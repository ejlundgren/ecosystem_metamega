AB  - Haemonchus contortus is a parasitic nematode that causes significant economic losses in ruminant livestock worldwide. In this study, we assessed the global genetic diversity and population structure of H. contortus using mitochondrial COX1 and ribosomal ITS2 sequences retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. In total, 324 haplotypes of the COX1 and 72 haplotypes of the ITS2 were identified. The haplotype diversity values were all higher than 0.5, and the nucleotide diversity values were higher than 0.005. The Tajima's D value for COX1 (-1.65634) was higher than that for ITS2 (-2.60400). Fu's Fs, Fu and Li's D (FLD), and Fu and Li's F (FLF) values also showed high negative values, indicating a high probability of future population growth. In addition, the high fixation index (FST) value suggests significant genetic differentiation among populations. The haplotype networks of H. contortus populations based on COX1 sequences revealed clear geographic clustering, whereas ITS2 sequences showed more haplotype admixture across regions. The results of phylogenetic analyses were consistent with the haplotype networks. These findings highlighted that H. contortus populations exhibit significant genetic variation and are undergoing rapid population expansion, with clear genetic differences across geographic regions. This study established critical baseline data for future molecular epidemiology studies, which could guide region-specific parasite surveillance and targeted control strategies, thus helping to mitigate the risk of cross-border parasite transmission and drug resistance.

AB  - Epilepsy is a severe neuropsychological disease accompanied by the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and associated behavioral disorders that are difficult to treat. In recent years, the neuroprotective properties of agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR alpha, beta/delta, gamma), nuclear transcription factors involved in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, have been actively investigated. The neuroprotective properties of PPAR gamma agonists have been repeatedly described in models of epilepsy; the effects of PPAR beta/delta agonists in these models have not been sufficiently investigated. The aim of this work was to study the effects of administering the PPAR beta/delta agonist cardarin (GW501516) on the formation of histopathological and behavioral abnormalities in the lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The lithium-pilocarpine model is one of the best experimental models of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. In this study, epilepsy was induced by administration of pilocarpine to male Wistar rats at the age of 7 weeks, one day after LiCl injection. Cardarin (2.5 mg/kg) was administered daily for 7 days after pilocarpine, with the first injection one day after pilocarpine injection. Behavioral testing was performed 2-3 months after induction of the model in the following tests: Open Field Test, Social Interaction, Novel Objects Exploration, Y-Maze Spontaneous Alternation and Morris Water Maze. Brain sampling for histological studies (assessment of neuronal death, Nissl staining) was performed after the end of behavioral testing, 95 days after TLE induction. It was shown that untreated rats with TLE exhibited significant hippocampal neuron death and behavioral impairment: increased motor activity, anxiety, memory disorders, research and communicative behavior. Cardarin did not affect the survival rate of hippocampal neurons, but reduced the manifestation of almost all the above-mentioned behavioral disorders, except for hyperactivity. Thus, this study demonstrated the promising use of PPAR beta/delta agonists to attenuate the development of behavioral disorders characteristic of epilepsy.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) may influence the brain's response to pain signals, indicating a role beyond motivation and reward. The study delved into how the D1-like dopamine receptors (D1Rs) and mu-opioid receptors (MOR) interact in the NAc region in the context of formalin-induced pain. Rats received intra-accumbal various doses of morphine as an MOR agonist (5, 10, 25, and 50 mmol/0.5 mu l) and different doses of SKF38393 as a selective D1Rs agonist (1.5, 3, 6, and 12 mmol/0.5 mu l) in separate experimental groups, respectively. In the second stage, animals received different doses of SCH23390 as a selective D1Rs antagonist (1.5, 3, 6, and 12 mmol) before an effective dose of SKF38393 (6 mmol) and morphine (10 mmol). The rats were then given naloxone as an MOR antagonist (1.5, 5, and 15 mmol) before being given an effective dose of SKF38393 (6 mmol). In the formalin test, 50 mu l formalin (2.5 %) was subcutaneously injected into the rat's hind paw to induce pain behavioral responses. The main findings indicated that the opioidergic and dopaminergic systems in the NAc region interact to create analgesic effects. The injection of morphine and SKF38393 into the NAc resulted in pain-relieving impacts. However, SCH23390 decreased the antinociceptive impacts of SKF38393 and morphine. Similarly, naloxone reduced the analgesic effects of SKF38393. The interactions between D1Rs and MOR can lead to synergistic effects. Therefore, using D1Rs agonists along with morphine can enhance the antinociceptive effect of morphine while reducing its side effects.

AB  - Background SMYD3 is a histone methyltransferase known for its dual role in modifying both histone and non-histone proteins. Despite its established involvement in somatic cell function and oncogenesis, its role in mammalian oogenesis and early embryonic development remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the function of SMYD3 in regulating oocyte meiotic progression and developmental competence using sheep as a mono-ovulatory model.Results Utilizing a 3D follicle-enclosed in vitro maturation (FEO-IVM) system, the study examined the impact of SMYD3 inhibition on oocyte maturation within Early Antral follicles In the absence of human chorionic gonadotropin oocytes remained arrested at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage. Interestingly, treatment with a SMYD3 inhibitor (iSMYD3) alone prompted germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) in 67% of oocytes; however, progression to the metaphase II (MII) stage was achieved only when iSMYD3 was combined with hCG, resulting in a 73% maturation rate. Despite this, MII oocytes from the iSMYD3 group exhibited compromised developmental competence, as evidenced by the failure of parthenogenetic embryos to progress beyond the 8-cell stage, contrasting with a 29% success rate in the hCG-only group. At the molecular level, SMYD3 inhibition led to sustained activation of CDC25A within oocytes, facilitating GVBD but impeding the MI-MII transition due to the absence of CDC25A degradation. Moreover, iSMYD3 failed to activate the MAPK1/3 and PDE5A pathways in the somatic compartment, unlike hCG treatment, indicating distinct signaling mechanisms. Additionally, hCG rapidly downregulated SMYD3 expression in follicular walls and cumulus cells, a process independent of meiotic progression but essential for metabolic decoupling between oocytes and cumulus cells. SMYD3 inhibition disrupted this decoupling by preventing hCG-induced gap junction closure, thereby maintaining prolonged intercellular communication.Conclusion SMYD3 is identified as a key modulator of oocyte maturation, orchestrating meiotic progression through CDC25A regulation and interacting with hCG-driven somatic signaling. These findings highlight SMYD3 as a critical determinant of late oogenesis and a potential target for enhancing oocyte competence in assisted reproductive technologies

AB  - Sheng-ma is recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica and mainly originates from the rhizomes of Cimicifuga dahurica (Turcz.) Maxim. (CD), Cimicifuga heracleifolia Kom. and Cimicifuga foetida L. The alcoholic extract of Cimicifuga foetida L. (Brand name: Ximingting (R)) has been approved for the treatment of perimenopausal symptoms accompanying hot flash, depression and anxiety in China. However, there's no further study about the antidepressant-like effects of C. dahurica (CD). The aim of this study is to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of CD extracted by 75% ethanol and its possible mechanisms.The neuro-protective effects of CD on injured PC12 cells induced by corticosterone was measured firstly. Then, forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), reserpine-induced hypothermia, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) induced head twitch response in mice and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on sucrose preference tests were executed. Moreover, the potential mechanisms were explored by measuring levels of monoamine neurotransmitter in mice frontal cortex and hippocampus, testing monoamine oxidase enzyme A (MAO-A) activities in the brains of CUMSexposed mice. Results showed that CD (60, 120 mg/kg) can significantly decreased the immobility period in FST and TST in mice without affecting locomotor activity. CD (30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg) could significantly counteracted reserpine-induced hypothermia and increased the number of head-twitches in 5-HTP induced head twitch response. It was also found that the monoamine neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were significantly increased in 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg CD treated mice. In addition, CD (60 and 120 mg/kg) significantly inhibited MAO-A after 6-week CUMS exposure. CD can effectively produce an antidepressant-like effect, which involved with modulation of monoamine regulatory pathways.

AB  - Two sulfuric acid speleogenesis (SAS) cave sites in northern Wyoming host speleogenetic byproducts that have been dated using the uranium-series method and thus provide the timing of the SAS events. Gypsum crusts that formed as byproducts of SAS in Lower Kane Cave, exposed by Bighorn River incision into the Little Sheep Mountain anticline, yield uranium-series dates of 20.5 +/- 0.2 ka to 16.2 +/- 0.2 ka that represent the timing of late stage speleogenesis of that cave. A calcite mammillary engulfed by elemental sulfur that formed during SAS of Shoshone Canyon Conduit Cave, exposed by Shoshone River incision of the homonymous canyon, yielded a uranium-series age of 174 +/- 5 ka and represents late stage speleogenesis of that cave, although the process continued after the cave was elevated above the water table until at least 100 +/- 5 ka. In addition to the timing of speleogenesis, the U-series results provide incision rates for these two canyons. The rate of canyon incision for the last 200 kyr by the Bighorn River in Little Sheep Mountain Canyon is measured as 190 +/- 50 m/Ma, and for the Shoshone River in Shoshone Canyon as 400 +/- 40 m/Ma. Using the Bighorn River incision rate, Upper Kane Cave located 33 m above Lower Kane Cave has a projected age of 170 +/- 60 ka. We suggest that climatically driven hydrologic mechanisms rather than magmatic ones likely produced the pulses of SAS at these two cave sites.

AB  - Thickness reduction or loss of the calcareous eggshell is one of major phenotypic changes in the transition from oviparity to viviparity. Whether the reduction of eggshells in viviparous squamates is associated with specific gene losses is unknown. Taking advantage of a newly generated high-quality genome of the viviparous Chinese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus), we found that ovocleidin-17 gene (OC-17), which encodes an eggshell matrix protein that is essential for calcium deposition in eggshells, is not intact in the crocodile lizard genome. Only OC-17 transcript fragments were found in the oviduct transcriptome, and no OC-17 peptides were identified in the eggshell proteome of crocodile lizards. In contrast, OC-17 was present in the eggshells of the oviparous Mongolia racerunner (Eremias argus). Although the loss of OC-17 is not common in viviparous species, viviparous squamates show fewer intact eggshell-specific proteins than oviparous squamates.

AB  - The storage and spreading of cattle slurry are significant contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia (NH3) emissions in agriculture, driven by the decomposition of organic matter and volatilization of nitrogen compounds. This study evaluates the impact of hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide (HK) and its combination with calcium chloride (CaCl2) (HKC) on mitigating GHG and NH3 emissions during the manure management chain. Storage trials were conducted at multiple scales (660 L and 20 kg), alongside field trials assessing the effect of treated slurries on emissions during land spreading. Emissions of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and NH3 were monitored over both the storage and land spreading trials. Results demonstrated that HK and HKC treatments inhibited CH4 (HK - 651.41 g m(-2); HKC - 621.44 g m(-2); Control - 768.74 g m(-2)) and N2O (HK - 2.88 g m(-2); HKC - 1.01 g m(-2); Control - 7.43 g m(-2)) production compared to control during storage but increased CO2 (HK - 5140.83 g m(-2); HKC - 5609.22 g m(-2); Control - 2474.27 g m(-2)) emissions due to foaming and agitation effects. NH3 emissions were significantly influenced by the treatments, with HK (168.91 g m(-2)) increasing emissions by 111 % and HKC (102.71 g m(-2)) by 28 %, relative to the control (80.03 g m(-2)). Application of a CaCl2 spray reduced NH3 emissions by 49 % in the first 48 h of treatment through surface pH modulation, though this effect was transient. Temperature significantly influenced CH4 emissions; emissions under high-temperature (HT; 19 degrees C) (0.085 kg CH4 kg(-1) VS Day(-1)) conditions were six times higher than under low-temperature (LT; 9 degrees C) (0.013 kg CH4 kg(-1) VS Day(-1)) conditions. CH4 inhibition was more effective at LT (86 % reduction, p < 0.05), highlighting the temperature sensitivity of methanogenic communities. However, no significant differences in cumulative GHG or NH3 emissions were observed between treatments and controls during land spreading. When storage and spreading results were combined, treatments showed no significant cumulative reduction in GHG emissions compared to controls, highlighting the need for optimization of treatment protocols. The results indicate that the oxidative treatments (HK & HKC) can suppress methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during storage, offering a potential strategy for reducing emissions from livestock waste. Furthermore, the application of CaCl2 as a surface treatment reduced ammonia volatilization, improving nitrogen retention in slurry, which can enhance its fertilization potential. These findings suggest that oxidative treatments and CaCl2 spray have potential for reducing emissions during manure storage, particularly under cooler conditions typical of Irish winters. However, the efficacy of these treatments under warmer conditions may require adjustments in application frequency and concentration. Future research should focus on optimizing treatment protocols and assessing the agronomic benefits of treated slurries.

AB  - Background Mitochondrial function involves the interplay between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Such mitonuclear interactions can be disrupted by the introgression of mitochondrial DNA between taxa or divergent populations. Previous studies of several model systems (e.g. Drosophila) indicate that the disruption of mitonuclear interactions, termed mitonuclear mismatch, can alter nuclear gene expression, yet few studies have focused on natural populations. Results Here we study a naturally introgressed population in the secondary contact zone of two subspecies of the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis), in which individuals possess either mitonuclear matched or mismatched genotypes. We generated transcriptome data for six tissue types from five mitonuclear matched and five mismatched individuals. Our results revealed strong tissue-specific effects of mitonuclear mismatch on nuclear gene expression with the largest effect seen in pectoral muscle. Moreover, consistent with the hypothesis that genes associated with the response to oxidative stress may be upregulated in mitonuclear mismatched individuals, we identified several such gene candidates, including DNASE1L3, GPx3 and HSPB6 in muscle, and ISG15 and IFI6 in heart. Conclusion Our study reveals how mitonuclear mismatch arising from introgression in natural populations is likely to have fitness consequences. Underlying the processes that maintain mitonuclear discordance is a step forward to understand the role of mitonuclear interactions in population divergence and speciation.

AB  - Previous work has demonstrated the importance of the prelimbic cortex (PL) in contextual control of operant behavior. However, the associated neural circuitry responsible for providing contextual information to the PL is not well understood. In Pavlovian fear conditioning the ventral hippocampus (vH) and its projection to the PL have been shown to be important in supporting the effects of context on learning. The present experiments used chemogenetic inhibition of the direct vH-PL projection or the vH to determine involvement in expression of context-specific operant behavior. Rats were injected with an inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di) or mCherry-only into the vH, and subsequently trained to perform a lever press response for a food pellet in a distinct context. The DREADD ligand clozapine-n-oxide (CNO) was then delivered directly into the PL (experiment 1) and then systemically (experiment 2) prior to tests of the response in the training context as well as an equally familiar but untrained context. vH (systemic CNO) but not vH-PL (intra-PL CNO) inhibition was found to attenuate operant responding in its acquisition context. A third experiment, using the same rats, showed that chemogenetic inhibition of vH also reduced Pavlovian contextual fear. The present results suggest that multisynapatic connections between the vH and PL may be responsible for integration of contextual information with operant behavior.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complicated, heterogeneous disorder characterized by social interaction deficits and repetitive stereotypical behaviors. Neuroinflammation and synaptic protein dysregulation have been implicated in ASD pathogenesis. Icariin (ICA) has proven to exert neuroprotective function through anti-inflammatory function. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the effects of ICA treatment on autism-like behavioral deficits in BTBR mice and whether these changes were related to modifications in the hippocampal inflammation and the balance of excitatory/inhibitory synapses. ICA supplementation (80 mg/kg, once daily for ten days, i.g.) ameliorated social deficits, repetitive stereotypical behaviors, and short-term memory deficit without affecting locomotor activity or anxiety-like behaviors of BTBR mice. Furthermore, ICA treatment inhibited neuroinflammation via decreasing microglia number and the soma size in the CA1 region of the hip-pocampus, as well as the protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of BTBR mice. In addition, ICA treatment also rescued excitatory-inhibitory synaptic protein imbalance by inhibiting the increased vGlut1 level without affecting the vGAT level in the BTBR mouse hippocampus. Collectively, the observed results indicate that ICA treatment alleviates ASD-like features, mitigates disturbed balance of excitatory-inhibitory synaptic protein, and inhibits hippocampal inflammation in BTBR mice, and may represent a novel promising drug for ASD treatment.

AB  - The qualitative assessment of groundwater and health risk is an integral step in sustainable development of the region. The present study mainly focuses on the assessment of human health risk in the Shahada tehsil of Nandurbar District, North Maharashtra, India due to the nitrate and fluoride contamination in subsurface water resources due to the anthropogenic inputs. In view of this, forty-five (45) representative water samples were collected in month of March 2019 and were assessed for major physiochemical parameters using guidelines of APHA standard procedures. The analytical results were compared with the drinking standards of World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian (BIS). The analytical results depict that EC, TDS, TH, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl-, NO3- and F- surpassed the desirable limit (DL) and permissible limit (PL). The statistical analysis includes Correlation Analysis (CA) and Principal component Analysis (PCA) has been used to ascertain the significant association among water quality parameters. Further, the degree of contamination and domestic suitability of water were evaluated by computing Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG), Groundwater Quality Index (GWQI) and Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) mainly for nitrate and fluoride contamination. PIG results inferred that 6.66% samples have moderate, 73% insignificant pollution and 20% low pollution. GWQI results revealed that 14% samples (poor class), 62% samples (very poor class) and only 6.6% samples (unsuitable). Total Hazard Index (THI) of fluoride and nitrate indicates that about 51% of the infants, 84% of the children, 69% of the teenagers and 60% of the adults are at non -carcinogenic risk, as THI values of more than 1 were observed to be vulnerable to non -carcinogenic health hazard. The outcomes of the study may assist the government authorities and research scholars as well as the local communities to develop comprehensive strategies in the study area to overcome the health risk problems due to fluoride and nitrate contamination.

AB  - Background: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) regulates glycolipid metabolism and insulin homeostasis and acts as a cardioprotective factor by protecting against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, hypertension, and vascular dysfunction. FGF21 has been reported to prevent Doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiotoxicity, and the related signaling pathway is worthy of further study. Connexin43 (Cx43) protein was reduced by Dox treatment, especially low phosphorylated form of Cx43. Thus the aim of study is to explore the protection effect of FGF21 on Dox induced cardiotoxicity by improving the expression of Cx43 and the involved signaling pathway. Methods and results: FGF21 inhibited apoptosis in Dox-treated mice and cardiomyocytes. FGF21 increased the levels of connexin43 phosphorylated at serine (S) 282 (p-Cx43 S282) and total Cx43 to inhibit Dox-induced apoptosis. By RNA sequencing, we found that deubiquitinase monocyte chemoattractant protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) expression was increased by FGF21. We further found that FGF21 induced the phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2), and Elk. Phosphorylated Elk translocated to the nucleus and increased the expression of MCPIP1. Then, MCPIP1 bound neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4 (Nedd4), an E3 ubiquitination ligase, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and suppressed Cx43 ubiquitination and degradation, competitively inhibiting the binding of Cx43 with Nedd4. Thus Nedd4 could not bind and ubiquitinate Cx43, leading to the up-regulation of Cx43 and phosphorylation of Cx43 at S282. Conclusions: FGF21 inhibited the effects of Dox on cardiomyocytes by elevating the phosphorylation of Cx43 at S282 and total Cx43 expression. This study suggests a previously unknown mechanism for the FGF21-mediated enhancement of cardiomyocyte survival and provides an effective approach to protect against the adverse cardiac effects of Dox.

AB  - Simple Summary Kasedbok (Neptunia javanica Miq.) is a fodder tree legume that grows successfully in a range of tropical and subtropical regions. Kasedbok could be used as a protein source in beef cattle's concentrate diet, which would lower the cost of feeding. We evaluated the effect of the Kasedbok levels in the diets on feed intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and the microbial population in beef cattle. The findings indicated that using up to 240 g/kg Kasedbok in concentrate diets does not affect feed utilization, rumen characteristics, or microbial population, lowering feed costs. This experiment was conducted to determine the influence of Kasedbok (Neptunia javanica Miq.) on the feed utilization, rumen fermentation, and microbial population in Thai Native beef cattle. Four animals with a mean body weight of 295 +/- 15 kg were randomly arranged in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. There were four treatments, utilizing 0, 80, 160, and 240 g/kg Kasedbok in concentrate. Local feed resources, including cassava chips, rice bran, palm kernel meal, and soybean meal, were utilized to formulate the concentrate diets, which contained between 11.8 and 12.0% crude protein (CP). The trial was conducted for four periods of three weeks each. The first two weeks consisted of an adaptation period, while the final week was a sampling period. The findings of the current study reveal that feed intake, dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) digestibility were similar between treatments. In addition, there was no effect of Kasedbok levels on rumen pH, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration, or volatile fatty acid. However, increasing the inclusion level of Kasedbok linearly decreased CP digestibility and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration (p = 0.04). In contrast, the population of fungal zoospores improved significantly (p = 0.03), while the bacterial and protozoal counts remained unchanged (p > 0.05). Furthermore, when the level of Kasedbok was increased from 0 to 80, 160, and 240 g/kg DM, the cost of concentrate decreased by 4.1, 7.8, and 10.6 USD/100 kg DM, respectively. The results of this experiment suggest that utilizing 240 g/kg of Kasedbok in a concentrated mixture will not affect feed utilization, rumen fermentation, improve microbial population, and reduce feed cost in Thai native beef cattle.

AB  - In environments with strong seasonality, many herbivorous zooplankton remain active only during the productive season and undergo a period of inactivity and suppressed development termed 'diapause' during the unproductive season. The ability to time the diapause entry and exit in response to the seasonality of the environment is thus essential for their survival. However, timing of diapause may become challenging when environmental conditions vary stochastically across shorter and longer timescales, and particularly when zooplankton lack external cues to predict these variations. In this study, we used a novel individual-based model to study the emerging patterns of diapause timing of the high-latitude marine herbivorous copepod Calanus finmarchicus under shorter- (6-h) and longer-term (interannual) environmental stochasticity. The model simulated growth, development, survival and reproduction (income breeding) of a C. finmarchicus population over multiple calendar years and traced the emergence of behavioral responses and life history strategies. The emergent timing of diapause entry and exit were robust to shorter-term environmental stochasticity, which was manifested through morphological (i.e., body and energy reserve sizes) and behavioral plasticity (i.e., diel vertical migration). Longer-term stochastic variations of temperature and food environments altered the timing of diapause entry, which occurred earlier in warmer years with higher growth potential and vice versa. Irrespective of the modelled environmental variability, diapause exit occurred asynchronously throughout the year. This appeared to be a consequence of a diversified bet hedging strategy, where parents spread the starvation mortality risk of ascending to the upper pelagial at food-deprived times of the year among their offspring. This was a potent strategy, particularly in simulations where the timing of the algal bloom varied stochastically between years, since a fraction of the population was present in the upper pelagial year-round and those that coincided with the emergence of the pelagic primary production survived and produced the next generation.

AB  - In brief Melatonin plays a crucial role in enhancing reproductive performance in small ruminants. This paper reveals the effects of exogenous melatonin on the placental and endometrial rearrangement in early pregnancy in sheep. Abstract Early pregnancy losses cause 25% of pregnancy failures in small ruminants because of asynchrony between conceptus and uterine signals. In this context, melatonin plays a crucial role in sheep reproductive dynamics, but little is known about its effects during the peri-implantation period. We hypothesized that melatonin supports embryo implantation by modulating the uterine microenvironment. This study aimed to assess the effects of exogenous melatonin on the endometrial and early placental rearrangement. Ten multiparous ewes either did (MEL, n = 5) or did not (CTR, n = 5) receive a subcutaneous melatonin implant (18 mg) 50 days before a synchronized mating. On day 21 of pregnancy, the sheep were euthanized. MEL ewes exhibited a higher prolificity rate (2.8 vs 2.0 embryos/ewe) and plasma progesterone levels (3.84 vs 2.96 ng/mL, P < 0.05) than did CTR ewes. Groups did not differ significantly in embryo crown-rump length. MEL placentas had significantly (P < 0.001) more binucleated trophoblast cells in the chorion region, and ovine placental lactogen expression was significantly (P < 0.05) more strongly upregulated than in CTR. Exogenous melatonin increased significantly (P < 0.05) gene expression of angiogenic factors (VEGFA, VEGFR1, IGF1R), IFNAR2, and PR in the caruncular endometrium. Expression of the MT2 receptor in the endometrium and placenta was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the MEL group. These results indicate that melatonin implants acted differentially on uterine and placental rearrangement. Melatonin increases differentiation in the placenta and induces changes that could promote vessel maturation in the endometrium, suggesting that it enhances the uterine microenvironment in the early stage of pregnancy in sheep.

AB  - Background Laurasiatheria contains taxa with diverse diets, while the molecular basis and evolutionary history underlying their dietary diversification are less clear. Results In this study, we used the recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the adaptive evolution of digestive system-related genes across both carnivorous and herbivorous mammals within Laurasiatheria. Our results show an intensified selection of fat and/or protein utilization across all examined carnivorous lineages, which is consistent with their high-protein and high-fat diets. Intriguingly, for herbivorous lineages (ungulates), which have a high-carbohydrate diet, they show a similar selection pattern as that of carnivorous lineages. Our results suggest that for the ungulates, which have a specialized digestive system, the selection intensity of their digestive system-related genes does not necessarily reflect loads of the nutrient components in their diets but appears to be positively related to the loads of the nutrient components that are capable of being directly utilized by the herbivores themselves. Based on these findings, we reconstructed the dietary evolution within Laurasiatheria, and our results reveal the dominant carnivory during the early diversification of Laurasiatheria. In particular, our results suggest that the ancestral bats and the common ancestor of ruminants and cetaceans may be carnivorous as well. We also found evidence of the convergent evolution of one fat utilization-related gene, APOB, across carnivorous taxa. Conclusions Our molecular phyloecological results suggest that digestive system-related genes can be used to determine the molecular basis of diet differentiations and to reconstruct ancestral diets.

AB  - The sense of taste plays a crucial role in herbivorous insects by discriminating nutrients from complex plant metabolic compounds. The peripheral coding of taste has been thoroughly studied in many insect species, but the central gustatory pathways are poorly described. In the present study, we characterized single neurons in the gnathal ganglion of Helicoverpa armigera larvae using the intracellular recording/staining technique. We identified different types of neurons, including sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. The morphologies of these neurons were largely diverse and their arborizations seemingly covered the whole gnathal ganglion. The representation of the single neurons responding to the relevant stimuli of sweet and bitter cues showed no distinct patterns in the gnathal ganglion. We postulate that taste signals may be processed in a manner consistent with the principle of population coding in the gnathal ganglion of H. armigera larvae.

AB  - Exogenous application of the plant hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can trigger induced plant defenses against herbivores, and has been shown to provide protection against insect herbivory in conifer seedlings. Other methods, such as mechanical damage to seedlings, can also induce plant defenses, yet few have been compared to MeJA and most studies lack subsequent herbivory feeding tests. We conducted two lab experiments to: (1) compare the efficacy of MeJA to mechanical damage treatments that could also induce seedling resistance, (2) examine if subsequent insect damage differs depending on the time since induction treatments occurred, and (3) assess if these induction methods affect plant growth. We compared Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings sprayed with MeJA (10 or 15 mM) to seedlings subjected to four different mechanical bark damage treatments (two different bark wound sizes, needle-piercing damage, root damage) and previous pine weevil (Hylobius abietis) damage as a reference treatment. The seedlings were exposed to pine weevils 12 or 32 days after treatments (early and late exposure, hereafter), and resistance was measured as the amount of damage received by plants. At early exposure, seedlings treated with needle-piercing damage received significantly more subsequent pine weevil feeding damage than those treated with MeJA. Seedlings treated with MeJA and needle-piercing damage received 84% less and 250% more pine weevil feeding, respectively, relative to control seedlings. The other treatments did not differ statistically from control or MeJA in terms of subsequent pine weevil damage. For the late exposure group, plants in all induction treatments tended to receive less pine weevil feeding (yet this was not statistically significant) compared to control seedlings. On the other hand, MeJA significantly slowed down seedling growth relative to control and all other induction treatments. Overall, the mechanical damage treatments appeared to have no or variable effects on seedling resistance. One of the treatments, needle-piercing damage, actually increased pine weevil feeding at early exposure. These results therefore suggest that mechanical damage shows little potential as a plant protection measure to reduce feeding by a bark-chewing insect.

AB  - Closely related species that use similar resources often differ in their seasonal patterns of activity, but the factors that limit their distributions across seasons are unknown for most species. One hypothesis to explain seasonal variation in the distributions of species involves a trade-off between competitive ability and cold tolerance, where tolerance to the cold compromises competitive ability in warmer (benign) temperatures, either at the level of the individual or population. We tested both individual-level and population-level mechanisms of this hypothesis in two co-occurring species of temperate burying beetles (Silphidae: Nicrophorus sayi, N. orbicollis) that differ in their seasonal patterns of activity. We measured cold tolerance, breeding activity as a function of temperature, and competitive ability as a function of temperature and season. Consistent with our hypothesis, the mid-season N. orbicollis was less able to function at the cold temperatures that characterise early spring, when the early-season N. sayi is most active. The larger beetle, however, always won one-on-one competitive trials at warm temperatures, regardless of species, inconsistent with an individual-level trade-off. N. orbicollis was usually larger and successful when competing for the same carrion later in the season, mostly because of its larger population size, consistent with a trade-off between competitive ability, and cold tolerance acting at the population level. Our findings suggest that cold temperatures limit the mid-season N. orbicollis from earlier spring emergence, while competitive pressure from the more abundant, larger N. orbicollis constrains the early-season N. sayi from remaining active through the summer.

AB  - To investigate the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa) in carnitine status and intestinal fatty acid oxidation in neonates, a total of 72 suckled newborn piglets were assigned into 8 dietary treatments following a 2 (+/- 0.35% clofibrate) x 4 (diets with: succinate+glycerol (Succ), tri-valerate (TC5), tri-hexanoate (TC6), or tri-2-methylpentanoate (TMPA)) factorial design. All pigs received experimental milk diets with isocaloric energy for 5 days. Carnitine statuses were evaluated, and fatty acid oxidation was measured in vitro using [1-C-14]-palmitic acid (1 mM) as a substrate in absence or presence of L659699 (1.6 mu M), iodoacetamide (50 mu M), and carnitine (1 mM). Clofibrate increased concentrations of free (41%) and/or acyl-carnitine (44% and 15%) in liver and plasma but had no effects in the intestine. The effects on carnitine status were associated with the expression of genes involved in carnitine biosynthesis, absorption, and transportation. TC5 and TMPA stimulated the increased fatty acid oxidation rate induced by clofibrate, while TC6 had no effect on the increased fatty acid oxidation induced by clofibrate (p > 0.05). These results suggest that dietary clofibrate improved carnitine status and increased fatty acid oxidation. Propionyl-CoA, generated from TC5 and TMPA, could stimulate the increased fatty acid oxidation rate induced by clofibrate as anaplerotic carbon sources.

AB  - We, (1) studied carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) in the environment, humans, and animals, within the same geographical area and, (2) delineated the isolates' resistome, mobilome, virulome, and phylogeny. Following ethical approval, 587 samples (humans = 230, pigs = 345, andwater = 12) were collected and cultured on CRE selective media. Confirmatory identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed using the VITEK 2 automated platform. The resistomes, virulomes, mobilomes, and phylogenies were ascertained by whole genome sequencing. Nineteen (3.2%), i.e., 15/19 humans and 4/19 environmental, but no pig, CRE were obtained. CREs included Klebsiella pneumoniae 9/19 (47%), Enterobacter hormaechei 6/19 (32%), Klebsiella quasipneumoniae 2/19 (11%), a novel ST498 Citrobacter freundii 1/19 (5%) and Serratia marcescens 1/19 (5%). Eleven isolates were extensively drug-resistant; eight were multidrug-resistant. Sixteen CRE harbored the bla(OXA-181), bla(OXA-48), bla(OXA-484), bla(NDM-1), and bla(GES-5) genes. Multiple species/clones carried bla(OXA-48) and blaNDM- 1 carbapenemase-encoding genes with respective mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The IncFIB (K) plasmid replicon was found in most human K. pneumoniae strains (7/ 9) and all environmental K. quasipneumoniae isolates; most K. pneumoniae produced OXA-181 (5/9). The (Col440I) plasmid replicon, identified in 11 (26.82%) isolates, mainly E. hormaechei (n = 6), predominated both sectors. Most beta-lactamase-encoding genes were associatedwith class 1 integrons IntI1, insertion sequences (IS) (IS91, IS5075, IS30, IS3000, IS3, IS19, ISKpn19, IS5075) and transposons (Tn3). The IncL/M(pMU407) and IncL/M(pOXA48) plasmid replicons were found exclusively in K. pneumoniae; all but one of these strains produced OXA-181. Also, the Klebsiella spp. harbored 80 virulence genes. Phylogenomic clustered identified isolates with other carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, E. hormaechei, S. marcescens, and C. freundii from different South African sources (animals, environment, and humans). We delineated the resistome, mobilome, virulome, and phylogeny of carbapenemaseproducing Enterobacterales in humans and environment, highlighting antibiotic resistance genes propagation via MGEs across sectors, emphasizing a One Health approach to AMR.

AB  - Recently, increasing attention has been focused on developing new products based on goat's milk. Consumers positively perceive fermented goat's milk products as health-promoting due to their nutritional value, digestibility, and potential source of probiotics. This study aimed to evaluate the possibility of using different doses of collagen and collagen hydrolysate in the production of probiotic goat's milk fermented by four monocultures: Lacticaseibacillus casei 431((R)) Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5((R)), Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LP26, and Lacticaseibicillus rhamnosus Lr- 32((R)). A total of 20 experimental groups were prepared, including control groups (without additives), and due to the added probiotic (Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus), various collagen doses (1.5% and 3.0%) and collagen types (hydrolysate and bovine collagen). Physicochemical, organoleptic, and microbiological characteristics were evaluated after 1 and 21 days of cold storage. The applied additives increased the acidity of the milk even before fermentation. However, milk with bovine collagen and hydrolysate had a higher pH value after fermentation than control milk. The study showed higher than 8 log cfu g(-1) viability of probiotic bacteria in goat's milk products during storage due to the proper pH, high buffering capacity, and rich nutrient content of goat's milk. The best survival rate was shown for the L. casei strain after 21 days in milk with collagen protein hydrolysate. Moreover, collagen in milk fermented by L. rhamnosus decreased syneresis compared to its control counterpart. The addition of collagen, especially the hydrolysate, increased the gel hardness of the fermented milk. The collagen additives used in the milk, both in the form of hydrolysate and bovine collagen, caused a darkening of the color of the milk and increased the intensity of the milky-creamy and sweet taste.

AB  - The dangerous insect pest known as rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis exigua (Butler), which reduces rice output globally, twists and feeds on the young rice plant's leaves. Protein elicitors are hypothesized to be biological components that promote rice in becoming herbivore resistant. The evolving elicitor protein PeBL2, obtained from Brevibacillus laterosporus A60, was tested for biocontrol against C. exigua. Four distinct PeBL2 doses (74.23, 45.53, 22.26, and 11.13 mu g mL(-1)) were assigned to evaluate the impact of PeBL2 on immature growth, survivability, and lifespan. Adult reproductive efficiency and the interaction between the pest and the disease were assessed against C. exigua. Further, the assessment of active compounds in PeBL2 with multi-acting entomopathogenic effects investigated the direct correlations of PeBL2 with temperature and climatic change in plants of rice (Oryza sativa L.). When compared to controls, PeBL2 treatments reduced the growing population of second- and third-generation C. exigua. Cnaphalocrocis exigua colonized control plants faster than PeBL2-treated O. sativa plants in a host selection test. PeBL2 doses delayed the development of the larval stage of C. exigua. PeBL2-treated seedlings generated less offspring than control seedlings, identical to fecundity. Trichomes and wax formation on PeBL2-treated leaves generated an adverse environment for C. exigua. PeBL2 altered the surface topography of the leaves, preventing colonization and reducing C. exigua reproduction. PeBL2-treated O. sativa seedlings exhibited somewhat increased amounts of jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene (ET). Systemic defensive processes also included the activation of pathways (JA, SA, and ET). Following these results versus C. exigua, the use of PeBL2 in an agroecosystem with integrated pest management and biocontrol appears to be reasonable. These findings shed new light on a cutting-edge biocontrol technique based on B. laterosporus A60.

AB  - Estimating spatiotemporal patterns of population density is a primary objective of wildlife monitoring programs. However, estimating density is challenging for species that are elusive and/or occur in habitats with limited visibility. In such situations, indirect measures (e.g., nests, dung) can serve as proxies for counts of individuals. Scientists have developed approaches to estimate population density using these "indirect count" data, although current methods do not adequately account for variation in sign production and spatial patterns of animal density. In this study, we describe a modified hierarchical distance sampling model that maximizes the information content of indirect count data using Bayesian inference. We apply our model to assess the status of chimpanzee and elephant populations using counts of nests and dung, respectively, which were collected along transects in 2007 and 2021 in western Uganda. Compared with conventional methods, our modeling framework produced more precise estimates of covariate effects on expected animal density by accounting for both long-term and recent variations in animal abundance and enabled the estimation of the number of days that animal signs remained visible. We estimated a 0.98 probability that chimpanzee density in the region had declined by at least 10% and a 0.99 probability that elephant density had increased by 50% from 2007 to 2021. We recommend applying our modified hierarchical distance sampling model in the analysis of indirect count data to account for spatial variation in animal density, assess population change between survey periods, estimate the decay rate of animal signs, and obtain more precise density estimates than achievable with traditional methods.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of meteorology initialization on surface ozone prediction in the Great Lakes region using Canada's operational air quality model (GEM-MACH) at a 2.5 km horizontal resolution. Two different initialization techniques are compared, and it is found that the four-dimensional incremental analysis updating (IAU) method yields improved model performance for surface ozone prediction. The IAU run shows better ozone regression line statistics (y = 0.7x + 14.9, R-2 = 0.2) compared to the non-IAU run (y = 0.6x + 23.1, R-2 = 0.1), with improved MB and NMB values (3.9 ppb and 8.9%, respectively) compared to the non-IAU run (4.1 ppb and 9.3%). Furthermore, analyzing ozone prediction sensitivity to model initialization time reveals that the 18z initialization leads to enhanced performance, particularly during high ozone exceedance days, with an improved regression slope of 0.9 compared to 0.7 for the 00z and 12z runs. The MB also improves to -0.2 ppb in the 18z run compared to -2.8 ppb and -3.9 ppb for the 00z and 12z runs, respectively. The analysis of meteorological fields reveals that the improved ozone predictions at 18z are linked to a more accurate representation of afternoon wind speed. This improvement enhances the transport of ozone, contributing to the overall improvement in ozone predictions.

AB  - The aim of this study is to characterize the digestates from three plastic tubular digesters implemented in Colombia fed with: i) cattle manure; ii) cattle manure mixed with cheese whey; iii) pig manure. All the digesters worked under psychrophilic conditions. Physico-chemical characteristics, heavy metals, pathogens, and agronomic quality were investigated.
   All the digestates were characterized by physico-chemical characteristics and nutrients concentration suitable for their reuse as biofertilizer. However, these digestates may only partially replace a mineral fertilizer due to the high nutrients dilution. Heavy metals were under the detection limit of the analytical method (Pb, Hg, Ni, Mo, Cd, Chromium VI) or present at low concentration (Cu, Zn, As, Se) in all the digestates. Biodegradable organic matter and pathogens (coliform, helminths and Salmonella spp.) analysis proved that all the digestates should be post-treated before soil application in order to prevent environmental and health risks, and also to reduce residual phytotoxicity effects. The digestate from pig manure had a higher nutrient percentage (0.2, 0.6 and 0.05 % w/w of total N, P2O5 and K2O, respectively), but also higher residual phytotoxicity than the other digestates. Co digestion seemed not to significantly improve the digestate fertilizing potential. Finally, further studies should address how to improve fertilizing potential of digestates from plastic tubular digesters, avoiding environmental and health risks.

AB  - Identifying traits that are associated with success of introduced natural ene-mies in establishing and controlling pest insects has occupied researchers and biological control practitioners for decades. Unfortunately, consistent gen-eral relationships have been difficult to detect, preventing a priori ranking of candidate biological control agents based on their traits. We summarise previ-ous efforts and propose a series of potential explanations for the lack of clear patterns. We argue that the quality of current datasets is insufficient to detect complex trait-efficacy relationships and suggest several measures by which current limitations may be overcome. We conclude that efforts to address this elusive issue have not yet been exhausted and that further explorations are likely to be worthwhile.

AB  - Simple Summary This study provides new perspectives about the roles of lincRNAs in the estrus expression of gilts, which is correlated with ovarian steroid hormone and follicular development. Follicular tissues from two stages of the estrus cycle of Large White and Mi gilts were used for RNA-seq. Some genes and lincRNAs related to estrus expression in pigs were discovered. PPI and ceRNA networks related to the estrus expression were constructed. These results suggest that the estrus expression may be affected by lincRNAs and their target genes. Visible and long-lasting estrus expression of gilts and sows effectively sends a mating signal. To reveal the roles of Long Intergenic Non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) in estrus expression, RNA-seq was used to investigate the lincRNAs expression of follicular tissues from Large White gilts at diestrus (LD) and estrus (LE), and Chinese Mi gilts at diestrus (MD) and estrus (ME). Seventy-three differentially expressed lincRNAs (DELs) were found in all comparisons (LE vs. ME, LD vs. LE, and MD vs. ME comparisons). Eleven lincRNAs were differentially expressed in both LD vs. LE and MD vs. ME comparisons. Fifteen DELs were mapped onto the pig corpus luteum number Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) fragments. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that involved estrus expression using 20 DEGs was then constructed. Interestingly, three predicted target DEGs (PTGs) (CYP19A1 of MSTRG.10910, CDK1 of MSTRG.10910 and MSTRG.23984, SCARB1 of MSTRG.1559) were observed in the PPI network. A competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network including three lincRNAs, five miRNAs, and five genes was constructed. Our study provides new insight into the lincRNAs associated with estrus expression and follicular development in gilts.

AB  - In this study. multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified by magnesium (Mg@CNT) was prepared as a novel adsorbent to recover phosphate from wastewater. Mg@CNT with the mass ratio of 0.48 (Mg versus MWCNTs) was the most efficient for phosphate adsorption and the maximum experimental adsorption capacity was up to 198 mg Pig. The Mg@CNT characterization was done by Field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy detector (FESEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), surface area analyzer (BET), Transmission electron microscope coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy detector (TEM-EDS). The MgO nanoflakes spread on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and reacted with phosphate to generate Mg-3(PO4)(2)center dot 10H(2)O as the end product. Phosphate adsorption on Mg@CNT was chemisorption onto heterogeneous surface according to the kinetic model and isotherm model fitting results. Several common co-existing ions, e.g., Cl-, NO3- and humic acid, had no obvious negative impact on the phosphate adsorption capacity: while SO42- and CO32 expressed stronger negative impacts and led to 132% and 39.5% decrease in phosphate adsorption capacity, respectively. After five adsorption-desorption cycles, Mg@CNT still maintained more than 80% adsorption capacity of the initial and high phosphate desorbability. These results implied that Mg@CNT possessed great application potential in phosphate recovery. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is among the gravest threats to human health and food security worldwide. The use of antimicrobials in livestock production can lead to emergence of AMR, which can have direct effects on humans through spread of zoonotic disease. Pigs pose a particular risk as they are a source of zoonotic diseases and receive more antimicrobials than most other livestock. Here we use a large-scale genomic approach to characterise AMR in Streptococcus suis, a commensal found in most pigs, but which can also cause serious disease in both pigs and humans. Results We obtained replicated measures of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for 16 antibiotics, across a panel of 678 isolates, from the major pig-producing regions of the world. For several drugs, there was no natural separation into 'resistant' and 'susceptible', highlighting the need to treat MIC as a quantitative trait. We found differences in MICs between countries, consistent with their patterns of antimicrobial usage. AMR levels were high even for drugs not used to treat S. suis, with many multidrug-resistant isolates. Similar levels of resistance were found in pigs and humans from regions associated with zoonotic transmission. We next used whole genome sequences for each isolate to identify 43 candidate resistance determinants, 22 of which were novel in S. suis. The presence of these determinants explained most of the variation in MIC. But there were also interesting complications, including epistatic interactions, where known resistance alleles had no effect in some genetic backgrounds. Beta-lactam resistance involved many core genome variants of small effect, appearing in a characteristic order. Conclusions We present a large dataset allowing the analysis of the multiple contributing factors to AMR in S. suis. The high levels of AMR in S. suis that we observe are reflected by antibiotic usage patterns but our results confirm the potential for genomic data to aid in the fight against AMR.

AB  - Monitoring wildlife in geographical areas is essential for the conservation of the biological heritage. At present, the strenuous task of animal observation on-site has been mitigated with the use of camera traps. The information gathered by these devices comprises a sequence of images, which are triggered by motion or heat, and enables the monitoring of several geographical areas at the same time without perturbing the fauna. Notwithstanding the advances of these kind of monitoring approaches, the captured images still must be manually classified, becoming into an expensive process. This paper describes an automatic methodology for labeling images captured with camera traps as a support tool for animal behaviour analysis. Specifically, we focus on the analysis of the Ovis canadensis better known as desert bighorn sheep, a species that inhabits in northwestern Mexico, USA and Canada. The importance of this species lies in that it is an emblematic one, of great historical, cultural and social value. We adopted a methodology based on a residual neural network (ResNet) as feature extractor and standard models for the classification of images depicting species of interest. The method is built (trained) and evaluated on realistic images captured by camera traps in the field. We achieve classification performances ranging from 89% for a multiclass classification setting (7 classes associated to the animal of interest) to 99% in a binary classification scenario (presence vs. absence of the species). The collected data set, model and extracted features are publicly available under request. We foresee the released data set and the proposed solution will boost research on the analysis of this species.

AB  - Maternal exposure to inflammation may represent a major risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders with associated cognitive dysfunction in offspring in later life. Growing evidence has suggested that resveratrol exerts a beneficial effect on cognitive impairment via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and by ameliorating synaptic dysfunction. However, how resveratrol affects maternal immune activation-induced cognitive dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, pregnant dams were given an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50 mu g/kg) on gestational day 15. Subsequently, the offspring mice were treated or not with resveratrol (40 mg/kg) from postnatal day (PND) 60 to PND 88. Male offspring were selected for the evaluation of cognitive function using the Morris water maze test. The hippocampal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined by ELISA. The mRNA and protein levels of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and synaptophysin (SYP) were determined by RT-qPCR and western blot, respectively. The results showed that male offspring mice exposed to LPS in utero exhibited learning and memory impairment. Additionally, the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were increased while those of SIRT1, BDNF, PSD-95, and SYP were decreased in male offspring of LPS-treated mothers. Treatment with resveratrol reversed cognitive impairment and attenuated the increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by maternal immune activation in the offspring mice. Furthermore, resveratrol reversed the deleterious effects of maternal immune activation on SIRT1, BDNF, PSD-95, and SYP levels in the hippocampus. Collectively, our results suggested that resveratrol can effectively improve learning and memory impairment induced by maternal immune activation via the modulation of inflammation and synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - Aim: To identify some novel fatty acid hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors that may contribute to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: In-silico pharmacophore modelling including ligand-based pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular dynamics modelling, density functional theory and in-silico pharmacokinetics and toxicological studies were employed for the retrieving of novel FAAH inhibitors. Further, these compounds were evaluated for FAAH inhibitory activity using an in vitro enzymatic assay, and later, an in vivo streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD model was examined in mice. Results: Using an in-silico pharmacophore modelling process with molecular docking, molecular dynamic modelling, density functional theory and in-silico pharmacokinetics and toxicological analysis, three compounds (NCI1697, NCI1001and NCI1041) were retrieved. The in vitro FAAH activity assay kit (Fluorometric) was employed to examine the FAAH inhibitory activity of identified compounds. Further, in in-vivo studies, treatment with these compounds at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg doses orally for 10 days restored the STZ-induced memory deficits in mice, as evident in the radial arm and Morris's water maze assays. Also, these compounds ameliorated oxidative stress profiles and neuroinflammatory biomarkers in mice. Interestingly, STZ-induced disturbance in gene expressions related to AD pathophysiology including endocannabinoid signalling neuroinflammation and neuroimmune signalling were also restored after the treatment. Histopathological findings also confirmed the improvement in the organization of cells and reduction in vacuolation in mice hippocampal tissue in treated mice. Conclusion: The in-silico, in vitro and in-vivo findings collectively indicated that these compounds have impressive FAAH inhibitory activity and may be developed as therapeutic agents in the management of AD.

AB  - Morphological scaling describes changes in the size or shape of one morphological character (e.g. mass, length, width, area etc.) as another increases in size. Understanding how morphological characters scale with body size can shed light on how natural selection influences morphology, and the nature of ecomorphological relationships through ontogeny. Batoids (Elasmobranchii: Batoidea) are a highly specialised lineage of cartilaginous fishes displaying extreme dorsoventral flattening. Despite this, little is known about morphological scaling in batoids compared to sharks. In this study we test the relationship between disc width and total length in five batoid species (Torpedo torpedo, Mobula tarapacana, Fontitrygon margarita, Raja parva, Rhinobatos irvinei) representing four orders that differ in both ecology and morphology, measured from artisanal fisheries in Western and Central Ghana. Whilst a lack of existing ecological data presents some limitations, our results are broadly consistent with ecomorphological theory previously applied to sharks. Moreover, we find that for some lineages (including some myliobatiform taxa) total length may represent a valid proxy for estimating overall body size. This finding has applications for body size and shape estimation in partially processed batoids obtained from fishing camps, and extinct taxa known only from incomplete or fragmented remains.

TI  - Social Rank, Female Competition for Food, and Behavioral Time-Budgets in the Golden Snub-Nosed Monkey Rhinopithecus roxellana Multi-Level Society
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Competition within primate groups often translates to a social hierarchy, with high-rank individuals gaining privileged access to resources, especially food. Golden snub-nosed monkeys Rhinopithecus roxellana live in a multi-level society, with multiple one-male units (OMUs), each containing a single adult male and several females, forming a breeding-band. High-rank males have increased access to high-value foods and spend less time feeding and more time being groomed by females, potentially enhancing social cohesion within their OMUs. The adults of each OMU mainly feed and socialize together, with food competition predominantly acting at the OMU level. We thus predicted that adult females by association attain the rank and feeding privileges of their OMU leader males, and make similar time-budget trade-offs. By food-provisioning a wild breeding-band during winter and spring, when natural foods are abundant or limited, respectively, we found that females of high-rank OMUs ate more provisioned foods at higher rates, especially during winter when provisioned foods had increased value. In winter, females of low-rank OMUs fed for longer on natural foods and females of high-rank OMUs longer on provisioned foods. Females of high-rank OMUs spent longer being groomed by other OMU members, especially during winter. Our results are consistent with females attaining the feeding privileges of their OMU leader male, enhanced during winter due to increased value of provisioned foods, high thermal demands, and reduced natural food availability. Importantly, the feeding privileges attained by females of high rank OMUs were less pronounced than those previously found for leader males, possibly due to higher tolerance between females of different OMUs. We suggest that behavioral time-budget effects of food competition in female R. roxellana enhance cohesion in high-rank OMUs, contributing to OMU integrity and, hence, the social structure of this multi-level society.

AB  - Forty-eight litters were used, with a total number of 645 piglets involved in the study. The split-suckling technique was applied to half of the litters at the end of farrowing by removing the heaviest piglets over three periods of 1 h. The piglets were individually weighed at 0, 1 d, and at weaning. Piglet losses were recorded daily. Traceability was maintained until the carcass splitting and meat analysis took place. Carcasses were eviscerated and weighed individually. Total mortality at weaning was affected by body weight, where the low-body-weight piglets showed a mortality rate almost four times higher than that of the normal-weight piglets. Mortality was highest in the first days of life, especially in the low-body-weight piglets. At weaning, split-suckling treatment caused a slight increase in mortality compared to the control group piglets (25% vs. 17.1%). Split-suckling had a positive effect on weight gain during the first 24 h of life (p = 0.014), and there was an interaction between treatment and parity (p = 0.007), with split-suckling being more effective in the primiparous sows compared to the multiparous sows. The piglets from litters receiving the split-suckling treatment had a lower average daily gain during the lactation period (p < 0.001) than the piglets from the control group. Weight gain during the first 24 h of life of the piglets subjected to split-suckling was higher than those of the control group. A lower IgG and alpha-tocopherol in plasma in the heavier piglets subjected to split-suckling treatment was observed in comparison to their respective control. The piglets from litters receiving the treatment showed a lower average daily gain during the lactation period (p < 0.001) than the piglets from the control group. No difference in slaughter weight was observed according to treatment. The pigs which received split-suckling treatment showed lower subcutaneous fat thickness (p < 0.0013) and higher lean meat yield (p < 0.0027), this effect being more marked in pigs from primiparous sows. Intramuscular fat concentration was higher in the Longissimus Dorsi muscle of the low-body-weight piglets. In the pigs that received split-suckling treatment, a higher concentration of C18:3n-3 (p = 0.036) and a tendency towards a higher concentration of C18:2n-6 (p = 0.107) and unsaturation index (p = 0.113) was observed in intramuscular fatty acids at slaughter, together with a lower concentration of C16:0 (p = 0.053) and SFA (p = 0.064). In conclusion, long-term response to split-suckling, particularly in low-birth-weight piglets, suggests an alteration in adiposity and metabolic regulation in these piglets that receive high levels of colostrum.

AB  - The spermatic membrane is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which makes it sensitive to the action of reative species of oxygen, which can damage the seminal quality of the scraps. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the supplementation of two selenium sources at different doses. Third five scraps were allocated in four groups: (INOR30) 0.30 ppm sodium selenite; (COMP30) 0.30 ppm selenium metal-amino acid; (MIXED15+15) 0.15 ppm sodium selenite + 0.15 ppm selenium metal-amino acid and (COMP15) 0.15 ppm selenium metal-amino acid. The ejaculates of the scraps were evaluated over 22 weeks, resulting in 210 samples evaluated for volume, motility, pH, presence of agglutination and morphological changes, and 140 samples for spermatic concentration. The data was analyzed with repeated measures in time in a mixed model with type of selenium supplementation, periods of evaluation (one period of two weeks + five periods of four weeks) and their interactions as fixed effects, and animal and the worker that collected the ejaculates as random effects. Results showed no difference in selenium supplementation with the sources and doses used. In this way, it was possible to verify that the metal amino acid of selenium at the dose of 0.15 ppm promotes the same effect as the diets formulated with 0.30 ppm of sodium selenite.

AB  - The mirid bug Helopeltis bakeri Poppius feeds on a wide range of host plants including economically important crops, like cocoa (Theobroma cacao) and sweetpotato (Ipomea batatas), yet little is known about its complex interactions with its host plants. Here, we assessed the response of sweetpotato to feeding by H. bakeri. Headspace volatiles from healthy and infested sweetpotato cuttings were collected and compared. Feeding resulted in the production of a new headspace constituent, the terpene squalene, and an increase in the emission of other volatiles, including several terpenes and terpenoids and a green leaf volatile [(Z)-3-hexenyl acetate]. Electroantennographic and behavioral analyses confirmed that squalene is not electrophysiologically and behaviorally active toward H. bakeri, which suggests that squalene might have other ecological functions. The results provide important baseline information on the interactions of H. bakeri with its host plant, but the role of these volatile compounds in multitrophic interactions cannot be assessed yet since the natural enemies (e.g., parasitoids) of H. bakeri have not yet been identified.

AB  - Significant changes to subsistence economy and hunting habits have occurred in hunter-gatherer societies in the Levant, starting as early as the late Epi-Palaeolithic. Among the observed changes were the increase in the frequencies of gazelles and small sized animals, including small carnivore species, primarily foxes and felids. The role of the red fox in Late Natufian and early Neolithic economies in the southern Lavant has been examined in previous studies, though rarely in detail, while the role of wildcats has been largely neglected. We studied fox and wildcat remains from EPPNB Ahihud (Israel), in order to elucidate their role in the economy of the site. We found relatively high frequencies of fox and wildcat remains and an abundance of burn signs and cut marks, which enabled us to conduct a detailed study of these small carnivore remains in their archaeological context. Our study demonstrates that foxes and wildcats were hunted and exploited intensively, both for their fur and for their meat. Hence, we suggest that they should be considered as game animals in future studies of animal exploitation in the Early Neolithic.

AB  - Nitrogen-based pollution from agriculture has global environmental consequences. Excessive use of chemical nitrogen fertilizer, incorrect manure management and rural waste treatment are key contributors. Circular agriculture combining cropland and livestock is an efficient channel to reduce the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers, promote the recycling of livestock manure, and reduce the global N surplus. The internal circulation of organic nitrogen resources in the cropland-livestock system can not only reduce the dependence on external synthetic nitrogen, but also reduce the environmental impacts of organic waste disposal. Therefore, this study tried to clarify the reactive nitrogen emissions of the crop-swine integrated system compared to the separated system from a life cycle perspective, and analyze the reasons for the differences in nitrogen footprints of the two systems. The results showed that the integrated crop production and swine production increased the grain yield by 14.38% than that of the separated system. The nitrogen footprints of crop production and swine production from the integrated system were 12.02% (per unit area) and 19.78% lower than that from the separated system, respectively. The total nitrogen footprint of the integrated system showed a reduction of 17.06%. The reduction was from simpler waste manure management and less agricultural inputs for both chemical fertilizer and raw material for forage processing. In conclusion, as a link between crop planting and pig breeding, the integrated system not only reduces the input of chemical fertilizers, but also promotes the utilization of manure, increases crop yield, and decreases environmental pollution. Integrated cropland and livestock is a promising model for agriculture green and sustainable development in China.

AB  - Simple Summary To determine the use of differential somatic cell count as an indicator of mammary health in sheep, the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis approach was used to find a threshold value that can be used to discriminate healthy animals from those with a probable intramammary infection. This threshold will enhance the precision of diagnosing mammary gland inflammation in dairy sheep.Abstract Differential somatic cell count (DSCC), the percentage of somatic cell count (SCC) due to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and lymphocytes (LYMs), is a promising effective diagnostic marker for dairy animals with infected mammary glands. Well-explored in dairy cows, DSCC is also potentially valid in sheep, where clinical and subclinical mastitis outbreaks are among the principal causes of culling. We pioneered the application of DSCC in dairy ewes by applying receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to define the most accurate thresholds to facilitate early discrimination of sheep with potential intramammary infection (IMI) from healthy animals. We tested four predefined SCC cut-offs established in previous research. Specifically, we applied SCC cut-offs of 265 x 103 cells/mL, 500 x 103 cells/mL, 645 x 103 cells/mL, and 1000 x 103 cells/mL. The performance of DSCC as a diagnostic test was assessed by examining sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under curve (AUC) analyses. The designated threshold value for DSCC in the detection of subclinical mastitis is established at 79.8%. This threshold exhibits Se and Sp of 0.84 and 0.81, accompanied by an AUC of 0.88. This study represents the inaugural exploration of the potential use of DSCC in sheep's milk as an early indicator of udder inflammation.

AB  - Non-avialan theropod dinosaurs had diverse ecologies and varied skull morphologies. Previous studies of theropod cranial morphology mostly focused on higher-level taxa or characteristics associated with herbivory. To better understand morphological disparity and function within carnivorous theropod families, here we focus on the Dromaeosauridae, 'raptors' traditionally seen as agile carnivorous hunters.We applied 2D geometric morphometrics to quantify skull shape, performed mechanical advantage analysis to assess the efficiency of bite force transfer, and performed finite element analysis to examine strain distribution in the skull during biting. We find that dromaeosaurid skull morphology was less disparate than most non-avialan theropod groups. Their skulls show a continuum of form between those that are tall and short and those that are flat and long. We hypothesise that this narrower morphological disparity indicates developmental constraint on skull shape, as observed in some mammalian families. Mechanical advantage indicates that Dromaeosaurus albertensis and Deinonychus antirrhopus were adapted for relatively high bite forces, while Halszkaraptor escuilliei was adapted for high bite speed, and other dromaeosaurids for intermediate bite forces and speeds. Finite element analysis indicates regions of high strain are consistent within dromaeosaurid families but differ between them. Average strain levels do not follow any phylogenetic pattern, possibly due to ecological convergence between distantly-related taxa.Combining our new morphofunctional data with a re-evaluation of previous evidence, we find piscivorous reconstructions of Halszkaraptor escuilliei to be unlikely, and instead suggest an invertivorous diet and possible adaptations for feeding in murky water or other low-visibility conditions. We support Deinonychus antirrhopus as being adapted for taking large vertebrate prey, but we find that its skull is relatively less resistant to bite forces than other dromaeosaurids. Given the recovery of high bite force resistance for Velociraptor mongoliensis, which is believed to have regularly engaged in scavenging behaviour, we suggest that higher bite force resistance in a dromaeosaurid taxon may reflect a greater reliance on scavenging rather than fresh kills.Comparisons to the troodontid Gobivenator mongoliensis suggest that a gracile rostrum like that of Velociraptor mongoliensis is ancestral to their closest common ancestor (Deinonychosauria) and the robust rostra of Dromaeosaurus albertensis and Deinonychus antirrhopus are a derived condition. Gobivenator mongoliensis also displays a higher jaw mechanical advantage and lower resistance to bite force than the examined dromaeosaurids, but given the hypothesised ecological divergence of troodontids from dromaeosaurids it is unclear which group, if either, represents the ancestral condition. Future work extending sampling to troodontids would therefore be invaluable and provide much needed context to the origin of skull form and function in early birds.

AB  - Although soybean protein is the major component in livestock feeds, its effect on pigs' appetites is largely unknown. Recently, the importance of gut nutrient-sensing for appetite modulation by regulating anorectic gut hormone release has been recognised. This study investigates the roles of soybean proteins in appetite regulation, anorectic gut hormone secretion, and underlying mechanisms. The duodenal-cannulated piglets were used to evaluate the effects of soybean protein hydrolysate (SPH) on feed intake and anorectic hormone release, including cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) in the hepatic vein by infusing SPH. Identifying which nutrient-sensing receptor in pig duodenum response to SPH stimulation for gut hormone release was conducted. Using its antagonist, the role of the identified receptor in feed intake and anorectic hormone release was also investigated. Combination with an ex vivo perfusion system, the possible mechanism by which SPH exerts the effects in porcine duodenum was further illustrated. Results in vivo showed that intraduodenal infusion of SPH inhibited short-term feed intake in pigs and promoted CCK, PYY, and GIP secretion in the hepatic vein. SPH also increased duodenum calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expression. Pre-treated with CaSR antagonist NPS 2143, the feed intake of pigs tended to be attenuated by SPH (P = 0.09), and CCK release was also suppressed (P < 0.05), indicating that CaSR was involved in SPH-stimulated CCK release and inhibited feed intake in pigs. The ex vivo perfused duodenum tissues revealed that SPH-triggered CCK secretion was likeliest due to the activation of the intracellular Ca2+/TRPM5 pathway. Overall, this study's result illustrates that the diet soybean protein might decrease appetite in pigs by triggering duodenum CCK secretion by activating CaSR and the intracellular Ca2+/TRPM5 pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Ticks and tick-borne pathogens affect the productivity of sheep in Tunisia. Searching for genetically resistant breeds to infestation by ticks may represent an alternative to the overuse of chemical drugs. The aim of this study was to assess if there is any difference in tick infestation among the main sheep breeds in Tunisia. Four hundred and thirty-nine ear-tagged ewes from Barbarine and Queue Fine de l'Ouest (QFO) breeds were examined and sampled each trimester for two years. Ticks were identified to the species level, and piroplasms were detected using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Queue Fine de L'Ouest ewes were markedly less infested by ticks, and none was infected by piroplasms compared with Barbarine conterparts. The QFO sheep breed could be considered in concrete control strategies, including a breeding program.
   As ticks and tick-borne pathogens affect the productivity of livestock, searching for genetically resistant breeds to infestation by ticks may represent an alternative to the overuse of chemical drugs. The aim of this study was to assess if there is a difference in tick infestation among the main sheep breeds in Tunisia. The study was carried out between April 2018 and January 2020 in 17 small to middle-sized sheep flocks from 3 regions across Tunisia. Four hundred and thirty-nine ear-tagged ewes from Barbarine (n = 288, 65.6%) and Queue Fine de l'Ouest (QFO) (n = 151, 34.4%) breeds were examined and sampled each trimester. Ticks were identified to the species level, and piroplasms were detected using PCR that targets a common sequence ARNr18S to both Babesia and Theileria genera using catch-all primers. Totally, 707 adult ticks were collected from animals; 91.4% (646/707) of them were Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. Queue Fine de l'Ouest animals were markedly less infested by ticks, and no one of them was infected by piroplasms compared to the Barbarine breed. Indeed, during the first four seasons, 21 animals, all from the Barbarine breed, were detected positive for piroplasms. This is the first study in Tunisia about the low susceptibility of QFO ewes to infestation by ticks and to infection by piroplasms. The QFO sheep breed could be raised preferably at high-risk areas of tick occurrence and could be considered in concrete control strategies, including a breeding program.

AB  - Thaumastocoris peregrinus is an insect pest that causes a reduction in the productivity of Eucalyptus. Control of this insect can be carried out through selection of its less preferred genetic materials. The aim of this research was to evaluate the preferences of T. peregrinus and to associate these with the biochemical composition of six genetic materials of Eucalyptus, collected in an experimental area of the Federal University of Technology - Parana. Three bioassays were performed: Bioassay 1 conferred the feeding preference of adults of T. peregrinus, through a multiple choice test among the genetic materials; Bioassay 2 evaluated the confinement of the insects, observing the presence of insects, feces, and eggs on the leaves, for a five-day period; Bioassay 3: biochemical analyses were performed on leaves collected from the genetic materials in three different treatments. The preferred genetic material for feeding of T. peregrinus was Clone H-13 and the least preferred was Clone GFMO-27. In the confinement test, the highest percentage of live insects was on Eucalyptus propinqua and the lowest percentage on Eucalyptus pellita x Eucalyptus tereticornis. The biochemical levels of proteins, total and reducing sugars, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity demonstrated specificity regarding changes after 24 h of exposure to T. peregrinus. In Clone H13, there was a greater increase in the activity of the PAL enzyme, demonstrating that there was a defense response on the part of the plant, however, not sufficient to deter the insects.

AB  - This study evaluates the long-term effects of swine wastewater (SWW) on relevant parameters for soil fertility, including calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) cations, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and organic matter (OM) in an agricultural area with 9 years of crop cultivation. Three types of SWW (raw, after leaving the biodigester, and after the manure plant) were analyzed with four application rates of SWW (0, 100, 200, and 300 m3.ha-1), associated or not with mineral fertilization, resulting in eight treatments. The study found that the long-term use of SWW had significant effects on soil parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to summarize the data. The soil's calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) levels were higher in soybean compared to other crops and natural soil. Similarly, the treatment with 0 m3.ha-1 of pig manure and without mineral fertilization showed higher levels of these nutrients. In contrast, potassium (K) was found in greater quantities in oats, SWW from the biodigester, higher doses of manure, and with mineral fertilization. The crops had a higher organic matter (OM) content compared to the natural soil, with corn and raw SWW showing the most significant increase.

AB  - Simple Summary Deer antler is a unique and astonishing case of annual regeneration in mammalians. Several studies have pointed out the potential for use of velvet antler extract as a nutraceutical supplement, among others, because of its anti-cancer activity. The study of antler regeneration and growth allow us to identify the main proteins and regulatory pathways involved in cell differentiation and regeneration. For this purpose, two sections of antlers (tips and middle sections) using ribs as controls were analyzed from a proteomic point of view. A total of 259 proteins mainly associated with antioxidant mechanisms and Wnt signalling pathways could be responsible for deer antler regeneration and these proteins may be linked to human health benefits. Further studies should be focused on discovering which proteins from velvet antler extracts are associated with these beneficial effects. Antlers are the only organ in the mammalian body that regenerates each year. They can reach growth rates of 1-3 cm/day in length and create more than 20 cm(2)/day of skin in the antler tips (their growth centers). Previous proteomic studies regarding antlers have focused on antler growth centers (tips) compared to the standard bone to detect the proteins involved in tissue growth. However, proteins of cell differentiation and regeneration will be more accurately detected considering more growing tissues. Thus, we set out to compare proteins expressed in antler tips (the highest metabolism rate and cell differentiation) vs. middle sections (moderate cell growth involving bone calcification), using ribs as controls. Samples were obtained in mid-June with antlers' phenology corresponding to the middle of their growth period. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified 259 differentially abundant proteins mainly associated with antioxidant metabolic mechanisms, protein formation and Wnt signalling pathway, meanwhile, the mid antler section was linked to blood proteins. The high metabolic rate and subsequent risk of oxidative stress also seem to have resulted in strong antioxidant mechanisms. These results suggest that redox regulation of proteins is a key factor in the model of deer antler regeneration.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of incorporating curcumin oil nano-emulsion (CONE) into a Tris-based freezing extender to relieve cryodamage effects and enhance sperm cryo-resistance in buffalo bulls. Pooled semen from five fertile buffalo bulls (n = 40 ejaculates) was divided and supplemented with 0.5% CONE (CONE0.5), 1% CONE (CONE1), or without CONE (CONE0, control), then extended and packaged. Post-thaw assessments included sperm kinematic parameters, oxidative stress markers, apoptosis levels, microbial load, ultrastructural integrity, molecular docking interactions, and conception rates. The CONE0.5 group exhibited significantly higher sperm viability, progressive motility, and membrane integrity, as well as significantly lower nitric oxide and MDA levels, compared to the CONE0 and CONE1 groups (p < 0.05), indicating reduced oxidative stress. Compared to the CONE0 group, the CONE0.5 group exhibited a significantly higher percentage of viable and early apoptotic sperm, and a significantly lower percentage of late apoptotic sperm (p < 0.05). Both CONE-treated groups demonstrated significantly lower post-thaw total bacterial, spore-forming bacterial, and coliform bacterial counts (p < 0.05). Conception rates were higher in the CONE0.5 group (80.0%) compared to the CONE0 group (68.0%) (p > 0.05). Molecular docking analysis revealed strong binding affinities between curcumin and caspase-3 (-7.87 kcal/mol), HSP70 (-8.52 kcal/mol), and PRDX-1 (-8.90 kcal/mol), suggesting potential mechanisms of action. In summary, the inclusion of 0.5% CONE as a cryoprotective additive in buffalo semen freezing media demonstrates a potential for improving post-thaw semen quality parameters, suggesting a possible enhancement of reproductive efficiency.

AB  - Diabetic gastroenteropathy is a common complication, which develops in patients with long-term diabetes. The pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide known for its cytoprotective properties and plays an important role in neuronal development, neuromodulation and neuroprotection. The present study was designed to elucidate, for the first time, the impact of prolonged hyperglycaemia conditions on a population of PACAP-like immunoreactive neurons in selected parts of the porcine gastrointestinal tract. The experiment was conducted on 10 juvenile female pigs assigned to two experimental groups: The DM group (pigs with streptozocin-induced diabetes) and the C group (control pigs). Diabetes conditions were induced by a single intravenous injection of streptozocin. Six weeks after the induction of diabetes, all animals were euthanised and further collected, and fixed fragments of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and descending colon were processed using the routine double-labelling immunofluorescence technique. Streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemia caused a significant increase in the population of PACAP-containing enteric neurons in the porcine stomach, small intestines and descending colon. The recorded changes may result from the direct toxic effect of hyperglycaemia on the ENS neurons, oxidative stress or inflammatory conditions accompanying hyperglycaemia and suggest that PACAP is involved in regulatory processes of the GIT function in the course of diabetes.

AB  - The content of long???chain hydrocarbons in the bark of several willow cultivars was investigated. The research material consisted of 10???cm???long apical one???year shoots harvested from 3???year???old carps. The content and composition of hydrocarbons were determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. All analyzed cultivars contained 19 hydrocarbons in various amounts. Hydrocarbon content was highest in the bark of Salix purpurea clone 1126, mainly due to a high concentration of 9,12???octadecadienoic acid. In turn, eicosanoic acid was found in trace amounts. A correlation analysis showed a positive relationship between browsing intensity and the content of the following compounds in willow bark: hexadecanoic acid, 11???octadecenoic acid, 9,12???octadecadienoic acid, 9,12,15???octadecatrienoic acid, docosanoic acid, and octadecanoid acid.

AB  - Simple Summary Grain legumes are cultivated for food and feed purposes in all regions of the world. Legumes are the main source of protein for a large part of the world population where animal protein is hardly available. The potential of grain legumes is increasing primarily due to the genetic improvement of their agricultural and nutritional characteristics and expansion of organic farming. They are also fed to animals as a component of concentrates and on farms producing "organic" food. Therefore, studies on the composition, nutritional value and factors affecting quality of legume protein contribute to a more efficient utilization of seeds as feed and food ingredients. Faba bean is rich in both starch and protein and is an important alternative protein source in animal nutrition; however, its potential is not yet fully exploited, particularly in pig diets. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of diets containing various levels of extruded faba bean seeds on growth performance and selected microbial activity indices in the large intestine of pigs. Treatments with faba bean seeds did not negatively affect growth performance (except for the highest level of faba bean) and microbial activity in the large intestine, and can be applied in piglet diets. The study investigated the effect of replacing soybean meal with extruded faba bean seeds on piglet growth performance and selected microbial activity indices in the large intestine. In total, 24, 35-day-old, healthy, castrated piglets of similar body weight were divided into four groups with six replicates. Animals in the control group (C) were fed with soybean meal without extruded faba bean seeds. In other experimental groups, pigs were fed diets with the addition of 20 (FB20), 25 (FB25) or 30% (FB30) extruded faba bean seeds instead of soybean meal and wheat starch. Growth performance, histology of the large intestine, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and ammonia concentration, as well as the activity of bacterial enzymes in digesta samples, were analyzed. The intake of the FB25 diet resulted in an increased feed:gain ratio in comparison to the FB30 group. Feeding the FB30 diet increased tunica muscularis thickness in the caecum as compared to other groups. Moreover, dietary inclusion of extruded faba bean seeds had no effect on SCFA and ammonia concentration. In addition, feeding diets with a different level of extruded faba bean seeds did not affect the activity of bacterial enzymes in the colon.

AB  - IntroductionDepression and anxiety are highly comorbid mental disorders with marked sex differences. Both disorders show altered activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Infralimbic deep brain stimulation (DBS-IL) has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to contribute to understanding sex differences in the neurobiology of these disorders. MethodsIn male and female rats, we recorded neural oscillations along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus and the amygdala in response to an anxiogenic drug, FG-7142. Following this, we applied DBS-IL. ResultsSurprisingly, in females, the anxiogenic drug failed to induce most of the changes observed in males. We found sex differences in slow, delta, theta, and beta oscillations, and the amygdalo-hippocampal communication in response to FG-7142, with modest changes in females. Females had a more prominent basal gamma, and the drug altered this band only in males. We also analyzed c-Fos expression in both sexes in stress-related structures in response to FG-7142, DBS-IL, and combined interventions. With the anxiogenic drug, females showed reduced expression in the nucleus incertus, amygdala, septohippocampal network, and neocortical levels. In both experiments, the DBS-IL reversed FG-7142-induced effects, with a more substantial effect in males than females. DiscussionHere, we show a reduced response in female rats which contrasts with the higher prevalence of anxiety in women but is consistent with other studies in rodents. Our results open compelling questions about sex differences in the neurobiology of anxiety and depression and their study in animal models.

AB  - Insect herbivores are amongst the most destructive plant pests, damaging both naturally occurring and domesticated plants. As sessile organisms, plants make use of structural and chemical barriers to counteract herbivores. However, over 75% of herbivorous insect species are well adapted to their host's defenses and these specialists are generally difficult to ward off. By actively antagonizing the number of insect eggs deposited on plants, future damage by the herbivore's offspring can be limited. Therefore, it is important to understand which plant traits influence attractiveness for oviposition, especially for specialist insects that are well adapted to their host plants. In this study, we investigated the oviposition preference of Pieris butterflies (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) by offering them the choice between 350 different naturally occurring Arabidopsis accessions. Using a genome-wide association study of the oviposition data and subsequent fine mapping with full genome sequences of 164 accessions, we identified WRKY42 and AOC1 as candidate genes that are associated with the oviposition preference observed for Pieris butterflies. Host plant choice assays with Arabidopsis genotypes impaired in WRKY42 or AOC1 function confirmed a clear role for WRKY42 in oviposition preference of female Pieris butterflies, while for AOC1 the effect was mild. In contrast, WRKY42-impaired plants, which were preferred for oviposition by butterflies, negatively impacted offspring performance. These findings exemplify that plant genotype can have opposite effects on oviposition preference and caterpillar performance. This knowledge can be used for breeding trap crops or crops that are unattractive for oviposition by pest insects.
   Pierisbutterfly preference for oviposition on naturally occurring and genetically diverse Arabidopsis accessions is associated with WRKY42impairment and negatively impacts caterpillar performance.

AB  - Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods provide valuable insights and opportunities for identifying functional gene underlying phenotype formation. However, the majority of GWAS risk loci and QTLs located in noncoding regions poses significant challenges in pinpointing the protein-coding genes associated with specific traits. Moreover, growing evidence suggests not all GWAS risk loci and QTLs are functional, emphasizing the critical need for prioritizing causal sites-a task of paramount importance for biologists. The accumulation of publicly available multiomics data provides an unprecedented opportunity to annotate and prioritize GWAS risk loci and QTLs. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive multiomics database encompassing four major agricultural species-pig, sheep, cattle, and chicken. This database integrates publicly accessible datasets, including 140 GWAS studies (covering 471 traits), 2625 QTL datasets (spanning 1235 traits), 86 Hi-C datasets (from eight cells/tissue types), 95 epigenomic datasets (from four cells/tissue types), and 769 transcription factor motifs. The database aims to link GWAS-QTL loci located in the noncoding regions to the target genes they regulate and prioritize functional and causal regulatory elements. Ultimately, it provides a valuable resource and potential validation targets for elucidating the genes and molecular pathways underlying economically important traits in agricultural animals.

AB  - Forensic entomology has relied on species-specificity, quantitative and qualitative variations of cuticular hydrocarbons to successfully carry out chemotaxonomic identification of insects based on species, age and gender. This work studied the effects of dichlorvos on the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of some adult sarco-saprophagous insects of forensic importance that fed on dichlorvos-poisoned carrions for utility during death investigations. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) were extracted from adult insects of the species Chrysomya albiceps, Sarcophaga exuberans, Musca domestica, Hermetia illucens, Dermestes maculatus and Necrobia rufipes from both dichlorvos-poisoned and control pig (Sus scrofa Linnaeus) carrions and subjected to chemotaxonomic profiling using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 41 CHCs were successfully identified from insects of both the dichlorvos-poisoned and control carrions ranging from C8 to C33 carbons consisting of majorly the n-alkanes, methyl branched alkanes and an alkene. There was a higher abundance of CHCs present in the insects of dichlorvos-poisoned carrions than the control group. The highest mean peak concentration and abundance of the CHCs was recorded by 2,6,10,14 -Tetramethyl Pentadecane (10.38 +/- 0.53 mu g/mg for dichlorvos-poisoned carrions and 8.99 +/- 1.13 mu g/mg for the control carrions). The visualization of the species-specific differences in CHCs compositions showed less overlapping CHCs clusters and quantitative metrics of principal component analysis plots of the insects from both carrion groups with high eigenvalues > 3 which were indications of good species level discrimination. The study showed that insects' CHCs profiles of dichlorvos-poisoned and control carrions exhibited uniqueness cum variations in terms of abundance and chemical identity.

AB  - In vitro embryo production (IVP) has widespread implications for animal husbandry and conservation programs. The overarching goal of achieving pregnancy with IVP systems calls for accurate methods of embryo viability screening. The present study set out to examine whether phototextural attributes of ovine presumptive zygotes were reliable markers of embryo developmental competence in vitro. Sheep oocytes were obtained post-mortem from nine cycling Polish Longwool ewes using the ovarian cutting and sieving method. Following in vitro maturation of oocytes and their fertilization with fresh ram semen, the development of embryos (n = 37) was monitored using time-lapse imaging. The embryos were retrospectively classified as non-arresting (attaining the blastocyst stage; n = 6) or arresting (non-dividing presumptive zygotes or embryos arresting before the 7th mitotic division; n = 31). Commercially available image analytical software ImageProPlus (R) was used to generate bitmaps of the regions of interest comprising zygotic cytoplasm. Subsequently, a proprietary computer program r-Algo 2.0 was used to determine if there existed clusters of pixels for which first-order phototextural characteristics of presumptive zygotes' (t0) cytoplasm (i.e., mean pixel intensity (MPI), heterogeneity (MPH), and concentration (MPC)) differed significantly between the two subsets of embryos. Within the algorithmically identified pixel intensity ranges, future non-arresting embryos at t0 exceeded their arresting counterparts in MPI (pixel range of 73-75; 74.06 +/- 0.01 vs. 73.98 +/- 0.008; P = 0.0007) and MPC (pixel range: 105-106; 1.25 +/- 0.22% vs. 0.56 +/- 0.07%; P = 0.0004) but had lower mean MPH (pixel range: 36-42; 1.81 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.97 +/- 0.02; P = 0.0005). Computerized segmentation of ovine zygotic microphotographs is a promising non-invasive method to predict their developmental potential in vitro.
   Sentence We employed algorithmic image analysis to predict sheep embryo viability in vitro, identifying key phototextural attributes that distinguish the cytoplasm of normally developing embryos from that of arresting ones.

AB  - Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveys on thermostatic animals has gained prominence due to their ability to provide practical and precise dynamic censuses, contributing to developing and refining conservation strategies. However, the practical application of UAVs for animal monitoring necessitates the automation of image interpretation to enhance their effectiveness. Based on our past experiences, we present the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) as a case study to illustrate the effective use of thermal cameras mounted on UAVs for monitoring monkey populations in Qinling, a region characterized by magnificent biodiversity. We used the local contrast method for a small infrared target detection algorithm to collect the total population size. Through the experimental group, we determined the average optimal grayscale threshold, while the validation group confirmed that this threshold enables automatic detection and counting of target animals in similar datasets. The precision rate obtained from the experiments ranged from 85.14% to 97.60%. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between the minimum average distance between thermal spots and the count of detected individuals, indicating higher interference in images with closer thermal spots. We propose a formula for adjusting primate population estimates based on detection rates obtained from UAV surveys. Our results demonstrate the practical application of UAV-based thermal imagery and automated detection algorithms for primate monitoring, albeit with consideration of environmental factors and the need for data preprocessing. This study contributes to advancing the application of UAV technology in wildlife monitoring, with implications for conservation management and research.
   The figure depicts using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial survey data of the same area collected using thermal imaging and visible light sources simultaneously during a specific time period. It contrasts the visual effects of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys in different data sources. The original thermal imaging data readily identify clustered targets, whereas under the same observational scale, targets are difficult to identify in visible light data. However, after local focus adjustment, the rich texture features in visible light data provide abundant species information. In large-scale UAV inspections, thermal imaging technology is more adept at target detection based on species behavior. Therefore, the exploration of computer-based automatic identification methods for the abundance of thermal spot data generated during inspections is the objective of drafting the manuscript "Advancing Primate Surveillance with Image Recognition Techniques from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles." As an essential and highly promising methodological exploration in primate research, we aim to attract more scholars and research groups from academic fields by presenting these findings on the cover, urging their attention and participation in this practical research direction. image

AB  - Low fat cheese is the demand of this era due to overconsumption and sedentary life style and increase in diseases like hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases etc. Inulin is a food ingredient that belongs to a class of carbohydrates known as fructans with degree of polymerization range from 2-70. Resistant starch is obtained by chemical and enzymatic treatment of starch to increase its properties. These have functional and health-promoting properties as they reduce caloric value, add dietary fiber and endorse prebiotic effects. These are frequently used in industrially processed dairy as a bulking agent for fat replacement, textural modifications and organoleptic improvements. Hence, these can be fruitfully be used in manufacturing different kind of cheeses to have reduced or low fat, texturized or symbiotic product. Present study designed to evaluate the effect of different levels of inulin and resistant starch in low fat cheddar cheese to improve its quality. Different levels have significant effect on the physic-chemical (moisture, fat, protein, ash,) characters. Melt-ability and flow-ability showed inverse relationship with levels of inulin. Melt-ability and flow-ability decreased by increasing level and increasing hardness. Yield calculation showed non-significant effect within levels but significant effect as compared with control. The fat substituting property is based on its ability to stabilize the structure of aqueous phase which creates an improved creaminess. The addition of inulin and resistant starch as fat replacement improved the sensory characteristics of low fat cheese samples when added up to the level of 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively.

AB  - A multilevel index system of organophosphate flame retardant bioremediation effect in an e-waste handling area was established under three bioremediation scenarios (scenario I, plant absorption; scenario II, plant-microbial combined remediation; scenario III, microbial degradation). Directional modification of OPFR substitutes with high selective bioremediation was performed. The virtual amino acid mutation approach was utilised to generate high-efficiency selective absorption/degradation mutant proteins (MPs) in a plant-microbial system under varying conditions. In scenario III, the MP's microbial degrading ability to replace molecules was increased to the greatest degree (165.82%). Appropriate foods such as corn, pig liver, and yam should be consumed, whereas the simultaneous consumption of high protein foods such as pig liver and walnut should be avoided; sweet potato and yam are believed to be prevent OPFRs and substitute molecules from entering the human body through multiple pathways for reduced genotoxicity of OPFRs in the populations of e-waste handling areas (the reduction degree can reach 85.12%). The study provides a theoretical basis for the development of ecologically acceptable OPFR substitutes and innovative high-efficiency bioremediation MPs, as well as for the reduction of the joint toxicity risk of multiple ingestion mute exposure/gene damage of OPFRs in high OPFR exposure sites.

AB  - Engineered collaborative biochemical techniques and regulated nanomaterials (NMs) offer extraordinary opportunities for improving the analysis performance of lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). Herein, inspired by the ability of macromolecules (e.g., proteins) to assemble into new functional units and the remarkable optical performance of engineered regulated NMs, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (GAMI) serves as the "crosslinker" integrate with gold-manganese oxide (Au-MnOx) to assemble the "signal tracers (STs)-crosslinker-antibody (mAb)" for elevating the mAb utilization efficiency. Notably, the "STs-crosslinker-mAb" assembly shows -13.33folds mAb utilization efficiency enhance, which perfectly response the challenge between limited sensitivity and sufficient signal intensity in competitive-type LFIA. The black color and rough structure of Au-MnOx offer higher colorimetric brightness (-2-folds than AuNPs) and enhanced mAb coupling efficiency (up to 92.47%), which further improves sensitivity under the premise of functional assembly to intensify the competitive immunoreaction. Additionally, the convenient synthesis conditions (-13 min at room temperature) even comparable to direct purchase commercial products indicate that using Au-MnOx undoubtedly increases the cost-effectiveness. Encouragingly, the Au-MnOx-GAMI-mAb based LFIA exhibited high sensitivity (LOD: 0.063 ng mL-1 for clenbuterol (CLE) monitoring) by elevating mAb utilization efficiency with the attendant enhancing immune competition response in a cost-effective manner, which provides an invigorating reference pathway in point-ofcare immunoassay.

AB  - Goats are widely recognized for their adaptability and resource efficiency, making them an excellent choice for sustainable farming. However, the Hainan Black goat (HNBG), a vital breed in southern China's tropical regions, faces significant challenges that threaten its productivity and economic viability. Specifically, young HNBGs exhibit stunted growth and poor muscle development, indicating the breed may have more genetic defects that cause the poor phenotypes. The FNDC5 gene, which encodes the protein irisin, plays a key role in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism by activating critical signaling molecules such as PGC-1 alpha, thereby enhancing muscle endurance and metabolic efficiency. This study aimed to investigate the impact of missense mutations in the FNDC5 gene on growth and meat quality traits in HNBGs. We sequenced a population of HNBGs and identified three SNPs that could lead to amino acid substitutions. Notably, SNP1 (p.119A/V) and SNP2 (p.135R/H) showed strong linkage. Predictions on the structural effects of these mutations indicated that SNP1 (p.119A/V) and SNP3 (p.170W/G) could alter the secondary structure of the FNDC5 protein. Association analyses revealed that SNP1 (p.119A/V) and SNP2 (p.135R/H) were significantly associated with morphometric traits and meat quality. The phenotypic values of SNP1 and SNP2 co-mutants were significantly lower than those of other combined genotypes. Furthermore, gene expression levels of FNDC5 varied notably across individuals with different SNP1 genotypes. These findings suggest that FNDC5-SNP1 (p.119A/V) could serve as a promising genetic marker for selecting HNBGs with improved growth and muscle development, offering a potential pathway for enhancing key economic traits in this breed.

AB  - With the current possible presence of thousands of PFAS compounds in industrial emissions, there is an increasing need to assess the impacts of PFAS regulation of conventional PFAS on one hand and the exposure to emerging and yet unknown PFAS on the other. Today's analytical methodologies using targeted approaches are not sufficient to determine the complete suite of PFAS present. To evaluate the presence of unknown PFAS, we investigated in this study the occurrence of an extended range of target PFAS in various species from the marine and terrestrial Norwegian environment, in relation to the extractable organofluorine (EOF), which yields the total amount of organofluorine. The results showed a varying presence of extractable fluorinated organics, with glaucous gull eggs, otter liver and polar bear plasma showing the highest EOF and a high abundance of PFAS as well. The targeted PFAS measurements explained 1% of the organofluorine for moose liver as the lowest and 94% for otter liver as the highest. PFCAs like trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, reported semi-quantitatively), played a major role in explaining the organic fluorine present. Emerging PFAS as the perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS), was found in polar bear plasma in quantifiable amounts for the first time, confirming earlier detection in arctic species far removed from emission sources. To enable a complete organic fluorine mass balance in wildlife, new approaches are needed, to uncover the presence of new emerging PFAS as cyclic-or ether PFAS together with chlorinated PFAS as well as fluorinated organic pesticides and pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Changes in the seasonal environment substantially influence organisms. Understanding how species respond to such changes, such as in their feeding interactions and physiology, is key to predicting their resilience to both seasonal and longer term climate changes. The Sitka Sound in Southeast Alaska, USA, is an attractive natural laboratory for studying change, as the marine environment experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations in parameters such as temperature, pH, and productivity between summer and winter. By sampling a suite of dominant macrophyte algae and their benthic herbivores in winter (January) and summer (July) 2019, we investigated how producers and their primary consumers may respond to seasonal change inferred through fatty acid trophic markers. We used a fatty acid logratio selection and analysis approach to ask the following: (1) Do fatty acid biomarkers for algae differ between seasons? (2) Do the same fatty acid biomarkers differ between seasons when applied to herbivores, with herbivore fatty acids tracking the presumed trophic resources? (3) Do fatty acid biomarkers for herbivores differ between seasons, when considered independently from algae? Comparing logratio sets selected each for the algae and the herbivore fatty acids, we found that algae fatty acids were different between our sampling seasons, but the algae-selected fatty acid logratios did not clearly separate most herbivores by season. In contrast, the herbivore-selected logratios strongly distinguished herbivore species between the January and June samplings. Further, dispersions of fatty acid logratios were greater within herbivore species in the winter than in the summer, potentially due to the utilization of more diverse resources when preferred algae are less abundant. In total, results suggest that herbivores are not simply tracking the seasonal fatty acid changes in the dominant algae as trophic resources; instead, herbivore fatty acid seasonal changes may occur largely through some other nonexclusive mechanisms, such as omnivory, reductions or shifts in dietary composition, and/or endogenous physiological responses. Thus, the benthic herbivores in our study appear not to be locked into their diets when faced with seasonal change and may use a range of strategies, including diet diversification, to cope with environmental variation.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most common and serious diseases of the brain, affecting more than 70 million people worldwide. Available anticonvulsants are able to suppress seizures in two thirds of patients, and in the remaining third of patients, epilepsy is considered drug-resistant and other types of treatment are required, such as surgery, which also does not always lead to positive results. Overcoming resistance is a complex task that requires an understanding of the biochemical pathways and general pathological processes underlying epilepsy, primarily apoptosis. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of the antibiotic minolexin on the levels of apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-associated molecules (p53, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and caspase-8) in the temporal cortex, underlying white matter and hippocampus of Krushinsky-Molodkina rats with hereditary audiogenic epilepsy with long-term kindling. We used Krushinsky-Molodkina rats at the age of 11 months, which were subjected to audiogenic stimulation and administered intraperitoneally with 1 mL of saline solution or the second-generation tetracycline series minolexin at a dose of 45 mg/kg, dissolved in saline solution for 14 days. The temporal lobe cortex and underlying white matter, the hippocampus, were examined. Apoptosis levels (TUNEL) and expression of apoptosis-associated proteins (p53, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and -8) were assessed (immunohistochemistry, Western blotting). In Krushinsky-Molodkina rats with hereditary audiogenic epilepsy, an increase in the apoptosis level was shown during long-term kindling. A p53-mediated, but caspase-independent mechanism of apoptosis activation has been identified. When minolexin was administered, an anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effect was observed in the temporal lobe and hippocampus of rats.

AB  - The inactivation of ancestral protein-coding genes (gene loss) can be associated with phenotypic modifications. Within placental mammals, repeated losses of PNLIPRP1 (gene inhibiting fat digestion) occurred preferentially in strictly herbivorous species, whereas repeated NR1I3 losses (gene involved in detoxification) occurred preferentially in strictly carnivorous species. It was hypothesized that lower fat contents of herbivorous diets and lower toxin contents of carnivorous diets cause relaxed selection pressure on these genes, resulting in the accumulation of mutations and ultimately to convergent gene losses. However, because herbivorous and carnivorous diets differ vastly in their composition, a fine-grained analysis is required for hypothesis testing. We generated a trait matrix recording diet and semi-quantitative estimates of fat and toxin consumption for 52 placental species. By including data from 31 fossil taxa, we reconstructed the ancestral diets in major lineages (grundplan reconstruction). We found support that PNLIPRP1 loss is primarily associated with low levels of fat intake and not simply with herbivory/carnivory. In particular, PNLIPRP1 loss also occurred in carnivorous lineages feeding on a fat-poor diet, suggesting that the loss of this gene may be beneficial for occupying ecological niches characterized by fat-poor food resources. Similarly, we demonstrated that carnivorous species are indeed less exposed to diet-related toxins, suggesting that the loss of NR1I3 and related genes (NR1I2 and UGT1A6) resulted from relaxed selection pressure. This study illustrates the need of detailed phenotype studies to obtain a deeper understanding of factors underlying gene losses and to progress in understanding genomic causes of phenotypic variation in mammals.

AB  - Vocal communication serves as an important mode of interaction among animals. The quantitative analysis of acoustic signals holds scientific value in highlighting the importance of understanding the social-ecological contexts and their effects on acoustic communication. The results can provide a direct scientific guidance for enhancing the welfare and management of captive animals. From January to February 2022 and from December 2022 to February 2023, we conducted a study involving 30 captive Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs (Trachypithecus francoisi) housed in nine enclosures. We collected acoustic signals along with their associated social-ecological contexts and recorded the social composition and number of Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs in each enclosure. We in total identified 23 call types based on human ear auditory, spectrogram visual inspection, and quantitative analysis of 37 acoustic parameters. Our findings revealed that adult males exhibited nine call types (five adult male-specific types), adult females 11 call types (seven adult female-specific types), juveniles eight call types (two juvenile-specific types), and infants five call types (two infant-specific types). The asymmetry in call types indicated distinct social roles among different sex-age classes of Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs. We found that a complex social composition or larger group size resulted in a more diverse range of call types and increased utterance frequency among Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs. The increased utterance frequency was linked to calls used in neutral (contact), affiliation, mating, and vigilance contexts, indicating that a diverse social setting encourages social interaction and boosts the occurrence of natural behaviors, and may also result in increased tension and anxiety. Implementing a one-male multi-female model with ample breeding space for captive Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs was identified as beneficial for enhancing vocal communication and improving animal welfare. This study established the first vocal repertoire of Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs, offering a novel scientific approach to evaluating the welfare of this endangered species through vocal behaviors.

AB  - In order to improve the accuracy of sheep counting and avoid the interference of mutual occlusion caused by different moving speed among sheep, the concept of fusion between the improved YOLOv5x model based on the attention mechanism and DeepSort algorithm is proposed. First, the ECA structure that is channel attention mechanism is used to optimize YOLOv5x model to strengthen the ability of capturing global information. Secondly, the sparrow search algorithm based on elite opposition-based learning strategy is used to optimize the learning rate of the detection model, so as to get the weight information of the optimal group to further improve the recognition rate of sheep. In the experiment, 800 high-resolution sheep images augmented by SRGAN network and data augmentation are used as model datasets, and the best weight information obtained by the YOLOv5x-ECA-SSA* model is used to accurately recognize sheep. According to the DeepSort algorithm, the recognized sheep are tracked, predicted and matched optimally. The experimental results show that the test precision of YOLOv5x*, YOLOv5x-ECA* and YOLOv5x-ECA-SSA* based on the SRGAN and data enhancement to train are respectively 95.74%, 96.50% and 97.10%. The error rate of each model combined with DeepSort algorithm to complete sheep dynamic counting is respectively 13%, 12% and 5%. Among them, the YOLOv5x-ECASSA* model has the highest mAP and best effect of sheep counting. The result can provide a new theorical method for realizing intelligent dynamic counting and tracking in the grazing process and provide a new technical application for intelligent animal husbandry.

AB  - Batoids (skates and rays) are the most speciose group of cartilaginous fishes with a diverse array of ecological adaptations and swimming modes. Early skeletal fossil remains and recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that convergence among batoids has occurred independently multiple times. The drivers for such disparity patterns and possible association with modularity and phenotypic integration among batoids are not fully understood. Here we employed geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods to characterize the evolutionary trends in the basal fin skeleton of extinct and extant batoids and dorsoventrally flattened sharks. We found that the most speciose orders of batoids, Myliobatiformes and Rajiformes, display the lowest levels of morphological disparity, while Torpediniformes and Rhinopristitiformes have the highest disparity. Differences in evolutionary rates by habitat indicate that both reef and freshwater species evolved faster than deep-sea and shelf-distributed species. We further explored the differences based on swimming modes and found that species with oscillatory swimming exhibit higher evolutionary rates on their coracoid bar. We found that specific groups underwent different rates of evolution on each element of the pectoral fin. This was corroborated by the modularity and integration analyses, which indicate differences in the covariation between structures among the analyzed groups. The convergence analysis does not support the resemblance between flattened sharks and batoids; however we found convergence between extinct batoids and modern guitarfishes. Our findings suggest that habitat and swimming mode have shaped the pectoral fin evolution among batoids.

AB  - Theoretical studies have shown that in protection mutualism, the modification of top-down control by protectors may be destabilizing. Central to this prediction are the assumptions that (1) protection mutualism increases the abundance of protected partners, (2) this increased abundance generates a lagged effect on partner resources, and (3) spatial dynamics can be ignored. Although a number of studies have confirmed that protection mutualism can increase the abundance of protected herbivores, the evidence for a negative effect of protected herbivores on plant quality is mixed, and we are unaware of any studies that have explored the effect of protected herbivores on plant quality across growing seasons. Here, we use the protection mutualism between ants and the treehopper Publilia concava to evaluate the assumption that treehopper herbivory has a lagged effect on plant quality. We also evaluated whether ant protection exacerbated the negative effect of treehoppers on their host plants. We used a two-way factorial design that manipulated ant and treehopper presence on goldenrod host plants in 1 year and assessed oviposition and survivorship on those same plants in the subsequent year. Treehopper herbivory was associated with a decrease in the probability of oviposition, and female treehoppers laid significantly fewer egg masses on plants that had been fed on the previous year, regardless of ant tending. In contrast, a prior history of herbivory had no impact on future treehopper performance as measured by nymph survival. Ant tending increased treehopper abundance and exacerbated the risk of plant mortality but otherwise did not significantly modify the negative effect of treehopper herbivory on plant quality or future treehopper performance. Although the increase in treehopper abundance associated with ant tending and the lagged oviposition response of treehoppers is consistent with the core assumptions of a model showing that mutualism can be destabilizing, the avoidance of previously occupied plants for oviposition is not. These results highlight the importance of future modeling studies that explore spatiotemporal dynamics in protection mutualism and long-term field studies that track the effect of mutualism across years.

AB  - The stock biomass of the carrot prawn (Pleuroncodes monodon) in the south-central area of Chile (33o-39 degrees S) has decreased progressively in the last 12 years. The depletion and lack of recovery of carrot prawn and other fish and crustacean stocks has been attributed mostly to fishing mortality (F). Predation can be also an important factor for the dynamics of marine species, especially those that are important prey in the ecosystem, like the carrot prawn and other demersal crustaceans. However, predation mortality (M2) has been less studied and quantified in Chile and elsewhere. Therefore, it is important to estimate and compare predation (M2) and fishing (F) mortality to understand their individual and combined effects on the dynamics of fishing stocks. In this study, we analyzed the biomass changes of carrot prawn and other components of the marine food web in south-central Chile from 1992 to 2018. For this, we built a food web model that was later fit to time series of observed biomass and catch data, using observed fishing mortality as forcing factor. We used the Ecopath with Ecosim software as modeling platform. This model provided M2 and F series for carrot prawn and other demersal crustaceans, which were compared to evaluate their relative contribution to total mortality (Z) from 1992 to 2018. The quantitative model considered 29 functional groups, from primary producers to top predators, and the following fishing fleets operating in the study area: artisanal and industrial purse seine fleets, artisanal and industrial hake trawling fleet and demersal prawn trawling fleet. The results indicated that M2 was the main component of Z in adults and juveniles carrot prawns, with Chilean hake as the main predator in both cases. M2 was responsible for 84 % and 86 % of Z of adults and juveniles of carrot prawns, respectively. M2 was also greater than F in yellow prawns (Cervimunida johni), whose main predator was big eye flounder (Hippoglossina macrops). In contrast, F was greater than M2 for the nylon shrimp (Heterocarpus reedi). We conclude that the stock dynamics of the carrot and yellow prawns has been strongly influenced in recent decades by the predation by Chilean hake on pre-recruits of carrot prawn as prey and bigeye flounder on yellow prawn as prey. We recommend that M2 should be considered both in evaluating the past dynamics of these stocks used to establish their status and in future projections used to establish biologically acceptable catch.

AB  - This research was done to identify the usefulness of clinico-physiological and haematobiochemical effects of total intravenous anaesthesia affected by combination of diazepam-propofol-ketamine with constant rate of infusion in goats undergoing orthopedic surgery (bone plating). Five goats having metatarsal and metacarpal fracture were included in the study. The animals were sedated with diazepam @ 0.25 mg/kg inducted with ketamine and propofol at the dose rate of 2.0 mg/kg each and maintained with diazepam, ketamine and propofol at the dose rate of 0.02 mg/kg/hr, 2.40 mg/kg/hr and 0.96 mg/kg/hr, respectively after using volumetric syringe driving pump. The clinico-physiological and haematobiochemical parameters of above said animals were recorded at 0 min before sedation (baseline), 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after induction of anaesthesia (Indoor Surgery Clinic, Department of Veterinary Surgery, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan). A score of (1.00 +/- 0.00) for the anesthetic parameters was observed, indicating a smooth induction, good muscular relaxation, and easy recovery at various time intervals following therapy compared to baseline before induction: the heart rate, respiration rate, rectal temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen haemoglobin saturation were substantially different (p<0.05). Throughout the observation period, there were non-significant differences in the packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration, leukocyte, granulocyte, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts (p>0.05). At various points during the observation period: the levels of serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and cortisol varied considerably (p>0.05) in comparison to 0 minutes (the baseline) prior to the induction of anesthesia. It was determined that goats underwent complete intravenous anaesthesia caused by a mixture of diazepam, propofol, and ketamine.

TI  - Sampling Volatile Organic Compounds from Individual Cotton Leaves to Test Effects of Fungal Endophyte Treatments
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
LA  - English
KW  - PLANT
AB  - Facultative fungal endophytes are unspecialized plant-associated fungi capable of colonizing plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease. Studies suggest facultative fungal endophytes enhance cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plant defense against insect herbivores and might alter emissions of volatile organic compounds. We tested for changes in emissions of volatile organic compounds using cotton plants treated with facultative fungal endophtytes Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin strain GHA and Phialemonium inflatum (Burnside) strain TAMU490 in the presence and absence of herbivory. Solid-phase micro-extraction was used to sample static headspace of individual leaves in collection chambers designed specifically for the experiment. Relative abundance of volatile organic compounds was significantly affected by herbivory, but differences caused by treatment with B. bassiana or P. inflatum were not significant. Findings showed our sampling method can be used to assess constitutive and herbivore-induced volatile organic compound profiles from individual leaves, but further studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying facultative fungal endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance in cotton.

AB  - Vertical profiles of the mass concentration of black carbon (BC) were measured at altitudes up to 5 km during the PAMARCMiP (Polar Airborne Measurements and Arctic Regional Climate Model simulation Project) aircraftbased field experiment conducted around the northern Greenland Sea (Fram Strait) during March and April 2018 from operation base Station Nord (81.6 degrees N, 16.7 degrees W). Median BC mass concentrations in individual altitude ranges were 7-18 ngm(-3) at standard temperature and pressure at altitudes below 4.5 km. These concentrations were systematically lower than previous observations in the Arctic in spring, conducted by ARCTAS-A in 2008 and NETCARE in 2015, and similar to those observed during HIPPO3 in 2010. Column amounts of BC for altitudes below 5 km in the Arctic (>66.5 degrees N; COLBC), observed during the ARCTAS-A and NETCARE experiments, were higher by factors of 4.2 and 2.7, respectively, than those of the PAMARCMiP experiment. These differences could not be explained solely by the different locations of the experiments. The year-to-year variation of COLBC values generally corresponded to that of biomass burning activities in northern midlatitudes over western and eastern Eurasia. Furthermore, numerical model simulations estimated the year-to-year variation of contributions from anthropogenic sources to be smaller than 30 %-40 %. These results suggest that the year-to-year variation of biomass burning activities likely affected BC amounts in the Arctic troposphere in spring, at least in the years examined in this study. The year-to-year variations in BC mass concentrations were also observed at the surface at high Arctic sites Ny-Alesund and Utqia.gvik (formerly known as Barrow, the location of Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory), although their magnitudes were slightly lower than those in COLBC.
   Numerical model simulations in general successfully reproduced the observed COLBC values for PAMARCMiP and HIPPO3 (within a factor of 2), whereas they markedly underestimated the values for ARCTAS-A and NETCARE by factors of 3.7-5.8 and 3.3-5.0, respectively. Because anthropogenic contributions account for nearly all of the COLBC (82 %-98 %) in PAMARCMiP and HIPPO3, the good agreement between the observations and calculations for these two experiments suggests that anthropogenic contributions were generally well reproduced. However, the significant underestimations of COLBC for ARCTAS-A and NETCARE suggest that biomass burning contributions were underestimated. In this study, we also investigated plumes with enhanced BC mass concentrations, which were affected by biomass burning emissions, observed at 5 km altitude. Interestingly, the mass-averaged diameter of BC (core) and the shell-to-core diameter ratio of BC-containing particles in the plumes were generally not very different from those in other air samples, which were considered to be mostly aged anthropogenic BC. These observations provide a useful basis to evaluate numerical model simulations of the BC radiative effect in the Arctic region in spring.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal models for human diseases are used in situations where studies cannot be carried out on humans. While animal models in biomedical research play a pivotal part in the development of new and safe treatments for humans, it is important that the animals are used in the best way and that possible refinements are considered. Pigs are often used to model humans since the two species share many anatomical and physiological characteristics. This publication describes refinements in the training technique of pigs prior to an oral glucose tolerance test, a test commonly used in diabetes research where the individual drinks a certain amount of glucose followed by blood sampling. Sharing these results with the research community will help other researchers to successfully train pigs in such studies. Animal models of human diseases are important in biomedical research. When using animals for scientific purposes, the 3Rs (replace, reduce, refine) should be considered. Refinement of animal models is essential to ensure best use of animals, which is important for ethical reasons and to retrieve reliable research data. The present publication describes improvements to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) model for pigs published in 2016. Historical data from 42 pigs were used to describe improvements in the training technique over six years. Pigs of various breeds and ages can be trained to bottle-feed glucose dissolved in water to undergo OGTT. This publication describes different tips and techniques to apply for successful training and will help researchers to minimize exclusions of pigs due to unsuccessful training. The improvements are an important contribution to the 3Rs.

AB  - Changes in 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR)-mediated neurotransmission in the hippocampus have been associated with anxiety, depression and in the mode of action of antidepressant drugs. It has been commonly accepted that whereas the dorsal pole of the hippocampus (DH) is involved in cognitive processing, the ventral pole (VH) is associated with emotional regulation. However, to date, only a few studies have directly addressed the role played by VH 5-HT1ARs in anxiety and panic processing, and their results are conflicting. Here we report that intra-VH administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, the endogenous agonist serotonin (5-HT), or the standard anxiolytic benzodiazepine midazolam impaired the acquisition of inhibitory avoidance in the elevated T-maze (ETM) of male Wistar rats, indicating an anxiolytic effect. Conversely, local injection of the 5HT1AR antagonist WAY-100635 caused the opposite effect. These results were equally found in the Vogel conflict test. None of these drugs interfered with locomotor activity in the open-field test, nor did they alter the expression of the escape response in the ETM, a defensive behavior associated with panic. Pre-injection of a subeffective dose of WAY-100635 in the VH blocked the anxiolytic effect of 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT in the Vogel test, confirming the involvement of 5-HT1AR for this behavioral effect. The effect in this test was anxiety-selective as none of the drugs affected water consumption or nociception. In conclusion, our results suggest that 5-HT1ARs in the VH play a tonic inhibitory role in anxiety processing. These receptors, however, are not involved in the regulation of panic-related escape behavior.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of incorporating silymarin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (SMCS-NPs) into semen extender on the semen quality, redox balance, enzymatic activities, apoptotic genes, and ultrastructural integrity of cryopreserved buffalo sperm. Semen samples were obtained using the artificial vagina technique from seven fertile bulls aged between 4 and 6 years. The collected semen was cryopreserved in a tris extender supplemented with varying levels of SMCS-NPs: 0 mu g/mL (SMCS-NPs0), 50 mu g/mL (SMCS-NPs50), 100 mu g/mL (SMCS-NPs100), and 200 mu g/mL (SMCS-NPs200). The inclusion of 100 mu g of SMCS-NPs in the cryopreservation media significantly improved sperm progressive motility, viability, membrane integrity, and kinematic parameters. Additionally, this concentration improved key antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide levels, and enhanced enzymatic activity in the seminal plasma compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The supplementation of SMCS-NPs notably boosted the expression of apoptotic genes like caspase 3, Bcl2, and Bax in sperm. Examination through electron microscopy revealed that enriching the cryopreservation medium with 100 <mu>g or 200 mu g of SMCS-NPs maintained the integrity of acrosome and the plasma membrane, and preserved the structural integrity of cryopreserved buffalo spermatozoa. The docking exploration revealed strong affinities for key proteins regulating apoptosis (caspase) and oxidative stress (catalase and glutathione peroxidase), emphasizing their therapeutic potential in reducing apoptosis and oxidative damage. In conclusion, supplementing the semen freezing extender with 100 mu g of SMCS-NPs improved post-thaw sperm quality.

AB  - Neurodevelopment has a "sensitive period" during which the brain is highly sensitive to experience. In this study, we used maternal separation (MS) models of male Long-Evans rats to examine whether sensitivity to stress changes after postnatal day (PND) 10, when dendritic spine density begins to increase rapidly in the CA (Cornu Ammonis)1 region of the hippocampus. We assigned littermates to three groups: early maternal separation group (EMS: MS during PND 1-9), late maternal separation group (LMS: MS during PND 10-20), and control group. During adulthood (PND 56-75, which strictly corresponds to young adulthood), LMS showed increased depression-like behaviors and decreased dendritic spine density in the CA1 hippocampal region; however, EMS did not show any such changes. Accordingly, littermates at PND 10-20 have a greater vulnerability to MS than those at PND 1-9. These findings suggest that dendritic spine formation in the hippocampus is an important factor in determining sensitivity to MS.

AB  - Respiratory diseases in pigs impact the wellbeing of animals and increase the cost of production. One of the most appropriate approaches to minimizing these negative effects is the early detection of ill animals. The use of cameras coupled with computer-based techniques could assist the early detection of physiological changes in pigs when they are beginning to become ill and prior to exhibiting clinical signs. This study consisted of two experiments that aimed to (a) evaluate the use of computer-based techniques over RGB (red, green, and blue) and thermal infrared imagery to measure heart rate and respiration rate of pigs, and (b) to investigate whether eyetemperature, heart rate and respiration rate assessed remotely could be used to identify early signs of respiratory diseases in free-moving, and group-housed growing pigs in a commercial piggery. In the first experiment, the remotely-obtained heart rate and respiration rate were compared with the measures obtained with standard methods, showing positive correlations (r = 0.61 - 0.66; p < 0.05). In the second experiment, pigs were recorded by overhead cameras and the remotely-obtained physiological measures were analysed to identify whether physiological changes could be detected in sick pigs before clinical signs were observed. The changes in eyetemperature and heart rate remotely obtained showed clear differences between sick and healthy pigs two days before clinical signs were detected. While significant changes in respiration rate occurred the day before clinical signs of illness were identified. The results of the present study indicate the possible use of computer vision technique for constant animal monitoring and rapid detection of physiological changes related to illness in commercial pigs. Further research is recommended to continue the development, automatization, and commercial practicality of this novel technology.

AB  - Despite the use of antimicrobials in livestock being reduced in recent years, they are still widely used in swine production. These therapeutic products are commonly prophylactically used via feed or water to prevent disease and maintain productive indexes, particularly during critical periods when animals usually suffer from pathogen infections, such as post-weaning colibacillosis. However, there is an urgent need to avoid using these drugs due to increased antimicrobial resistance. Different probiotics and prebiotics are effective in preventing or limiting the disease, constituting possible alternatives. Still, there is scarce information regarding the potential benefits of combining both strategies through a synbiotic approach. In this study, we hypothesize that combining short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) and live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sc 47 could turn in an effective synbiotic to fight post-weaning colibacillosis in piglets due to complementary and/or synergistic effects. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of supplementing a blend of scFOS, live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sc 47, or their combination, on the health of weanling pigs orally challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4(+). Our results show that these products' mechanism of action could be slightly different; therefore, a beneficial effect could be expected from their synbiotic supplementation.
   The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of supplementing short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) combined or not with live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sc 47 on weanling pigs challenged with Escherichia coli F4(+). We allocated ninety-six piglets to four experimental diets: control (CTR); supplemented with scFOS (5 g/kg Profeed((R)) P95) (scFOS); S. cerevisiae Sc 47 (1 g/kg Actisaf((R)) Sc 47 HR +) (YEA); or both (SYN). Parameters included: performance; E. coli F4(+) detection; fermentation activity; inflammatory biomarkers; and ileal histomorphology. Our results showed that supplementing scFOS was able to reduce the incidence of diarrhea, and both supplements were able to lower counts of EHEC along the gut. Supplementing scFOS was mostly associated with changes in the gut ecosystem and increases in the lactobacilli population, while S. cerevisiae Sc 47 registered increases in the numbers of ileal intraepithelial lymphocytes. The synbiotic mixture showed the lowest diarrhea incidence and fecal scores, benefiting from complementary modes of action and possible synergistic effects due to a hypothesized yeast-LAB cross-feeding phenomenon in the foregut. In conclusion, our results evidence that supplementing scFOS or Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sc 47 is efficacious to fight post-weaning colibacillosis, and combining both could be beneficial in high-risk scenarios.

AB  - Ethnogeology offers a longitudinal history of the formation of landscapes though the lens of First Nations Peoples. Significantly, it offers an insight into landscape change and geographical formation as consequence of geological events, climate shift (change), and consequential human resilience and adaptation strategies. This article considers a cultural landscape near Ballaarat (Ballarat) in Australia and its geological omnipresence in the eyes of the First Nations' Wadawurrung People. The features, two extinct volcanoes-Bonan Youang (Mt Buninyong) and Terrinalum (Mt Elephant)-and a connection tract, offer high cultural values to the Wadawurrung People in addition to serving as key contemporary mental and orientation landmarks arising from their roles in the locality's pastoral, goldmining, and suburbanisation colonisation phases.

AB  - Concentration of plant secondary metabolites (SMs) show seasonal variations. However, it is still not well understood how these abiotic and biotic factors influence the seasonal variations of SMs. In addition, it is of interest to know if and how SMs are reallocated to the different plant organs, in particular whether SMs are reallocated to the remaining tissues when biomass is lost, e.g., during winter. Here we used Jacobaea vulgaris, Jacobaea aquatica, two F1 and four F2 hybrids that differed in their pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) bouquet as a study system. A series of clones of these genotypes were investigated during their vegetative stage spanning 14 months in a semi-natural environment. We found that the total PA concentration in roots and shoots showed a gradual increase until the spring of the second year, whereafter it dropped substantially in shoots. The variation in PA composition due to seasonal changes was significant but relatively small. Senecionine-like PAs were the dominant PAs in roots, while jacobine-/erucifoline-like PAs were dominant in shoots. The variation of PA concentration was significantly correlated with temperature, day length, and plant age. A correlation analysis showed that PAs were not reallocated when biomass was lost in winter. Overall, our study showed that PA composition of each genotype changed over seasons in a different manner but seasonal variation did not overrule the differences in PA composition among genotypes.

AB  - Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) is a developing region characterized for its importance for global food security, producing 23 and 11% of the global beef and milk production, respectively. The region's ruminant livestock sector however, is under scrutiny on environmental grounds due to its large contribution to enteric methane (CH4) emissions and influence on global climate change. Thus, the identification of effective CH4 mitigation strategies which do not compromise animal performance is urgently needed, especially in context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) defined in the Paris Agreement of the United Nations. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to: 1) collate a database of individual sheep, beef and dairy cattle records from enteric CH4 emission studies conducted in the LAC region, and 2) perform a meta-analysis to identify feasible enteric CH4 mitigation strategies, which do not compromise animal performance. After outlier's removal, 2745 animal records (65% of the original data) from 103 studies were retained (from 2011 to 2021) in the LAC database. Potential mitigation strategies were classified into three main categories (i.e., animal breeding, dietary, and rumen manipulation) and up to three subcategories, totaling 34 evaluated strategies. A random effects model weighted by inverse variance was used (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V3.3.070). Six strategies decreased at least one enteric CH4 metric and simultaneously increased milk yield (MY; dairy cattle) or average daily gain (ADG; beef cattle and sheep). The breed composition F1 Holstein x Gyr decreased CH4 emission per MY (CH4IMilk) while increasing MY by 99%. Adequate strategies of grazing management under continuous and rotational stocking decreased CH4 emission per ADG (CH4IGain) by 22 and 35%, while increasing ADG by 22 and 71%, respectively. Increased dietary protein concentration, and increased concentrate level through cottonseed meal inclusion, decreased CH4IMilk and CH4IGain by 10 and 20% and increased MY and ADG by 12 and 31%, respectively. Lastly, increased feeding level decreased CH4IGain by 37%, while increasing ADG by 171%. The identified effective mitigation strategies can be adopted by livestock producers according to their specific needs and aid LAC countries in achieving SDG as defined in the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Leonurine (LEO), an alkaloid isolated from Leonurus spp., has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects and can prevent damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These properties suggest that it can improve the maturation rate of oocytes and developmental ability of embryos, which are key parameters in animal breeding. In this study, the effects of LEO on in vitro maturation and early embryonic development in sheep oocytes were evaluated. Among various doses examined (0, 10, 20 and 40 mu M), a dose of 20 mu M was optimal with respect to the oocyte maturation rate. Compared with estimates in the control group, GSH levels and mitochondrial membrane potential of sheep oocytes treated with 20 mu M LEO were significantly higher, and 40 mu M LEO would affect oocyte maturation. Additionally, ROS levels were significantly lower, expression levels of the antioxidant genes CAT and SOD1 were significantly higher, and there was no significant difference in GPX3 expression. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase-3 expression were significantly reduced in the 20 mu M LEO group. During early embryonic development in vitro, the cleavage rate and blastocyst rate were significantly higher in the 20 mu M LEO treatment group compared to other groups. GSH levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly higher, while ROS levels were significantly lower, and expression levels of the antioxidant genes CAT, GPX3 and SOD1 were significantly higher in eight-cell embryos treated with 20 mu M LEO than in the control group. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase-3 levels were significantly decreased. In summary, LEO can reduce the effect of oxidative stress, improve the oocyte maturation rate and enhance embryonic development.

AB  - Lamb mortality remains a significant welfare and production issue, constraining ethical and sustainable sheep production. Lamb survival benefits from early suckling and colostrum intake, while it is impaired by inclement weather. The effect of cold exposure on neonatal behaviour and progress to suckling in lambs needs to be understood to curb lamb mortality. This study used historic data to establish the relationship of neonatal lamb behaviour with cold stress and derive genetic parameters for early lamb behaviour. Data of Merino lambs from 1993 to 2002 of the Elsenburg Merino flock were assessed for birth weight (BW) and behaviour latencies (intervals in minutes), namely: from birth to first standing for > 10 sec (LTBS) as well as from standing to first suckling for > 10 sec (LTSS) in relation to a cold index (CI). The CI was derived from a combination of wind, rain, and temperature. The flock consisted of a line selected for number of lambs weaned per mating (NLW; the High or H-Line) and a line selected against NLW (Low or L-Line). Fixed linear and random cubic spline components of LTBS and LTSS on the CI and genetic parameters were derived. Overall, H-line lambs were somewhat heavier at birth and progressed faster from standing to first suckling than L-line lambs (P < 0.05). Random spline components as well as interactions of the regression variables with selection line were not significant (P > 0.05) and the analyses reduced to modelling the fixed linear component. Increased levels of cold stress resulted in faster progress in LTBS (P < 0.05). Expressed relative to mild conditions at a CI of 800 kJm(-2)h(-1), LTBS was reduced by 17.6 % on the observed scale at a higher CI of 1200 kJm(-2)h(-1) (P < 0.05). In contrast, LTSS was compromised at higher CI values (P < 0.05), increasing markedly by 76.0 % from 800 kJm(-2)h(-1) to 1200 kJm(-2)h(-1). Direct single-trait heritability estimates were 0.16 +/- 0.05 for BW, 0(.2)2 +/- 0.07 for LTBS, and 0.06 +/- 0.05 for LTSS. The inclusion of the maternal genetic variance ratio resulted in an improvement in the log-likelihood ratio for BW and LTBS, yielding single-trait estimates of 0.37 +/- 0.03 and 0.06 +/- 0.03, respectively. The single-trait dam permanent environment variance ratio was 0.09 +/- 0.03 for LTSS. Further research is required to better understand the responses to cold stress between LTBS and LTSS.

AB  - Sperm osmotic adaptability to anisosmotic conditions is important for sperm epididymal maturation, motility activation at ejaculation, and female tract colonization, or for conducting technological procedures such as cryopreservation. Several factors affect this adaptability, including the fluid composition that contributes to water flow dynamics, and the temperature at which osmotic stress is initiated. This study was designed to investigate the effect of medium composition (electrolyte- or sugar-based extender) and temperature (25 and 5 degrees C) on rabbit sperm adaptability to anisosmotic conditions. Rabbit spermatozoa, therefore, were diluted at both temperatures (25 and 5 degrees C) in electrolyte- or sugar-based media at increasing osmotic conditions (100 to 1,000 mOsm/kg), and values for sperm variables (sperm kinetics, membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential) were estimated as endpoints. Sperm kinetics seemed to be more sensitive to osmotic stress than membrane integrity or mitochondrial function. The effect of moderate hypoosmotic stress did not differ when there was use of sugar- and electrolyte-based extenders at 25 degrees C (P > 0.05). In hyper-tonic conditions at 25 degrees C, the sugar-based extender was more effective in protecting sperm membrane integrity and mitochondrial function (P < 0.05). The lesser temperature made the differences more relevant because of the detrimental effect of hypemsmotic stress was more evident in the electrolyte-based extender at 5 degrees C (P < 0.05). The results from this study indicated rabbit spermatozoa have different adaptability to anisosmotic conditions induced by sugar- and electrolyte-based media and that the temperature at which the osmotic stress is initiated affects the cellular response.

AB  - Manure is considered a by-product or organic waste in cattle, pig, chicken or other animal breeding farms, which can be a valuable product as compost or feedstock for biogas production. The production of biomethane from biogas always copes with the formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a by-product. This CO2 may be recycled through the feedstock as a pretreatment to maximize homogeneity, and improve biogas yield and biogas quality. The CO2-pretreatment process of cow manure (CoM), chicken manure (ChM) and pig manure (PM) was performed in the continuously fed agitated reactor at 25 degrees C temperature and ambient barometric pressure. Biogas yield and composition exploration were performed in an anaerobic continuous feeding digester with controlled mesophilic (37 degrees C) environmental conditions. The CO2 pretreated PM, CoM and ChM yielded 234.62 +/- 10.93 L/kg(VS), 82.01 +/- 3.19 L/kg(VS) and 374.53 +/- 9.27 L/kg(VS) biomethane from feedstock volatile solids, respectively. The biomethane yield from CO2 pretreated CoM, ChM and PM achieved was higher over untreated manure by +33.78%, +28.76% and +21.78%, respectively. The anaerobic digestion process of tested feedstocks was stable, and the pH of the substrate was kept steady at a pH of CoM 7.77 +/- 0.02, PM 8.07 +/- 0.02 and ChM 8.09 +/- 0.02 during all the experiment. The oxidation-reduction potential after pretreatment was within the optimal range (-255 +/- 39.0 to -391 +/- 16.8 mV) for anaerobic digestion. This process also had a positive effect on the energy generated from the feedstock, with ChM showing the greatest increase, from 2.38 MJ/kg to 3.06 MJ/kg.

AB  - Brazil is the world's largest producer of soybeans, and the crop is one of the most important contributors to the economy. Soybeans often suffer damage from insect pests, such as Anticarsia gemmatalis, which also attacks other crops. Genotypes of soybeans have been used to decipher the resistance mechanisms by evaluating the activity of defense compounds such as protease inhibitors (PIs) and flavonols. However, the genetic determinants of resistance have not been thoroughly investigated. This study used the response of resistant and susceptible genotypes of soybean to evaluate genes and proteins responsive to caterpillar attack and involved in the biosynthesis of methylated and glycosylated flavonols. Rutin and isorhamnetin rutinoside were produced constitutively in the resistant genotypes IAC 17 and IAC 100. Following insect attack, genes encoding flavonol synthase and methyltransferases were highly upregulated in IAC 17. Some herbivory defense responses appear constitutive, while others were induced or JA-independent, as verified for flavonol levels. Salicylic acid levels were higher in IAC 17 and IAC 100. Proteins not yet characterized for their involvement in plant-insect interactions, such as transmembrane receptors and transcription factors, were upregulated in the resistant genotype IAC 17. It appears constitutive flavonol biosynthesis in both IAC 17 and IAC 100 was inherited from the PI229358 parent, making the two genotypes good genetic sources to study flavonol biosynthesis and their relationship with insect resistance.

AB  - Plants exhibit various defense mechanisms against pathogens and herbivores, which are induced by pathogen/herbivore-derived elicitors. Ascogaster reticulata (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is an egg-larval parasitoid of the smaller tea tortrix moth Adoxophyes honmai (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), a serious pest moth of tea plants. In tea plants, egg deposition by A. honmai induces tea leaves to arrest A. reticulata. In a previous study, homogenate of the whole reproductive system from female moths showed elicitor activity that induced tea plant responses. The present study aimed to understand the elicitor-mediated interactions among the tea plant, A. honmai moth, and A. reticulata parasitoid to clarify the elicitor-secreting organs and characterize the elicitors. Investigation of elicitor activity that induced tea leaves to arrest parasitoids in leaves treated with homogenates of each organ of the reproductive system revealed the elicitor activity only in leaves treated with the homogenates of accessory glands, but not those of other organs. Furthermore, proteinase treatment of accessory gland homogenates resulted in loss of elicitor activity. These results suggest that elicitors derived from egg deposition by A. honmai, which induce tea leaves to arrest parasitoids, are proteinaceous compounds specifically contained in the accessory glands of female moths. Our findings contribute to identifying the elicitors and the application of biological control in tea fields.

AB  - Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is one of the most important and consumed vegetables worldwide both in fresh and processed form. Among the main pests, the South American tomato pinworm (Tuta absoluta Meyrick, Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) stands out as one that causes great damage to its production. Control is based essentially on intensive chemical applications which increases the production cost, besides promoting ecological imbalances and possible health problems for consumers and farmers. Among the plant defense mechanisms against herbivores pests are the glandular trichomes and their secondary metabolites that together can be poisonous, repellent, or trap insects and other organisms. In order to develop a resistant cultivar to T. absoluta, we introgressed a trichome-based resistance trait from the wild tomato (Solanum pennellii) into cultivated tomato. The wild tomato has the type IV glandular trichomes, the major site of biosynthesis for acylsugars, which have been consistently linked to broad-spectrum resistance to herbivorous arthropods of tomato. The backcross genotypes (F2BC2) come from a cross between the species S. pennellii access LA-716 (donor genome with high acylsugar content) and the commercial cultivar S. lycopersicum cv. Redencao (background genome with low acylsugar content). Eight genotypes with high recovery of the background genome were selected to identify and quantify the glandular and non-glandular trichomes as well as to assess their resistance to the T. absoluta. Direct correlations between the acylsugar content, number of type IV glandular trichomes and resistance to the South American tomato pinworm were observed, indicating that the desired trait from S. pennellii is inherited throughout the backcrosses. Two groups were formed among the analyzed genotypes: high and low levels of acylsugars. In the high-level group, the higher acylsugar content led to a better control of the pinworm in a similar way to the wild parent (resistant). The overall analysis of our data shows that the genotypes RVTA-2010pl#232 and RVTA-2010pl#257 have the greatest potential to develop tomato lines with desirable commercial traits for the processing industry besides resistance to the South American tomato pinworm.

AB  - Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid peptide hormone that impacts a wide range of biological processes, including appetite regulation, glucose metabolism, growth hormone regulation, and cognitive function. To bind and activate its cognate receptor, ghrelin must be acylated on a serine residue in a post-translational modification performed by ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT). GOAT is a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) responsible for the catalysis of the addition of an octanoyl fatty acid to the third serine of desacyl ghrelin. Beyond its canonical role for ghrelin maturation in endocrine cells within the stomach, GOAT was recently reported to be overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and detected at increased levels in the serum and urine of PCa patients. This suggests GOAT can serve as a potential route for the detection and therapeutic targeting of PCa and other diseases that exhibit GOAT overexpression. Building upon a ghrelin mimetic peptide with nanomolar affinity for GOAT, we developed an antibody-conjugate-inspired system for customizable ligand-conjugate (LC) synthesis allowing for the attachment of a wide range of cargoes. The developed synthetic scheme allows for the easy synthesis of the desired LCs and demonstrates that our ligand system tolerates an extensive palette of cargoes while maintaining nanomolar affinity against GOAT.

AB  - Haemonchus contortus is considered the most pathogenic nematode in sheep production systems based on grazing. Comparing infective larvae (L-3) with adult parasites can lead to the identification of proteins that play an important role in parasite-host interactions. In this study, we report a list of H. contortus somatic proteins and made a comparative analysis of somatic proteins of L-3 and adult worms. L-3 and adult parasites were subjected to protein extraction and subsequently to peptide fractionation. Peptides were analysed by mass spectrometry and LC-MS/MS data analysis. Data analysis and search on SEQUEST and MASCOT against H. contortus from the WormBase ParaSite database resulted in the identification of 775 unique peptide sequences corresponding to 227 proteins at 1 % FDR. From these, 18 proteins were specific to L-3 and 63 to adult parasites. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the proteins specific to L-3 and adult worms to gain insight into cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes that affect the parasite-host interaction showed some differences between the two parasite stages. The list of proteins found provides a database to identify target proteins that could be useful as biomarkers of the infection or in the generation of anthelmintic drugs that inhibit proteins essential for the establishment of the infection and the survival of adult parasites. They can also serve as new candidates for vaccine research.

AB  - Follicular ovarian cysts (FOCs) are prevalent reproductive disorders in both humans and animals, especially in livestock, where they cause economic losses by reducing fertility and productivity. FOCs are marked by a dominant follicle that fails to ovulate, disrupting the estrous cycle and reproductive efficiency. Previous studies indicate that the follicular fluid (FF) in cystic ovaries shows oxidative imbalance, affecting oocyte quality by altering glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) and selenium pathways. However, the metabolic profile of FF in cystic ovaries needs further exploration. This study examined oxidative stress and metabolic changes in FOC pathogenesis. Using untargeted metabolomics of goat FF, we found significant differences in 12,741 metabolites between cystic and control FF. Cystic FF had reduced levels of alpha-tocopherol and 8 '-apocaroten-8 '-ol, key for oxidative stress management, and increased levels of mycotoxins (e.g., Deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside) and long-chain fatty acids. Adding 200 mu M alpha-tocopherol to FOC FF oocyte cultures doubled oocyte maturation rates and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Metabolomic analysis linked low alpha-tocopherol to high lipid peroxyl radicals and low glutathione oxidation, emphasizing oxidative stress regulation's importance in the follicular microenvironment. Our findings suggest that alpha-tocopherol may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic agent to enhance oocyte maturation in FOCs.

AB  - Bee species interact differently with flowers, playing different roles in pollination. For gynodioecious plant populations, which consist of two sexes (female-non-pollen-producing flowers and hermaphroditic flowers), bee-flower interactions also have ecological implications, including the maintenance of females. We evaluated bee performance on a gynodioecious globose cactus, Coryphantha elephantidens, to determine how bees interact with different sexes and if they visit and pollinate them differently. We recorded videos of visits to both hermaphroditic and female flowers (n = 26 flowers of each sex). From these videos, we registered and analyzed bee visitation rate, handling time, and behavior using non-parametric models, generalized linear models, and chi-squared tests. Our findings revealed 15 species of visiting bees, with the most frequent being Augochlorines (59%), Ashmeadiella opuntiae (21%), and Apis mellifera (13%). Augochlorines were focused on collecting pollen and rarely touched stigmas, while A. mellifera promoted self-pollination, as they contacted stigmas after contacting the stamens. The solitary bee A. opuntiae emerged as the most effective pollinator, promoting cross-pollination by visiting both sexes with equal frequency. Since both sexes of C. elephantidens lack nectar and female flowers lack pollen, we suggest that female flowers are pollinated by deceit. This cactus species exhibits functional specialization, as only three bee species significantly contribute to pollination. Although the other remaining bees are not effective pollinators, their presence suggests this cactus is an important host for a wide variety of wild bees.

AB  - Members of the diverse heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family play crucial roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin-binding patterns, likely due to interactions with various specificity factors. Previously, we showed that the chromatin-binding pattern of the HP1 protein Rhino, a crucial factor of the Drosophila PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, is largely defined by a DNA sequence-specific C2H2 zinc finger protein named Kipferl (Baumgartner et al., 2022). Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between Rhino and its guidance factor Kipferl. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and in vivo genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhino's chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but disrupts the interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the rhino(G31D) mutation phenocopy kipferl mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of rhino(G31D) flies. Thus, Rhino's chromodomain functions as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.

AB  - Seed oils are used as edible oils and increasingly also for industrial applications. Although high-oleic seed oil is preferred for industrial use, most seed oil is high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and low in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) such as oleic acid. Oil from Camelina, an emerging oilseed crop with a high seed oil content and resistance to environmental stress, contains 60% PUFAs and 30% MUFAs. Hexaploid Camelina carries three homoeologs of FAD2, encoding fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2), which is responsible for the synthesis of linoleic acid from oleic acid. In this study, to increase the MUFA contents of Camelina seed oil, we generated CsFAD2 knockout plants via CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing using the pRedU6fad2EcCas9 vector containing DsRed as a selection marker, the U6 promoter to drive a single guide RNA (sgRNA) covering the common region of the three CsFAD2 homoeologs, and an egg-cell-specific promoter to drive Cas9 expression. We analyzed CsFAD2 homoeolog-specific sequences by PCR using genomic DNA from transformed Camelina leaves. Knockout of all three pairs of FAD2 homoeologs led to a stunted bushy phenotype, but greatly enhanced MUFA levels (by 80%) in seeds. However, transformants with two pairs of CsFAD2 homoeologs knocked out but the other pair wild-type heterozygous showed normal growth and a seed MUFAs production increased up to 60%. These results provide a basis for the metabolic engineering of genes that affect growth in polyploid crops through genome editing.

AB  - Salinity affects the yield and quality of oilseed crops. The effects of a single foliar application of solutions with different concentrations (0, 30, 60 or 90 mu M) of melatonin (MEL) to camelina (Camelina sativa) plants grown in soil in a greenhouse and irrigated at four salinity levels (0.5, 4, 8 and 16 dS m(-1)) were assessed. Increasing salinity decreased leaf chlorophyll and photosynthetic rates, decreased K concentrations and increased Na concentrations in roots and shoots, and increased oxidative marker levels and the activity of protective antioxidant enzymes in leaves. Under severe salinity stress, the MEL90 treatment resulted in increases in chlorophyll, gas exchange attributes, leaf antioxidant enzyme activities, and decreases in leaf oxidative markers and Na. Salinity decreased seed yield, with no seeds being produced at salinities above 8 dS m(-1). The MEL90 treatment resulted in increases in seed yield and poly- and mono-unsaturated fatty acid contents and decreases in saturated fatty acid contents. The MEL90 treatment was more effective in alleviating salinity effects than those including lower MEL concentrations. The highest concentrations of K and K/Na ratios were observed with the MEL90 treatment under non-stressed conditions. Data suggest that MEL foliar applications could increase salinity stress tolerance in camelina.

AB  - Insect herbivores face multiple challenges to their ability to grow and reproduce. Plants can produce a series of defenses that disrupt and damage the herbivore digestive system, which are heightened upon injury by insect feeding. Additionally, insects face threats from virulent microorganisms that can incur their own set of potential costs to hosts. Microorganisms that invade through the digestive system may function in concert with defenses generated by plants, creating combined assailments on host insects. In our study, we evaluated how tomato defenses interact with an enteric bacterial isolate, Serratia marcescens, in the corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea). We performed bioassays using different tomato cultivars that were induced by methyl jasmonate and larvae orally inoculated with a S. marcescens isolate. Untreated corn earworm larval mortality was low on constitutive tomato, while larvae inoculated with S. marcescens exhibited > 50% mortality within 5 days. Induction treatments elevated both control mortality (similar to 45%) and in combination with S. marcescens (> 95%). Larvae also died faster when encountering induced defenses and Serratia. Using a tomato mutant, foliar polyphenol oxidase activity likely had stronger impacts on S. marcescens-mediated larval mortality. Induction treatments also elevated the number of bacterial colony-forming units in the hemolymph of larvae inoculated with Serratia. Larval mortality by S. marcescens was low (< 10%) on artificial diets. Our results demonstrate that plant chemical defenses enhance larval mortality from an opportunistic gut microbe. We propose that the combined damage from both the plant and microbial agent overwhelm the herbivore to increase mortality rates and expedite host death.

AB  - The Enemy Release Hypothesis posits that invasive plants in secondary ranges are freed from phytophage pressure, yet local phytophages may adapt to these invasive species over time. This study investigated the dietary preferences of Altica oleracea in relation to three native (Chamaenerion angustifolium (L.) Scop., Epilobium montanum L., and E. hirsutum L.) and three invasive (E. adenocaulon Hausskn., Oenothera biennis L., Oe. rubricaulis Kleb.) plant species from the Onagraceae family. A neural network was employed to automate the calculation of leaf damage area for assessing the phytophagous insects' dietary preferences. A. oleracea demonstrated a pronounced preference for Chamaenerion angustifolium compared to other Onagraceae species, irrespective of their invasive status. Among imago, no significant preference was observed between native and invasive Epilobium species or between two Oenothera species. However, the larvae were more discerning and avoided Oe. biennis, rearing on which led to the least weight gain by larvae. The adult beetles' inability to differentiate between plants unsuitable for larvae could lead to an evolutionary trap. The prevalence of Wolbachia infection in the A. oleracea population may influence the further evolution of adaptability to invasive species and the formation of dietary preferences.

AB  - The defense mechanisms that plants have developed in response to herbivory can be chemical, physical, or morphological, which, acting alone or combined, can reduce the damage caused by insects. In this study, the morphogenetic traits capable of attributing resistance to common bean cultivars to Diabrotica speciosa were analyzed, which will serve as a basis for use in the organic system and serving as parents to compose variability in breeding programs. The susceptibility and resistance of cultivars to D. speciosa were determined through tests of feed preference no-choice and free-choice and preference for consumption, the enzymatic activity of CAT, POD, and SOD, expression of PvbZIP1, PvWHIRLY3 and PvNPR1 genes, analysis of morphological and chemical components of the plant. The studied morphogenetic components showed insect-plant interaction, where the cultivars, in response to damage caused by D. speciosa increased enzyme activity and expression of defense genes. Trichomes in the abaxial surfaces of the leaves, and phosphorus content demonstrated a negative correlation with the feed preference and consumption by D. speciosa. The resistance of the cultivars to D. speciosa was also correlated with nitrogen, sugar, and chlorophyll content since they can modify the plant's chemical composition and increase resistance to herbivory. Morphogenetic analysis indicates that BRS Esplendor and IPR Curio has traits providing greater susceptibility, while IPR Uirapuru and IPR Tangara present features bringing greater resistance to D. speciosa. Therefore, they are promising genotypes for cultivation in an organic system and as parents to compose variability for breeding programs, research development, and selection to resist D. speciosa or other herbivorous insects.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria present in yogurts produce bioactive compounds, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Sheep's milk yogurt is an excellent medium to enhance their bioactive properties. In this study, the impact of adding an extract derived from the GABA-producing strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UCLM56 to sheep's milk yogurt was evaluated in terms of its bioactive and antioxidant properties. Samples were subjected to in vitro digestion and fermentation to simulate the effects of the gastrointestinal tract. GABA, SCFAs, amino acids, biogenic amines, antioxidant capacity, and organic acid levels were analyzed. Yogurt enriched with UCLM56 postbiotic extract showed higher levels of GABA and propionic acid, with increases of more than 360 and 260%, respectively, along with an improved antioxidant capacity (FRAP and DPPH methods) compared to conventional yogurt. After in vitro fermentation, the levels of lactic and propionic acids were significantly higher in the enriched yogurt (50 and 41% increases, respectively), as well as the antioxidant capacity (more than 200% improvement). In conclusion, the use of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UCLM56 extract enhances the bioactive properties of sheep's milk yogurt, making it a promising option for developing functional dairy products with added value.

AB  - Simple Summary The death of endometrial cells induced by bacterial infections can result in damage to the endometrial function. In this study, we investigated the potential role of necroptosis in Staphylococcus aureus-induced goat endometrial epithelial cell (gEEC) death. We found that S. aureus induced gEECs RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis, triggered mainly by membrane disruption and ion imbalance. Moreover, gEEC necroptosis contributed to the regulation of reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial damage. These provide evidence of the involvement of necroptosis in the S. aureus-induced gEEC death. Endometrial cell death is induced by bacterial infection, resulting in damage to the physical barriers and immune function. An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of endometrial epithelial cell necroptosis might provide new insights into the treatment of uterine diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Staphylococcus aureus on goat endometrial epithelial cell (gEEC) necroptosis, and the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that S. aureus induced significant necroptosis in gEECs by increasing the expression of key proteins of the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL axis; importantly, this effect was alleviated by inhibitors of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. Moreover, we found that the main triggers of gEEC necroptosis induced by S. aureus were not the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), but membrane disruption and ion imbalance. Moreover, we observed a significant decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating mitochondrial damage, in addition to increased cytochrome c levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in S. aureus-infected gEECs; these, effects were also suppressed by the inhibitors of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. Taken together, these data revealed the molecular mechanism of S. aureus-induced gEEC necroptosis and provided potential new targeted therapies for clinical intervention in bacterial infections.

AB  - Simple Summary: Growth and meat production traits are significant economic traits in pigs. In this study, we investigated the differences in phenotypic traits as well as the genes and pathways affecting meat production traits in individuals from Duroc x Bama Xiang F2 crossbred pigs with different growth rates. The regulatory relationships between genes and meat production traits were explored by utilizing whole transcriptome sequencing technology and ceRNA regulatory network analysis. The results of this study provide a reference for the genetic basis analysis of porcine meat production traits. The meat production traits of pigs are influenced by the expression regulation of multiple gene types, including mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. To study the differences in meat production traits at the transcriptional level among individuals with different growth rates, the longissimus dorsi samples from eight Duroc x Bama Xiang F2 crossbred pigs with a fast growth rate (high gTroup) or a slow growth rate (low group) were selected to perform whole transcriptome sequencing and ceRNA regulatory network construction. This study first analyzed the differences in physiological and biochemical indicators, muscle histological characteristics, and muscle fiber types. A total of 248 mRNAs, 25 miRNAs, and 432 lncRNAs were identified as differentially expressed by whole transcriptome sequencing. Key genes that may influence meat production traits include MTMR14, PPP1R3A, PYGM, PGAM2, MYH1, and MYH7. The ceRNA regulatory network map showed that ENSSSCG00000042061-ssc-mir-208b-MYH7, ENSSSCG00000042223-ssc-mir-146a-MTMR14, ENSSSCG00000045539-ssc-mir-9-3-MYH1, and ENSSSCG00000047852-ssc-mir-103-1-PPP1R3A may be the key factors affecting meat production traits through their regulatory relationships. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying porcine muscle development and can aid in improving meat production traits.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Modern society is paying more attention to the quality of meat and its production system. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the possibility of using a native pig breed-Zlotnicka Spotted. This breed's popularity has increased in Poland as it may be a good source of valuable meat. Compared to the meat frompigs of the same breed following intensive fattening, the meat from free-range pigs extensively fed on silage and small amounts of acorns is characterized by a higher content of fat, which acts as a carrier for flavor and, indirectly, juiciness. Moreover, rearing systems with traditional feeding, e.g., with the use of acorns, may have a positive effect on meat quality, dietetic value, and, therefore, consumer acceptance of the product.
   The popularity of meat from animals of native breeds is growing all over the world, due to consumer belief regarding its higher quality compared to meat from industrial farm animals. In addition, the living conditions (welfare) are of great importance for consumers. We observed the effect of different ways of keeping and feeding pigs of the same conservative breed on the quality of meat and its health benefits. The aim of the study was to compare the meat quality from pigs of the native Zlotnicka Spotted breed, fattened intensively or extensively (with conventional farm-produced compound feed and acorns). The meat from free-range pigs extensively fed on silage and small amounts of acorns was characterized by a higher content of fat, which acts as a carrier for flavor and juiciness, as well as higher monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content (p <= 0.05) and lower atherogenic, thrombogenic, and peroxidability indices (p <= 0.05). It may be stated that the meat quality of the native pig breed is significantly dependent on the housing and feeding method. A more beneficial effect on the quality of meat and its dietetic value, as well as its susceptibility to rancidity, can be obtained throughextensive pig feeding with roughage and the addition of acorns.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an economically important crop that plays an important role not only in the beverage industry but also in the pharmaceutical industry. The environment has a great influence on the quality of the tea plant. Heat shock factors (Hsfs) are transcriptional regulators that control the plant response to adversity. However, only a limited number of studies have reported the Hsf gene in Camellia sinensis, and most of these reports involve high-temperature, drought, and salt stress. Research on light, dark, and cold stress is limited. In this study, 22 CsHsf genes were obtained by whole genome sequencing and found to be located on 11 chromosomes. In addition, the gene structure, protein motif, and phylogeny were studied. We classified the genes into three major subfamilies: CsHsfA, CsHsfB, and CsHsfC. Interestingly, we found that there was more alignment between CsHsf and Hsf genes in dicotyledons, including Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum, than in the monocotyledon Oryza sativa. The expression of many CsHsf genes was affected by low-temperature, light, and dark abiotic stresses. Notably, CsHsf15 and CsHsf16 showed high induction rates under both light and cold stress, and both genes carried cis-acting elements associated with light and low-temperature responses. These results lay a solid groundwork for further investigations into the involvement of CsHsf genes in the response of Camellia sinensis to abiotic stresses.

AB  - Piercing/sucking insects such as green peach aphid (GPA) (Myzus persicae) cause direct damage by obtaining phloem nutrients and indirect damage by spreading plant viruses. To investigate the response of peach trees (Prunus persica) to aphids, the leaf transcriptome and metabolome of two genotypes with different sensitivities to GPA were studied. The gene expression of aphid-susceptible plants infested with aphids was similar to that of control plants, whereas the gene expression of aphid-resistant plants infested with aphids showed strong induced changes in gene expression compared with control plants. Furthermore, gene transcripts in defense-related pathways, including plant-pathogen interaction, MAPK signaling, and several metabolic pathways, were strongly enriched upon aphid infestation. Untargeted secondary metabolite profiling confirmed that aphid infestation induced larger changes in aphid-resistant than in aphid-susceptible peaches. Consistent with transcriptomic alterations, nine triterpenoids showed highly significant GPA-induced accumulation in aphid-resistant peaches, whereas triterpenoid abundance remained predominantly unchanged or undetected in aphid-susceptible peaches. Furthermore, some types of transcription factors (including WRKYs, ERFs, and NACs) were strongly induced upon GPA infestation in aphid-resistant, but not in aphid-susceptible peaches. These results suggested that the accumulation of specialized triterpenoids and the corresponding pathway transcripts may play a key role in peach GPA resistance.
   Transcriptome analysis and metabolic profiling suggest a key role of a group of triterpenoids in the defense response of peach under Myzus persicae infestation.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the standardized ileal digestible tryptophan-to-lysine (SID Trp-Lys) ratio through the supplementation of different levels of L-tryptophan on pig performance and immune response following an LPS challenge. A total of 120 entire male pigs, with an average body weight of 16.5 +/- 0.50 kg, were allocated in a randomized block design with four treatments, ten replicates per treatment, and three animals per experimental unit. The experimental treatments consisted of SID Trp-Lys ratios of 16%, 18%, 21%, and 24%, achieved through L-tryptophan supplementation. The evaluated performance parameters included the final body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Blood samples were collected on day 21 to determine serum serotonin levels, and on day 26, pigs were inoculated with LPS to induce an immune challenge, followed by blood sampling to assess cytokine responses. The results showed that pigs fed the 16% SID Trp-Lys ratio exhibited a lower FBW (p < 0.05). The SID Trp-Lys ratios influenced performance parameters, with quadratic responses (p < 0.05) observed for the FBW and FCR, where the highest FBW and lowest FCR were recorded at 22.05% and 21% SID Trp-Lys, respectively. A linear increase (p < 0.05) was observed for ADG, with a trend for a linear increase (p = 0.056) in ADFI. No effects (p > 0.10) of the SID Trp-Lys ratios were detected on serum serotonin levels. An increase in cytokine levels (GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and TNF-alpha) was observed in pigs challenged with LPS (p < 0.10) compared to non-challenged animals. An interaction effect (p < 0.10) was detected for IL-2 and IL-18. SID Trp-Lys ratios between 21% and 24% optimize growth performance in pigs from 16 to 33 kg and modulate the immune response under LPS-induced challenge conditions.

AB  - Plants have evolved diverse mechanisms to cope with damages caused by insect herbivores. Proteomics can greatly contribute to the understanding of plant changes in response to herbivory. Here, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used in a comparative proteomics approach to survey responses of pistachio seedlings to herbivory of the nymphal stages of the common pistachio psylla. Protein spots (similar to 360) were reproducibly detected on each gel that led to the identification of 24 differentially expressed proteins via nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). The identified proteins were involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis, signaling, protein folding, homeostasis, apoptotic processes, and stress response. Pyrophosphatase 6, controlled tumor protein, ferritin1, succinate dehydrogenase 1-1 were the proteins reported for the first time in response to herbivory. It seems that increased growth rate is a major strategy against herbivory stress of the psylla. The results of this study provide valuable information for understanding plants-herbivores interaction.

AB  - Purposeful manipulation of biological control programs, such as timed releases of biological control agents, can be ephemeral and difficult to expand into new areas impacted by the targeted invasive plant. Integration of chemical ecology through attractive semiochemical lures to aggregate biological control agents to un-colonized areas can help mitigate this challenge. The invasive air potato vine, Dioscorea bulbifera L., is native to Asia and Africa with invasive infestations in the southeastern United States, Hawai'i, and Puerto Rico. In 2011, a host specific biological control agent, Lilioceris cheni (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), was introduced to manage D. bulbifera. Synthetic and racemic blends of previously identified attractive herbivory induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), ocimene and farnesene, were first evaluated for antennal response through electroantennography, then deployed as potential attractive lures in field conditions. Electroantennogram results validated the ability of adult male and female L. cheni to detect the two compounds. When used in field conditions, adult L. cheni beetles showed increased response to plants with ocimene and farnesene lures compared to control plants. The chemically enhanced lures increased L. cheni adult densities on D. bulbifera plants in the field compared to control plants. Plants with higher densities of L. cheni had greater direct herbivore feeding damage and observed cupped leaves, indicating the presence of oviposition and future larval development. The information gathered in this study indicated that the use of attractant semiochemical lures to purposefully aggregate and direct movement of biological control agents can improve the efficacy of invasive plant biocontrol programs.

AB  - Cysteine-rich polycomb-like (CPP) is a small gene family in plants, which plays key role in plant development and stress response. Although CPP transcription factors have been characterized in several other plant species, a genome-wide characterization of the CPP gene family has been absent in Camellia sinensis. In this study, we totally identified 7, 8, and 8 non-redundant CsCPP genes in three published genomes, including Camellia sinensis var. assamica cv. Yunkang-10 (CSA-YK10), Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cv. Biyun (CSS-BY) and Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cv. Shuchazao (CSS-SCZ). CPP proteins from tea tree and other plant species were classified into three groups, which were further divided into four subgroups based on phylogenetic relationships. Most CPP genes in the same subgroup had similar gene structures and conserved motifs. The cis-acting elements analysis indicated that CPP genes might be involved in plant growth, development and stress responses. Analysis of gene expression using qRT-PCR experiments validated that CPP genes exhibited different expression patterns across the examined tissues. All the genes were expressed differentially in a range of tissues, indicating that CPPs were involved in a range of developmental and physiological processes. This study has obtained new insights into the evolution and function of the CPP gene family in the growth and development of tea plants, and also provide candidate genes for further functional characterization in tea tree.

AB  - Ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions are an environmental issue associated with animal manure management. Concrete, practical, and economic solutions are needed for farmers and other stakeholders around the globe to solve this issue. Decreasing slurry pH with the help of acids or other compounds is a well-documented technique to reduce ammonia and methane emissions from slurry. However, the effect of manure acidification on N2O emissions is still not clear. Recently, acidifying agents other than the previously used mineral acids have been tested such as e.g. organic acids, bio-waste materials, and microbial inoculations. However, the effectiveness of these acidifying agents in reducing the slurry pH and mitigation of gaseous emissions further needs to be reviewed. Also, the effectiveness of acidification in combination with other manure treatments such as composting, solid-liquid separation, and anaerobic digestion requires consideration in whole-system solutions. Here, recent studies have been compiled and reviewed to determine the applicability of acidification options for slurry management to deepen our understanding of the environmental impact of slurry acidification. The literature review revealed that temperature fluctuations have a substantial impact on the acidified slurry's performance during storage. A viable substitute for conventional mineral acids could be organic acids and biomaterials like sugars whey, and microbes. Furthermore, apple pulp, sugar beet molasses, and grass silage are examples of bio-waste products that exhibit promise as acidifying agents. However, to gain a better understanding of the viability and usefulness of the recently evaluated acidifying compounds, more research is still required.

AB  - Understanding the molecular mechanism of the cold response is critical to improve horticultural plant cold tolerance. Here, we documented the physiological, transcriptome, proteome, and hormonal dynamics to cold stress in temperate genotype (Tg) and subtropical genotype (Sg) populations of Camellia japonica. Tg C. japonica suffered minimal osmotic and oxidative damage compared to Sg C. japonica under the same cold treatment. Transcriptional and translational differences increased under the cold treatment, indicating that Tg C. japonica was affected by the environment and displayed both conserved and divergent mechanisms. About 60% of the genes responding to cold had similar dynamics in the two populations, but 1,896 transcripts and 455 proteins differentially accumulated in response to the cold between Tg and Sg C. japonica. Co-expression analysis showed that the ribosomal protein and genes related to photosynthesis were upregulated in Tg C. japonica, and tryptophan, phenylpropanoid, and flavonoid metabolism were regulated differently between the two populations under cold stress. The divergence of these genes reflected a difference in cold responsiveness. In addition, the decrease in the abscisic acid (ABA)/gibberellic acid (GA) ratio regulated by biosynthetic signal transduction pathway enhanced cold resistance in Tg C. japonica, suggesting that hormones may regulate the difference in cold responsiveness. These results provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of cold stress and will improve cold tolerance in horticultural plants.

AB  - Based on increases in reported cases of tick-borne illnesses, expanding ranges of native ticks, and repeated documentation of arrivals of nonnative tick species, there is a clear need for their effective management in the United States. Synthetic acaricides have proven efficacious in tick management, but real/perceived negative impacts to the environment and nontarget, beneficial insects must be addressed. We sought to determine whether late fall synthetic acaricide application, when most susceptible beneficial insects are presumably dormant or have migrated, could effectively manage host-seeking spring Ixodes scapularis Say abundances as compared to traditional spring application. We compared results of delivery of Demand CS (lambda-cyhalothrin) via truck-mounted high-pressure spray and powered backpack blower as well as delivery of granular Demand G to experimental control (water) in peridomestic habitats in fall 2021, spring 2022, and combined fall 2021/spring 2022. High-pressure fall delivery of Demand CS and backpack delivery of Demand G significantly reduced host-seeking adult I. scapularis abundances within-season and the following spring combined by 100% and 94%, respectively. No host-seeking nymphal I. scapularis were documented in spring after fall only, spring only, or fall and spring combined delivery of Demand CS via high-pressure or powered backpack blower. No adult I. scapularis were documented at any time posttreatment on locations that received high-pressure delivery of Demand CS. We conclude that high-pressure delivery of Demand CS in late fall successfully eliminated multiple stages of host-seeking I. scapularis through the following spring while likely limiting exposure of beneficial insects to synthetic pyrethroids.

AB  - Simple Summary An understanding of the mechanisms involved in the nutritional regulation of the ovulation rate would increase sheep productivity and would improve animal feeding strategies and environmental footprints. The interaction of the metabolic axis controlling energy balance and the reproductive axis occurs at central and peripheric levels, ultimately signaling their influence directly in the reproductive tract. Growth Hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factors (IGF), and insulin are major peripheric players in this linkage. In addition to controlling energy homeostasis, their specific roles in modulating reproduction efficiency are unclear because they are functionally associated. Based on a single administration of long-acting bST, this study used a model that increased blood concentrations of IGF and kept basal that of insulin to assess, during an annual reproductive cycle, the effect of bST on terminal follicular development and oocyte competence for fertility. Results show that bST increased the number of lambs born from each ovulatory-sized follicle only during the breeding season, without affecting any other clinical marker. This model and the information gathered by this study allow a precise search for the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect.Abstract The study aimed to assess the effect of long-acting bST treatment, in a dose that only increases IGF-I plasma concentrations, on ovarian and fertility markers of estrous synchronized ewes that were fed to keep their bodyweight. Three experiments were designed to evaluate this effect: in Experiment 1, 18 ewes were distributed in groups (bST 0, 30, 50 mg) to measure plasma IGF-I and insulin for 15 days; in Experiment 2, 92 ewes (5 replicates) in two groups (0 and 30 mg bST) were synchronized using a 6-day progesterone protocol during the breeding season to assess the effect of bST on follicular and luteal performances, estrous and ovulation, and fertility after mating. In Experiment 3, 50 ewes (3 replicates) were used to repeat the study before but during anestrus. Results indicate that 50 mg bST increased IGF-I and insulin plasma concentrations, but 30 mg bST only increased IGF-I concentrations; and that only during the breeding season did 30 mg bST increase the number of lambs born and the reproductive success of ovulatory-sized follicles compared to controls. This occurred without it affecting any other reproductive marker. In conclusion, 30 mg bST treatment may improve oocyte competence for fertility during the breeding season.

AB  - Introduction: The primary metabolism of plants, which is mediated by nitrogen, is closely related to the defense response to insect herbivores.Methods: An experimental system was established to examine how nitrogen mediated tomato resistance to an insect herbivore, the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis). All tomatoes were randomly assigned to the suitable nitrogen (control, CK) treatment, nitrogen excess (NE) treatment and nitrogen deficiency (ND) treatment.Results: We found that nitrogen excess significantly increased the aboveground biomass of tomato and increased the pupal biomass of B. dorsalis. Metabolome analysis showed that nitrogen excess promoted the biosynthesis of amino acids in healthy fruits, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), arginine and asparagine. GABA was not a differential metabolite induced by injury by B. dorsalis under nitrogen excess, but it was significantly induced in infested fruits at appropriate nitrogen levels. GABA supplementation not only increased the aboveground biomass of plants but also improved the defensive response of tomato.Discussion: The biosynthesis of GABA in tomato is a resistance response to feeding by B. dorsalis in appropriate nitrogen, whereas nitrogen excess facilitates the pupal weight of B. dorsalis by inhibiting synthesis of the GABA pathway. This study concluded that excess nitrogen inhibits tomato defenses in plant-insect interactions by inhibiting GABA synthesis, answering some unresolved questions about the nitrogen-dependent GABA resistance pathway to herbivores.

AB  - The maternal immune activation produced by the systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats provides valuable insights into the basis of behavioural schizophrenia-like disturbances and biochemical changes in the brains of the offspring, such as microglial activation. Regarding therapy, antipsychotics continually constitute the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment. To their various efficacy and side effects, as well as not fully recognised mechanisms of action, further characteristics have been suggested, including an anti-inflammatory action via the impact on neuron-microglia axes responsible for inhibition of microglial activation. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to determine whether chronic treatment with chlorpromazine, quetiapine or aripiprazole could influence schizophrenia-like behavioural disturbances at the level of sensorimotor gating in male offspring prenatally exposed to LPS. Simultaneously, we wanted to explore if the chosen antipsychotics display a positive impact on the neuroimmunological parameters in the brains of these adult animals with a special focus on the ligand-receptor axes controlling neuron-microglia communication as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory factors related to the microglial activity. The results of our research revealed the beneficial effect of quetiapine on deficits in sensorimotor gating observed in prenatally LPS-exposed offspring. In terms of axes controlling neuron-microglia communication and markers of microglial reactivity, we observed a subtle impact of quetiapine on hippocampal Cx3cl1 and Cx3cr1 levels, as well as cortical Cd68 expression. Hence, further research is required to fully define and explain the involvement of quetiapine and other antipsychotics in Cx3cl1-Cx3cr1 and/or Cd200-Cd200r axes modulation and inflammatory processes in the LPS-based model of schizophrenia-like disturbances.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to develop an esophageal atresia (EA) model using fresh sheep esophagus, trachea, and lungs to simulate a realistic thoracoscopic surgical environment. Methods: A thoracoscopic trainer box was used with fresh sheep tissues (esophagus, trachea, and lungs) to create an EA and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) model. The distal esophagus was anastomosed to the trachea, and a bicycle pump was integrated to simulate lung function. Additional components, such as a simulated azygos vein and parietal pleura, enhanced the model's realism for surgical training. Results: The developed EA-TEF model was created in six steps, including pleural dissection, azygos vein control, TEF division, and esophageal anastomosis. The procedure used a thoracoscopic trainer box, sheep tissues, and standard instruments. A bicycle pump simulated lung function, and careful techniques were employed for vein ligation and esophageal anastomosis. After the posterior wall was sutured, an 8 Fr feeding tube was inserted. The total cost of the model was $260, with reusable equipment and a $10 recurring cost for sheep tissues. Conclusions: This study successfully developed a cost-effective and anatomically accurate thoracoscopic model for EA and TEF repair using fresh sheep tissue.

AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhea in yaks, which has a negative impact on their economic value. In recent years, probiotics have gained increasing attention as a pure, natural, nontoxic, harmless, and residue-free additive. However, the underlying mechanisms by which probiotics safeguard against ETEC are not completely elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) against ETEC infection in mice through oral gavage. Morphological changes were examined through light microscopy. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, NF-kappa B, and NLRP3), tight junction protein (ZO-1, Claudin-1), and pyroptosis (Caspase-1, Caspase-4, and gasdermin D (GSDMD)) were detected using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR. The results indicate that ETEC infection triggers the activation of inflammation-related pathways (NF-KB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the expression of a large number of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the activation of NLRP3 leads to the release of GSDMD activation through Caspase-1, ultimately resulting in inflammatory injury and pyroptosis. Feeding mice E. faecium early resulted in an increase in the expression of tight junction protein, a reduction in inflammatory cytokines, and alleviation of inflammatory injury and pyroptosis in intestinal tissues. Our research indicates that E. faecium has the ability to antagonize ETEC and provide protection to the gastrointestinal mucosa in mice.

AB  - In traditional pigging operations, sealed disks having a specific amount of interference guarantee that the pig runs at the velocity of the gas behind it. A bypass flow path in the pig lowers its speed while causes the uneven pig motion, which is referred to as slippage. The slippage raises the risk of the pig becoming stuck and negatively impacts the pipe and related facilities. This paper proposes a numerical method to solve a pigging model consisting of arbitrary Lagrange-Euler forms of the fluid flow equations and the bypass pig kinetic equation based on the moving grid method, which considers the contact surfaces between the pig and the fluid as discretized grid nodes. A detailed moving mesh was adopted to study the flow field around the pig. The consistency between the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy and applicability of the numerical method. Gas compressibility is primarily responsible for the transitional motions of the pig, especially its gradual restarting and the gradually smoothed velocity. Furthermore, the variation in the friction force is the primary factor that determines the appearance of the pigging stoppage and the scale of the pig resting and the next uneven pig velocity.

AB  - Oxidative stress in high-yielding dairy goats adversely affects lactation length, milk quality, and the economics of dairy products. During the lactation period, goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) are often in a state of disordered metabolic homeostasis primarily caused by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sulforaphane (SFN), an electrophilic compound that is enriched in broccoli, is a promising antioxidant agent for future potential clinical applications. The objective of the present study was to investigate the function of SFN on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage in primary GMECs and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Isolated GMECs in triplicate were pretreated with SFN (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mu M) for 24 h in the absence or presence of H2O2 (400 mu M) for 24 h. The results showed that SFN effectively enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, elevated the ratio of glutathione (GSH)/glutathione oxidized (GSSG), and reduced H2O2-induced ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) production and cell apoptosis. Mechanically, SFN-induced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2/NFE2L2) translocation to the nucleus through the activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway coupled with inhibition of the caspase apoptotic pathway. In addition, GMECs were transfected with NFE2L2 small interfering RNA (NFE2L2 siRNA) for 48 h and/or treated with SFN (5 mu M) for 24 h before being exposed to H2O2 (400 mu M) for 24 h. We found that knockdown of NFE2L2 by siRNA abrogated the preventive effect of SFN on H2O2-induced ROS overproduction and apoptosis. Taken together, sulforaphane suppressed H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis via the activation of the AMPK/NFE2L2 signaling pathway in primary GMECs.

   In the U.S., thousands of pigs had to be destroyed on the farms when illness caused by COVID-19 greatly reduced pork slaughter plant capacity. Some of the methods used to destroy pigs on the farms severely compromised animal welfare. Reliance on a few large slaughter plants created a fragile supply chain. Animal welfare auditing conducted by large meat buyers was also hindered by COVID-19. Many live in-person audits were stopped and replaced by a combination of stationary video cameras and live streamed videos from mobile phones. To insure high standards of animal welfare, video methods should never completely replace in-person visits.
   In the U.S., the most severe animal welfare problems caused by COViD-19 were in the pork industry. Thousands of pigs had to be destroyed on the farm due to reduced slaughter capacity caused by ill workers. In the future, both short-term and long-term remedies will be needed. In the short-term, a portable electrocution unit that uses scientifically validated electrical parameters for inducing instantaneous unconsciousness, would be preferable to some of the poor killing methods. A second alternative would be converting the slaughter houses to carcass production. This would require fewer people to process the same number of pigs. The pandemic revealed the fragility of large centralized supply chains. A more distributed supply chain with smaller abattoirs would be more robust and less prone to disruption, but the cost of pork would be greater. Small abattoirs can coexist with large slaughter facilities if they process pigs for specialized premium markets such as high welfare pork. The pandemic also had a detrimental effect on animal welfare inspection and third party auditing programs run by large meat buyers. Most in-person audits in the slaughter plants were cancelled and audits were done by video. Video audits should never completely replace in-person audits.

AB  - When retrieved, seemingly stable memories can become sensitive to significant events, such as acute stress. The mechanisms underlying these memory dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we show that noradrenergic stimulation after memory retrieval impairs subsequent remembering, depending on hippocampal and cortical signals emerging during retrieval. In a three-day study, we measured brain activity using fMRI during initial encoding, 24 hr-delayed memory cueing followed by pharmacological elevations of glucocorticoid or noradrenergic activity, and final recall. While post-retrieval glucocorticoids did not affect subsequent memory, the impairing effect of noradrenergic arousal on final recall depended on hippocampal reactivation and category-level reinstatement in the ventral temporal cortex during memory cueing. These effects did not require a reactivation of the original memory trace and did not interact with offline reinstatement during rest. Our findings demonstrate that, depending on the retrieval-related neural reactivation of memories, noradrenergic arousal after retrieval can alter the future accessibility of consolidated memories.

AB  - Caryocaridids exhibited a wide geographical distribution and high diversity during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event. The global geographical distribution, limited taxonomic examination and lack of insight into preservational conditions have collectively contributed to an inadequate systematic assessment of Ordovician caryocaridids. To address this situation, we re-examined Ordovician caryocaridid specimens from Australia and New Zealand. Considering these findings, we establish Rhinopterocaris fordycei sp. nov. This new species is characterized by the presence of a well-developed anterior carapace horn, a rounded, truncated posteroventral margin, and furcal rami that lack triangular expansion and spines. In doing so, we confirm the validity of Rhinopterocaris. We reclassify specimens of Lingulocaris maccoyi Etheridge, 1892 into Rhinopterocaris maccoyi (Etheridge, 1892) and highlight that specimens previously reported as Rhinopterocaris maccoyi belong in Jellicaris stewarti. A phylogenetic analysis of 44 Paleozoic phyllocarids reveals that Rhinopterocaris is basal within caryocaridids and is a sister group to younger caryocaridids. Finally, we present a hypothetical evolutionary lineage of caryocaridids and explore the evolutionary history of the group. http://zoobank.org/urnlsid:zoobank.org:pub:8DB2B405-F13A-480D-919E-48E43C048B9A

AB  - Freezing of sperm is known as an important part of assisted reproduction. However, many studies have illustrated that cryopreservation negatively affects the quality and fertility rate of sperm. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of trehalose and pentoxifylline (PTX) in diluents on cooled and frozen-thawed Markhoz goat sperm. Preassessed samples were pooled and diluted with a basic diluent using trehalose and PTX. The cooled sperm showed significant improvement. The motion characteristics of cryopreserved sperm were evaluated based on computer-assisted system analysis. In this study, we investigated the viability, membrane integrity, malondialdehyde concentration, total abnormality, acrosome integrity, and seminal hyaluronidase enzyme. Also, the hypo-osmotic swelling test, mitochondrial activity, apoptotic features, caspase activity, chromatin dispersion test, active mitochondria, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity were assessed as complementary parameters. The data illustrate that the total motility, progressive motility, average path velocity (VAP), straight-line velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), and the ratio of sperm chromatin dispersion, viable sperm were improved significantly (p < 0.05) using 3 mM PTX alone or 3 mM PTX plus 50 mM trehalose, while other characteristics indicate significant enhancement by 3 and 6 mM PTX and 50 and 70 mM trehalose alone or in combination, except amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), beat/cross frequency (BCF), and intracellular ROS-(O-), which demonstrate no significant difference among treatments. In conclusion, this study indicates that addition of 3 and 6 mM PTX alone or with 50 and 70 mM trehalose seems to reduce the damage caused by cooling and cryopreservation processes.

AB  - Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Bunyavirales: Phlebovirus) is a prominent vector-borne zoonotic disease threat to global agriculture and public health. Risks of introduction into nonendemic regions are tied to changing climate regimes and other dynamic environmental factors that are becoming more prevalent, as well as virus evolutionary factors and human/animal movement. Endemic to the African continent, RVFV has caused large epizootics at the decadal scale since the early 20th century but has spread to the Arabian Peninsula and shows increasing patterns of interepizootic transmission on the annual scale. This virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes as well as through direct contact with infected tissues and can cause sporadic to widespread morbidity and mortality in domestic ungulate livestock as well as humans. High viremias in infected livestock moved for legal and illegal trade as well as in infected mosquitoes or human travelers can spread this virus worldwide. With increasing global commerce, it is likely RVFV will be introduced to new areas with suitable hosts, mosquito vector species, and environments. However, the strong mosquito component of RVFV epidemiology combined with advancements in vaccines, diagnostics, and virus evolutionary factors create opportunities for strategies to leverage models of connectivity among potential source and emerging regions to target surveillance and mitigation activities to reduce the risk of RVFV introduction, or contain the virus should it be introduced, into new regions.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) emissions resulting from the field application of livestock slurry has both negative human health and environmental impacts. However, decreasing the exposed surface area (ESA) of slurry upon application can reduce NH3 volatilization by limiting its atmospheric exposure. In the present study, three strategies for depositing slurry within a growing crop were studied, including: 1. standard trailing hoses (SA(hose)), 2. trailing shoes (SA(shoes)), and 3. the combination of rigid tines and trailing shoes (SA(tines+shoes)). Application methods interact with the soil to varying degrees and were evaluated within the context of contemporary weed management practices, namely in cereals receiving inter-row hoeing. SA(hose), SA(shoes), and SA(tines+shoes) were compared in three coinciding experiments that assessed slurry ESA, NH3 emissions, and crop and weed effects. SA(tines+shoes) resulted in smallest ESA, 70-72% and 61-66% less than SA(hose) and SA(shoes), respectively. However, in only one of three site-years did SA(shoes) and SA(tines+shoes) reduce NH3 emissions compared to SA(hose), by 46% and 29%, respectively. Crop yields, nitrogen (N) accumulation in crop biomass, and intra-row weed biomass were unaffected by the placement method. In heavily crusted soils, the SA(tines+shoes) prototype worked well; however, the functional differences among placement strategies were not great enough to detect crop and NH3 effects.

AB  - Many plants have red/purple young leaves, and it has been proposed that the red/purple colouration reduces herbivory. Possible mechanisms underlying herbivory avoidance by red/purple young leaves were investigated using a generalist grasshopper Atractomorpha lata. To determine whether red/purple leaves reduce herbivory by the grasshopper, choice tests between purple and green perilla leaves were conducted under three light conditions, namely, exposure to white light, blue light, and darkness. Only under white light, A. lata ate more green leaves than purple leaves. Therefore, purple colouration of leaves is effective in preventing herbivory by A. lata. Young leaves of Annou-imo, a variety of sweet potato, are reddish brown or purple, and the colour changes to green when the leaves mature. The purple leaves contain a higher concentration of phenolics and latex than do the green leaves, and A. lata nymphs fed on the purple young leaves of Annou-imo exhibited worse growth than those fed the green mature leaves. Therefore, the red/purple colouration of young leaves is likely a warning signal to herbivores. When green herbivorous insects are positioned on red/purple leaves, they are conspicuous to enemies. Herbivores may have evolved to actively avoid red/purple leaves to maintain colour matching between their body and the background. I investigated whether A. lata exhibited a colour preference for substrates other than leaves, but they did not select a background that matched their body colour.

AB  - Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), caused by abnormal prion protein (PrPSc), affect many species. The most classical scrapie isolates harbor mixtures of strains in different proportions. While the characterization of isolates has evolved from using wild-type mice to transgenic mice, no standardization is established yet. Here, we investigated the incubation period, lesion profile and PrPSc profile induced by well-defined sheep scrapie isolates, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and ovine BSE after intracerebral inoculation into two lines of ovine PrP (both ARQ/ARQ) overexpressing transgenic mice (Tgshp IX and Tgshp XI). All isolates were transmitted to both mouse models with an attack rate of almost 100%, but genotype-dependent differences became obvious between the ARQ and VRQ isolates. Surprisingly, BSE induced a much longer incubation period in Tgshp XI compared to Tgshp IX. In contrast to the histopathological lesion profiles, the immunohistochemical PrPSc profiles revealed discriminating patterns in certain brain regions in both models with clear differentiation of both BSE isolates from scrapie. These data provide the basis for the use of Tgshp IX and XI mice in the characterization of TSE isolates. Furthermore, the results enable a deeper appreciation of TSE strain diversity using ovine PrP overexpressing transgenic mice as a biological prion strain typing approach.

AB  - The tongue serves as a vital organ in mammals, facilitating crucial functions such as mastication, swallowing, vocalization, thermoregulation, and taste reception. Cetacean tongues have evolved under distinct selective pressures compared to those of terrestrial mammals, yet research on their tongues is limited, leading to controversy regarding their gustatory abilities. This study aims to elucidate the morphological characteristics of the fetal tongue of common minke whales through both gross and microscopic observations. Macroscopic examination revealed that the papillae marginales were the only lingual papillae that were obviously developed in all specimens, and these projections are hypothesized to aid in suckling during the nursing period. Lingual glands were exclusively found in the proximal region of the tongue, unlike in toothed whales, where they are distributed in rostral regions. The rudimentary mechanical papillae and the caudal location of the lingual glands are thought to be consistent with the lunge feeding strategy. Neither macroscopic nor microscopic observations detected taste buds or any structures which are responsible for taste reception. Hence, it is suggested that gustation is not a crucial sense for nutrition in this species. These morphological findings enhance our understanding of rorqual feeding habits and provide insights for the management of this unique mammalian lineage.

AB  - Simple Summary The development of the fetal pancreas tissue can be affected during gestation by alterations to the intrauterine environment, often referred to as fetal programming. However, the mechanisms by which fetal programming predisposes offspring to reduced beta-cell function later in life are poorly understood. The aims of this study were to (1) determine how under or over-nutrition during gestation can affect the growth and development of the pancreas tissue during gestation and (2) determine how the DNA methylation patterns of the pancreas tissue could be affected. We were able to determine that maternal under- and over-nutrition during gestation altered offspring pancreas structure causing reductions in islet size and number. Additionally, the changes in DNA methylation patterns were determined to be in a diet-specific and sex-dependent manner. These data are being used to better understand the mechanisms by which the development of the pancreas is affected by fetal programming with the ultimate goals of developing appropriate intervention strategies for these offspring. The mechanisms by which fetal programming predisposes offspring to reduced beta-cell function later in life are poorly understood. We hypothesized that maternal under- and over-nutrition during gestation would negatively affect offspring pancreas development and alter DNA methylation patterns. Pregnant ewes (n = 78) were fed 100, 60, or 140% of NRC requirements beginning at d 30.2 +/- 0.2 of gestation. The fetuses are referred to as CON, RES, and OVER, respectively. Fetal pancreas tissue was collected at d 90 or 135 of gestation or within 24 h of birth. Tissue was preserved for histological (n = 8 to 9 offspring per treatment per time point) and DNA methylation analyses (n = 3 to 4 fetuses per treatment per sex). At d 135, OVER exhibited an increased islet size, reduced islet number, and greater insulin positive area compared with CON (p <= 0.03). An increased islet size was also observed at d 135 in RES (p <= 0.03) compared with CON. Cellular proliferation was reduced at birth in OVER vs. CON (p = 0.01). In the RES vs. CON females, 62% of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were hypomethylated (p <= 0.001). In the RES vs. CON males, 93% of the DMRs were hypermethylated (p <= 0.001). In OVER, 66 and 80% of the DMRs were hypermethylated in the female and male offspring compared with CON (p <= 0.001). In conclusion, changes to maternal diet during pregnancy affects the islet hypertrophy and cellular proliferation of the offspring at early post-natal time points. Additionally, changes in DNA methylation patterns appear to be in a diet-specific and sex-dependent manner.

AB  - Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a key upstream regulator of lipid metabolism; however, the molecular mechanisms by which SIRT1 regulates milk fat synthesis in dairy goats remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory roles of SIRT1 in modulating lipid metabolism in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) and its impact on the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) promoter activity using RNA interference (RNAi) and gene overexpression techniques. The results showed that SIRT1 is significantly upregulated during lactation compared to the dry period. Additionally, SIRT1 knockdown notably increased the expressions of genes related to fatty acid synthesis (SREBP1, SCD1, FASN, ELOVL6), triacylglycerol (TAG) production (DGAT2, AGPAT6), and lipid droplet formation (PLIN2). Consistent with the transcriptional changes, SIRT1 knockdown significantly increased the intracellular contents of TAG and cholesterol and the lipid droplet abundance in the GMECs, while SIRT1 overexpression had the opposite effects. Furthermore, the co-overexpression of SIRT1 and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) led to a more pronounced increase in ATGL promoter activity, and the ability of SIRT1 to enhance ATGL promoter activity was nearly abolished when the FOXO1 binding sites (FKH1 and FKH2) were mutated, indicating that SIRT1 enhances the transcriptional activity of ATGL via the FKH element in the ATGL promoter. Collectively, our data reveal that SIRT1 enhances the transcriptional activity of ATGL through the FOXO1 binding sites located in the ATGL promoter, thereby regulating lipid metabolism. These findings provide novel insights into the role of SIRT1 in fatty acid metabolism in dairy goats.

AB  - Tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze] has primarily been improved by selections and controlled hybridizations. In India, the genetic improvement programs are largely led by United Planters Association of South India (UPASI). Tea has robust vegetative propagation and several high yielding commercial elite tea clones released by UPASI have been cultivated across the world. In a previous study, we analysed 42 elite UPASI tea clones using cytological and molecular analysis (Sharma and Raina, Int J Tea Sci 5:21-28, 2006). Present work analysed the same clones using Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to document the genetic diversity and delineate the genetically distinct superior tea clones. A total of 447 and 116 bands were generated with 52 RAPD and 27 ISSR primers, out of which 395 and 70 bands, respectively were observed to be polymorphic. RAPD markers outcompeted ISSRs when compared against various genetic diversity attributes. An overall low Nei's gene diversity (0.23 and 0.19) and higher value of gene flow (6.5 and 5.0) with both markers indicated narrow genetic base for the clones. Dendrograms delineated 42 clones into three major clusters whereas population STRUCTURE analysis clustered them into 6 subpopulations without discrete morphotype based grouping. Presence of many admixtures in STRUCTURE indicates towards diverse genetic ancestry of the analysed tea clones. A high level of genetic variation (90.48%) was revealed with analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) within populations as compared to a low (9.52%) level among populations. A few superior clones were found to be genetically distinct than others and can be fruitfully used in future tea breeding programme.

AB  - In the context of the theory of multi-agent systems, the shepherding problem refers to designing the dynamics of a herding agent, called a sheepdog, so that a given flock of agents, called sheep, is guided into a goal region. Although several effective methodologies and algorithms have been proposed in the last decade for the shepherding problem under various formulations, little research has been directed to the practically important case in which the flock contains sheep agents unresponsive to the sheepdog agent. To fill in this gap, we propose a sheepdog algorithm for guiding unresponsive sheep in this paper. In the algorithm, the sheepdog iteratively applies an existing shepherding algorithm, the farthest-agent targeting algorithm, while dynamically switching its destination. This procedure achieves the incremental growth of a controllable flock, which finally enables the sheepdog to guide the entire flock into the goal region. Furthermore, we illustrate by numerical simulations that the proposed algorithm can outperform the farthest-agent targeting algorithm.

AB  - Villacis-Perez et al. describe the existence of and the mechanisms sustaining a host race of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, which was previously regarded as a generalist. Here, the authors identify a specialist host race exhibiting reproductive incompatibility with sympatric generalist populations, as well as significant differences in host performance.
   Plant-herbivore interactions promote the generation and maintenance of both plant and herbivore biodiversity. The antagonistic interactions between plants and herbivores lead to host race formation: the evolution of herbivore types specializing on different plant species, with restricted gene flow between them. Understanding how ecological specialization promotes host race formation usually depends on artificial approaches, using laboratory experiments on populations associated with agricultural crops. However, evidence on how host races are formed and maintained in a natural setting remains scarce. Here, we take a multidisciplinary approach to understand whether populations of the generalist spider mite Tetranychus urticae form host races in nature. We demonstrate that a host race co-occurs among generalist conspecifics in the dune ecosystem of The Netherlands. Extensive field sampling and genotyping of individuals over three consecutive years showed a clear pattern of host associations. Genome-wide differences between the host race and generalist conspecifics were found using a dense set of SNPs on field-derived iso-female lines and previously sequenced genomes of T. urticae. Hybridization between lines of the host race and sympatric generalist lines is restricted by post-zygotic breakdown, and selection negatively impacts the survival of generalists on the native host of the host race. Our description of a host race among conspecifics with a larger diet breadth shows how ecological and reproductive isolation aid in maintaining intra-specific variation in sympatry, despite the opportunity for homogenization through gene flow. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering the spatial and temporal scale on which plant-herbivore interactions occur in order to identify herbivore populations associated with different plant species in nature. This system can be used to study the underlying genetic architecture and mechanisms that facilitate the use of a large range of host plant taxa by extreme generalist herbivores. In addition, it offers the chance to investigate the prevalence and mechanisms of ecological specialization in nature.

AB  - Domestic swine ( Sus scrofa domesticus) ) are important translational models for cardiovascular transplant studies. This can be attributed to the anatomic and physiologic similarities of their cardiovascular system to humans. Transplant studies frequently employ clinically relevant immunosuppression regimens to prevent organ rejection postoperatively. Immunosuppression can lead to opportunistic infection, including presentations that are novel or poorly described in immunocompetent hosts. In this study, we describe the first case of Mycoplasma hyorhinis -induced endocarditis affecting the pulmonary valve in a juvenile, immunosuppressed pig following a partial heart transplantation procedure. Clinical signs of infection began at 15 d postoperation, were consistent with a variety of infectious agents, including Mycoplasma hyorhinis, , and included lethargy, respiratory signs, and elevated white blood cell counts. By 28 d post procedure, lameness and soft tissue swelling around the left tarsus developed. Joint fluid obtained by arthrocentesis was PCR positive for Mycoplasma hyorhinis and negative for other tested pathogens. Despite antimicrobial treatment, the transplanted pulmonary valve developed leaflet thickening, stenosis, and insufficiency starting at 30 d after the procedure. At 86 d posttransplantation, the pig reached experimental endpoints and was humanely euthanized for necropsy and histopathology. The pulmonary valve had numerous dark red vegetative expansions of all 3 leaflets. Postmortem testing of a vegetative lesion was positive for Mycoplasma hyorhinis, , confirming the etiologic agent responsible for endocarditis. Mycoplasma hyorhinis -induced endocarditis of an orthotopic transplanted pulmonary valve has yet to be described in swine. This case report demonstrates that infections following immunosuppression may present with novel or undercharacterized clinical signs.

AB  - This study aims at improving dietary discrimination among primates through a new analytic approach of dental microwear texture analysis integrating a surface sampling on facets of both phase I and II of mastication. The surface sampling is applied on these two types of molar facets on 104 specimens belonging to four extant cercopithecids, and on 207 Plio-Pleistocene specimens representing four taxa from the Shungura Formation, Ethiopia. The extant species, including Colobus guereza, Theropithecus gelada, Papio hamadryas, Chlorocebus aethiops, compose a model covering a wide range of feeding ecology from leaf-eating through grass-eating habits to opportunistic habits.
   A principal component analysis built with a selection of the most discriminant variables and extant species as a model displays that the two facets contribute equally to the dispersion of individuals and to the between-species differences. Also, most contributing variables along the components are not central values of texture parameters (mean and median of the parameters measured on subsurfaces or a single value for the whole surface) but rather statistics of their dispersion (percentiles) and distribution (kurtosis, skewness).
   Once the fossil specimens are inserted into the extant species model, the two large-bodied colobines, Paracolobus and Rhinocolobus, are found to differ from the extant Colobus guereza, one of the most leaf-eating colobines. This highlights ecological diversity among early African colobines. Besides, the analysis tracks betweengenus as well as temporal differences between the extinct species of papionins, attesting of a low ecological overlapping between Theropithecus and non-theropith papionins, notably after 2.4 Ma. No significant difference was found between T. brumpti, T. oswaldi, Theropithecus sp. supporting similar feeding habits with the present-day gelada, at least from 2.9 Ma onwards.

AB  - Among the alternatives identified as capable of making livestock farming a more efficient activity and reducing its environmental impact, the use of feeds with high digestibility and the use of non-conventional fodder species can be highlighted. Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray (TD) has already gained attention as a feed for ruminants. Nonetheless, there has been little discussion about the impacts of this plant on the rumen dynamics that lead to better animal performance. The aim of this study was to assess how increasing levels of TD could affect ruminal microbial biomass synthesis, degradability, and in vitro gas production (IVGP) of diets. Four diets were evaluated: a control diet (TD0: 400 g kg(-1) soybean meal and maize grain, and 600 g kg(-1) Tifton 85 hay (Cynodon spp.)) and three increasing levels of TD (TD9: 90, TD27: 270, and TD45: 450 g kg(-1)-dry matter basis) as a replacement for dietary roughage. A 96 h IVGP assay was carried out and five incubation times (2, 4, 10, 24, and 96 h) were used for degradability determination. Gas produced, methane (CH4), degradability of organic matter (IVDOM), short-chained fatty acid (SCFA) production, partitioning factor (PF), and microbial biomass (MB) were evaluated among treatments. There was no significant effect (p > 0.05) between TD inclusion and IVGP at most incubation times; only at 6 h of incubation did gas production increase linearly with TD inclusion (R-2 = 0.19; p < 0.05). TD inclusion had no effects on CH4. IVDOM increased linearly with TD inclusion at 6 and 10 h, with TD45 being more degradable than the control diet at 6 h only. There was a positive linear relationship (R-2 = 0.20; p < 0.05) between TD inclusion and PF. TD45 had significantly higher PF values than the control. MB also increased linearly (R-2 = 0.30; p < 0.05) with TD inclusion, and all diets with TD had significantly more MB than the control diet. The inclusion of TD at the levels used in this work was revealed to have a positive impact on microbial protein synthesis, which could be related to the higher microbial efficiency of increased substrate quality.

AB  - Simple Summary The ladybird beetle fauna of the Canary Islands is quite specific due to the presence of a number of species that do not occur anywhere else (the so-called endemic species). However, many ladybirds recorded in the archipelago are relatively recent arrivals from various parts of the world, as shown by our previous surveys carried out in several of the Canary Islands, including Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, Gran Canaria, and El Hierro. In this paper, we analyze the ladybird fauna of La Palma, one of the western islands of the archipelago, based on our field survey and already published data. The survey resulted in the recording of 26 species, seven of which had not previously been recorded on La Palma, and two of these seven had not been recorded on any of the Canary Islands. Combining our data and literature reports gives a figure of at least 35 ladybird species recorded to date on La Palma. This is fewer than on the central islands of the Canary archipelago (Gran Canaria and Tenerife), but more than on the other four islands (Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, La Gomera, and El Hierro). This study confirms previous observations that the Canary Islands are often colonized by exotic ladybird species. This paper provides new data on the ladybird beetles (Coccinellidae) of La Palma, one of the western islands of the Canarian archipelago. The field survey of 54 study sites resulted in recording 2494 ladybird individuals belonging to 26 species. Seven of the species recorded were new to La Palma, including two, Harmonia quadripunctata (Pontoppidan) and Nephus reunioni (Fursch), which were not registered so far on any of the Canary Islands. Novius conicollis (Korschefsky) is synonymized with N. cruentatus (Mulsant). Taking our survey and literature reports into account, a total of at least 35 species of Coccinellidae have so far been recorded on La Palma. This richness in species is lower compared to that of the central islands of the Canarian archipelago, Gran Canaria (42 species) and Tenerife (41 species), but higher than that of the remaining four islands (between 22 and 27 species). The detection of two alien species new to La Palma, Nephaspis bicolor Gordon and Nephus reunioni (Fursch), confirms earlier observations that colonization of the Canary Islands by ladybird species of exotic origins seems to be a frequent phenomenon.

AB  - Ability to efficiently localize productive foraging habitat is crucial for nesting success of insectivorous birds. Some bird species can use olfaction to identify caterpillar-infested trees by detection of herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), but these cues probably need to be learned. So far, we know very little about the process of olfactory learning in birds, whether insectivorous species have a predisposition for detecting and learning HIPVs, due to the high ecological significance of these odors, and how olfaction is integrated with vision in making foraging decisions. In a standardized setup, we tested whether 35 wild-caught great tits (Parus major) show any preference for widely abundant HIPVs compared to neutral (non-induced) plant odors, how fast they learn to associate olfactory, visual and multimodal foraging cues with food, and whether the olfactory preferences and learning speed were influenced by bird sex or habitat (urban or rural). We also tested how fast birds switch to a new cue of the same modality. Great tits showed no initial preference for HIPVs compared to neutral odors, and they learned all olfactory cues at a similar pace, except for methyl salicylate (MeSA), which they learned more slowly. We also found no differences in learning speeds between visual, olfactory and multimodal foraging cues, but birds learned the second cue they were offered faster than the first one. Bird sex or habitat had no effect on learning speed or olfactory preference, but urban birds tended to learn visual cues more slowly. We conclude that insectivorous birds utilize olfactory and visual cues with similar efficiency in foraging, and that they probably don't have any special predisposition toward the tested HIPVs. These results confirm that great tits are flexible foragers with good learning abilities.

AB  - The Tugen Hills Succession of the Baringo Basin (Kenya) is a nearly continuous geologic succession spanning from the Middle Miocene (-15.5 Ma) to the Late Pleistocene (-240 ka) that includes one of the largest concentrations of fossil hominoids from 14 to 4 Ma. Paleoecological data from this succession are highly relevant to determining the nature and mode of environmental change during ape and human evolution, and while much work has characterized these environments in the Plio-Pleistocene, less has been done for those from the Miocene and early Pliocene. This study offers the first mesowear dataset for the Tugen Hills Succession and is one of the largest focused specifically on Miocene/Plio-Pleistocene bovids in eastern Africa. These data reflect the general diversity and increase in mixed-feeding behaviors of post-Miocene bovid diets in the THS, and while they can sometimes be extrapolated to describe an 'opening' of environments after the late Miocene, the enigmatic influence of spatial and temporal scale limit assemblage-level claims of paleoenvironment. The diversification of mesowear scores in the Plio-Pleistocene data is generally supported by bovid delta 13C values from the late Cenozoic of eastern and southern Africa and underscores the utility of combining both proxies in the characterization of bovid dietary ecology.

AB  - As an important nutrient source in large areas of the world, goat milk is favored by more and more consumers; however, the composition, nutritional value, and regulation mechanism of goat milk are not fully characterized. Mammary gland development is as important as detailed annotation of protein composition to address the physiological and nutritional values of goat milk. In the present study, 4353 colostrum and mature goat milk proteins were identified. The abundance of 118 proteins was significantly different between colostrum and mature milk proteins. Our results indicate that the milk protein changes were associated with a network of mammary gene expression changes; importantly, the prime factors include enhanced mammary growth/development, decreased protein translation, attenuated protein folding, and lower lip/carbohydrate metabolism. The present study provides insights into the changes in mammary metabolisms during the transition from colostrum to mature milk, which can help deeply explore the difference and regulation mechanism of active milk protein in colostrum and mature milk and provide references for the identification and functional study of bioactive milk proteins in colostrum.

AB  - Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease and remains a significant global public health challenge. Nevertheless, large-scale breeding of sheep and frequent sheep transport significantly contribute to the spatial dissemination and inter-herd transmission of brucellosis, particularly at pastoral regions where lax quarantine measures or inadequate transport conditions may facilitate cross-regional spread of brucellosis. To analyze the epidemiological effects of sheep migration, we develop a mechanism-driven mathematic model incorporating periodic components to characterize the coupling between sheep dispersal and seasonal fluctuations. The existence and global stability of periodic solutions are rigorously established through the theoretical framework of monotone dynamical systems. The monthly surveillance data about human brucellosis cases of Inner Mongolia and Liaoning Province during 2017-2020 period are simulated, and the basic reproduction numbers for brucellosis transmission are evaluated as 1.25, 1.15, respectively. The findings suggest that: (1) An elevated dispersal rate from Inner Mongolia to Liaoning Province would exacerbate the brucellosis epidemic in Liaoning Province. Conversely, an increased dispersal rate in the reverse direction from Liaoning to Inner Mongolia would mitigate the epidemic intensity of Liaoning Province. (2) Implementing comprehensive public health education programs, enhancing environmental disinfection and expanding surveillance coverage could effectively control brucellosis epidemics. (3) The basic reproduction numbers will be reduced below the critical threshold of 1 in both regions through either an 18% increase in public health education intensity in Inner Mongolia coupled with 16% increase in Liaoning Province, or a 0.8-unit enhancement in disinfection frequency in Inner Mongolia combined with 0.6-unit of Liaoning Province. The research findings could offer a novel perspective on the transmission mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics of brucellosis.

AB  - Depression has emerged as the predominant psychiatric affliction affecting individuals. Prior research has substantiated the antidepressant properties exhibited by numerous anesthetics. Sevoflurane, a widely utilized inhalant anesthetic in clinical practice, remains relatively uncharted in terms of its specific antidepressant effects. In this study, we used open field test, forced swimming test and novelty -suppressed feeding test to investigate the anxiety and depression -like behaviors in C57BL/6 mice following the inhalation of sevoflurane. We then used western blotting to scrutinized the expression levels of proteins associated with the brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tryosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) pathway in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. To further investigate whether sevoflurane exerts antidepressant -like effects via the BDNF-TrkB pathway, we downregulated TrkB expression by administering siRNA into the lateral ventricle. We found that the inhalation of 2.5 % sevoflurane exerted a significant antidepressant -like effect, accompanied by an elevation in p-TrkB expression levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Intriguingly, this antidepressant -like effect was abrogated following the downregulation of TrkB expression through the microinjection of siRNA into the lateral ventricle. In conclusion, this study provides evidence supporting the notion that sevoflurane exerts its antidepressant -like effect via the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway.

AB  - Reclamation of abandoned mining areas can be a potentially viable solution to tackle three major problems: waste mismanagement, environmental contamination, and growing food demand. This study aims to evaluate the rehabilitation of mining areas into agricultural production areas using integrated biotechnology and combining Technosols with a multipurpose (forage, food, ornamental and medicinal) drought-resistant legume, the Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet. Two Technosols were prepared by combining gossan waste (GW) from an abandoned mining area with a mix of low-cost organic and inorganic materials. Before and after plant growth, several parameters were analysed, such as soil physicochemical characteristics, nutritional status, bioavailable concentrations of potentially hazardous elements (PHE), soil enzymatic activities, and development and accumulation of PHE in Lablab, among others. Both Technosols improved physicochemical conditions, nutritional status and microbiological activity, and reduced the bioavailability of most PHE (except As) of GW. Lablab thrived in both Technosols and showed PHE accumulation mainly in the roots, with PHE concentrations in the shoots that are safe for cattle and sheep consumption. Thus, this is a potential plant that, in conjunction with Technosols, constitutes a potential integrated biotechnology approach for the conversion of marginal lands, such as abandoned mining areas, into food-production areas.

AB  - The Eurasian gall-forming weevil Ceutorhynchus cardariae Korotyeav (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a biological control candidate for the invasive Eurasian Lepidium draba L. (Brassicaceae) in the western USA. Among 157 nontarget plant species that have been tested, some North American Caulanthus and Streptanthus species, confamilial with Lepidium, were found to be at potential risk of attack by C. cardariae. Many Caulanthus and Streptanthus species grow on serpentine soils, which are characterized by low nutrient content and high concentrations of various combinations of heavy metals. Some of these species accumulate heavy metals, which have been shown to act as deterrents against insect herbivory. Standard pre-release host specificity tests with C. cardariae used plants propagated on horticultural soils, which could have inflated performance by C. cardariae on Caulanthus and Streptanthus species. To examine this possibility, we assessed the performance of C. cardariae on three Caulanthus species, the federally listed threatened and endangered Streptanthus glandulosus ssp. albidus, and Lepidium draba, on plants propagated in horticultural soil or in native serpentine soil. Our study showed that native serpentine soil influenced C. cardariae attack. All plant species, including L. draba, received less feeding damage and gall formation when grown in serpentine soil. In addition, feeding by C. cardariae was much less and fewer galls were formed on the confamilial species than on L. draba, regardless of soil type. Our data show that native confamilial species restricted to specialized soil types may be at less risk of herbivore attack than predicted based on tests conducted in horticultural soil.

AB  - To investigate the response of different levels of molybdenum (Mo) fertilizer to Chinese Merino sheep (Junken Type) grazing on natural heavy metal-contaminated meadows, this study was carried out in the Bayanbulak Grassland lying in the northwest of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. A total of 24-hm(2) polluted meadows were fenced and were randomly divided into four groups (3 replication/group and 2 hm(2)/replication) applied 0-kg Mo, 1-kg Mo, 2-kg Mo, and 3-kg Mo (ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate) per hectare for the CON group, group I, group II, and group III, respectively. Seventy-two healthy 1-year-old Chinese Merino sheep (45.56 +/- 2.35 kg) were randomly assigned to the tested pastures for 90 days. Compared with the CON group, the Mo content from fertilized groups and the Se content from group II and group III in serums and livers were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the Cu content from fertilized groups in serums and livers was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The levels of blood Hb and RBC, and the activities of serum SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and Cp in group III, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in the CON group, group I, and group II. Serum MDA content in group III was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in the other three groups. In summary, Mo fertilization improved the antioxidant capacity of grazing sheep and also reduced the toxic damage to Chinese Merino sheep grazing on natural grasslands contaminated by heavy metals, but Mo poisoning caused by excessive fertilization should be prevented.

AB  - Understanding the costs of emission abatement measures is essential for devising reduction efforts. It allows to identify cost-effective solutions to achieve target values set by international agreements or national policies. This work aims to summarize and discuss the current knowledge on costs and effects associated with selected ammonia (NH3) mitigation measures in livestock production through comparison of country-specific and modelestimated values. Often, large differences appear between the results of individual countries, also in comparison with model results that are generally better harmonized between countries. It seems that different system boundaries in cost assessments, but also different geographic and structural conditions create perceived as well as real cost differences, also caused by the variability of individual situations. Our results are robust with respect to identifying feeding strategies as the most cost-effective, but results for other mitigation options do not show any clear trends, thus making it difficult to distinguish further cost-effective solutions. We point out and discuss some key aspects which may affect estimates of national costs, leading to challenges with the interpretation of final results. Our study concludes that further and more consistent assessments (e.g. standardized protocols) are needed to improve the evaluation base for other individual abatement options, including options that are under development.

AB  - We discuss various human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) inherent within communities bordering a mid-sized, semi-porous wildlife conservancy in Kenya. HWC are a growing issue as human population expands into wildlife habitat to put people and wildlife in more frequent contact and compete for scarce resources. In 2018, we surveyed the crop-raiding and livestock depredation experiences of 918 households from 10 separate villages and asked about the experiences of the villagers with HWC over the past 3 years. These communities are protected from wildlife with two different fence designs, a standard 12-strand electrical fence, and an upgraded predator-proof fence design. We found that between 70% and 91% of respondents had experienced some form of HWC including 39.5% who reported threats to their person from wildlife encroachments despite electrical perimeter fencing. HWC happened more often at night and during the dry seasons. The most common encroachments were from elephants, hyenas, leopards, and baboons. Community respondents rated that the upgraded predator-proof fences performed better than the standard 12-strand fences. However, even the predator-proof design had issues with keeping monkeys from entering the communities and crop raiding. We discuss potential mitigation measures, including an improved predator-proof fencing design that incorporates butterfly stingers that may offer better protection.

AB  - As a unique woody oil crop in China, Camellia oleifera Abel. germplasm resources show significant genetic diversity in Ya'an City. This study measured 60 phenotypic traits (32 quantitative, 28 qualitative) of 302 accessions to analyze phenotypic variation, establish a classification system, and screen high-yield, high-oil germplasms. The phenotypic diversity index for fruit (H' = 1.36-1.44) was significantly higher than for leaf (H' = 1.31) and flower (H' < 1), indicating genetic diversity concentrated in reproductive traits, suggesting potential genetic variability in these traits. Fruit quantitative traits (e.g., single fruit weight CV = 35.37%, fresh seed weight CV = 38.93%) showed high genetic dispersion. Principal component analysis confirmed the fruit factor and economic factor as main phenotypic differentiation drivers. Quantitative traits were classified morphologically, and correlation analysis integrated them into 13 key indicators classified using LSD and range methods. Finally, TOPSIS evaluation selected 10 excellent germplasms like TQ122 and TQ49, with fruit weight, fresh seed yield, and kernel oil content significantly exceeding the population average. This study provides data for C. oleifera DUS test guidelines and proposes a multi-trait breeding strategy, supporting high-yield variety selection and germplasm resource protection.

AB  - The rapid growth of the livestock sector in some areas of Europe has caused an imbalance between the generation of livestock manure and the availability of agricultural soil for its direct application as a fertilizer. Since the transport of pig slurry to other areas with nutrient-deficient soils is costly from an economic point of view due to its high water content, the application of new technologies for the concentration of this waste is considered key for reducing management costs. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to demonstrate the potential of vibratory shear enhanced processing (VSEP) operated with reverse osmosis membranes to recover nutrients from the liquid fractions of pig slurry (LF-pig slurry) and digestate (LF-digestate) and obtain concentrated fertilizing products. Use of the VSEP unit permitted reductions in the water contents of the LF-pig slurry and LF-digestate, around 77% and 67%, respectively. Both VSEP concentrates were characterized by their significant nutrient contents and showed a nitrogen fertilizer replacement value similar to that of mineral fertilizer as demonstrated in a barley crop pot-test, although the salinity of the digestate concentrate was identified as a key limitation, negatively impacting the agronomic yield of the test crop.

AB  - A certain power of microwave radiation could cause changes in the nervous, cardiovascular, and other systems of the body, and the brain was a sensitive target organ of microwave radiation injury. Studies have shown that microwaves can impair cognitive functions in humans and animals, such as learning and memory, attention, and orientation. The dose-dependent effect of microwave radiation is still unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of 1.5-GHz microwaves with different average power densities on locative learning and memory abilities, hippocampal structure, and related N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) signalling pathway proteins in rats. A total number of 140 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: S group (sham exposure), L5 group (1.5-GHz microwaves with average power density = 5 mW/cm(2)), L30 group (1.5-GHz microwaves with average power density = 30 mW/cm(2)), and L50 group (1.5-GHz microwaves with average power density = 50 mW/cm(2)). Changes in spatial learning and memory, EEG activity, hippocampal structure, and NMDAR signalling pathway molecules were detected from 6 h to 28 d after microwave exposure. After exposure to 1.5-GHz microwaves, rats in the L30 and L50 groups showed impaired spatial memory, inhibited EEG activity, pyknosis and hyperchromatism of neuron nucleus, and changes in NMDAR subunits and downstream signalling molecules. In conclusion, 1.5-GHz microwaves with an average power density of 5, 30, and 50 mW/cm(2) could induce spatial memory dysfunction, hippocampal structure changes, and changes in protein levels in rats, and there was a defined dose-dependent effect.

AB  - Implantable deep brain probes (DBPs) constitute a vital component of brain-machine interfaces, facilitating direct interaction between neural tissues and the external environment. Most multifunctional DBPs used for neural system sensing and modulation are currently fabricated through thermal tapering of polymeric materials. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge in selecting materials that simultaneously accommodate the thermal stretching process and yet match the modulus of brain tissues. Here, we introduce a kind of multifunctional hydrogel-based fiber (HybF) designed for neural sensing, on-demand deep brain manipulation, and photodynamic therapy, and was achieved by integrating ion chelation/dechelation effects with templating methods throughout the entire wet-spinning process. With a low bending stiffness of approximately 0.3 N/m and a high conductivity of about 97 S/m at 1 kHz, HybF facilitates a high-quality signal recording (SNR similar to 10) while minimizing immune rejection. It also effectively mediates deep brain optogenetic stimulation, successfully manipulating the behavior of hippocampal neurons in hSyn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato SD rats. Importantly, by leveraging HybF, this study explores the use of a spatiotemporally controllable photodynamic strategy in antiepilepsy, in which the high-amplitude abnormal electrical discharges were instantaneously eliminated without affecting normal cognitive/memory abilities. The above innovative approach established a distinct paradigm for deep brain manipulation and degenerative disease treatment, providing interesting insights into brain circuits and bioelectronic devices.

AB  - To effectively remove n-propylbenzene (n-PBZ) and isopropylbenzene (i-PBZ) leaked into seawater using Rhinomonas reticulata S6A (a newly isolated marine microalga), the effects of three inorganic nutrients and four environmental factors on their degradation were determined after 7 d of inoculation. Results show that NaNO3 at 300 mg/L caused a higher removal efficiency of both n-PBZ and i-PBZ (44.79% and 39.26%), while for NaH2PO4H2O, greater removal rates of two PBZs (47.30% and 42.23%) were achieved at 30 and 20 mg/L, respectively. NaHCO3 supplementation (500-750 mg/L) resulted in a large reduction (43.67%-45.04%) in i-PBZ concentration. The change in seawater pH (from 6 to 9) did not affect the elimination of n-PBZ and i-PBZ. The most suitable salinity and temperature were 30 and 25-30 degrees C, respectively, leading to the PBZs removal of similar to 40%. Light intensity exhibited significant influence on elimination of PBZs, and the maximum removal efficiencies of 56.07% (n-PBZ) and 55.00% (i-PBZ) were recorded under 200 and 600 mu mol/(m(2)center dot s), respectively. In addition, the microalga could still remove PBZs when it failed to grow well due to darkness, strong light, low temperature, or low salinity, which might mean that good growth of alga is not always a necessary condition for PBZs removal. Therefore, attention should be paid to the suitability of nutrient levels and environmental conditions (excluding pH) in seawater when using microalgae for bioremediating PBZs-contaminated seawater.

AB  - Penicillium and Acaulium species are common in fresh herbivore dung and can produce many diverse secondary metabolites, and these fungi play important roles as decomposers of organic materials, food industry, or enzyme factories. Besides, the well-characterized diversity of coprophilous fungi offers accessible systems for dissecting the function of fungi and for exploring the potential to produce high amounts of cellulases in herbivore guts. During a survey of coprophilous fungi from herbivorous animals in China, more than 400 strains were isolated. Thirty-eight strains belonging to Penicillium and 4 belonging to Acaulium were obtained from 12 healthy animals including marmot and chinchilla and selected for detailed study. The strains were characterized by a multi-gene sequencing analysis of partial beta-tubulin (TUB), the internal transcribed spacer rDNA (ITS), calmodulin (CAM), and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) genes, and a detailed phenotypic study. Penicillium strains were identified as belonging to six sections and 12 known species. In addition, four Acaulium isolates were identified as Acaulium album and A. stercorarius sp. nov. based on morphology and multi-gene sequence phylogeny. This study shows that the species diversity of Penicillium on herbivore dung has not been widely studied and that this substrate seems to be a good reservoir of interesting penicillium-like fungi.

AB  - Simple Summary Corn is one of the most produced grains in the world, being the primary energy concentrate used in animal feeding due to its nutrition quality and high cultivation potential, which make it the main source of starch in the diets of ruminant animals. We compared three different moisture additives to conserve rehydrated corn-grain silage, namely water, cactus mucilage, and whey, and replaced ground corn (GC) with rehydrated corn-grain silage in the finishing of kids' diet. Cactus pear cladode mucilage was a more efficient moisture additive than water and whey for ground-corn silage. Thus, it is recommended to replace ground corn with rehydrated corn-grain silage with mucilage (RCSmucilage) in 415 g/kg because it provides better animal performance than ground corn (GC)-along with having a similar intake and digestion to it-due to better conservation of the silage at a lower cost when compared to commercial additives. The effects of the replacement of dry ground corn (GC) with corn-grain silage rehydrated with water (RCSwater), cactus pear mucilage (RCSmucilage), and whey (RCSwhey) on the growth, physicochemical composition, and fatty acid profile of goat kids' meat were investigated. Thirty-two crossbred goat kids (16.4 +/- 2.50 kg initial weight) were assigned in a randomized block design with four treatments and eight repetitions. The NDF intake of goat kids fed with RCSmucilage was higher in comparison to RCSwater and RCSwhey (p = 0.0009). The dietary replacement of GC by RCSmucilage increased the final weight (p = 0.033) and meat-cooking losses (p = 0.0001) of kids. The concentrations of oleic (p = 0.046), 11,14-eicosadienoic (p = 0.033), and EPA (p = 0.010) were higher in the meat of kids fed with RCSmucilage and RCSwhey, and the alpha-linolenic concentration was higher (p = 0.019) for animals feeding with RCSmucilage. Meat from kids fed with RCSwhey presented the lowest n-ary sumation SFA and the highest n-ary sumation MUFA. In contrast, the n-ary sumation PUFA (p < 0.012) was higher for goats fed with RCSwater. The n-ary sumation omega 3 (p < 0.0001) was higher in animals fed with RCSmucilage and RCSwhey. Desirable fatty acids were higher (p = 0.044) in animals fed with RCSmucilage and RCSwhey, and the atherogenicity (p = 0.044) and thrombogenicity (p < 0.0001) indexes were lower for goats fed the RCSwhey diet. The enzymatic activities of Delta(9)desaturase (C16) were higher (p = 0.027) in goat kids fed with GC and RCSmucilage, and Delta(9)desaturase (C18) was higher (p = 0.0497) when goats were fed with RCSmucilage and RCSwhey. Elongase activities were higher (p = 0.045) in goat kids fed with GC and RCSwater. The total replacement of GC by RCSmucilage is recommended in the diet of goat kids due to improvements in the weight gain and proportion of desirable fatty acids in the meat. In addition, RCSmucilage promoted better conservation of the silage at a lower cost when compared to commercial additives.

AB  - The Cashmere goat (Capra hircus) is renowned for its high-quality fiber production trait. The hair cycle in Cashmere goat has an annual rhythm. To deepen the understanding of the molecular foundation of annual rhythm in the skin of Cashmere goat, we did a comparative analysis of the Cashmere goat skin transcriptome all year round. 4002 Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with seasonal variations. 12 months transcriptome were divided into four developmental stages: Jan-Mar, Apr-Jul, Aug-Oct, and Nov-Dec based on gene expression patterns. 13 modules of highly correlated genes in skin were identified using WGCNA. Ten of these modules were consistent with the development stages. The gene function of those genes in each module was analyzed by functional enrichment. The results indicated that Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways were inhibited from January to March and activated from April to July. The cutaneous immune system of Cashmere goats has high activity from August to October. Fatty acid metabolism dominates goat skin from November to December. This study provides new information related to the annual skin development cycle, which could provide molecular biological significance for understanding the seasonal development and response to the annual rhythm of skin.

AB  - Light, as an energy source, has been proven to strongly affect photosynthesis and, thus, can regulate the yield and quality of tea leaves (Camellia sinensis L.). However, few comprehensive studies have investigated the synergistic effects of light wavelengths on tea growth and development in green and albino varieties. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate different ratios of red, blue and yellow light and their effects on tea plants' growth and quality. In this study, Zhongcha108 (green variety) and Zhongbai4 (albino variety) were exposed to lights of different wavelengths for a photoperiod of 5 months under the following seven treatments: white light simulated from the solar spectrum, which served as the control, and L1 (red 75%, blue 15% and yellow 10%), L2 (red 60%, blue 30% and yellow 10%), L3 (red 45%, far-red light 15%, blue 30% and yellow 10%), L4 (red 55%, blue 25% and yellow 20%), L5 (red 45%, blue 45% and yellow 10%) and L6 (red 30%, blue 60% and yellow 10%), respectively. We examined how different ratios of red light, blue light and yellow light affected tea growth by investigating the photosynthesis response curve, chlorophyll content, leaf structure, growth parameters and quality. Our results showed that far-red light interacted with red, blue and yellow light (L3 treatments) and significantly promoted leaf photosynthesis by 48.51% in the green variety, Zhongcha108, compared with the control treatments, and the length of the new shoots, number of new leaves, internode length, new leaf area, new shoots biomass and leaf thickness increased by 70.43%, 32.64%, 25.97%, 15.61%, 76.39% and 13.30%, respectively. Additionally, the polyphenol in the green variety, Zhongcha108, was significantly increased by 15.6% compared to that of the plants subjected to the control treatment. In addition, for the albino variety Zhongbai4, the highest ratio of red light (L1 treatment) remarkably enhanced leaf photosynthesis by 50.48% compared with the plants under the control treatment, resulting in the greatest new shoot length, number of new leaves, internode length, new leaf area, new shoot biomass, leaf thickness and polyphenol in the albino variety, Zhongbai4, compared to those of the control treatments, which increased by 50.48%, 26.11%, 69.29%, 31.61%, 42.86% and 10.09%, respectively. Our study provided these new light modes to serve as a new agricultural method for the production of green and albino varieties.

AB  - Recently, we reported that the atypical antidepressant agomelatine (Ago) exerted a beneficial impact on behavioral changes and concomitant neuropathological events in icvSTZ rat model of sporadic Alzheimer diseases (AD). In the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of Ago (40 mg/kg, i.p. for 30 days) on beta-amyloid (A beta) metabolism in icvA beta(1-42) rat model of AD. The melatonin analogue was administered either simultaneously with A beta(1-42) (A beta Ago1) or 30 days later during the late stage of the progression of AD (A beta Ago2). Treatment with Ago in the early stage of AD attenuated anxiety and depressive-like responses but was inefficient against A beta-induced impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. The melatonin analogue, administered both during the early and the late stage of AD, corrected to control level the elevated A beta(1-42) in the frontal cortex (FC) and the hippocampus. The concentration of alpha-secretase was enhanced by A beta Ago1 compared to the sham- and A beta-veh groups in the hippocampus. No changes in the concentration of beta-secretase in the FC and the hippocampus as well as of gamma-secretase in the FC were observed among groups. Both the A beta Ago1 and A beta Ago2 attenuated to control level the A beta-induced increased concentration of gamma-secretase in the hippocampus. A beta Agol exerted also structure-specific neuroprotection observed mainly in the CA1, septal CA3b subfield of the dorsal hippocampus and septo-temporal piriform cortex (Pir) and partially in the temporal CA3c, septal and temporal Pir. These findings suggest that Ago treatment in the early stage of AD can exert beneficial effects on concomitant behavioral impairments and neuroprotection in associated brain structures. The antidepressant administration both in the early stage and after the progression of AD affected A beta metabolism via decreasing of gamma-secretase concentration in the hippocampus.

AB  - There are drawbacks associated with current methods used to quantify insect predation. However, there has been relatively little effort to experimentally document the sources of biases associated with different methodologies. In this study, we investigated how methods used experimentally to quantify predation may influence insect antipredator defenses being observed, and thus alter the determination of the number of prey killed by predators, and potentially the conclusions reported in the study. We focused on acclimation period, which represents the time between the point at which a prey individual is made available, for example on a leaf, and when the experiment is initiated. In essence, this is the period of time during which an organism adjusts to the conditions that surround it before a treatment is imposed. We investigated if prey acclimation period on plants influences the antipredator behavior of larval Orgyia leucostigma (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), and the number of prey killed in the laboratory by the predatory wasp Polistes fuscatus (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). The results of this study provide evidence that acclimation time significantly affects the antipredator behavior observed and mortality of caterpillars exposed to predators. The majority of larvae allowed short acclimation periods did not drop in response to the attacks of wasps. These larvae suffered significantly higher mortality compared to caterpillars that were allowed to acclimate for longer periods of time.

AB  - Introduction: The combination of apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (ApoE epsilon 4) status, odor identification, and odor familiarity predicts conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: To further understand olfactory disturbances and AD risk, ApoE epsilon 4 carrier (mean age 76.38 +/- 5.21) and epsilon 4 non-carrier (mean age 76.8 +/- 3.35) adults were given odor familiarity and identification tests and performed an odor identification task during fMRI scanning. Five task-related functional networks were detected using independent components analysis. Main and interaction effects of mean odor familiarity ratings, odor identification scores, and epsilon 4 status on network activation and task-modulation of network functional connectivity (FC) during correct and incorrect odor identification (hits and misses), controlling for age and sex, were explored using multiple linear regression. Results: Findings suggested that sensory-olfactory network activation was positively associated with odor identification scores in epsilon 4 carriers with intact odor familiarity. The FC of sensory-olfactory, multisensory-semantic integration, and occipitoparietal networks was altered in epsilon 4 carriers with poorer odor familiarity and identification. In epsilon 4 carriers with poorer familiarity, connectivity between superior frontal areas and the sensory-olfactory network was negatively associated with odor identification scores. Conclusions: The results contribute to the clarification of the neurocognitive structure of odor identification processing and suggest that poorer odor familiarity and identification in epsilon 4 carriers may signal multi-network dysfunction. Odor familiarity and identification assessment in epsilon 4 carriers may contribute to the predictive value of risk for MCI and AD due to the breakdown of sensory-cognitive network integration. Additional research on olfactory processing in those at risk for AD is warranted.

AB  - The derivation of porcine embryonic stem cell (pESC) lines remains a major challenge in this field. To date, the porcine na & iuml;ve ESCs have yet to be successfully established, and standardized criteria for their characterization and evaluation are still lacking. The regulation of X-chromosome activity integrates information from embryonic development and the dosage of sex chromosomes, which is closely associated with the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells. In this study, we aimed to establish pESC lines in LCDM medium from porcine blastocyststage embryos, and analyzed the features of ESCs from the sight of X chromosome activity. We assessed molecular markers and epigenetic characteristics to confirm pluripotency and X chromosome activity in porcine parthenogenetic ESCs (named as ppLCDM) using XIST RNA-FISH, immunofluorescence staining, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and other techniques. Results showed that ppLCDM cells expressed most pluripotent markers. The percentage of ppLCDM cells exhibiting H3K27me3 and XIST aggregation signals increased with passage, indicating the progressive establishment of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Meanwhile, the pluripotency of most ppLCDM cells gradually declined during extended passaging. However, two distinct patterns of ppLCDM cells were observed from passage 35 (type I cells, P35-I) displayed normal XCI states, while type II cells (P35-II) exhibited X-chromosome erosion-like state, characterized by the loss of aggregation signals, abnormal Xlinked gene ratios. Particularly, the pluripotency of ppLCDM cells with an X-chromosome erosion-like state undergoes unusual changes compared to normal cells. These findings indicate that X chromosome activity is closely associated with the pluripotent state of porcine ESCs and that heterogeneity in X chromosome activity arises during passaging. Our research provides crucial insights into X chromosome dynamics in large-animal ESC models and contribute to ongoing efforts to establish stable na & iuml;ve pESC lines.

AB  - GDP-mannose transporters (GMTs) have been implicated in the virulence of some important pathogenic fungi, and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) mannose transporters transport GDP-mannose from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen prior to mannosylation, where mannose attaches to the modified protein. GMTs could be potential targets for new antifungal drugs, as disruption of any step in GDP-mannose biosynthesis can affect fungal viability, growth, or virulence. To date, the GDP-mannose transporter has been extensively studied in yeast, but its biological function in fungi, particularly F. graminearum, is still unclear. In this experimental study, the role of the GDP-mannose transporter in F. graminearum was investigated by analysing the VRG4 gene. FgGmtA and FgGmtB were blastp-derived from their Scvrg4 protein sequences and proved to be their functional homologues. The mutant and complementary strains of FgGmtA, FgGmtB and FgGmtA&B genes were generated and used to evaluate the effect of the two GMTs genes on mycelial growth, asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction, cell wall sensitivity, glyphosate synthesis and drug susceptibility. Only in the FgGmtB and FgGmtA&B mutants was the rate of mycelial growth slowed, conidium production increased, sexual reproduction impaired, cell wall sensitivity increased, glycemic content decreased, and drug sensitivity reduced. The results of the pathogenicity assessment of GMTs showed that only FgGmtB affects the patogenicity of F. graminearum. At the same time, the effect of GMTs on the ability of rhinoceros to synthesise DON toxins was investigated and the results showed that the ability of Delta FgGmtB and Delta FgGmtA&B mutants to produce the DON toxin was significantly reduced, and the expression of toxin-related genes was also reduced.

AB  - The adult Strategus aloeus (L.) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae: Oryctini) is a pest insect that causes damage in young oil palm plantations in Colombia. The indiscriminate use of insecticides for their control affects the beneficial fauna of the agroecosystem, reducing their populations. Therefore, it is essential to identify S. aloeus native enemies and establish their importance in regulating pest populations. Sampling was performed every 20 d for 3 yrs in plots with decomposing stipes in 3 plantations of the central zone (Colombia). The predator Phileurus didymus (L.) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae: Oryctini) was found in 64.7% of the collected samples. Strategus aloeus larvae, pupae, and adults also were naturally infected by the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes). Under laboratory conditions, adults of P. didymus caused the death of S. aloeus larvae 3 to 7 mins after finding their prey, taking 6 to 36 mins to consume the larvae. The percentage predation of S. aloeus larvae by P. didymus was a function of exposure time. At 24 h of exposure, approximately 81.3% of the population was predated. Due to the presence within the agroecosystem of the oil palm, the habits of oviposition, the search factor, and the predation capacity, this natural enemy (P. didymus) should have strong effects on the regulation of the of S. aloeus in oil cultivation.

AB  - Nasal polyps are edematous polypoid masses covered by smooth, gray, shiny, soft and gelatinous mucosa. They often pose a threat for the patients to result in allergic rhinitis, sinus infections and asthma. The aim of this paper is to design a reliable rhinology assistance system for recognizing the nasal polyps in endoscopic videos. We introduce NP-80, a novel dataset that contains high-quality endoscopy video-frames of 80 participants with and without nasal polyps (NP). We benchmark vanilla machine learning and deep learning-based classifiers on the proposed dataset with respect to robustness and accuracy. We conduct a series of classification experiments and an exhaustive empirical comparison on handcrafted features (texture features-Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and shape features-Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features for recognizing nasal polyps automatically. The classification experiments are carried out by K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and CNN classifiers. The best obtained precision, recall, and accuracy rates are 99%, 98%, and 98.3%, respectively. The classifier methods built with handcrafted features have shown poor recognition performance (best accuracy of %96.3) from the proposed CNN classifier (best accuracy of %98.3). The empirical results of the proposed learning techniques on NP-80 dataset are promising to support clinical decision systems. We make our dataset publicly available to encourage further research on rhinology experiments. The major research objective accomplished in this study is the creation of a high-accuracy deep learning based nasal polyps classification model using easily obtainable portable rhino fiberoscope images to be integrated into an otolaryngologist decision support system. We conclude from the research that using appropriate image processing techniques along with suitable deep learning networks allow researchers to obtain high accuracy recommendations in identifying nasal polyps. Furthermore, the results from the study encourages us to develop deep learning models for various other medical conditions.

AB  - Background Camellia tachangensis F. C. Zhang is a five-compartment species in the ovary of tea group plants, which represents the original germline of early differentiation of some tea group plants. Methods and results In this study, we analyzed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the genome level, constructed a phylogenetic tree, analyzed the genetic diversity, and further investigated the population structure of 100 C. tachangensis accessions using the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) method. A total of 91,959 high-quality SNPs were obtained. Population structure analysis showed that the 100 C. tachangensis accessions clustered into three groups: YQ-1 (Village Group), YQ-2 (Forest Group) and YQ-3 (Transition Group), which was further consistent with the results of phylogenetic analysis and principal component analyses (PCA). In addition, a comparative analysis of the genetic diversity among the three populations (Forest, Village, and Transition Groups) detected the highest genetic diversity in the Transition Group and the highest differentiation between Forest and Village Groups. Conclusions C. tachangensis plants growing in the forest had different genetic backgrounds from those growing in villages. This study provides a basis for the effective protection and utilization of C. tachangensis populations and lays a foundation for future C. tachangensis breeding.

AB  - The brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) is a notorious sap-sucking insect pest that damages rice (Oryza sativa) plants throughout Asia. During BPH feeding, saliva enters rice plant tissues, whereas during oviposition egg-associated secretions (EAS) are deposited in damaged plant tissue. Dynamic changes in rice to planthopper salivary effectors have been widely reported. However, the effects of EAS from planthopper on rice immunity remains largely unexplored. In this study, we found that both infestation of rice by gravid BPH female adults and treatment with the EAS elicited a strong and rapid accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA), JA-isoleucine, and hydrogen peroxide in rice. EAS enhanced plant defenses not only in rice but also in tobacco, and these impaired the performance of BPH on rice, as well as the performance of aphids and whiteflies on tobacco. High-throughput proteome sequencing of EAS led to 110 proteins being identified and 53 proteins with 2 or more unique peptides being detected. Some proteins from BPH EAS were also found in the salivary proteome from herbivores, suggesting potential evolutionary conservation of effector functions across feeding and oviposition; however, others were only identified in EAS, and these are likely specifically related to oviposition. These findings point to novel proteins affecting interactions between planthoppers and rice during oviposition, providing an additional source of information for effector studies.

AB  - Intermittent fasting (IMF) is associated with many health benefits in animals and humans. Yet, little is known if an IMF diet affects mood and cognitive processing. We have previously identified that IMF in diet-induced obese males increases norepinephrine and dopamine content in the hypothalamus and increases arcuate neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene expression more than in ad libitum control males. This suggests that IMF may improve cognition through activation of the hindbrain norepinephrine neuronal network and reverse the age-dependent decline in NPY expression. Less is known about the association between anxiety and IMF. Although, in humans, IMF during Ramadan may alleviate anxiety. Here, we address the impact of IMF on anxiety-like behavior using the open field test, hippocampal-dependent memory using the Y-maze and spatial object recognition, and hippocampalindependent memory using novel object recognition in middle-aged male and female (12 mo) and aged male and female (18 mo) mice. Using ELISA, we determined norepinephrine (NE) content in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We also investigated gene expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and the locus coeruleus (LC). In IMF-treated females at both ages, we observed an improvement in spatial navigation although an impairment in spatial object orientation. IMF-treated females (12 mo) had a reduction and IMF-treated males (12 mo) displayed an improvement in novel object recognition memory. IMF-treated females (18 mo) exhibited anxiolytic-like behavior and increased locomotion. In the DH, IMF-treated males (12 mo) had a greater amount of NE content and IMF-treated males (18 mo) had a reduction. In the ARC, IMF-treated males (12 mo) exhibited an increase in Agrp and Npy and a decrease in Adr1a. In the ARC, IMF-treated males (18 mo) exhibited an increase in Npy and a decrease in Adr1a; females had a trending decrease in Cart. In the LH at 12 months, IMF-treated males had a decrease in Npy5r, Adr1a, and Adr1b; both males and females had a reduction in Npy1r. In the LH, IMF-treated females (18 mo) had a decrease in Hcrt. In the LC at both ages, mice largely exhibited sex effects. Our findings indicate that IMF produces alterations in mood, cognition, DH NE content, and ARC, LH, and LC gene expression depending on sex and age.

AB  - Quantification of predation, herbivory, and parasitism is critical to understanding the dynamics and trophic interactions of populations in an ecosystem. Such quantification can be challenging if the availability or consumption of the taxa are difficult to assess. Sometimes the consumption of a single prey, forage, or host is used as an overall index of the predation, herbivory, or parasitism for a population of interest. Occasionally, human-manipulated baits are used to derive similar indices. However, all such indices are susceptible to influence by variation in the abundance of the preferred taxon relative to other taxa as the result of preference switching. In this article, I describe a test for preference switching (and an adjustment, if detected) that does not require availability and consumption of the prey (forage, or host) to be measured on the same scale. The ability to detect and adjust for preference switching in such situations may advance the understanding of biological preference in taxa not previously studied in this respect.

AB  - Context. Population-monitoring programs often use direct (e.g. live capture or spotlighting) or indirect (e.g. scats sightings) observations to estimate population abundance. Such methods, however, are often inadequate for rare, elusive, or cryptic species due to the difficulty in achieving sufficient encounters or detection rates. The mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus), a small native Australian macropod, listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, is difficult to capture, susceptible to capture myopathy, and not easily sighted in their dense habitat; consequently, the population size cannot always be estimated. The use of molecular markers to identify individual genotypes from non-invasively collected samples is increasingly being used in wildlife conservation and may be an alternative approach for mala. Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of noninvasive scat DNA sampling to estimate the population abundance of mala. Methods. A panel of microsatellite markers was developed for the identification of individual mala via profiling of their scats. Scats were systematically collected from a wild mala population located in an 1100-ha fenced reserve in Western Australia. Individual genotypes were determined using the microsatellite markers, and the abundance of mala was estimated using the genotypes with spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) and mark-resight analyses. Key results. The genetic markers proved variable and with sufficient exclusionary power to confidently identify unique individuals (mean locus genotyping error rate: 3.1%). Individual genetic identification from scat sampling, when used with traditional mark-recapture/resight analytical models, provides feasible estimates of population abundance. This is the first reliable abundance estimate of this mala population, suggesting a > 70% increase in population size since the initial reintroduction of 64 individuals in 2011-13. Conclusions. Given the inherent difficulties in surveying mala, this approach would be valuable to ensure effective monitoring of the few remaining fenced and island mala populations to prevent further decline of this vulnerable species. Implications. This is the first study to identify species-specific microsatellite markers for mala and use genetic-capture sampling with scat DNA to estimate the abundance of a mala population. The study provides an evaluation of a valuable species monitoring technique that can be applied to other rare, elusive, or cryptic threatened species.

AB  - Water pipe sediment removal should be implemented as an integral part of water mains maintenance in order to steadily supply consumers with drinking water of high quality. Considering the number of different water pipe sediment removal methods, the article aims to evaluate the currently used methods to remove water pipe sediment from the pipes of the drinking water distribution system. The evaluation compares the implementation requirements of each method as well as the quality and the quantity of the removed products. The tested methods were unidirectional flushing, Comprex(R), and Ice Pigging(R). The results of the comparison are expressed in terms of total suspended solids (TSS) recovery, metals mass concentration and water consumption. Since contamination can settle along the entire surface of the pipeline, it is most appropriate to recalculate the results per unit area of the pipeline. The results point at the following efficiency the Comprex(R) method was the most efficient in removing TSS, Ice Pigging(R) was the next and unidirectional flushing removed a negligible amount of TSS compared to the other two methods. The absolute recovery of TSS was 0.12-3.01 g.m(-2) in unidirectional flushing of plastic pipes, 1.58-8.54 g.m(-2) in unidirectional flushing of metal pipes, 4.36-47.53 g.m(-2) in Ice Pigging(R), and 5.19-69.23 g.m(-2) in Comprex(R). The composition of the sediment was strongly influenced by particle origin: Pipe material affected the crystalline phase of the sediment and the water source and the age of the pipe affected the amorphous phase of the sediment. Therefore, it was found that evaluation of efficiency based on the amount of TSS removed is only suitable for sites that meet the same conditions as pipe material, water source and ideally the pipe age. It has further been found that the Comprex(R) method can be advantageously used in real conditions to clean pipes with insufficient hydraulic conditions (such as with a high level of incrustation), as the cleaning has low water flow velocity requirements.

AB  - The karstic caves in the Bubing Basin, Guangxi, southern China, contain abundant Quaternary mammalian fossils. These cave sites are located at varying altitudes that have been roughly correlated with chronological age (higher caves are older, lower caves are younger). A growing number of recent studies have established a regional biochronological sequence for these Bubing caves from the Early to the Late Pleistocene. Here, we describe a new mammalian assemblage from the Zhongshan Cave, that dates to the late Middle Pleistocene Marine Isotope Stage 6 (191-130 ka). The age is supported by minimum ages derived from U-series dating of the deposits, and the ESR/U-series dating of one Rhinoceros tooth (similar to 184 ka). The Zhongshan mammalian assemblage, comprising 33 taxa of large-sized mammals, belongs to the Middle Pleistocene "Ailuropoda-Stegodon" faunal unit and, in this respect, most closely resembles the Ganxian fauna (362-168.9 ka). The high diversity and abundance of ruminant Artiodactyla (versus Perissodactyla) in the Zhongshan fauna suggest a diversity of forest to more open habitats in the Bubing Basin during this period.
   The Zhongshan fauna fills a gap in the biochronological framework of southern China, offering new insights into the evolutionary history of some mammalian lineages in the Bubing Basin. Overall, data indicate major changes in the Early to Late Pleistocene faunal sequence, particularly with more turnover during the EarlyMiddle Pleistocene transition compared to the Middle-Late Pleistocene transition.
   Comparison between faunas from the Bubing Basin with those from sites in the Chongzuo area, also in Guangxi, southern China, highlights two major phases in the general decline of large-sized mammals during the Middle to Late Pleistocene transitional period. In that respect, our results provide an updated biochronological background for further analyses of the region.

AB  - To act proactively, we must predict when future events will occur. Individuals generate temporal predictions using cues that indicate an event will happen after a certain duration elapses. Neural models of timing focus on how the brain represents these cue-duration associations. However, these models often overlook the fact that situational factors frequently modulate temporal expectations. For example, in realistic environments, the in-tervals associated with different cues will often covary due to a common underlying cause. According to the 'common cause hypothesis,' observers anticipate this covariance such that, when one cue's interval changes, temporal expectations for other cues shift in the same direction. Furthermore, as conditions will often differ across environments, the same cue can mean different things in different contexts. Therefore, updates to tem-poral expectations should be context-specific. Behavioral work supports these predictions, yet their underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we asked whether the dorsal hippocampus mediates context-based timing, given its broad role in context-conditioning. Specifically, we trained rats with either hippocampal or sham lesions that two cues predicted reward after either a short or long duration elapsed (e.g., tone-8 s/light-16 s). Then, we moved rats to a new context and extended the long cue's interval (e.g., light-32 s). This caused rats to respond later to the short cue, despite never being trained to do so. Importantly, when returned to the initial training context, sham rats shifted back toward both cues' original intervals. In contrast, lesion rats continued to respond at the long cue's newer interval. Surprisingly, they still showed contextual modulation for the short cue, responding earlier like shams. These data suggest the hippocampus only mediates context-based timing if a cue is explicitly paired and/or rewarded across distinct contexts. Furthermore, as lesions did not impact timing mea-sures at baseline or acquisition for the long cue's new interval, our data suggests that the hippocampus only modulates timing when context is relevant.

AB  - IntroductionMany higher plants contain cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA) sequences from Agrobacterium and have been called "natural genetically modified organisms" (nGMOs). Among these natural transformants, the tea plant Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cv. Shuchazao contains a single 5.5 kb T-DNA fragment (CaTA) with three inactive T-DNA genes, with a 1 kb inverted repeat at the ends. Camellia plants are allogamous, so that each individual may contain two different CaTA alleles. Methods142 Camellia accessions, belonging to 10 of 11 species of the section Thea, were investigated for the presence of CaTA alleles. Results discussionAll accessions were found to contain the CaTA insert, showing that section Thea derives from a single transformed ancestor. Allele phasing showed that 82 accessions each contained two different CaTA alleles, 60 others had a unique allele. A phylogenetic tree of these 225 alleles showed two separate groups, A and B, further divided into subgroups. Indel distribution corresponded in most cases with these groups. The alleles of the different Camellia species were distributed over groups A and B, and different species showed very similar CaTA alleles. This indicates that the species boundaries for section Thea may not be precise and require revision. The nucleotide divergence of the indirect CaTA repeats indicates that the cT-DNA insertion took place about 15 Mio years ago, before the emergence of section Thea. The CaTA structure of a C. fangchengensis accession has an exceptional structure. We present a working model for the origin and evolution of nGMO plants derived from allogamous transformants.

AB  - This paper records a new distribution of long-billed vulture in the Sindh Province of Pakistan. Existing literature on long-billed vultures provides the distribution and status of this vulture in Sindh Province but does not cover the western mountainous eco-region. IUCN Pakistan's team conducted a pre-monsoon baseline survey in the province in the dry season in June 2019 and another survey in the vulture breeding season, in February 2020. Methodology included direct field observations and interviews of local communities. Field Guide to the Birds of Pakistan, by the senior author and other related literature, as well as the use of a high resolution camera helped in the identification of the species. During the surveys, information on the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, that is diclofenac and other drugs known to be harmful to vultures, were gathered through interviews. This paper suggests that the vultures and other raptors in the mountainous eco-region of Sindh are in relatively larger populations compared to the Eastern side of Sindh due to the abundance of wild ungulates in protected areas such as the Khirthar National Park.

AB  - Agricultural lands with farm animals (e.g. cattle) can be significantly affected by radioactive contamination following nuclear or radiation accidents. In order to optimise the techniques for measuring Cs-137 in contaminated cattle, selected radiation detectors have been tested and calibrated using volumetric radiation sources. In addition, a mathematical phantom of a cow was created within Monte Carlo simulations. The main aim of the research was to propose a method for making rapid measurements of Cs-137 in cattle in vivo/in situ and to select the most suitable measurement set-up. Measurements of contaminated cattle in vivo were carried out in Belarus with one selected detector, and were then compared with measurements of meat in a laboratory and with measurements of a control group of cows. The proposed measurement method was also tested on measurements of Cs-137 in wild boars in Czechia with higher levels of the Cs-137 activity.

AB  - Conservation policies often need to integrate scientific predictions with ethical considerations. However, different normative ethical systems at the root of conservation approaches often support different decisions, and the moral stances of stakeholders are influenced by diverse societal values and perceptions. This creates the potential for dilemmas and conflicts. In the present article, we adapt the well-known trolley problem thought experiment to a conservation context. Exploring variations in how the problem is framed enables us to highlight key concepts that need to be considered in decision-making (uncertainty; asymmetry in numbers, victims, and impacts; temporal and spatial asymmetry; causal relationships and stakeholder involvement). We argue that the trolley problem offers a simplified but flexible framework to understand and predict the factors underlying differences in moral stances across diverse conservation issues, foster communication, and facilitate informed decision-making in conservation practice.

AB  - Sheep facial expressions are valuable indicators of their pain levels, playing a critical role in monitoring their health and welfare. In response to challenges such as missed detections, false positives, and low recognition accuracy in sheep facial expression recognition, this paper introduces an enhanced algorithm based on YOLOv8n, referred to as SimAM-MobileViTAttention-EfficiCIoU-AA2_SPPF-YOLOv8n (SMEA-YOLOv8n). Firstly, the proposed method integrates the parameter-free Similarity-Aware Attention Mechanism (SimAM) and MobileViTAttention modules into the CSP Bottleneck with 2 Convolutions(C2f) module of the neck network, aiming to enhance the model's feature representation and fusion capabilities in complex environments while mitigating the interference of irrelevant background features. Additionally, the EfficiCIoU loss function replaces the original Complete IoU(CIoU) loss function, thereby improving bounding box localization accuracy and accelerating model convergence. Furthermore, the Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast (SPPF) module in the backbone network is refined with the addition of two global average pooling layers, strengthening the extraction of sheep facial expression features and bolstering the model's core feature fusion capacity. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method achieves a mAP@0.5 of 92.5%, a Recall of 91%, a Precision of 86%, and an F1-score of 88.0%, reflecting improvements of 4.5%, 9.1%, 2.8%, and 6.0%, respectively, compared to the baseline model. Notably, the mAP@0.5 for normal and abnormal sheep facial expressions increased by 3.7% and 5.3%, respectively, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in enhancing recognition accuracy under complex environmental conditions.

AB  - Congenital hypothyroidism (CH), a common neonatal endocrine disorder, can result in cognitive deficits if delay in diagnose and treatment. Dentate gyrus (DG) is the severely affected subregion of the hippocampus by the CH, where the dentate granule cells (DGCs) reside in. However, how CH impairs the cognitive function via affecting DGCs and the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In the present study, the CH model of rat pups was successfully established, and the aberrant dendrite growth of the DGCs and the impaired cognitive behaviors were observed in the offspring. Transcriptome analysis of hippocampal tissues following rat CH successfully identified that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) was the prominent regulator involved in mediating deficient growth of DGC dendrites. CaMKIV was shown to be dynamically regulated in the DG subregion of the rats following drug-induced CH. Interference of CaMKIV expression in the primary DGCs significantly reduced the spine density of dendrites, while addition of T3 to the primary DGCs isolated from CH pups could facilitate the spine growth of dendrites. Insights into relevant mechanisms revealed that CH-mediated CaMKIV deficiency resulted in the significant decrease of phosphorylated CREB in DGCs, in association with the abnormality of dendrites. Our results have provided a distinct cell type in hippocampus that is affected by CH, which would be beneficial for the treatment of CH-induced cognitive deficiency.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Goats have been used as animal models in research and are increasingly kept as companion animals like dogs and cats. Therefore, keeping them to be always healthy and disease free is an important matter for the owners. Anesthesia is a prerequisite for veterinarians to treat animals suffering from medical and surgical disorders. However, information about the efficacy of anesthetic drugs is scant in this species. In this current study, the quality of induction, antinociceptive and cardio-respiratory effects of a newer anesthetic combination "xylazine-alfaxalone" were evaluated. It is well known that the small opening of the oral cavity and long soft palate make intubation in goats a very challenging procedure. The findings demonstrated that xylazine reduced the dose of alfaxalone required for successful intubation and uneventful induction. In addition, this anesthetic regimen produced better antinociception with stability in cardiac function indices, however oxygen supplementation is necessary, especially in compromised animals, to counteract xylazine-associated lowering of hemoglobin oxygen saturation.
   Goats have been used as animal models in research and are increasingly kept as companion animals. However, information about effective anesthetic drugs is scarce in this species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of xylazine premedication on alfaxalone induction. Twelve clinically healthy goats weighing 18.5 +/- 2 kg were randomly assigned to two groups. Induction was performed with alfaxalone alone intravenously (ALF group) or with xylazine premedication before alfaxalone administration (XYL-ALF group). The quality of induction was scored, induction doses of alfaxalone were determined, and cardiorespiratory parameters and nociceptive thresholds were measured before any treatment(s) (baseline) and at 5, 15, 25 and 35 min after alfaxalone administration. The mean dose of alfaxalone required for induction in the ALF group was greater than that in the XYL-ALF group (p < 0.001). There were no significant changes in diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) or systolic arterial pressure (SAP) compared to baseline in either group, while hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) was lower from 5 to 25 min (p < 0.5) in the XYL-ALF group. The nociceptive threshold was significantly higher at 5 min in the XYL-ALF group than in the ALF group (p = 0.0417). Xylazine premedication reduced the required dose of alfaxalone for anesthetic induction and produced better antinociception than alfaxalone alone. In addition, the combination of xylazine and alfaxalone allowed for successful induction; however, oxygen supplementation is necessary to counteract xylazine-associated hypoxemia.

AB  - Haemonchus contortus poses a severe hazard to the healthy development of the sheep industry and threatens the welfare of sheep. Ivermectin is the primary anthelmintic used for the prevention and treatment of H. contortus parasitism. However, the widespread and uncontrolled application of ivermectin has resulted in the development and spread of resistant strains of H. contortus. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays important roles in the pharmacology and toxicology of ivermectin, and changes in P-gp expression levels can be used to analyze the resistance of H. contortus to ivermectin. This study aimed to analyze the effects of ivermectin on P-gp expression in H. contortus L3 larvae isolated from China and to evaluate whether changes in P-gp expression levels can be used to analyze resistant H. contortus strains. In the absence of drug treatment, the ivermectin-resistant strains isolated in China showed increased expression of P-gp11 (p < 0.01) compared with sensitive strains from elsewhere, whereas the expressions of P-gp2 and P-gp9.1 were downregulated (p < 0.01). When the same strain was compared before and after drug treatment, obvious differences in expression were observed between the different strains. Ivermectin-induced P-gp expression was found to be very complex among the L3 larvae of different strains. In addition, it was confirmed that using P-gp to determine ivermectin resistance in H. contortus strains from different geographic environments can yield different results.

AB  - Fat deposition plays a key role in determining porcine meat quality traits, with lipid droplets serving as critical organelles for lipid storage in adipose tissue. Inhibiting lipid droplet biogenesis disrupts the lipid storage capacity of adipocytes. The Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD) family is crucial in regulating polyunsaturated fatty acid/monounsaturated fatty acid (PUFA/MUFA) composition, while its role in lipid droplet formation remains unclear. This study employed CRISPR/Cas9 to create SCD1-deficient porcine renal epithelial cells (PK15), enabling an investigation into SCD1's role in fatty acid composition and lipid droplet regulation. RNA-seq analysis was conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SCD1's impact on lipid droplet numbers. Results showed that SCD1 deletion significantly decreased triacylglycerols (TAG) content, altered fatty acid composition, and decreased lipid droplet numbers. Conversely, SCD1 overexpression increased lipid droplet numbers, confirming SCD1's role in regulating lipid droplet abundance. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SCD1 regulates lipid metabolism via Calsyntenin 3 beta (CLSTN3B). Experimental validation confirmed the SCD1-CLSTN3B regulation of lipid droplet numbers. In summary, we discovered the role of SCD1 in regulating the number of lipid droplets, highlighting its potential impact on lipid metabolism and adipocyte function in pigs.

AB  - We tested two versions of a trap that captures climbing ticks on their dorsum. A prototype based on a decades old model had three components, a truncated pyramidal base with steep sloping walls, downward facing sticky-tape extending beyond and spanning the boundary of the flat upper surface, on which ticks become dorsally immobilized, and a reservoir for gaseous CO2 emission from dry ice that rests on the flat upper surface. A preoperational trap was made of thermoformed plastic and differed from the prototype by its circular structure, a central depression suitable for future housing of a biotic CO2 generator and supplemental volatile lures and a transparent sticky ceiling that enables ticks to exhibit a phototactic response and allows users to see captured ticks without disturbing the traps. Field testing of the prototype in Florida and both trap types in Oklahoma and North Carolina achieved high catches of lone star ticks, Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), e.g. mean catches of >70 ticks (adults plus nymphs) in 4 h in both the prototype and preoperational traps in North Carolina, and significantly higher yields of ticks than on dry ice baited 1 m(2) white sheets.

AB  - Health-promoting effects of medicinal mushrooms have been postulated for centuries in folk medicine in Asia and Europe and are currently being verified by scientific research. Lion's mane (Hericium erinaceus, HE) is an arboreal medicinal mushroom that has been shown to improve short-term memory of healthy mice, and to modulate stress-coping strategies of rodents. HE shares bioactive compounds with other arboreal medicinal mushrooms such as the pink oyster mushroom (Pleurotus djamor, PDJ) and agarikon (Fomitopsis officinalis, FO), but their effects in vivo have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of dietary supplementation with HE, FO, or PDJ on long-term memory, anxiety-like behavior, and hippocampal gene expression of healthy male mice. CD-1 mice were fed with either control or mushroom-supplemented (2 mg/g of dry chow) diets for 40 days and underwent object novelty recognition and elevated plus maze tests before hippocampi collection. Only HE-supplemented animals displayed long-term memory (one sample t-test against chance level of novelty preference ratio). Supplementation had no effect on anxiety-like behavior, but its effect on the frequency of arm visits of the elevated plus maze apparatus was modulated by the amount of ingested food - an effect that was absent in control animals. We also observed that mice with higher weight gain had lower expression of Gsk3 beta and Mtor in their hippocampi. We discuss the relevance of these results for rodent behavioral studies of dietary mushroom supplementation.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we propose a grouped attention module that combines channel attention and spatial attention simultaneously and applies it to a feature pyramid network for instance segmentation of group-raised pigs. First, we discuss the performance impact of adding different attention modules and setting different numbers of attention groups on the pig instance segmentation. Then, we visualize the spatial attention information and analyze the segmentation results under different scenes, ages, and time periods. Additionally, we explore the robustness and transferability of the model using third-party datasets. The aim is to provide insights into the intelligent management of pigs. In the pig farming environment, complex factors such as pig adhesion, occlusion, and changes in body posture pose significant challenges for segmenting multiple target pigs. To address these challenges, this study collected video data using a horizontal angle of view and a non-fixed lens. Specifically, a total of 45 pigs aged 20-105 days in 8 pens were selected as research subjects, resulting in 1917 labeled images. These images were divided into 959 for training, 192 for validation, and 766 for testing. The grouped attention module was employed in the feature pyramid network to fuse the feature maps from deep and shallow layers. The grouped attention module consists of a channel attention branch and a spatial attention branch. The channel attention branch effectively models dependencies between channels to enhance feature mapping between related channels and improve semantic feature representation. The spatial attention branch establishes pixel-level dependencies by applying the response values of all pixels in a single-channel feature map to the target pixel. It further guides the original feature map to filter spatial location information and generate context-related outputs. The grouped attention, along with data augmentation strategies, was incorporated into the Mask R-CNN and Cascade Mask R-CNN task networks to explore their impact on pig segmentation. The experiments showed that introducing data augmentation strategies improved the segmentation performance of the model to a certain extent. Taking Mask-RCNN as an example, under the same experimental conditions, the introduction of data augmentation strategies resulted in improvements of 1.5%, 0.7%, 0.4%, and 0.5% in metrics AP(50), AP(75), AP(L), and AP, respectively. Furthermore, our grouped attention module achieved the best performance. For example, compared to the existing attention module CBAM, taking Mask R-CNN as an example, in terms of the metric AP(50), AP(75), AP(L), and AP, the grouped attention outperformed 1.0%, 0.3%, 1.1%, and 1.2%, respectively. We further studied the impact of the number of groups in the grouped attention on the final segmentation results. Additionally, visualizations of predictions on third-party data collected using a top-down data acquisition method, which was not involved in the model training, demonstrated that the proposed model in this paper still achieved good segmentation results, proving the transferability and robustness of the grouped attention. Through comprehensive analysis, we found that grouped attention is beneficial for achieving high-precision segmentation of individual pigs in different scenes, ages, and time periods. The research results can provide references for subsequent applications such as pig identification and behavior analysis in mobile settings.

AB  - Simple Summary Wool fiber diameter (WFD) is one of the most important economic traits of wool, especially in Angora rabbits. Emerging studies have been conducted on sheep and goats. However, few studies of WFD have been reported in rabbits. In our study, the diameter of coarse and fine wool and their respective hair follicles in Wan strain Angora rabbits were analyzed, and it was found that the diameter of coarse wool and hair follicles was larger than that of fine wool and hair follicles. High-throughput sequencing analysis was performed using hair follicles from coarse and fine wool. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including transcription factors, keratin-associated protein (KAP) and keratin (KRT) families, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes, were screened. Enrichment analysis showed that skin development, epidermal cell and keratinocyte differentiation, epithelium development, and Notch and ribosome signaling pathways were important in regulating hair structure. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis further identified six important signaling pathways and functional DEGs, including LEF1, FZD3, SMAD3, ITGB6, and BMP4. The results provide valuable data for screening molecular markers involved in hair structure and facilitating enhanced selection of super-fine wool rabbits through gene-assisted selection. Wool fiber diameter (WFD) is an important index of wool traits and the main determinant of wool quality and value. However, the genetic determinants of fiber diameter have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, coarse and fine wool of Wan strain Angora rabbits and their hair follicle traits were characterized. The results indicated significant differences in the diameters of wool fibers and their hair follicles. The RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technique was used to identify differences in gene expression in hair follicles between coarse and fine wool. In total, 2574 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found between the two hair follicle groups. Transcription factors, keratin-associated protein (KAP) and keratin (KRT) families, and ECM-related genes may control the structure of fine fibers in rabbits. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that skin development, epidermal cell and keratinocyte differentiation, epithelium development, and Notch and ribosome signaling pathways were significantly enriched, respectively. GSEA further filtered six important pathways and related core genes. PPI analysis also mined functional DEGs associated with hair structure, including LEF1, FZD3, SMAD3, ITGB6, and BMP4. Our findings provide valuable information for researching the molecular mechanisms regulating wool fiber and could facilitate enhanced selection of super-fine wool rabbits through gene-assisted selection in the future.

AB  - Lizards, as predators, can use different prey foraging strategies that are expected to influence daily movement behavior and home range use. Variation in lizard movement behavior can be achieved via frequency changes in movement step lengths and turning angles that can facilitate distinctive prey-searching and foraging strategies. Komodo Dragons (Varanus komodoensis) exhibit a distinct dietary transition at similar to 18 kg, where lizards switch from consuming small-bodied and abundant prey species to highly dispersed adult ungulate prey. Our study examined competing models for the relative effects of ontogenetic dietary shift, body mass, sex, time of day, and arboreal habitat use on Komodo Dragon movement behavior (i.e., the proportional use of Levy flight movement steps) and home range area (i.e., 50 and 95% utilization distributions). Model ranking indicated that two models incorporating the proportion of adult ungulates and body mass best explained the increased use of Levy flight movement behavior of Komodo Dragons. Body mass also best explained the increase in the 50 and 95% utilization distribution Kernel home range areas. However, the slope of this relationship was less steep than that predicted by metabolic scaling theory and suggested that attributes specific to Komodo Dragons, or their environment, may attenuate their spatial requirements. This study demonstrates that because of distinct shifts in diet and other activities associated with large body size, Komodo Dragons alter movement behavior and increase their home range area to optimize environmental resource use.

AB  - Developmental exposure to environmental chemicals perturbs establishment and maintenance of the ovarian reserve across the reproductive lifetime, leading to premature follicle depletion and ovarian aging. Considering humans are exposed to a complex mixture of environmental chemicals, real-life models assessing their cumulative impact on the ovarian reserve are needed. Biosolids are a source of a real-life mixture of environmental chemicals. While earlier studies demonstrated that grazing pregnant sheep on biosolids-treated pastures did not influence establishment of the ovarian reserve in fetal life, its impact on subsequent depletion of ovarian reserve during reproductive life of offspring is unknown. We hypothesized that developmental exposure to biosolids accelerates depletion of ovarian reserve. Ovaries were collected from F1 juveniles (9.5 weeks) and adults (2.5 years) born to F0 ewes grazed on control inorganic fertilizer pastures or biosolids-treated pastures from before conception and throughout gestation. The impact on follicular density, activation rate, and anti-M & uuml;llerian hormone (mediator of activation) expression by immunohistochemistry was determined. Activation rate was increased in F1 biosolids-treated pastures juveniles with a corresponding reduction in primordial follicle density. In contrast, activation rate and ovarian reserve were similar between control and F1 biosolids-treated pastures adults. The density of anti-M & uuml;llerian hormone-positive antral follicles was lower in biosolids-treated pastures juveniles, whereas anti-M & uuml;llerian hormone expression tended to be higher in antral follicles of biosolids-treated pastures adults, consistent with the changes in the ovarian reserve. These findings of detrimental effects of developmental exposure to biosolids during juvenile life that normalizes in adults is supportive of a shift in activation rate likely related to peripubertal hormonal changes.
   Sentence Maternal preconceptional and gestational exposure to biosolids programs increased activation rate and reduced ovarian reserve in juvenile offspring that is normalized by adult life, which is likely related to changes during peripuberty.

AB  - The evolutionary success of phytophagous insects depends on their ability to efficiently exploit plants as a source of energy for survival. Herbivorous insects largely depend on the efficiency, flexibility, and diversity of their digestive physiology and sophistication of their detoxification system to use chemically diverse host plants as food sources. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is a polyphagous pest of many commercially important crops. To elucidate the ability of this insect pest to adapt to host plant mechanisms, we evaluated the impact of primary (corn) and alternate (rice) host plants after 11 generations on gut digestive enzymatic activity and expression profiles of related genes. Results indicated that the total protease and class-specific trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like protease activity of S. frugiperda significantly differed among host plant treatments. The class-specific protease profiles greatly differed in S. frugiperda midguts upon larval exposure to different treatments with inhibitors compared with treatments without inhibitors. Similarly, the single and cumulative effects of the enzyme-specific inhibitors TLCK, TPCK, and E-64 significantly increased larval mortality and reduced larval growth/mass across different plant treatments. Furthermore, the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results revealed increased transcription of two trypsin (SfTry-3, SfTry-7) and one chymotrypsin gene (Sfchym-9), which indicated that they have roles in host plant adaptation. Knockdown of these genes resulted in significantly reduced mRNA expression levels of the trypsin genes. This was related to the increased mortality observed in treatments compared with the dsRED control. This result indicates possible roles of S. frugiperda gut digestive enzymes and related genes in host plant adaptation.

AB  - Understanding how natural aging impacts rodent performance in translational behavior tests is critical to teasing apart impairments due to age-related decline from neurodegenerative disorder modeling. Reduced neuropilin and tolloid-like 1 (NETO1), an accessory protein of ionotropic glutamate receptors involved in synaptic plasticity, was associated with Alzheimer's disease, yet aging effects on Neto1 remain unclear. For these reasons, our goal was to characterize how Neto1 expression corresponded with social, repetitive, and spatial learning behaviors and stress response across the C57BL/6J mouse lifespan. We measured social preferences in threechamber tests, and motor stereotypies by marble burying. Cognitive flexibility is typically assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM), wherein C57BL/6J mice exhibit deficits with age. However, fatigue or locomotor impairment may confound interpretation of MWM performance. Therefore, we used a less arduous water T-maze (WTM) to compare spatial learning flexibility in 2, 9-15, and 24-month-old male and female mice to test the hypothesis that deficits would emerge with age. In both sexes, 9-15-month-olds made more chamber entries during social preference tests, while 2-month-olds did less social sniffing than aged mice. No age or sex differences emerged in marble burying or serum corticosterone measurements. In 24-month-olds hippocampal Neto1was increased relative to 2-month-olds, and male cognitive flexibility was strong, while spatial learning and reversal learning of 24-month-old females was impaired in WTM irrespective of Neto1 expression. The WTM is a useful alternative assessment for cognitive flexibility deficits in aged mice, and the role of hippocampal Neto1 in promoting social sniffing is of interest.

AB  - This study investigates the energy efficiency of the pyrolysis process of sheep manure using a fixed-bed reactor. The energy efficiency was evaluated through an energy balance approach, considering operational parameters such as holding time (120-180 min), temperature (250-400 degrees C), heating rate < 1 degrees C/sec, mass of feedstock 2.5-4 kg. The results indicated that Scheme C produced the highest char yield at 72.4%, followed by Scheme D at 56.5%, Scheme B at 31.5%, and Scheme A at 30.8%. Scheme D achieved the highest energy efficiency of 81.44%, with a holding time of 180 min and a feedstock mass of 4 kg, whereas Scheme A exhibited the lowest energy efficiency at 37.26%, with a holding time of 120 min and a feedstock mass of 2.5 kg. Linear regression analysis revealed that holding time had a strong positive correlation with char yield (correlation coefficient of 0.95), while feedstock mass showed a weaker correlation with char yield (correlation coefficient of 0.22). Additionally, energy efficiency was strongly correlated with holding time (correlation coefficient of 0.92), indicating that longer holding times resulted in higher energy efficiency. However, feedstock mass had minimal impact on energy efficiency (correlation coefficient of 0.37), and energy efficiency was directly proportional to char yield (correlation coefficient of 0.82). These findings emphasize the critical role of holding time in enhancing both energy efficiency and char yield in the pyrolysis of sheep manure.

AB  - Influenza, a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, remains a major global health concern. This study aimed to comprehensively assess the prevalence of influenza virus in different aquatic environments. Using 43 articles from four databases, we thoroughly examined water matrices from wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) and other human environments, as well as poultry habitats and areas frequented by migratory wild birds. In WTP influents (10 studies), positivity rates for influenza A ranged from 0.0 % to 97.6 %. For influenza B (8 studies), most studies reported no positivity, except for three studies reporting detection in 0.8 %, 5.6 %, and 46.9 % of samples. Within poultry habitats (13 studies), the prevalence of influenza A ranged from 4.3 % to 76.4 %, while in environments frequented by migratory wild birds (11 studies), it ranged from 0.4 % to 69.8 %. Geographically, the studies were distributed as follows: 39.5 % from the Americas, 18.6 % from Europe, 2.3 % from South -East Asia and 39.5 % from the Western Pacific. Several influenza A subtypes were found in water matrices, including avian influenza (H3N6, H3N8, H4N1, H4N2, H4N6, H4N8, H5N1, H5N8, H6N2, H6N6, H7N9, H0N8, and H11N9) and seasonal human influenza (H1N1 and H3N2). The existing literature indicates a crucial requirement for more extensive future research on this topic. Specifically, it emphasizes the need for method harmonization and delves into areas deserving of indepth research, such as water matrices pertaining to pig farming and prevalence studies in low-income countries.

AB  - An extensive effort to identify and functionally annotate long intergenic noncoding RNAs in four plant species within the mustards, including Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa.
   Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are a large yet enigmatic class of eukaryotic transcripts that can have critical biological functions. The wealth of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data available for plants provides the opportunity to implement a harmonized identification and annotation effort for lincRNAs that enables cross-species functional and genomic comparisons as well as prioritization of functional candidates. In this study, we processed >24 Tera base pairs of RNA-seq data from >16,000 experiments to identify similar to 130,000 lincRNAs in four Brassicaceae: Arabidopsis thaliana, Camelina sativa, Brassica rapa, and Eutrema salsugineum. We used nanopore RNA-seq, transcriptome-wide structural information, peptide data, and epigenomic data to characterize these lincRNAs and identify conserved motifs. We then used comparative genomic and transcriptomic approaches to highlight lincRNAs in our data set with sequence or transcriptional conservation. Finally, we used guilt-by-association analyses to assign putative functions to lincRNAs within our data set. We tested this approach on a subset of lincRNAs associated with germination and seed development, observing germination defects for Arabidopsis lines harboring T-DNA insertions at these loci. LincRNAs with Brassicaceae-conserved putative miRNA binding motifs, small open reading frames, or abiotic-stress modulated expression are a few of the annotations that will guide functional analyses into this cryptic portion of the transcriptome.

AB  - This chapter summarizes the math neurophysiological characteristics of tonic immobility (TI), in many susceptible species of mammals and birds.
   During TI, cortical EEG shows high voltage slow waves whose amount is affected by events preceding TI induction and is positively correlated with TI duration. The pattern of hippocampal activity helps to predict TI onset and TI termination. Both polysynaptic flexor and monosynaptic heteronymous reflexes are depressed independently from the EEG activity. Brain metabolism, signaled by glycogen mobilization and glucose utilization, indicates a reduced neuronal activity during TI.
   Learned avoidance responses to shock can be extinguished during TI and recover after TI. Moreover, during TI animals may learn how to avoid the shock by a motor response that may be followed by TI interruption. Decortication, decerebellation and telencephalic sections do not affect TI characteristics, whereas ponto-mesencephalic sections abolish both righting reflexes and TI.

AB  - BackgroundSpecies delimitation within Camellia sect. Thea is taxonomically challenging due to its complex evolutionary history. This study aims to utilize nuclear and chloroplast data as genomic DNA barcodes to delimit species within this economically important group of plants.ResultsWhole genome sequencing (WGS) data were obtained for 98 accessions representing all but one species in C. sect. Thea. Based on 759 high-quality SCNs, 98 whole chloroplast genomes, and by using 2x coverage clean reads from WGS for Skmer analyses, we found that combining the findings from these three data sets resulted in nearly complete species delimitation and resolution of all interspecific relationships within C. sect. Thea. We also found support for the taxonomic elevation of two varieties (C. sinensis var. assamica and C. tachangensis var. remotiserrata) to species status (C. assamica and C. remotiserrata, respectively). Furthermore, we confirmed that C. formosensis represents a distinct species. Gene tree discordances, chloroplast-nuclear conflicts and complex network-like phylogenetic relationships were observed in C. sect. Thea.ConclusionCompared with the use of single parentally inherited chloroplast data sources, utilizing both uniparentally inherited chloroplast data and biparentally inherited nuclear data improved the species delimitation of taxa within C. sect. Thea. The intricate phylogenetic relationships observed are likely a result of widespread past hybridization and chloroplast capture events among species within this group, which may have blurred the species boundaries. Our novel approach to species delimitation within C. sect. Thea may serve as a blueprint for employing genomic DNA barcodes in other taxa with complex histories, and will significantly contribute to the conservation of cultivated tea plant species and their wild relatives.

AB  - Under a changing climate, harvesting management and exploiting the genotypic divergence of Egyptian clover cultivars offers a biologically viable solution to sustainably boost the milk productivity of dairy animals. Two multi-season field trials were executed under semi-arid conditions whereby the first experiment aimed to assess the potential of Egyptian clover cultivars (Berseem Agaiti, Anmol and SB-11) for nutritional quality attributes and the digestibility of green forage and hay, forage palatability and milk productivity of buffaloes fed on hay. In the second field investigation, new promising line, SB-11, was tested for seed production potential under varying dates of the last harvesting regimes (10, 20 and 30 March along with 9 April and 19 April) owing to a sharp hike in temperature. In terms of the nutritive value of green forage and hay, SB-11 remained superior for recording the maximum crude protein (CP), ash, fat and nitrogen-free extract except dry matter (DM) content that was exhibited by the Anmol cultivar. Additionally, SB-11 remained unmatched by giving a minimum crude fiber (CF), while Berseem Agaiti yielded the lesser nutritive forage by producing 4% and 2% higher CF than SB-11 and Anmol, respectively. Moreover, SB-11 recorded the maximum digestibility of CP and DM. Furthermore, SB-11 exhibited a 6% and 9% higher palatability along with 8% and 11% higher milk production than Anmol and Berseem Agaiti, respectively. Additionally, 20 March surpassed the rest of the cutting dates by exhibiting 7%, 23%, 50% and 207% more seed yield than 10 March, 30 March, 9 April and 19 April, respectively, indicating quite a pronounced effect of the last cutting management on the seed production potential of Egyptian clover. The research findings suggest SB-11 as a promising genotype for bridging the nutritive gap of quality feed (forage and hay) for buffaloes along with addressing the seed production challenge of Egyptian clover.

AB  - BackgroundThe demand for natural product-based treatment options for livestock is increasing by animals' owners, veterinarians and policy makers. But at the same time, the traditional knowledge about it is at risk of falling into oblivion in Europe. The present study recorded this knowledge for the linguistically and geographically interesting Swiss canton of Valais.MethodOpen, semi-structured interviews were used to collect detailed information on formulations and applications, including plant species and natural substances, origin of material, extraction and preparation of herbal products, indication and type of application, dosage, sources of knowledge, frequency of usage and self-assessment of the treatment.Results and discussionIn the course of 43 interviews, 173 homemade single species herbal remedy report (HSHR) were recorded. They included 53 plant species from 30 botanical families. Plant species from the botanical families of Asteraceae, Rubiaceae and Cupressaceae were mentioned the most, while the most frequently documented plant species were Coffea arabica L., Juniperus sabina L., Arnica montana L. and Matricaria chamomilla L. For the 173 HSHR, a total of 215 uses were mentioned, most of which were for the treatment of gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders, followed by skin lesions and genito-urinary tract problems. Regional peculiarities emerged, such as the use of Leontopodium alpinum Cass. for diarrhea in the French-speaking Valais, while Matricaria chamomilla and Camellia sinensis L. were used in the German-speaking part instead. In comparison with other regions of Switzerland, 10 plants were reported for the first time, including Juniperus sabina with 18 use reports.ConclusionThe daily use on farms and the high satisfaction of farmers with homemade herbal remedies demonstrate their high practical relevance. In conclusion, the traditional regional knowledge about the use of medicinal plants is not only a cultural heritage worth protecting, but also an essential resource for the further development of European veterinary medicine.

AB  - The gut microbiota is a repository of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which may affect the health of humans and animals. The intestinal flora is affected by many factors but it is unclear how the intestinal microflora and antibiotic resistome in rabbits might change under dietary intervention. Feeding with lettuce led to the amplification and transfer of exogenous ARGs in the intestinal flora, but there were no significant differences when fed lettuces grown with dif-ferent manure types. For example, the lsaC of lettuce fed with bovine, chicken and pig manure without adding organic fertilizer increased by 0.143, 0.151, 0.179 and 0.169 logs respectively after 4 weeks, and the efrB also increased by 0.074, 0.068, 0.079 and 0.106 logs respectively. Network analysis showed that Clostridium_ sensu_ stricto_ 18 was a po-tential host of type 6 virulence factor genes (VFGs). Mantel analysis showed that ARGs were directly influenced by mo-bile genetic elements (MGEs) and VFGs. Thus, feeding rabbits lettuce grown with different manure types contribute to the transmission of ARGs by remodeling the intestinal microenvironment. In addition, diet may affect exogenous ARGs to change the intestinal antibiotic resistome and possibly threaten health.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by amyloid-beta (A$) plaque accumulation, chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis, leading to cognitive decline. Recent preclinical studies have highlighted the neuroprotective effects of Asiaticoside (AS) and Madecassoside (MS), two primary triterpenoid saponins derived from C. asiatica. These compounds show promise in addressing multiple pathological pathways associated with AD. AS and MS exhibit potent antiamyloidogenic properties, effectively inhibiting A$ aggregation and reducing plaque formation, primarily through direct binding to amyloid peptides and disruption of fibrillogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrated that AS prevents the early stages of A$ aggregation, while in vivo research confirms its role in reducing plaque deposition in critical brain regions like the hippocampus, enhancing cognitive function. MS similarly disrupts A$ aggregation, as shown through molecular docking studies, and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing amyloid burden and improving synaptic health in AD models. Both compounds also modulate neuroinflammation by downregulating key inflammatory pathways, such as NF-kB and MAPK. AS reduces proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6) by inhibiting NF-kB activation, while MS downregulates iNOS and COX-2, thereby alleviating neuroinflammatory damage. Notably, both saponins activate the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, contributing to an enhanced cellular antioxidant response, reducing oxidative stress, and stabilizing mitochondrial function. These anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms further protect against cognitive decline associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Additionally, AS and MS prevent neuronal apoptosis by modulating apoptotic signaling pathways, such as caspase-3 inhibition and upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2. In vivo studies indicate that these compounds support cognitive function and synaptic integrity, as demonstrated by improved memory and learning outcomes in AD animal models, likely via enhanced synaptic plasticity and cholinergic support. In conclusion, the triterpenoids AS and MS show multifaceted neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of AD. Their abilities to inhibit A$ aggregation, modulate neuroinflammation, enhance mitochondrial function, and prevent neuronal apoptosis highlight their therapeutic potential. These findings warrant further exploration in clinical studies to assess their viability as treatments for AD. (c) 2025 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) culture depends on the availability of seeds which is affected by asynchronous spawning and brooders availability. The possible solution for these problems is the use of cryopreserved, high quality gametes from selected individuals. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of different extenders, different concentrations of cryoprotectants and dilution ratios on the spermatological properties of cryopreserved cobia milt was analysed. Milt was collected from R. canadum brooders and diluted with Marine Fish Ringer's Solution (MFRS) and 0.85% physiological saline (PS) as extenders and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) as cryoprotectant at three different concentrations (5, 10 and 15%) at three dilution ratios such as 1:5, 1:10 and 1:15. Motility duration, motility pattern, motility score and percentage of live and dead cells were analysed. The milt was rapidly frozen employing liquid nitrogen vapour for 10 min. The milt sample diluted with PS and 10% DMSO at 1:5 dilution ratio exhibited highest post-thaw motility parameters.

AB  - Being part of the Algerian steppes, the Djelfa region is characterized by a semi-arid climate, where groundwater resources are very low. They are the only source for human, agricultural and industrial food. This study focuses on the Mio-Plio-Quaternary groundwater. Its purpose is to study the physicochemical parameters, the main chemical elements, the origin of the mineralization as well as the possible sources of pollution. To this end, 19 water samples were taken during the low water period (November 2019) and were subjected to physico-chemical analyzes to determine the parameters: T degrees C, EC, pH, TDS, Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, and NO3-. According to Piper's diagram, 74% of the waters in the study area have chloride, calcium sulfate and magnesium facies; 26% are calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. To extract and visualize the important information contained in these multivariate data; principal component analysis synthesizes this information and has highlighted the main phenomenon of mineralization, which is essentially the dissolution of rock by contact with water. The high concentrations of nitrates (> 50 mg/l) in the study area come mainly from the fertilizers used, the excrement of sheep livestock, given the agricultural nature of the region and the presence of discharge points located near certain wells of water and the Djelfa-Mellah wadi.

AB  - An agricultural product plays a major role in the economical growth of developing countries. Agricultural products like pepper and corn are the essential crops with respect to human health food security. But, these two crops are prone to different diseases such as gray leaf spot, common rust and fruit rot which affects the productivity of crops. Further, the severity identification is also a challenging one. To address these limitations, this work presents different approaches for identifying the crop lesions and predicting the severity and thereby increasing the productivity of crops. The development of the proposed model includes steps such as dataset collection, noise removal, segmentation, feature extraction, classification and severity prediction. Initially, the crop images are pre-processed by the median filter and the pre-processed images are processed are segmented, extracted and classified by the optimized U-Net model. Moreover, hybrid optimizer which is the integration of GJA (Golden jackal algorithm) and RDA (Red deer algorithm) are utilized for precise segmentation and classification. Finally, the severity prediction is computed for the diseased leaves by the measuring the size of image pixels. The experimentation is carried out on the benchmark PlantVillage dataset; the accuracy and precision values achieved are 99.2% and 99.1%. Thus, the experimental outcomes show the effectiveness and stability of the model.

AB  - BACKGROUND Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is an effective means that can efficiently regulate the metabolism and health of animals and humans. However, the effect of TRF on hypothalamic function remains unclear. RESULTS Results showed that TRF significantly increased the activities of digestive enzymes lipase, maltase in the duodenum and lipase, trypsin in the pancreas whereas significantly decreased serum gastrointestinal hormones gastrin, glucagon-like peptide-1, cholecystokinin, peptide YY, and ghrelin. Metabolites related to amino acid metabolism, including citrulline, kynurenine, N-acetylleucine, l-tryptophan, and l-tyrosine, significantly increased in the TRF group. Differential metabolites were mainly enriched in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis and tryptophan metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis of hypothalamus showed that a total of 462 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly changed by TRF. In particular, DEGs such as DDC, TH, GOT2, and DBH involved in aromatic amino acid metabolism pathways were significantly downregulated, whereas the expression of CYP1B1 was significantly upregulated. Moreover, DEGs (PDYN and PPP3CA) involved in amphetamine addiction and cocaine addiction were also downregulated in the TRF group. CONCLUSION Taken together, these results suggested that TRF improved the digestion and absorption of nutrients and thus increased the accessibilities of aromatic amino acids. The increasing of circulating aromatic amino acids might mediate the regulatory neuroendocrine effects of TRF regimes on the hypothalamus functions, especially on drug addictions. This study reveals a possible mechanism underlying the effects of regulating feeding patterns on the function of the hypothalamus by altering aromatic amino acids metabolism.

AB  - Trans-urocanic acid (trans-UCA) is an isomer of cis-UCA and is widely distributed in the brain, predominantly in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Previous studies have investigated the role of trans-UCA in non-spatial memory; however, its influence on spatial memory remains unclear. In the present study, network pharmacology strategy and behavioral testing were used to evaluate the role of trans-UCA in spatial memory and predict its possible mechanism. The results showed that there are 40 intersecting targets between trans-UCA and spatial memory identified by several databases and Venn diagram, indicating that trans-UCA may be involved in spatial memory. Behavioral results show that trans-UCA facilitates spatial working memory in the Y-maze test as well as spatial recognition memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in an object location recognition (OLR) task. Furthermore, PPI (protein-protein interaction) network analysis, GO (gene ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathway enrichment analyses show that the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhancing effect of trans-UCA on spatial memory are mainly associated with the regulation of insulin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathways, serotonergic synapse and arginine and proline metabolism. The results of this study suggest that trans-UCA facilitates spatial memory in the Y-maze test and OLR task and may offer therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying mechanisms predicted by network pharmacology should be further verified.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental mechanism contributing to proteome diversity, yet its comprehensive landscape and regulatory dynamics during skeletal muscle development remain largely unexplored. Here, the temporal AS profiles are investigated during myogenesis in five vertebrates, conducting comprehensive profiling across 27 developmental stages in skeletal muscle and encompassing ten tissues in adult pigs. The analysis reveals a pervasive and evolutionarily conserved pattern of alternative exon usage throughout myogenic differentiation, with hundreds of skipped exons (SEs) showing developmental regulation, particularly within skeletal muscle. Notably, this study identifies a muscle-specific SE (exon 15) within the Fxr1 gene, whose AS generates two dynamically expressed isoforms with distinct functions: the isoform without exon 15 (Fxr1E15-) regulates myoblasts proliferation, while the isoform incorporating exon 15 (Fxr1E15+) promotes myogenic differentiation and fusion. Transcriptome analysis suggests that specifically knocking-down Fxr1E15+ isoform in myoblasts modulates differentiation by influencing gene expression and splicing of specific targets. The increased inclusion of exon 15 during differentiation is mediated by the binding of Rbm24 to the intron. Furthermore, in vivo experiments indicate that the Fxr1E15+ isoform facilitates muscle regeneration. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive resource for AS studies in skeletal muscle development, underscoring the diverse functions and regulatory mechanisms governing distinct Fxr1 isoforms in myogenesis.

AB  - Background: Repetitive atrial activation patterns (RAAPs) during atrial fibrillation (AF) may be associated with localized mechanisms that maintain AF. Current electro-anatomical mapping systems are unsuitable for analyzing RAAPs due to the trade-off between spatial coverage and electrode density in clinical catheters. This work proposes a technique to overcome this trade-off by constructing composite maps from spatially overlapping sequential recordings. Methods: High-density epicardial contact mapping was performed during open-chest surgery in goats (n=16, left and right atria) with 3 or 22 weeks of sustained AF (249-electrode array, electrode distance 2.4 mm). A dataset mimicking sequential recordings was generated by segmenting the grid into four spatially overlapping regions (each region 6.5 cm2, 48 +/- 10% overlap) without temporal overlap. RAAPs were detected in each region using recurrence plots of activation times. RAAPs in two different regions were joined in case of RAAP cross-recurrence between overlapping electrodes. We quantified the reconstruction success rate and quality of the composite maps. Results: Of 1021 RAAPs found in the full mapping array (32 +/- 13 per recording), 328 spatiotemporally stable RAAPs were analyzed. 247 composite maps were generated (75% success) with a quality of 0.86 +/- 0.21 (Pearson correlation). Success was significantly affected by the RAAP area. Quality was weakly correlated with the number of repetitions of RAAPs (r=0.13, p<0.05) and not affected by the atrial side (left or right) or AF duration (3 or 22 weeks of AF). Conclusions: Constructing composite maps by combining spatially overlapping sequential recordings is feasible. Interpretation of these maps can play a central role in ablation planning.

AB  - Epidemiological studies show that social determinants of health are amongst the strongest factors associated with developmental outcomes after prenatal and perinatal brain injuries, even when controlling for the severity of the initial injury. Elevated socioeconomic status and a higher level of parental education correlate with improved neurologic function after premature birth. Conversely, children experiencing early life adversity have worse outcomes after developmental brain injuries. Animal models have provided vital insight into mechanisms perturbed by developmental brain injuries, which have indicated directions for novel therapeutics or interventions. Animal models have also been used to learn how social environments affect brain maturation through enriched environments and early adverse conditions. We recognize animal models cannot fully recapitulate human social circumstances. However, we posit that mechanistic studies combining models of developmental brain injuries and early-life social environments will provide insight into pathways important for recovery. Some studies combining enriched environments with neonatal hypoxic injury models have shown improvements in developmental outcomes, but further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these improvements. By contrast, there have been more limited studies of the effects of adverse conditions on developmental brain injury extent and recovery. Uncovering the biological underpinnings for early life social experiences has translational relevance, enabling the development of novel strategies to improve outcomes through lifelong treatment. With the emergence of new technologies to analyze subtle molecular and behavioral phenotypes, here we discuss the opportunities for combining animal models of developmental brain injury with social construct models to deconvolute the complex interactions between injury, recovery, and social inequity.

AB  - Simple Summary This study focuses on preserving four endangered local sheep breeds in the Italian eastern Alps, reared in small-scale farms. This study aims to assess the nutritional quality of their products (milk and meat) and explore ways to enhance their market value, thus supporting farmers economically. Results indicated that the milk and meat from the four breeds have unique qualities that could be promoted to increase consumer awareness and demand. By developing specific guidelines for the production and marketing of local sheep products, this research helps create a local supply chain based on the positive externalities that local breeds in mountain areas have on the environment.Abstract Local sheep breeds in the Italian eastern Alps passed from ex situ to in situ conservation. These breeds are mainly reared by smallholders in low-input farming systems. To allow the sustainable use of genetic resources, the economic sustainability of farmers must be supported through production guidelines. Analyzing meat and milk composition and fatty acid profile, we aimed to characterize their products based on breed and diet to identify tailormade sales strategies. Results showed that both meat and milk have good nutritional values and can benefit from a pasture-based diet, irrespective of the breed. These results support the redaction of production guidelines based on the peculiar characteristics of these breeds: being multi-purpose breeds adapted to mountain areas and to grazing, thus contributing to the conservation of cultural and landscape heritage.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are thought to underlie a progressive impairment of neural plasticity. Previous work in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease shows pronounced changes in artificially-induced plasticity in hippocampus, perirhinal and prefrontal cortex. However, it is not known how degeneration disrupts intrinsic forms of brain plasticity. Here we characterised the impact of tauopathy on a simple form of intrinsic plasticity in the visual system, which allowed us to track plasticity at both long (days) and short (minutes) timescales. We studied rTg4510 transgenic mice at early stages of tauopathy (5 months) and a more advanced stage (8 months). We recorded local field potentials in the primary visual cortex while animals were repeatedly exposed to a stimulus over 9 days. We found that both short- and long-term visual plasticity were already disrupted at early stages of tauopathy, and further reduced in older animals, such that it was abolished in mice expressing mutant tau. Additionally, visually evoked behaviours were disrupted in both younger and older mice expressing mutant tau. Our results show that visual cortical plasticity and visually evoked behaviours are disrupted in the rTg4510 model of tauopathy. This simple measure of plasticity may help understand how tauopathy disrupts neural circuits, and offers a translatable platform for detection and tracking of the disease.
   Amalia Papanikolaou and Fabio Rodrigues et al. examine visual cortical function and intrinsic plasticity using the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model. They demonstrate that, while basal visual cortical responses seem largely unaffected, intrinsic plasticity and the behavioural response to a visual stimulus is compromised, even in young rTg4510 mice.

AB  - For the past few decades, global goat populations exceeds the world population growth especially in Africa and Asia. Because of this, the bio-waste has been increasing drastically. So, this research aims to utilize the excess goat dung as a reinforcement material for the production of a sustainable composite material with enhanced morphological and mechanical properties. The fabricated hybrid composites consist of Al8011alloy as a matrix material, Goat Dung Ash (GDA) and Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) as a reinforcement particles with various proportions from 0% to 10%. Microstructural analysis was performed to estimate the uniform distribution of reinforcement particles. The inclusion of GDA particles along with the Si3N4 particles increased tensile, flexural, and hardness strength with a minor reduction in impact strength (+21.8%, +7%, +62% and-5.5%) when compared with the unreinforced alloys. The transformation of ductile to brittle phase, clustering, crack propagations, necking, dimples, and cleavage facets were inspected in the fractured specimens. The incorporation of an optimal combination of Si3N4 and GDA reinforcement particles results in fine grain structure which restricts the dislocation moments during the action of external load and also prevents the propagation of slip. Similarly, the strong interfacial bonding and adhesion between the soft ductile Al8011 and the Si3N4/GDA reinforcement particles are attributed to the composites' strengthening process. This research work proves that the use of bio-waste in the fabrication of composites has the potential benefit in enhancing the morphological and mechanical properties.

AB  - Trichomes function in plant defenses against biotic and abiotic stresses; examination of glabrous lines, which lack trichomes, has revealed key aspects of trichome development and function. Tests of allelism in 51 glabrous rice (Oryza sativa) accessions collected worldwide identified OsSPL10 and OsWOX3B as regulators of trichome development in rice. Here, we report that OsSPL10 acts as a transcriptional regulator controlling trichome development. Haplotype and transient expression analyses revealed that variation in the approximately 700-bp OsSPL10 promoter region is the primary cause of the glabrous phenotype in the indica cultivar WD-17993. Disruption of OsSPL10 by genome editing decreased leaf trichome density and length in the NIL-HL6 background. Plants with genotype OsSPL10(WD-17993)/HL6 generated by crossing WD-17993 with NIL-HL6 also had fewer trichomes in the glumes. HAIRY LEAF6 (HL6) encodes another transcription factor that regulates trichome initiation and elongation, and OsSPL10 directly binds to the HL6 promoter to regulate its expression. Moreover, the transcript levels of auxin-related genes, such as OsYUCCA5 and OsPIN-FORMED1b, were altered in OsSPL10 overexpression and RNAi transgenic lines. Feeding tests using locusts (Locusta migratoria) demonstrated that non-glandular trichomes affect feeding by this herbivore. Our findings provide a molecular framework for trichome development and an ecological perspective on trichome functions.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a common cause of male infertility. Sertoli cells are one of the target cells of oxidative injury, which leads to impaired testicular function. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is critical in Sertoli cell function. However, the role of FSH in the response of goat Sertoli cells to H2O2-induced oxidative stress has not been studied yet. To investigate this response, we established an oxidative stress model using goat Sertoli cells. FSH pretreatment significantly enhanced the decreased cell viability (p < 0.05) caused by oxidative injury and inhibited autophagic flux. FSH significantly increased p62 mRNA and protein levels (p < 0.01). Further investigations revealed that FSH also increased the expression level and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in Sertoli cells (p < 0.01), which resulted in increased antioxidant enzyme activity (p < 0.05). In contrast, treatment with siNrf2 and sip62 abolished this protective effect of FSH. These findings suggest that FSH protects Sertoli cells against oxidative stress via the p62-Nrf2 pathway, and that p62 accumulation maintains persistent activation of Nrf2. Thus, p62 and Nrf2 are required for FSH-mediated protective role in H2O2-induced Sertoli cell injury. The findings reveal new mechanisms by which FSH protects against oxidative injury in goat Sertoli cells. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - According to the reconsolidation theory, memories can be modified through the destabilization-reconsolidation process. The rodent perirhinal cortex (PER; Brodmann areas 35 and 36) critically participates in the process of fear conditioning. Previous studies showed that some of the parahippocampal regions are critical for contextual fear memory reconsolidation. In our research, through a three-day paradigm of CFC, we showed that protein synthesis in PER of rats is required for memory reconsolidation, and activation of CB1 pathway is necessary but not sufficient in inducing memory destabilization. This result underlines parahippocampal regions in destabilization and reconsolidation process of fear memory besides amygdala and hippocampus.

AB  - The SLC7A5 gene encodes a Na+ and pH-independent transporter protein that regulates cell growth by regulating the uptake of AA. This study, utilizing RNA-seq, aimed to explore the effect of SLC7A5 on the synthesis of milk proteins and fats in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) through gene interference and overexpression techniques. The results demonstrated that the overexpression of SLC7A5 resulted in a significant increase in the expression of CSN1S1, SCD, CEBPB, ACACA, alpha(S1)-casein, p-S6K, and p-S6. The levels of p-S6K and p-S6 gradually increased as the AA/Leu stimulation time lengthened. The overexpression of SLC7A5 rescued the role of Torin1 in GMECs. In conclusion, SLC7A5 plays a crucial role in promoting the synthesis of milk proteins and milk fats through the mTOR signaling pathway in GMECs, providing a theoretical foundation for improving the quality of goat milk.

AB  - Cheese production causes significant environmental impacts, which have to be reduced. In France, a lot of different cheeses are available, made from different milks but also from different cheese technologies. The goal of this study was to understand the origin of the environmental impact variation between cheeses made from different technologies and milks and produced using different ripening practices. To do so, the environmental impacts of 44 different types of French artisanal cheese, all produced under protected designation of origin (PDO) labels, were assessed using the life cycle assessment. Cheese technologies were fully described and two ripening scenarios were investigated. Results show that the differences of environmental impacts between cheeses mainly come from: the milk type (cow, goat, or sheep), the milk amount needed to produce one kilogram of cheese, the energetic performance of the ripening room, and the ripening time. Such results could be useful to cheesemakers to identify the origin of the environmental impacts of their products and to implement effective actions to reduce them. According to the results, innovations leading to the reduction in electrical consumption during ripening are interesting to explore in order to increase the environmental performance of a cheese.

AB  - Aging often leads to a decline in various cognitive domains, potentially contributing to spatial navigation challenges among older individuals. While the Morris water maze is a common tool in rodents research for evaluating allocentric spatial memory function, its translation to studying aging in humans, particularly its association with hippocampal dysfunction, has predominantly focused on spatial reference memory assessments. This study expanded the adaptation of the Morris water maze for older adults to assess flexible, rapid, one-trial working memory. This adaptation involved a spatial search task guided by allocentric cues within a 3-D virtual reality (VR) environment. The sensitivity of this approach to aging was examined in 146 community-living adults from three Chinese cities, categorized into three age groups. Significant performance deficits were observed in participants over 60 years old compared to younger adults aged between 18 and 43. However, interpreting these findings was complicated by factors such as psychomotor slowness and potential variations in task engagement, except during the probe tests. Notably, the transition from the 60 s to the 70 s was not associated with a substantial deterioration of performance. A distinction only emerged when the pattern of spatial search over the entire maze was examined in the probe tests when the target location was never revealed. The VR task's sensitivity to overall cognitive function in older adults was reinforced by the correlation between Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and probe test performance, demonstrating up to 17 % shared variance beyond that predicted by chronological age alone. In conclusion, while implementing a VR-based adaptation of rodent water maze paradigms in older adults was feasible, our experience highlighted specific interpretative challenges that must be addressed before such a test can effectively supplement traditional cognitive assessment tools in evaluating age-related cognitive decline.

AB  - An in vivo study was conducted into the effects of partial replacement of dried ground corn grain with dried whey - as a supplement to alfalfa haylage (AH) or Italian ryegrass haylage (IRH) - on ad libitum intake, in vivo digestibility and N retention in wether sheep. The chemical composition of AH and IRH was roughly the same, except for the crude protein (CP) content which was much higher in AH compared with IRH. Sheep fed the AH -based diet had higher feed intake. Higher CP digestibility and higher N retention, as well as higher levels of excreted N, were shown compared IRHbased diet. The IRH-based diet increased the digestibility of chemical parameters studied, except CP and starch. The partial replacement of corn grain with dried whey reduced the intake of acid detergent fibre (ADF), improved the starch digestibility in AH and IRH-based diets, and increased the overall N intake in wethers fed the AH -based diet. In practical conditions, replacing 10% of corn grain with dried whey in a ration based on higher quality forage is a way to increase N intake in sheep. In conclusion, the partial replacement of corn grain with dried whey in a forage-based diet with higher CP content improves the nitrogen efficiency in the diet of wether sheep.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the effects of Bovine somatotropin (rbST) and oxytocin on various health biomarkers, reproductive performance and milk composition of buffaloes during spring and hot summer. A total of 60 Nili-Ravi buffaloes were randomly divided into three groups based on their milk production. Low (1-2.9 liters/milking), medium (3-5.9 liters/milking) and High (6-12 liters/milking), with (n=10) animals in each group during spring and summer. Animals of respective groups received recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) (Boostin-250 manufactured by LG Life Sciences, Ltd, South Korea and distributed by M/S Ghazi Brothers, Pakistan) 35mg on alternate days and oxytocin 10 IU before each milking, starting on day 70 postpartum till the end of lactation. Blood samples were collected to determine Total oxidant status (TOS), Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Milk samples were analyzed for fat, protein, lactose and SNF contents. Reproductive performance parameters were assessed by rectal palpation and from farm record. Results revealed that mean ALT, AST and TOS activity was significantly higher during summer. Milk production was very well correlated with their assigned groups of milk production during spring. Milk fat, protein and lactose contents decreased due to rbST, oxytocin or rbST+ oxytocin treatment. In conclusion during summer, milk yield was increased after rbST+ oxytocin treatment, but decreased following treatment with either hormone.

AB  - Adult male and female Murrah buffalo fibroblast cells were used as donors for the production of embryos using handmade cloning. Both donor cells and reconstructed embryos were treated with 50 nM trichostatin-A (TSA) and 7.5 nM 5-aza-2 '-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). The blastocyst rate of both treated male (40.1% +/- 2.05) and female (37.0% +/- 0.83) embryos was significantly lower than in untreated control males (49.7% +/- 3.80) and females (47.2% +/- 2.44) but their apoptotic index was lower (male, control: 5.90 +/- 0.48; treated: 4.96 +/- 0.31): (female, control: 8.11 +/- 0.67; treated: 6.65 +/- 0.43) and epigenetic status in terms of global acetylation and methylation of histone was significantly improved. The expression level of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) was higher (P < 0.05) and that of PGK, G6PD, OCT 4, IFN-tau and CASPASE3 was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in treated male blastocyst than control and the expression levels of DNMT1, IGF1R and BCL-XL were not significantly different between the two groups. In the female embryos, the relative mRNA abundance of OCT4 was significantly higher (P < 0.05), and that of XIST and CASPASE3 was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the epigenetic modifier-treated group compared with that of the control group, whereas the expression levels of HPRT, PGK, G6PD, DNMT1, IFN-tau, IGF1R and BCL-XL were not significantly different between the two groups. In both embryos, a similar effect of treatment was observed on genes related to growth and development, but the effect on the expression of X-linked genes varied. These results indicate that not all X-linked genes respond to TSA and 5-aza-dC treatment in the same manner.

AB  - Biotic stresses caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens damage crops; identifying treatments that enhance disease resistance provides important information for understanding plant defenses and sustainable agriculture. Salt stress affects crop yields worldwide; however, studies have focused on the toxic sodium ion, leaving the effects of the chloride ion unclear. In this study, we found that irrigation with a combination of chloride salts (MgCl2, CaCl2, and KCl) suppressed the cell death phenotype of the ceramide kinase mutant acd5. Chloride salt pre-irrigation also significantly limited the cell death caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola infection and inhibited the multiplication of this bacterial pathogen in a mechanism partially dependent on the salicylic acid pathway. Moreover, chloride salt pre-irrigation improved plant defenses against the fungal pathogen challenge, confining the lesion area caused by Botrytis cinerea infection. Furthermore, the growth of herbivorous larvae of Spodoptera exigua was retarded by feeding on chloride salt irrigated plants. Thus, our data suggest that treatment with Cl- increases broad spectrum resistance to biotic challenges.

AB  - Livestock slurry has been reported to be a potential secondary raw material as it contains macronutrients -nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium-, which could be valorised as high-quality fertilizers if proper separation and concentration of valuable compounds is performed. In this work, pig slurry liquid fraction was assessed for nutrient recovery and val-orisation as fertilizer. Some indicators were used to evaluate the performance of proposed train of technologies within the framework of circular economy. As ammonium and potassium species are highly soluble at the whole pH range, a study based on phosphate speciation at pH from 4 to 8 was assessed to improve the macronutrients recovery from the slurry, resulting in two different treatment trains at acidic and alkaline conditions. The acidic treatment system based on centrifugation, microfiltration and forward osmosis was applied to obtain a nutrient-rich liquid organic fertilizer containing 1.3 % N, 1.3 % P2O5 and 1.5 % K2O. The alkaline path of valorisation was composed by centrifugation and stripping by using membrane contactors to produce an organic solid fertilizer -7.7 % N, 8,0 % P2O5 and 2.3 % K2O-, ammonium sulphate solution -1.4 % N-and irrigation water. In terms of circularity indicators, 45.8 % of the initial water content and <50 % of contained nutrients were recovered -28.3 % N, 43.5 % P2O5 and 46.6 % K2O -in the acidic treatment resulting in 68.68 g fertilizer per kg of treated slurry. 75.1 % of water was recovered as irriga-tion water and 80.6 % N, 99.9 % P2O5, 83.4 % K2O was valorised in the alkaline treatment, as 219.60 g fertilizer per kg of treated slurry. Treatment paths at acidic and alkaline conditions yield promising results for nutrients recovery and valorisation as the obtained products (nutrient rich organic fertilizer, solid soil amendment and ammonium sulphate solution) fulfil the European Regulation for fertilizers to be potentially used in crop fields.

AB  - Background: There is a growing interest in the impact of air pollution from livestock farming on respiratory health. Studies in adults suggest adverse effects of livestock farm emissions on lung function, but so far, studies involving children and adolescents are lacking. Objectives: To study the association of residential proximity to livestock farms and modelled particulate matter <= 10 mu m (PM10) from livestock farms with lung function in adolescence. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study among 715 participants of the Dutch prospective PIAMA (Pre-vention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy) birth cohort study. Relationships of different indicators of residential livestock farming exposure (distance to farms, distance-weighted number of farms, cattle, pigs, poultry, horses and goats within 3 km; modelled atmospheric PM10 concentrations from livestock farms) with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) at age 16 were assessed by linear regression taking into account potential confounders. Associations were expressed per interquartile range in-crease in exposure.Results: Higher exposure to livestock farming was consistently associated with a lower FEV1, but not with FVC among participants living in less urbanized municipalities (<1500 addresses/km2, N = 402). Shorter distances of homes to livestock farms were associated with a 1.4% (0.2%; 2.7%) lower FEV1. Larger numbers of farms within 3 km and higher concentrations of PM10 from livestock farming were associated with a 1.8% (0.8%, 2.9%) and 0.9% (0.4%,1.5%) lower FEV1, respectively.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that higher exposure to livestock farming is associated with a lower FEV1 in adolescents. Replication and more research on the etiologic agents involved in these associations and the un-derlying mechanisms is needed.

AB  - The hypothesis that pigs fed a low crude protein (CP) diet with 6% spray-dried plasma (SDP) in phase 1 will have improved growth and intestinal health if the phase-2 diet contains 2.5% SDP was tested. Three hundred weaned pigs were used. Growth performance, feces, blood, and intestinal tissue were evaluated. Pigs fed 6% SDP in phase 1 had improved average daily gain (ADG) and final body weight (BW), but had reduced villus-height-to-crypt-depth ratio in phase 2 if 2.5% SDP was included in the normal-CP diet (p < 0.05), but not in the low-CP diet. Diarrhea incidence was less (p < 0.05) with 2.5% SDP in the phase 2 diet and for the low-CP diet. Ileal mucosa interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-1 beta decreased (p < 0.05) for pigs fed the phase-1 diet with 6% SDP compared with pigs fed the diet without SDP. Addition of 2.5% SDP in phase 2 reduced (p < 0.05) IL-1 beta compared with the diet without SDP. Although the combination of SDP and low CP did not affect intestinal health in phase 2, diarrhea incidence and pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced in pigs fed SDP in phase 1 or phase 2 or if a low-CP diet was fed.

AB  - Volatile plant compounds are essential for host plant selection by herbivores and particularly important for the behaviour of parasitoids seeking larvae in which to lay eggs. Headspace extracts were collected from intact plants of four Brassica oleracea genotypes, as well as from plants damaged by larvae of Mamestra brassicae or Pieris rapae. In total, 52 volatiles present in the headspaces of four genotypes were selected for multivariate analyses. The most abundant groups of volatiles were terpenes and esters, represented by 20 and 14 compounds, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative differences in odour profiles between the four genotypes were sufficient to differentiate between groups using multivariate analysis techniques. The most distinct volatile blends originated from curly kale, followed by cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli. Multivariate analysis revealed that genotypes affected the composition of the volatile blends to a large extent compared to the herbivore damage by the different species tested. In curly kale, broccoli and cauliflower, the differences in odour bouquets were more expressed between plants with and without active feeding, independent of the herbivore identity, while in cabbage, larger differences were observed between odour profiles with different herbivore feedings, independent of whether the herbivore was present or removed.

AB  - Genetic diversity plays a crucial role in determining the ability of populations to evolve. We investigated the genetic variation of the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey by integrating adaptive MHC genes and neutral microsatellites. We found that neutral loci exhibited high heterozygosity and a high degree of polymorphism, while MHC genes showed high heterozygosity and moderate polymorphism. Additionally, positive selection and trans-species evolution indicated that historical balancing selection might have sustained the MHC polymorphism. This study provides valuable scientific evidence and a reference for formulating or amending conservation strategies for black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys. Genetic diversity is an essential indicator that echoes the natural selection and environmental adaptation of a species. Isolated small populations are vulnerable to genetic drift, inbreeding, and limited gene flow; thus, assessing their genetic diversity is critical in conservation. In this study, we studied the genetic diversity of black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) using neutral microsatellites and five adaptive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. Two DQA1 alleles, two DQB1 alleles, two DRB1 alleles, two DRB5 alleles, and three DPB1 alleles were isolated from a population. The results indicate that neutral microsatellites demonstrate a high degree of heterozygosity and polymorphism, while adaptive MHC genes display a high degree of heterozygosity and moderate polymorphism. The results also show that balancing selection has prominently influenced the MHC diversity of the species during evolution: (1) significant positive selection is identified at several amino acid sites (primarily at and near antigen-binding sites) of the DRB1, DRB5, and DQB1 genes; (2) phylogenetic analyses display the patterns of trans-species evolution for all MHC loci. This study provides valuable genetic diversity insights into black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys, which dwell at the highest altitude and have experienced the harshest environmental selection of all primates globally since the Pleistocene. Such results provide valuable scientific evidence and a reference for making or amending conservation strategies for this endangered primate species.

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the variance, heritability, and genetic correlation of growth traits in Inner Mongolia white cashmere goats (Erlangshan type) (IMWCG-ER). Data collected from the Erlang Mountain Ranch in 2022-2023 were analyzed. The traits studied included birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), pre-weaning daily gain (ADG), and the 12-month weight (12W). In animal models, single and multi-trait analyses were performed using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method to estimate genetic parameters, and six different models were fitted for each trait by ignoring or including maternal permanent environmental effects, maternal additive genetic effects, and the interaction with individual additive genetic effects. The accuracy and suitability of each model were tested using the likelihood ratio and AIC and BIC tests. The heritability estimates of birth weight, weaning weight, daily gain before weaning, and the 12-month weight were 0.3884, 0.2951, 0.2749, and 0.2192, respectively. The absolute value of the genetic correlation coefficient between traits ranged from -0.8700 to 0.5529. The highest genetic association was between birth weight and pre-weaning daily gain (-0.8700), followed by birth weight and the 12-month weight (-0.6256). The absolute value of phenotypic correlation coefficients ranged from -0.7906 to 0.3562. The highest phenotypic correlation was between birth weight and daily gain before weaning, and the correlation coefficient was -0.7906.

AB  - Simple Summary After weaning, pigs are subjected to a variety of nutritional, psychological and environmental stresses. Historically, weaning age was determined knowing that antibiotics could be included in postweaning diets for piglets. The use of antibiotic growth promoters to help prevent weaning stress in weaned pigs has been forbidden in Japan, Korea, the European Union and China. In this study, intestinal morphology, pH of the stomach and antioxidant status of pigs weaned at 28 d were better than pigs weaned at 21 d. These results indicated that strategies including enhancing the intestinal absorption function and antioxidant ability in weaned pigs can improve growth performance and decrease diarrhea incidence. The study objective was to assess effects of different weaning ages on growth performance, intestinal morphology and redox status in Duroc x Landrace x Large White piglets (n = 96) fed diets without antibiotic growth promoters. Piglets were selected from 24 litters based on similar body weight at 14 d of age. All piglets were allocated to two groups in a completely random design with six replicates and eight pigs per replicate (four barrows and four gilts), which were weaned at 21 (n = 48; BW = 6.87 +/- 0.33 kg) and 28 (n = 48; BW = 8.49 +/- 0.41 kg) days of age. After weaning, pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion (F:G), diarrhea incidence, gastrointestinal pH, intestinal morphology and redox status were determined. Pigs weaned at 28 d displayed increased ADG from d 8 to 14 (p < 0.01) compared with pigs weaned at 21 d. Pigs weaned at 28 d had a higher ADFI from d 0 to 7 (p < 0.01), d 8 to 14 (p < 0.01), d 15 to 28 (p < 0.05) and during the entire experimental period (p < 0.01) compared with pigs weaned at 21 d. Pigs weaned at 21 d had an improved F:G from d 15 to 28 (p < 0.05) compared with pigs weaned at 28 d. Pigs weaned at 28 d had decreased diarrhea incidence from d 8 to 14 (p < 0.01) and the entire experimental period (p < 0.01) compared with pigs weaned at 21 d. On d 28, the pH of the stomach contents in pigs weaned at 21 d was significantly higher compared with pigs weaned at 28 d (p < 0.01). On d 14, the morphology of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum in pigs weaned at 28 d was improved compared with pigs weaned at 21 d. During the experiment period, the antioxidant abilities of pigs weaned at 28 d of the heart, liver, kidney, intestinal and serum were better than pigs weaned at 21 d. In conclusion, intestinal morphology, pH of the stomach and antioxidant status of pigs weaned at 28 d were better than pigs weaned at 21 d. These factors supported better growth performance and decreased diarrhea incidence.

AB  - The leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) are one of the most species-rich family of herbivorous beetles with about 45,000 species worldwide. Based on the contributions of chrysomelidologists to the Taxonomic Catalog of the Brazilian Fauna - CTFB, the family comprises 6,079 species in 562 genera of which 951 species are endemic to Brazil, standing out as the most diverse, representing 4.8% of the Brazilian fauna and 17.1% of the beetle species. Chrysomelidae has twelve subfamilies with nine reported to Brazil: Galerucinae, the richest with 1,916 species in 202 genera,followed byCassidinae, Eumolpinae, Cryptocephalinae,Chrysomelinae, Bruchinae,Criocerinae, Lamprosomatinae and Sagrinae - this with only one species. Most ofthese subfamilies need urgent revision, since many species are poorly characterized, and polymorphism is frequent in some groups. The Czech couple Jan and Bohumila Bechyn & ecaron; were the researchers who described most species from Brazil. Furthermore, despite the increase of research on biology, natural history, host plants, genetics, ecology from 1980's much still need to be investigated to better known the Brazilian Chrysomelidae and probably many new species are yet to be discovered.

AB  - The internal ion source of the Advanced Molecular Image Technologies (AMIT) superconducting cyclotron uses cathodes made of pure tantalum to generate high energy H- ion beams for the production of isotopes for positron emission tomography. During service, the cathodes are impacted by high-energy ions from the plasma. The resulting erosion creates craters that reduce the current density of the extracted beam. The cathodes eventually need to be replaced when the ion source can no longer be activated. This research explores the possibility of repairing the tantalum cathodes used in the AMIT cyclotron through laser metal deposition additive manufacturing. The damaged parts were first characterised by 3D imaging, scanning electron microscopy, and Vickers microhardness to understand the damage mechanisms occurring during service and quantify the extent of the damage. Different repair strategies were then tested employing both high-purity tantalum wire and powder feedstocks and the properties of the reconditioned electrodes were determined. The ability of laser metal deposition to restore the damaged cathodes for use in the AMIT cyclotron has been demonstrated.

AB  - Purpose The molecular profile of specimens of Mediorhynchus gallinarum (Bhalero, 1937) collected from chickens, Gallus gallus L. in Indonesia was analysed. The aim of this study was to assess the phylogenetic position of species of Mediorhynchus within the order Giganthorhynchida. Methods We used one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome oxidase 1) and one nuclear gene (18S ribosomal RNA) to infer phylogenetic relationships of class Archiacanthocephala. Results The COI and 18S rDNA genes sequences showed that M. gallinarum had low genetic variation and that this species is sister to Mediorhynchus africanus Amin, Evans, Heckmann, El-Naggar, 2013. The phylogenetic relationships of the Class Archiacanthocephala showed that it is not resolved but, however, were mostly congruent using both genes. A review of host-parasite life cycles and geographic distributions of Archiacanthocephala indicates that mainly small mammals and birds are definitive hosts, while termites, cockroaches, and millipedes are intermediate hosts. Conclusions While the intermediate hosts have wide geographic distributions, the narrow distribution of the definitive hosts limit the access of archiacanthocephalans to a wider range of prospective hosts. Additional analyses, to increase taxonomic and character sampling will improve the development of a robust phylogeny and provide more stable classification. The results presented here contribute to better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary relationships that allow the host-parasite co-existence within the class Archiacanthocephala.

AB  - In the face of challenges, animals must balance investments in reproductive effort versus their own survival. Physiologically, this trade-off may be mediated by glucocorticoid release by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and prolactin release from the pituitary to maintain parental care. The degree to which animals react to and recover from stressors likely affects maintenance of parental behavior and, ultimately, fitness. However, less is known about how gaining parental experience may alter hormonal stress responses and their underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms. To address this gap, we measured the corticosterone (CORT) and prolactin (PRL) stress response in individuals of both sexes of the biparental rock dove (Columba livia) that had never raised chicks versus birds that had fledged at least one chick. We measured both CORT and PRL at baseline and after an acute stressor (30 min restraint). We also measured negative feedback ability by administering dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid that suppresses CORT release, and measured CORT and PRL after 60 min. All hormones were measured when birds were not actively nesting to assess whether effects of parental experience extend beyond the breeding bout. Experienced birds had lower stress-induced and negative-feedback CORT, and higher stress-induced PRL than inexperienced birds. In a separate experiment, we measured glucocorticoid receptor subtype expression in the hippocampus, a key site of negative feedback regulation. Experienced birds showed higher glucocorticoid receptor expression than inexperienced controls, which may mediate their ability to attenuate CORT release. Together, these results shed light on potential mechanisms by which gaining experience may improve parental performance and fitness.

AB  - Simple Summary In Europe, swine are a livestock reservoir for Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV-3). Consumption of food containing HEV-3 may lead to human infection, and severe illness in some cases. Heat treatment and good hygiene practice during food preparation reduces human infection risk, but further control could be achieved by controlling HEV infection in pigs on farm. However, the key sources and timing of HEV infection in pig herds is not well understood. This study aimed to address these knowledge gaps. Pig faeces were collected from a farrow-to-finish farm on multiple occasions spanning five months and were tested for presence of HEV nucleic acid. Prevalence was always higher in growers (85.8% overall) compared to older fattener pigs (26.0%), but was detected at all visits indicating long-term persistence on the farm. Prevalence of HEV in the farm environment was also high (64.7% of 67 samples), and this may lead to continual herd re-infection. Studying infection in a single cohort of pigs over time revealed an absence of active infection in farrowing sows and young piglets. Infection first appeared in the cohort at weaner age, but only in groups that had either been weaned earlier or experienced a high degree of mixing with other pigs. In Europe, swine are a livestock reservoir for Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV-3). Consumption of food containing HEV-3 can cause zoonotic human infection, though risk is reduced by heat treatment. Implementing controls that limit infection in slaughter pigs may further reduce foodborne transmission risk but knowledge of infection dynamics on commercial farms is limited. This study addressed this knowledge gap and in particular investigated the influence of group mixing. Faeces were collected from grower (n = 212) and fattener (n = 262) pigs on a farrow-to-finish farm on four occasions. HEV RNA was detected on all occasions, and prevalence was higher in growers (85.8%) than fatteners (26.0%; p < 0.001). HEV-positive samples were also collected from the wider farm environment (n = 67; 64.7% prevalence), indicating potential sources for HEV re-circulation within the herd. Timing of infection in a cohort was also investigated. HEV was absent from all piglet faeces (n = 98) and first detected at weaner stage (25.7% prevalence), but only in groups weaned earlier or comprising pigs from many different litters. Farrowing sow faeces (n = 75) were HEV-negative but antibodies were detected in blood from two sows. Results suggest that multiple factors influence HEV infection dynamics on pig farms, and potential foci for further study into practical control solutions are highlighted.

AB  - Melatonin has known anti-inflammatory effects. Yet, how melatonin protects sheep endometrial epithelial cells from inflammation remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the melatonin synthetase AANAT and HIOMT and melatonin membrane receptors MT1 and MT2 distribution in sheep uterus. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated sheep endometrial epithelial cells as an in vitro inflammation model. The results showed that melatonin attenuated the expression of inflammatory factors in a concentration-response manner. Melatonin also inhibited the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and NF-kappa B p65. This attenuation was partially blocked by luzindole (a non-specific MT1 and MT2 inhibitor) or 4P-PDOT (specific MT2 inhibitor). In addition, the above inhibition of melatonin was abolished by the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002. It was concluded that melatonin had an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced endometrial epithelial cell inflammation in sheep, which was mediated by the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway via melatonin receptors.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Fungi in the genus Periglandula (Clavicipitaceae) are endosymbionts of plants in the Convolvulaceae family (morning glories and relatives) where they may help protect plants from herbivory by production of bioactive compounds known as ergot alkaloids. We investigated mortality and behavior of nymphs and adults of Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) exposed to crude extracts from morning glories and to synthetic ergot alkaloids known to be produced in Convolvulaceae-Periglandula symbioses. We monitored effects of extracts or synthetic compounds on survival, host settling, and feeding. Several ergot alkaloids reduced survival of D. citri on treated surfaces. Crude extracts and synthetic ergot alkaloids reduced D. citri adult settling on treated host plants compared with water controls. We observed an antifeedant effect of the crude extracts at concentrations which otherwise caused minimal adult mortality. Our results indicate that ergot alkaloids produce both toxic and sub-lethal effects on D. citri that could be useful for management of this pest.
   Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is an important economic pest of citrus crops because it vectors the causal pathogen of huanglongbing (HLB; aka citrus greening). Population suppression of D. citri with insecticides has been disproportionally relied on for HLB management and a greater diversity of more sustainable tools is needed. Periglandula spp. is a fungal endosymbiont (family Clavicipitaceae) that forms a mutualistic relationship with members of plants in family Convolvulaceae. This association results in the production of ergot alkaloids that were previously documented as having psyllicidal properties. We investigated the mortality and behavior of D. citri exposed to crude extracts from morning glories in the plant family Convolvulaceae, as well as synthetic ergot alkaloids. Nymphs and adults were exposed to the crude plant extracts from Periglandula positive species of Convolvulaceae, as well as five synthetic ergot alkaloids. Treatments were prepared by exposing clippings of citrus to 100 ng/mu L of crude extract from Periglandula-positive species of Ipomoea (I. imperati, I. leptophylla, I. pandurata and I. tricolor), and Turbina corymbosa, and from one Periglandula-negative species (I. alba) (100 ng/mu L). Mortality of adult and nymphal D. citri was significantly higher than the control after exposure to extracts from I. tricolor and I. imperati. The synthetic ergot alkaloids, lysergol (10-100 ng/mu L), ergonovine maleate (100 ng/mu L), agroclavine (10-100 ng/mu L), and ergosine (10-100 ng/mu L) increased mortality of D. citri nymphs, while ergosine (100 ng/mu L) and agroclavine (100 ng/mu L) increased mortality of adults compared to water controls. Fewer D. citri adults settled on plants treated with crude extracts or synthetic ergot alkaloids than on water controls at 48 h after release. D. citri that fed on citrus leaves treated with 10 ng/mu L solution of crude extract from the Periglandula-positive species Ipomoea (I. imperati, I. leptophylla, I. pandurata, I. tricolor), and Turbina corymbosa excreted significantly less honeydew compared with a negative water control and extract from Periglandula-negative species (I. alba). Our results indicate that crude extracts and ergot alkaloids exhibit toxic and sub-lethal effects on D. citri that could be useful for management of this pest.

AB  - Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a globally important food crop, which was domesticated about 8-10,000 years ago. Bread wheat is an allopolyploid, and it evolved from two hybridization events of three species. To widen the genetic base in breeding, bread wheat has been re-synthesized by crossing durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) and goat grass (Aegilops tauschii Coss), leading to so-called synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW). We applied the quantitative genetics tools of "hybrid prediction"-originally developed for the prediction of wheat hybrids generated from different heterotic groups - to a situation of allopolyploidization. Our use-case predicts the phenotypes of SHW for three quantitatively inherited global wheat diseases, namely tan spot (TS), septoria nodorum blotch (SNB), and spot blotch (SB). Our results revealed prediction abilities comparable to studies in 'traditional' elite or hybrid wheat. Prediction abilities were highest using a marker model and performing random cross-validation, predicting the performance of untested SHW (0.483 for SB to 0.730 for TS). When testing parents not necessarily used in SHW, combination prediction abilities were slightly lower (0.378 for SB to 0.718 for TS), yet still promising. Despite the limited phenotypic data, our results provide a general example for predictive models targeting an allopolyploidization event and a method that can guide the use of genetic resources available in gene banks. Plain Language Summary Bread wheat is an allopolyploid from two hybridization events of three species. To widen the genetic base in breeding, bread wheat has been re-synthesized by crossing durum wheat and goat grass, leading to so-called synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW). We applied the "hybrid prediction" to a situation of allopolyploidization. We performed genomic prediction phenotypes of SHW for three quantitatively inherited global wheat diseases, tan spot (TS), septoria nodorum blotch (SNB), and spot blotch (SB). Our results revealed comparable genomic prediction abilities to studies in "traditional" elite or hybrid wheat.

AB  - The waste generated in the production of wine and grape juice is characterized by a high concentration of organic matter, when properly treated, can serve as sustainable strategies for its use and destination, and among these, the production of biocompost. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the process of composting grape marc, sheep manure, and mango leaves, evaluating in the biocompost its physical-chemical, nutritional and microbiological characteristics for use in agriculture. The composting pile assembly followed the proportion of 30% of sheep manure as nitrogenous material and 70% of carbon-rich material (divided into 50% of grape marc and 20% of hose leaves), the initial C/N ratio was 33:1, and the process lasted 120 days according to legislation. When evaluating the results, the process occurred in an accelerated manner, where at 30 days the biocompost was already stabilized, and at the end of the process (120 days) it presented a C/N ratio of 5.85, as well as acceptable levels for the macronutrients K and P, and without risk of phytotoxicity, and could be used as organic fertilizer or as soil conditioner, reducing environmentally inadequate destination and generating savings with their reinsertion in the production chain.

AB  - Improving the litter performance of sows is one of the main challenges in the current pig industry. In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PRLR gene were performed, in order to test whether they are associated with the reproductive performance of Large White pigs. In total, we discovered nine SNP loci (g.C260G, g.C362T, g.C527G, g.A540G, g.A584G, g.A673T, g.A745G, g.C765T and g.A934G) in exon 10 of PRLR. The result showed that genotypes CC and CT at the g.C362T locus and genotype AG at g.A584G could significantly increase the litter size of different strains of Large White pigs (p < 0.05). In addition, the genotype CC at the g.C765T locus and the genotype AA at g.A934G could also increase the litter size (TNB could be increased by 1.5 piglets per year; while NBA could be increased by 0.98 piglets per year, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the haplotype combinations of H2H7 and H4H4 were the dominant com-binations and contributed to larger litter sizes in the Large White pigs. In conclusion, there were dominant genotypes in the related SNP loci in the PRLR gene that were beneficial to improving the litter traits of sows. These findings will provide a reference for screening the molecular markers of a high reproductive performance in sows, and are helpful for genetic breeding and the reproductive improvement of pigs.

AB  - Predators can induce behavioral changes in prey that influence vigilance, grouping patterns, and space use, and these can ultimately affect prey demography and trophic interactions. Consequently, prey must respond to the risk of predation, but little is known about the features that drive the spatial responses of prey species to predators. We tested what factors affected the proximity of prey to the lions reintroduced to Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa. We also tested whether prey species that are preferentially killed by lions revealed greater responsiveness than those that are not, and whether prey respond to predator behavioral states and hunger. From 1588 observations of potential prey locations in relation to lions under varying wind directions, lion behaviors, and hunger states throughout the day and night, we found no evidence of wind-driven odor responses affecting prey proximity to lions. Prey species that were not preferentially preyed upon by lions occurred closer to lions than those species that lions prefer to hunt. Prey were closer to lions performing noisy behaviors compared to those performing quiet behaviors. Prey were more likely to be closer to covertly behaving lions and further from stationary lions. Our results, compared to the published literature and accepted dogma of the primacy of odor in predator detection, suggest large vertebrate prey responses to predators in intact, multi-species assemblages are context dependent.

AB  - In cities, the incidence of mental disorders is higher, while visits to nature have been reported to benefit mental health and brain function. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how exposure to natural and urban environments affects brain structure. To explore the causal relationship between exposure to these environments and the hippocampal formation, 60 participants were sent on a one hour walk in either a natural (forest) or an urban environment (busy street), and high-resolution hippocampal imaging was performed before and after the walks. We found that the participants who walked in the forest had an increase in subiculum volume, a hippocampal subfield involved in stress response inhibition, while no change was observed after the urban walk. However, this result did not withstand Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, the increase in subiculum volume after the forest walk was associated with a decrease in self-reported rumination. These results indicate that visits to nature can lead to observable alterations in brain structure, with potential benefits for mental health and implications for public health and urban planning policies.

AB  - Lung transplantation results are compromised by ischemia-reperfusion injury and alloimmune responses. Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is used to assess marginal donor lungs before transplantation but is also an excellent platform to apply novel therapeutics. We investigated donor lung immunomodulation using genetically engineered mesenchymal stromal cells with augmented production of human anti-inflammatory hIL-10 (MSCsIL-10). Pig lungs were placed on EVLP for 6 h and randomized to control (n = 7), intravascular delivery of 20 x 106 (n = 5, low dose) or 40 x 106 human MSCs IL-10 (n = 6, high dose). Subsequently, single-lung transplantation was performed, and recipient pigs were monitored for 3 days. hIL-10 secretion was measured during EVLP and after transplantation, and immunological effects were assessed by cytokine profile, T and myeloid cell characterization and mixed lymphocyte reaction. MSCIL-10 therapy rapidly increased hIL-10 during EVLP and resulted in transient hIL-10 elevation after lung transplantation. MSCIL-10 delivery did not affect lung function but was associated with dose-related immunomodulatory effects, with the low dose resulting in a beneficial decrease in apoptosis and lower macrophage activation, but the high MSCIL-10 dose resulting in inflammation and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activation. MSCIL-10 therapy during EVLP results in a rapid and transient perioperative hIL-10 increase and has a therapeutic window for its immunomodulatory effects.

AB  - The objective of this research was to explore the effects of different aeration methods on NH3 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the losses of carbon and nitrogen from composting of cow manure and corn stalks in the laboratory-scale reactors. Here, we designed three treatments, including continuous aerated treatment C1 (aeration rates 0.21 L center dot kg(-1) dry matter (DM)center dot min(-)(1)) and intermittent aerated treatments I1 (aeration rates 0.42 L center dot kg(-1) DM center dot min(-)(1); aerate 10 min, stop 10 min) and I2 (aeration rates 0.84 L center dot kg(-1) DM center dot min(-)(1); aerate 5 min, stop 15 min). The results showed that the physicochemical parameters (temperature, pH values, and germination index) of composting products met the requirements of maturity and sanitation. Compared with continuous aerated treatment C1, the cumulative NH3 emissions of I1 and I2 treatments decreased by 24.37% and 19.27%, while the cumulative CO2 emissions decreased by 13.01% and 20.72%. On the contrary, the cumulative N2O emissions of I1 and I2 treatments increased by 22.22% and 43.14%. CO2 emission was the principal pathway for the TOC losses, which comprised over 65% of TOC losses. C1 treatment had the highest TOC losses due to its highest cumulative CO2 emissions. The TN losses of I1 and I2 treatments reduced 9.07% and 6.1% compared to C1 treatment, so the intermittent aerated modes could reduce the TN loss. Due to the potential for mitigation of gaseous emissions, I1 treatment was recommended to be used in aerobic composting of cow manure.

AB  - The relationship between milk fat intake (because of its high saturated fatty acid content) and the risk of suffering from cardiovascular diseases remains controversial. Thus, Golden Syrian hamsters were fed two types of fat-sheep milk fat that was rich in rumenic (cis9,trans11-18:2) and vaccenic (trans11-18:1) acids and olive oil-and two doses (a high- or normal-fat diet) for 14 weeks, and markers of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis evolution were analyzed. The results revealed that the type and percentage of fat affected most plasma biochemical parameters related to lipid metabolism, while only the expression of five (CD36, SR-B1, ACAT, LDLR, and HMG-CoAR) of the studied lipid-metabolism-related genes was affected by these factors. According to aortic histology, when ingested in excess, both fats caused a similar increase in the thickness of fatty streaks, but the high-milk-fat-based diet caused a more atherogenic plasma profile. The compositions of the fats that were used, the results that were obtained, and the scientific literature indicated that the rumenic acid present in milk fat would regulate the expression of genes involved in ROS generation and, thus, protect against LDL oxidation, causing an effect similar to that of olive oil.

AB  - LGALS12, also known as galectin12, belongs to the galectin family with beta-galactoside-binding activity. We previously reported that LGALS12 is an important regulator of adipogenesis in porcine adipocytes in vitro, but its value in pig breeding needed to be explored in vivo. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to construct porcine fetal fibroblasts (PFFs) with a 43 bp deletion in LGALS12 exon 2. Using these PFFs as donor cells, a LGALS12 knockout pig model was generated via somatic cell nuclear transfer. Primary cultures of porcine intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) adipocytes were established using cells from LGALS12 knockout pigs and wild-type pigs. A comparison of these cells proved that LGALS12 deficiency suppresses cell proliferation via the RASp38MAPK pathway and promotes lipolysis via the PKA pathway in both IM and SC adipocytes. In addition, we observed AKT activation only in IM adipocytes and suppression of the Wnt/beta-catenin only in SC adipocytes. Our findings suggest that LGALS12 deficiency affects the adipogenesis of IM and SC adipocytes through different mechanisms.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var botrytis) field performance in response to season, organic waste types, and rates; a cultivar (ATRIA 153F1) was grown for two years (2019 and 2020) under two dif-ferent seasons (Rainy and Dry). This is to ascertain the effective season, type, and rate of organic waste for the promotion of sustainable agriculture and organic farming practices for cauliflower. Method: The experiment was 2 x 4 factorial in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Factor A was the two different organic wastes (poultry and pig slurry) while factor B was the four rates (0, 10, 20, and 30 t/ha) of the organic wastes. The growth and yield parameters monitored were plant height, number of leaves, curd diameter, and curd fresh weight. Data on nutrient assessment of the fortified plots were also collected. Results:The study reveals that Season played a significant role in the growth and yield of cauliflower on average for the two years studied. Dry seasons produced taller plants (30.40 cm), and a higher number of leaves (15.90), while rainy seasons produced larger curd diameter (10.28 cm) and higher curd weights (71.39 t/ha). Soil fertility significantly improved with the application of the organic wastes. Plant height and number of leaves showed responses to manure type (MT) and manure rates (MR) suggesting that both assist in the growth and development of cauliflower in the field. Conclusion: The responses of yield components tended towards the positive side and the parameters responded to MT and varying MR. This study recommends the use of organic waste and emphasizes the need to consider cropping seasons in optimizing benefits. Optimization of organic waste management practices for cauliflower farming could lead to a significant increase in yield and sustainability in large-scale commercial agriculture.

AB  - As a widely epigenetic modification, m6A (N6-methyladenosine, m6A) can regulate the degradation, translation, and other biological functions of circRNAs through dynamic reversible processes. It plays an important role in regulating the life activities of biological organisms, particularly in cell differentiation, apoptosis, embryonic development, stress response, and innate immunity. In this study, bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR identification, FISH subcellular localization, and ceRNA network construction were performed on m6A modified circRNAs regulating the apoptosis of secondary hair follicle cells of Inner Mongolia Albas white cashmere goats based on the skin m6A sequencing data of secondary hair follicles in anagen and catagen. The results showed that 8 m6A modified circRNAs regulating the cell apoptosis of secondary hair follicles, namely circRNA_2130, circRNA_0013, circRNA_1203, circRNA_1462, circRNA_1242, circRNA_2308, circRNA_2654 and circRNA_1442 were identified, and they are respectively derived from ANGEL2, APP, GKAP1, HNRNPC, PTBP3, NUCB1, SNRK and ZNF609 genes. Among them, circRNA_0013, circRNA_1442 and circRNA_1462 were located in the cytoplasm of the secondary hair follicle papilla, while circRNA_1203, circRNA_1242, circRNA_2130, circRNA_2308 and circRNA_2654 were located in the nucleus. There are complex and diverse regulatory relationships among 8 circRNAs, with each circRNA targeting one or more miRNAs, revealing that each m6A circRNA can exert regulatory effects through multiple potential miRNA-mRNA axes, to regulate the apoptosis of secondary hair follicle cells of cashmere goats during the growth cycles. This result provides a direction for further elucidating the regulatory mechanism of m6A modified circRNAs in cashmere growth and exploring biomarkers.

AB  - Enormous efforts have been made to understand the functions of bioluminescence; however, its relevance in soil ecosystems has barely been investigated. In addition, our understanding of the biological relevance of bioluminescence is hampered by the scarcity of tools to genetically manipulate this trait. Using the symbionts of entomopathogenic nematodes, Photorhabdus bacteria, we show that bioluminescence plays important regulatory roles in multitrophic interactions in the soil. Through genetic modifications and exploiting natural variability, we provide direct evidence for the multifunctional nature of bioluminescence. It regulates abiotic and biotic stress resistance, impacts other trophic levels, including nematodes, insects, and plants, and contributes to symbiosis. Our study contributes to understanding the factors that have driven the evolution and maintenance of this trait in belowground ecosystems.

AB  - The effects of oxidized beta-carotene (OxBC) were determined upon the growth performance of swine through their full growth cycle under commercial production conditions in Vietnam. Five hundred 28-day-old-weaned barrows and gilts were used in a 140-day complete wean-to-finish feeding trial. Animals were randomized by weight, and each pen contained 20 pigs with the same ratio of barrows to gilts. There were five dietary treatment groups with five replicate pens per treatment: Control basal diet, no antibiotics or OxBC; Basal diet with antibiotics; no OxBC; Basal diet supplemented with 2, 4, or 8 mg OxBC/kg of diet, no antibiotics. Growth performance parameters were calculated for each production stage (Starter: Days 1-28, Grower: Days 29-84, Finisher: Days 85-140) and for the overall study (Days 1-140). OxBC and antibiotics each improved growth rate, feed efficiency, and body weight compared to the unsupplemented control (p < 0.001). Animals receiving 4 and 8 mg/kg OxBC performed better than animals on antibiotics (p < 0.001). In Starter pigs, OxBC reduced the occurrence of diarrhea dose-dependently (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) and more so than did antibiotics (p < 0.001). These findings support the concept that oxidized beta-carotene can facilitate swine growth and health in the absence of in-feed antibiotics.

AB  - Management of animal populations requires spatially explicit knowledge of movement corridors, such as those used during seasonal migrations. Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking data allow for mapping of corridors from directly observed movements, but such tracking data are absent for many populations. We developed a novel statistical corridor modelling approach that predicts movement corridors from cost-distance models fit directly to migration tracking data. Unlike existing predictive approaches, this does not require the ad hoc transformation of habitat suitability surfaces into resistance surfaces. We tested the ability of the approach to recover parameters used to generate simulated movements. We then used GPS data from three migrating mule deer Odocoileus hemionus herds in Idaho and Wyoming to model corridors as a function of elevation, slope, aspect, percent shrub, date of peak green-up, snow-off date and human footprint. We assessed the predictive ability of the fitted models using validation tracks from the same herd as well as from the other herds. The approach reproduced parameters used to generate the simulated movements, predicted the corridors used by migratory populations, and described the direction, magnitude and confidence levels of the effects of environmental variables on corridors. Within-herd validation indicated that fitted corridor models are more accurate at predicting migration corridors than null models, and cross-herd validation indicated that fitted models for some herds accurately predicted the observed migrations of other herds. In addition to the practical benefit of mapping corridors for management, our statistical corridor modelling framework sets the stage for evaluating fundamental questions about the fitness trade-offs, navigation, learning, fidelity and movement constraints that influence migratory and other corridor-generating behaviour. Models of predictive corridors can inform management and planning for the conservation of migrations across taxa, including the potential restoration of corridors. Our corridor modelling approach is also readily applied to non-migratory animal movements.

AB  - Cholinergic projection neurons of the nucleus basalis and substantia innominata (NBM/SI) densely innervate the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and have been shown to contribute to the encoding of fundamental and life-threatening experiences. Given the vital importance of these circuits in the acquisition and retention of memories that are essential for survival in a changing environment, it is not surprising that the basic anatomical organization of the NBM/SI is well conserved across animal classes as diverse as teleost and mammal. What is not known is the extent to which the physiology and morphology of NBM/SI neurons have also been conserved. To address this issue, we made patch-clamp recordings from NBM/SI neurons in ex vivo slices of two widely divergent mammalian species, mouse and rhesus macaque, focusing our efforts on cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA. We then reconstructed most of these recorded neurons post hoc to characterize neuronal morphology. We found that rhesus macaque BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons were both more intrinsically excitable and less morphologically compact than their mouse homologs. Combining measurements of 18 physiological features and 13 morphological features, we illustrate the extent of the separation. Although macaque and mouse neurons both exhibited considerable within-group diversity and overlapped with each other on multiple individual metrics, a combined morphoelectric analysis demonstrates that they form two distinct neuronal classes. Given the shared purpose of the circuits in which these neurons participate, this finding raises questions about (and offers constraints on) how these distinct classes result in similar behavior.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to understand the positivity rates of gastrointestinal nematodes in cattle and sheep in Ordos, and the effects of different pasture types on the distribution of gastrointestinal nematodes, we conducted an epidemiological investigation and analysis in four banner districts of Ordos. The results showed that the positive rates of sheep and cattle were 38.84% and 4.48%, respectively. The anthelmintic resistance analysis revealed that the nematode population in the area was severely resistant to ivermectin and albendazole, and resistance to levamisole, nitroxynil and closantel was suspected. Gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs), such as Trichostrongylidae, are important pathogens in small ruminants, causing significant losses in these livestock species. Despite their veterinary importance, GINs have not been studied in certain regions of the world. Therefore, much of their epidemiology and economic impact on production remain unknown. In the present study, a systematic epidemiological survey based on the modified McMaster technique was conducted to investigate the type and infection of GINs in sheep and cattle. In 9622 fecal samples from 491 sampling sites in the four main banner districts of Ordos, the prevalence of GIN infection was found to be 38.84% and 4.48% in sheep and cattle, respectively. At the same time, the effects of four pasture types on the distribution of GINs were analyzed. This study also found severe resistance to ivermectin and albendazole in GINs and suspected anthelmintic resistance in nitroxynil, levamisole and closantel. We report the type and infection of GINs in Ordos, with the aim to help the prevention and control of GINs. Based on the results of the questionnaire survey and GIN resistance test, we found several reasons for the anthelmintic resistance of GINs, consequently providing new ideas for controlling the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance.

AB  - The thick-enameled, bunodont dentition shared by most early hominins has traditionally been interpreted as reflecting durophagy, especially in the robust genus Paranthropus. However, subsequent works on dental microwear textures (DMT) and biogeochemical compositions have challenged this hypothesis. Some authors argued that their robust morphology might have been driven by the consumption of mechanically challenging resources during periods of food scarcity. An experimental baseline using a model taxon with bunodont, thick-enameled cheek teeth, could help better interpret DMT and test hypotheses regarding the consumption of mechanically challenging foods that could be fallback foods. Besides, earlier studies have shown that DMT can track subtle dietary variations in extant taxa. This study aims at testing the hypothesis that the consumption of various seeds has an impact on DMT of bunodont mammals despite similar overall diets. Trials were conducted on four groups of domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) all fed on mixed cereal and soy flours: the control group received only flours (n = 12), and the three others were supplemented with either 20% corn kernels (n = 6), 30% barley seeds (n = 5), or 10 hazelnuts in shell per day (n = 6). We studied phases I and II facets on first molars and on fourth deciduous premolars, and applied a subsampling surface strategy to identify discriminative parameters among dietary groups. Principal Component Analyses show that DMT differ between pigs fed on different types of seeds. Our results also demonstrate that combining both crushing and shearing facets into analyses improves dietary discriminations. This study shows that variables that contribute most to dietary discriminations as selected from the subsampling strategy are mainly height parameters. These results thus support the idea that the consumption of seeds has an impact on the relief of surface textures.

AB  - Nonfee grazing costs on both federal and privately leased land have been a topic of research since the 1960s. A nonfee cost difference of $1.23 animal unit mo (AUM)-1 , later adjusted to $1.35 AUM-1 , was found between grazing on federal and privately leased land. This value became the base for the federal land forage value in the current federal grazing fee. In 1992, a task force group was formed to further research the value of federal forage and update the range for the federal grazing fee and recommended keeping the fee between $3 and $5, which would be $6.60 and $11.01 in 2018 US dollars. This study aims to update the 1992 nonfee costs of federal and privately leased grazing. Packets containing information on costs of grazing were gathered from randomly selected sheep and cattle producers in Wyoming, Idaho, and California for the yr 2018. The current study found an observed difference of $3.09 AUM-1 between public and privately leased grazing in the three states but found the overall costs to have no statistically significant difference. This research can be used in the future for observing the nonfee cost changes of federally and privately leased land in the western United States.Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Intercropping is drawing increasing attention as a strategy to increase crop yields and manage pest pressure, however the mechanisms of associational resistance in diversified cropping systems remain controversial. We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the impact of co-planting with silverleaf Desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum) on maize secondary metabolism and resistance to herbivory by the spotted stemborer (Chilo partellus). Maize plants were grown either in the same pot with a Desmodium plant or adjacent to it in a separate pot. Our findings indicate that co-planting with Desmodium influences maize secondary metabolism and herbivore resistance through both above and below-ground mechanisms. Maize growing in the same pot with a Desmodium neighbor was less attractive for oviposition by spotted stemborer adults. However, maize exposed only to above-ground Desmodium cues generally showed increased susceptibility to spotted stemborer herbivory (through both increased oviposition and larval consumption). VOC emissions and tissue secondary metabolite titers were also altered in maize plants exposed to Desmodium cues, with stronger effects being observed when maize and Desmodium shared the same pot. Specifically, benzoxazinoids were strongly suppressed in maize roots by direct contact with a Desmodium neighbor while headspace emissions of short-chain aldehydes and alkylbenzenes were increased. These results imply that direct root contact or soil-borne cues play an important role in mediating associational effects on plant resistance in this system.

AB  - Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a critical role in reproduction through paracrine and endocrine mechanisms. However, its autocrine effects on uterine receptivity and inflammatory pathways remain unknown. This study is the first to demonstrate NGF's direct autocrine action on sheep endometrial luminal epithelial cells (SELECs), primary cultures treated with NGF for 12, 24, and 48 h, with or without the NTRK1 antagonist. NGF significantly increased PGE2 (p < 0.0001) and PGF2 alpha (p < 0.0001) levels only at 12 h, with no significant changes at 24 and 48 h. NGF also upregulated the expression of NGF, COX2, and NTRK1 (p < 0.0001), and p75NTR and STAR (p < 0.001), at 12 h, with the effects reversed by NTRK1 inhibition, while no significant changes were observed for TLR4 (p > 0.05). Western blot (WB) analysis was performed exclusively to confirm the presence of NGF protein, revealing no significant differences (p > 0.05) across experimental conditions. These findings highlight NGF's role in directly regulating SELEC activity through autocrine mechanisms, emphasizing its importance in uterine receptivity and reproductive readiness. This study provides novel insights into NGF's role in sheep reproduction and its potential applications in fertility treatments.

AB  - Tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] is a major commercially important crop cultivated in both tropical and subtropical areas for the production of the famous beverage "tea". Gray blight is one of the commonly encountered foliar fungal diseases caused by Pestalotiopsis-like taxa. In this study, fungi isolated from symptomatic tea leaves were characterized based on morphological and molecular data. A combined phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 1, 5.8S and the internal transcribed spacer 2 of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster (ITS), beta-tubulin (TUB2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-alpha) revealed multiple species of Pseudopestalotiopsis associated with gray blight in Sri Lanka. Among them, the currently known species of Ps. daweiana, Ps. annellata and Ps. chinensis were identified based on the molecular data derived from ex-type isolates. Additionally, four new species of Pseudopestalotiopsis viz Ps. petchii, Ps. ratnapurensis and Ps. rossmaniae and Ps. srilankensis are introduced herein with descriptions and illustrations. Since young leaves and buds of tea plants are used in manufacturing tea, prevention of the occurrence of foliar diseases is crucial to minimize annual yield loss. This study demonstrates the significance of DNA-aided identification and enhances our understanding of the diversity and distribution of fungi associated with tea, which are crucial for implementing effective disease management strategies.

AB  - The pig has long been used as a research animal and has now gained importance as a potential source of organs for clinical xenotransplantation. When an organ from a wild -type (i.e., genetically unmodified) pig is transplanted into an immunosuppressed nonhuman primate, a vigorous host immune response causes hyperacute rejection (within minutes or hours). This response has been largely overcome by 1) extensive gene editing of the organ -source pig and 2) the administration to the recipient of novel immunosuppressive therapy based on blockade of the CD40/CD154 T cell costimulation pathway. Gene editing has consisted of 1) deletion of expression of the 3 known carbohydrate xenoantigens against which humans have natural (preformed) antibodies and 2) the introduction of human 'protective' genes. The combination of gene editing and novel immunosuppressive therapy has extended life -supporting pig kidney graft survival to greater than 1 y and of pig heart survival to up to 9 mo. This review briefly describes the techniques of gene editing, the potential risks of transfer of porcine endogenous retroviruses with the organ, and the need for breeding and housing of donor pigs under biosecure conditions.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of maternal microbial transmission is crucial for early gut microbiota development and long-term health outcomes in offspring. However, early maternal microbial interventions remain a challenge due to the complexity of accurately identifying transmitted taxa. Here, the maternal-offspring microbial transmission model (MOMTM), a deep learning framework specifically designed to map maternal microbiota transmission dynamics across pig breeds and developmental stages, is introduced. Using MOMTM, key transmitted taxa, such as the Christensenellaceae R-7 are successfully predicted, which show high transmission centrality during early development periods. Additionally, it is demonstrated that galacto-oligosaccharide intervention in sows promotes a Christensenellaceae R-7-dominated enterotype and improves fiber digestibility in offspring. Further analysis reveals that Christensenellaceae, particularly Christensenella minuta, have enhanced adhesion and mucin utilization capabilities, facilitating its gut colonization. These findings highlight MOMTM's potential as a novel approach for microbiota-targeted health interventions in early life, offering insights into strategies that promote gut health and development from birth.

AB  - Cryopreservation is associated with increased oxidative stress, which is responsible for sperm damage. We analyzed the effect of cryopreservation on mRNA and protein expression of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), heat shock protein family A (HSP 70) member 4 like (HSPA4L) and sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 (ATP1B1) genes in boar sperm with different freezability. Boars were classified as having good and poor semen freezability (GSF and PSF, respectively), according to the assessment of post-thaw sperm motility. Total RNA was isolated from fresh pre-freeze (PF) and frozen-thawed (FT) sperm from five boars of the GSF and PSF groups, respectively. Quantification of TXNRD1, HSPA4L and ATP1B1 gene expression was performed by RT-qPCR analysis. Proteins extracted from sperm were subjected to Western blotting and SDS-PAGE analyses. Poor freezability ejaculates were characterized by significantly higher relative mRNA expression levels of TXNRD1 and HSPA4L in FT sperm compared with the fresh PF sperm. Furthermore, the relative mRNA expression level of ATP1B1 was significantly higher in the fresh PF sperm of the GSF group. Western blotting analysis revealed significantly higher relative expression of TXNRD1 protein in the fresh PF sperm of the GSF group, while HSPA4L protein expression was markedly increased in FT sperm of the PSF group. Electrophoretic and densitometric analyses revealed a higher number of proteins in the fresh PF and FT sperm of the PSF and GSF groups, respectively. The results of this study indicate that ATP1B1 mRNA expression in the fresh PF sperm is a promising cryotolerance marker, while the variations of TXNRD1 and HSPA4L protein expression in the fresh PF or FT sperm provide useful information that may help to elucidate their biological significance in cryo-damage.

AB  - Fat deposition in pigs is not only closely related to pig production efficiency and pork quality but also an ideal model for human obesity. Transcriptome sequencing is widely used to study fat deposition. However, due to small sample sizes, high false positive rates, and poor consistency of results from different studies, new strategies are urgently needed. Machine learning, a new analysis method, can effectively fit complex data and accurately identify samples and genes. In this study, 36 samples of adipose tissue, muscle tissue, and liver tissue were collected from Songliao black pigs and Landrace pigs, and the mRNA of all the samples was sequenced. In addition, we collected transcriptome data for 64 samples in the GEO database from four different sources. After standardization and imputation of missing values in the data set comprising 100 samples, traditional differential expression analysis was carried out, and different numbers of expressed genes were selected as features for the training model of eight machine learning methods. In the 1000 replications of fourfold cross validation with 100 samples, AdaBoost performed best, with an average prediction accuracy greater than 93% and the highest mean area under the curve in predicting the high- and low-fat content groups among the eight ML methods. According to their performance-based ranks inferred by AdaBoost, 12 genes related to fat deposition were identified; among them, FASN and APOD were specifically expressed in adipose tissue, and APOA1 was specifically expressed in the liver, which could be important candidate biomarkers affecting fat deposition.

KW  - GRAPH
AB  - In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have dominated natural language processing (NLP) and achieved outstanding performance in various NLP tasks, including dense retrieval based on PLMs. However, in the biomedical domain, the effectiveness of dense retrieval models based on PLMs still needs to be improved due to the diversity and ambiguity of entity expressions caused by the enrichment of biomedical entities. To alleviate the semantic gap, in this paper, we propose a method that incorporates external knowledge at the entity level into a dense retrieval model to enrich the dense representations of queries and documents. Specifically, we first add additional self-attention and information interaction modules in the Transformer layer of the BERT archi-tecture to perform fusion and interaction between query/document text and entity embeddings from knowledge graphs. We then propose an entity similarity loss to constrain the model to better learn external knowledge from entity embeddings, and further propose a weighted entity concatenation mechanism to balance the impact of entity representations when matching queries and documents. Experiments on two publicly available biomedical retrieval datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods. In term of NDCG metrics, the proposed method (called ELK) improves the ranking performance of coCondenser by at least 5% on both two datasets, and also obtains further performance gain over state-of-the-art EVA methods. Though having a more sophisticated architecture, the average query latency of ELK is still within the same order of magnitude as that of other efficient methods.

AB  - Second language (L2) learners frequently encounter persistent difficulty in perceiving certain non-native sound contrasts, i.e., a phenomenon called ?phonological deafness?. However, if extensive L2 experience leads to neuroplastic changes in the phonological system, then the capacity to discriminate non-native phonemic contrasts should progressively improve. Such perceptual changes should be attested by modifications at the neurophysiological level. We designed an EEG experiment in which the listeners? perceptual capacities to discriminate second language phonemic contrasts influence the processing of lexical-semantic violations. Semantic congruency of critical words in a sentence context was driven by a phonemic contrast that was unique to the L2, English (e.g.,/?/-/i:/, ship ? sheep). Twenty-eight young adult native speakers of French with intermediate proficiency in English listened to sentences that contained either a semantically congruent or incongruent critical word (e.g., The anchor of the ship/*sheep was let down) while EEG was recorded. Three ERP effects were found to relate to increasing L2 proficiency: (1) a left frontal auditory N100 effect, (2) a smaller fronto-central phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) effect and (3) a semantic N400 effect. No effect of proficiency was found on oscillatory markers. The current findings suggest that neuronal plasticity in the human brain allows for the late acquisition of even hard-wired linguistic features such as the discrimination of phonemic contrasts in a second language. This is the first time that behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for the critical role of neural plasticity underlying L2 phonological processing and its interdependence with semantic processing has been provided. Our data strongly support the idea that pieces of information from different levels of linguistic processing (e.g., phonological, semantic) strongly interact and influence each other during online language processing.

AB  - Over the past 40 years, assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have grown significantly in scale and innovation, from the bovine embryo industry's shift from in vivo derived to in vitro produced embryos and the development of somatic cell-based approaches for embryo production. Domestic animal models have been instrumental in the development of ARTs for wildlife species in support of the One Plan Approach to species conservation that integrates in situ and ex situ population management strategies. While ARTs are not the sole solution to the biodiversity crisis, they can offer opportunities to maintain, and even improve, the genetic composition of the captive and wild gene pools over time. This review focuses on the application of sperm and embryo technologies (artificial insemination and multiple ovulation/in vitro produced embryo transfer, respectively) in wildlife species, highlighting impactful cases in which significant progress or innovation has transpired. One of the key messages following decades of efforts in this field is the importance of collaboration between researchers and practitioners from zoological, academic, governmental, and private sectors.

AB  - Cryopreservation of boar spermatozoa affects the perinuclear theca (PT) and involves several proteins and molecules that play important roles during capacitation and the acrosomal reaction. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether the deleterious effects of cryopreservation in addition to protein tyrosine phosphorylation are accompanied by changes in the distribution of phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate (PIP2) and the localization of cytoskeletal and signaling proteins in the perinuclear theca of cryopreserved boar spermatozoa. For this purpose, by immunocytochemistry (IC) the changes in localization of phosphorylated proteins in tyrosine residues, gelsolin, c-SRC kinase and PLC-zeta, as well as in the distribution of phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate were analyzed in thawed spermatozoa (T) non capacitated (NC), capacitated (C) and in those with acrosomal reaction (AR) and compared with fresh spermatozoa (F) under the same physiological status. Western blotting (WB) and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to confirm the presence of these proteins in PT and to determine the interaction between these molecules. IC showed that immunostaining for phosphorylated proteins significantly increased in the acrosomal region and flagellum in TNC spermatozoa (p < 0.05). The proportion of cells displaying immunolabeling for gelsolin in the acrosomal region decreased after capacitation in cryopreserved spermatozoa; the same change was found (p < 0.05) in the proportion of spermatozoa immunoreactive to PIP2 in the sperm head. c-SRC was observed in the equatorial segment and acrosomal region, subdomains that coincide with the site where phosphorylated proteins were detected. PLC-zeta immunolocalization in fresh spermatozoa underwent changes after capacitation and acrosomal reaction, with a significant increase in the equatorial segment and post-acrosomal region in cryopreserved spermatozoa (p < 0.05). WB analysis indicated the presence of gelsolin, c-SRC and PLC-zeta in PT; besides, we confirmed that gelsolin co-immunoprecipitated with c-SRC and PLC-zeta, which changes according to the physiological state of spermatozoa. As a conclusion, cryopreservation together with increased immunodetection of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins decreases the

AB  - The present review addresses the oocyte and the preimplantation embryo, and is intended to highlight the underlying principle of the "nature versus/and nurture" question. Given the diversity in mammalian oocyte maturation, this review will not be comprehensive but instead will focus on the porcine oocyte. Historically, oogenesis was seen as the development of a passive cell nursed and determined by its somatic compartment. Currently, the advanced analysis of the cross-talk between the maternal environment and the oocyte shows a more balanced relationship: Granulosa cells nurse the oocyte, whereas the latter secretes diffusible factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation of the granulosa cells. Signal molecules of the granulosa cells either prevent the precocious initiation of meiotic maturation or enable oocyte maturation following hormonal stimulation. A similar question emerges in research on monozygotic twins or multiples: In Greek and medieval times, twins were not seen as the result of the common course of nature but were classified as faults. This seems still valid today for the rare and until now mainly unknown genesis of facultative monozygotic twins in mammals. Monozygotic twins are unique subjects for studies of the conceptus-maternal dialogue, the intra-pair similarity and dissimilarity, and the elucidation of the interplay between nature and nurture. In the course of in vivo collections of preimplantation sheep embryos and experiments on embryo splitting and other microsurgical interventions we recorded observations on double blastocysts within a single zona pellucida, double inner cell masses in zona-enclosed blastocysts and double germinal discs in elongating embryos. On the basis of these observations we add some pieces to the puzzle of the post-zygotic genesis of monozygotic twins and on maternal influences on the developing conceptus.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) may negatively affect human health. We detected the effect of 3500 MHz RF-EMR on anxiety-like behavior and the auditory cortex (ACx) in guinea pigs. Forty male guinea pigs were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to a continuous wave of 3500 MHz RF-EMF at an average specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0, 2, 4, or 10 W/kg for 72 h. After exposure, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, antioxidant enzyme activity, anxiety-like behavior, hearing thresholds, cell ultrastructure, and apoptosis were detected. Our results revealed that hearing thresholds and basic indexes of animal behavior did not change significantly after exposure (P > 0.05). However, the MDA levels of ACx were increased (P < 0.05), and catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activities were decreased (P < 0.05) in the exposure groups compared to the sham group. Ultrastructural changes of ACx, including swollen mitochondria and layered myelin sheaths, were observed. Cytochrome-c relocalization, caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 activation were detected in the exposure groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that oxidative stress is an important mechanism underlying the biological effects of RF-EMR, which can induce ultrastructural damage to the ACx and cell apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent mechanism. Moreover, oxidative stress, apoptosis induction and ultrastructural damage increase in a SAR-dependent manner. However, RF-EMR does not increase hearing thresholds or induce anxiety.

AB  - Previous studies show that stressful events after ovulation in sows significantly impaired the embryo cleavage with a significant elevation of blood cortisol. However, the effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol on fertilization and embryo development remain to be specified, and whether they damage pig embryos directly or indirectly is unclear. This study demonstrated that embryo development was unaffected when pig parthenotes were cultured with different concentrations of CRH/ACTH/cortisol. However, embryo development was significantly impaired when the embryos were cocultured with pig oviductal epithelial cells (OECs) in the presence of CRH/cortisol or cultured in medium that was conditioned with CRH/cortisol-pretreated OECs (CRH/cortisol-CM). Fertilization in CRH/cortisol-CM significantly increased the rates of polyspermy. CRH and cortisol induced apoptosis of OECs through FAS and TNF alpha signaling. The apoptotic OECs produced less growth factors but more FASL and TNF alpha, which induced apoptosis in embryos. Pig embryos were not sensitive to CRH because they expressed no CRH receptor but the CRH-binding protein, and they were tolerant to cortisol because they expressed more 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (HSD11B2) than HSD11B1. When used at a stress-induced physiological concentration, while culture with either CRH or cortisol alone showed no effect, culture with both significantly increased apoptosis in OECs. In conclusion, CRH and cortisol impair pig fertilization and preimplantation embryo development indirectly by inducing OEC apoptosis via the activation of the FAS and TNF alpha systems. ACTH did not show any detrimental effect on pig embryos, nor OECs.

AB  - Weaning wields environmental, social, and nutritional stresses that are detectable in the blood metabolite levels of the offspring. Prenatal stress in the form of maternal immune activation (MIA) in response to infection, which is associated with health and behavior disorders, also elicits prolonged changes in blood and brain cytokine and metabolite levels of the offspring. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of weaning and MIA on the offspring's liver function to advance the understanding of the impact of stressors on peripheral and central nervous systems, physiology, and health. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to compare the level of hepatic metabolites from 22-day-old pigs (n = 48) evenly distributed among weaning (nursed or weaned), viral MIA exposure (yes or no), and sexes. Weaning effects were detected on 38 metabolites at p-value < 0.05 (28 metabolites at FDR p-value < 0.05), and sex-dependent MIA effects were detected on 11 metabolites. Multiple intermediate and final products of the enriched (FDR p-value < 0.05) glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathways were over-abundant in nursed relative to weaned pigs. The enriched pathways confirm the impact of weaning on hepatic metabolic shift, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Higher levels of the glucogenic amino acid histidine are observed in pigs exposed to MIA relative to controls, suggesting that the role of this metabolite in modulating inflammation may supersede the role of this amino acid as an energy source. The lower levels of cholesterol detected in MIA pigs are consistent with hypocholesterolemia profiles detected in individuals with MIA-related behavior disorders. Our findings underline the impact of weaning and MIA stressors on hepatic metabolites that can influence peripheral and central nervous system metabolic products associated with health and behavior disorders.

AB  - Environmental cues that predict increased risk of herbivory can prime plant defenses; however, few studies have explored how such cues elicit broader plant responses, including potential effects on plant growth and other resource allocations that may affect tolerance to herbivore damage. We exposed goldenrod plants (Solidago altissima) to varying concentrations of the putative sex pheromone of a gall-inducing herbivore, which has previously been implicated in defense priming. In experiments with two plant genotypes and three herbivore populations, any level of exposure to the pheromone enhanced tolerance of galling, rescuing flower production to levels observed for ungalled plants. Exposure to low doses of the pheromone elicited greater resistance to galling than exposure to high doses, with unexposed plants exhibiting intermediate resistance, suggesting a nonlinear relationship between exposure and defense priming. These findings suggest plant responses to environmental cues associated with biotic stressors are broader and more complex than previously appreciated.

AB  - The effects of the equilibration time, the vitrification procedure, and the warming procedure on the quality of goat oocytes vitrified by Cryotop were assessed. In the first part of the study, oocytes were exposed to 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 10% ethylene glycol (EG) for 1, 3, 5, or 10 minutes, respectively, followed by vitrification. In the second part, after equilibration in 7.5% DMSO +7.5% EG for 3 minutes, 10% DMSO +10% EG for 3 minutes, or 4% EG for 10 minutes, oocytes were equilibrated in 15% DMSO +15% EG, 20% DMSO +20% EG, or 35% EG for 30 seconds before vitrification. The vitrification procedures were designated as first vitrification procedure (VPI), second vitrification procedure (VPII), and third vitrification procedure (VPIII), respectively. In the third part, oocytes vitrified using VPIII were warmed by the three procedures (first warming procedure [TPI], second warming procedure [TPII], or third warming procedure [TPIII]) containing different concentrations of trehalose. The results showed that after equilibration for 1 or 3 minutes in 10% DMSO and 10% EG, the viability and developmental capability of vitrified oocytes were significantly superior to the groups after equilibration for over 5 minutes (p < 0.05). With the VPIII procedure, the frequencies with normal morphology, cleavage, and blastocyst formation of vitrified oocytes were 91.87% +/- 4.14%, 76.51% +/- 4.37%, and 39.84% +/- 2.91%, respectively, demonstrating a significant increase compared to the VPI or VPII group (p < 0.05). The rates of vitrified oocytes with normal morphology and cleavage in the TPI group were higher than the TPII or TPIII group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, equilibration in 10% DMSO and 10% EG for <3 minutes benefits the viability of vitrified oocytes. EG may be more efficient for vitrification of goat oocytes compared to DMSO. Higher concentrations (more than 1 M) of trehalose enhance cryosurvival of goat oocytes when warming.

AB  - Although the glaciers in the Antarctic periphery currently modestly contribute to sea level rise, their contribution is projected to increase substantially until the end of the 21st century. The South Shetland Islands (SSI), located to the north of the Antarctic Peninsula, are lacking a geodetic mass balance calculation for the entire archipelago. We estimated its geodetic mass balance over a 3-4-year period within 2013-2017. Our estimation is based on remotely sensed multispectral and interferometric SAR data covering 96% of the glacierized areas of the islands considered in our study and 73% of the total glacierized area of the SSI archipelago (Elephant, Clarence, and Smith Islands were excluded due to data limitations). Our results show a close to balance, slightly negative average specific mass balance for the whole area of -0.106 +/- 0.007 m w.e. a(-1), representing a mass change of -238 +/- 12 Mt a(-1). These results are consistent with a wider scale geodetic mass balance estimation and with glaciological mass balance measurements at SSI locations for the same study period. They are also consistent with the cooling trend observed in the region between 1998 and the mid-2010s.

AB  - In this study, we investigated cause-specific temporal and spatial trends in sea turtle strandings in New Caledonia. Five species of sea turtles were recorded in the 406 strandings documented between January 1999 and March 2021. Green turtles represented the majority of the stranded species (68%), reflecting the importance of the resident green turtle population in New Caledonian waters. Nearly half of the individuals stranded were juveniles (48%). The great majority of strandings were recorded in the South Province, the most populous province of New Caledonia (73%). The main causes of the strandings were classified as unknown (50%), followed by poaching (17%), by-catch (15%), collision (10%), natural (8%), plastic ingestion (0.5%) and other (0.5%). This study contains the first official record of the presence and relative importance of fibropapilloma in New Caledonia, but we could not determine if it was the cause of death for the stranded individuals. Two individuals, after necropsies, were found to have ingested plastic (one in 2011 and the other in 2020). This is the first record of plastic ingestion for sea turtles in New Caledonia. Three significant trends were also found during the study: an increase in the number of individuals reported in the study since 2004; a seasonal effect, with most strandings occurring in summer (November to January); and stranding hotspots. Rehabilitation allowed for 35% of individuals found alive to be released back into the wild. This study suggests that mitigation strategies such as "go slow" zones and a robust stranding network should be put in place in New Caledonia.

AB  - Ciborinia camelliae is the causal agent of camellia flower blight (CFB). It is a hemibiotrophic pathogen, inoperculate Discomycete of the family Sclerotiniaceae. It shows host and organ specificity infecting only flowers of species belonging to the genus Camellia, causing serious damage to the ornamental component of the plant. In this work, the first mitochondrial genome of Ciborinia camellia is reported. The mitogenome was obtained by combining Illumina short read and Nanopore long read technology. To resolve repetitive elements, specific primers were designed and used for Sanger sequencing. The manually curated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the Italian strain DSM 112729 is a circular sequence of 114,660 bp, with 29.6% of GC content. It contains two ribosomal RNA genes, 33 transfer RNAs, one RNase P gene, and 62 protein-coding genes. The latter include one gene coding for a ribosomal protein (rps3) and the 14 typical proteins involved in the oxidative metabolism. Moreover, a partial mtDNA assembled from a contig list was obtained from the deposited genome assembly of a New Zealand strain of C. camelliae. The present study contributes to understanding the mitogenome arrangement and the evolution of this phytopathogenic fungus in comparison to other Sclerotiniaceae species and confirms the usefulness of mitochondrial analysis to define phylogenetic positioning of this newly sequenced species.

AB  - We discuss the intricate relationship between the evolution of the concept of stress and the development of the concept of animal welfare. After a brief review of the main concepts of animal welfare, we analyse important steps in the evolution of the concept of stress, starting from the mechanistic approach of the General Adaptation Syndrome to the recent integrative allostatic theory. We show how, over time, each concept of stress has informed the development of the concept of animal welfare. We discuss the role of emotions and affective states in the response of animals to challenges and how psychological stress is integral to the welfare of animals. Lastly, we discuss briefly the potential role of the gut-brain axis in both the concept of stress and the concept of welfare.

AB  - In the Americas, the Comarca Lagunera (CL), located in North-arid Mexico, concentrates one of the main dairy cattle hubs (>500,000 Holstein cows) managed under highly technified-industrial schemes. Dairy cows' nutrition is based on the use of total mixed rations; whereas feed rejection (i.e., 3-5%) has been observed, such feed-leftovers retain a high-pitched nutritional value. The CL also holds an emergent sheep industry, which exhibited the largest production value growth (i.e., >580%; 2010-2023). With that in mind and considering a circular economy perspective, we envisioned a research opportunity. Our working hypothesis states that a basal diet founded on such dairy cow feed-leftovers and aligned with short-term supplementation (i.e., 40 d) with Withania somnifera L. (Ashwagandha) will enhance some reproductive and behavioral outcomes in Black Belly rams. Such approach should bridge these two interesting animal production systems in the CL. Considering a circular economy perspective, this study evaluates the possible effect of targeted short-term supplementation with Withania somnifera L. (WS; Ashwagandha) on ram's seminal quality, socio-sexual behaviors, and blood constituents. Black Belly rams (n = 20) received a basal diet comprising feed-leftovers from dairy cows in the north-arid Mexico (i.e., Comarca Lagunera CL). The experimental units, with proven libido and fertility, were homogeneous in terms of age (3.41 +/- 0.21 yr.), live weight (LW; 53.8 +/- 3.3 kg), body condition (BC; 2.96 +/- 0.01 units), initial sperm concentration (2387 +/- 804 x 10(6)), and viability (23.9 +/- 15.6%). Rams were randomly assigned during the transition reproductive period (i.e., May to Jun; 25 degrees NL) to three treatment groups: non-supplemented control group (CONT; n = 6), low WS-supplemented (LWS; i.e., 100 mg kg LW-1 d(-1) x 40 d; n = 7), and high-WS-supplemented (HWS; i.e., 200 mg kg LW-1 d(-1) x 40 d; n = 7). The basal leftover diet was offered twice daily (0700 and 1600 h); the experimental period (EP) lasted 47 d. No differences (p > 0.05) among treatments occurred regarding LW and BCS at the onset of the EP. Whereas the greater scrotal circumference (SCRC, cm) arose in the LWS and CONT rams, an increased ejaculated volume (VOLEJA, mL) occurred in the WS-rams. A total of 5/9 (i.e., 55%) appetitive and 3/3 (i.e., 100%) consummatory sexual behaviors favored (p < 0.05) the WS-rams, particularly the HWS rams, towards the final EP. The same was true (p < 0.05) regarding the hemogram variables white blood cell count (x10(9) cells L-1), hemoglobin concentration (g dL(-1)), and medium corpuscular volume (fL). This study, based on a rethink-reuse-reduce enquiry approach, enabled connectedness between two noteworthy animal systems in the CL: dairy cows and meat sheep schemes. Certainly, the use of dairy cow feed-leftovers aligned with the short-term supplementation with WS promoted enhanced testicular function, augmented seminal volume, and an increased sexual behavior in Black Belly rams in northern Mexico. Finally, while our research outcomes should enhance not only the resilience and sustainability of sheep production and the well-being of sheep-producers and their families, it may also embrace clinical translational applications.

AB  - In this paper, the ammonium polyphosphate (APP) is mixed with epoxy to fabricate APP/epoxy goat horn composites. The composites were obtained by casting method with different weight ratios of APP of 0%, 10%, 15%, and 20% for improving the mechanical and thermal properties. This is the first paper to discuss about both mechanical and thermal properties of APP/epoxy goat horn composites. The mechanical properties were evaluated by tensile test and wear test. For the goat horn composites with a content of 20 wt% of APP, the tensile strength was 30 MPa, shows that adding APP led to composites having a better tensile strength. From limiting oxygen index test results, it is clear that goat horn composite is fire retardant, and that the fire-retardant value improves with the addition of APP up to a weight ratio of 15% APP. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that the degradation of composites in relation to temperature. From the TGA analysis, the bio composites without APP gives the better results comparing with incorporation of APP in composites up to 40% of weight loss. At the same time, the 50% of weight loss occur at the degradation temperature of around 380 degrees C for 20 wt% of APP composites. It shows the addition of APP improves the thermal stability of the composites. The ignition time from the horizontal flammability test of the composites of 0, 10, 15, and 20 wt% APP were 20, 22, 24, and 25 (in s) respectively. It shows that the addition of filler material into the composites, the ignition time also increases. The water absorption percentage was peak at 15% of APP and lower at 10% of APP. All the samples were saturated after 80 h. The lower percentage of water absorption in composites can be attributed to the improved interfacial bonding between the fibers and matrix. From scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis the morphological structure and dispersion of ammonium polyphosphate and goat horn particles in epoxy bio composites were studied.

AB  - 1. The fasting endurance hypothesis (FEH) predicts strong selection for large body size in mammals living in environments where food supply is interrupted over prolonged periods of time. The Arctic is a highly seasonal and food-restricted environment, but contrary to predictions from the FEH, empirical evidence shows that Arctic mammals are often smaller than their temperate conspecifics. Intraspecific studies integrating physiology and behaviour of different-sized individuals may shed light on this paradox.
   2. We tested the FEH in free-living Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus. We measured daily energy expenditure (DEE), subcutaneous body temperature (T-sc) and activity levels during the late winter in 14 adult females with body masses ranging from 46.3 to 57.8 kg. Winter energy expenditure (WEE) and fasting endurance (FE) were modelled dynamically by combining these data with body composition measurements of culled individuals at the onset of winter (14 years, n = 140) and variation in activity level throughout winter (10 years, n = 70).
   3. Mean DEE was 6.3 +/- 0.7 MJ/day. Lean mass, T-sc and activity had significantly positive effects on DEE. Across all 140 individuals, mean FE was 85 +/- 17 days (range 48-137 days). In contrast to the predictions of the FEH, the dominant factor affecting FE was initial fat mass, while body mass and FE were not correlated. Furthermore, lean mass and fat mass were not correlated. FE was on average 80% (45 days) longer in fat than lean individuals of the same size. Reducing activity levels by similar to 16% or T-sc by similar to 5% increased FE by 7% and 4% respectively.
   4. Our results fail to support the FEH. Rather, we demonstrate that (a) the size of fat reserves can be independent of lean mass and body size within a species, (b) ecological and environmental variation influence FE via their effects on body composition and (c) physiological and behavioural adjustments can improve FE within individuals. Altogether, our results suggest that there is a selection in Svalbard reindeer to accumulate body fat, rather than to grow structurally large.

AB  - Upper Triassic deposits of the Leigh Creek Coal Measures in South Australia yield exquisitely preserved plant fossils of a typical mid- to high-latitude Gondwanan flora. Here, we present a detailed cuticular analysis of the ginkgoalean leaf Sphenobaiera insecta J.M. Anderson et H.M. Anderson nov. emend., which is characterized by an unlobed or once-lobed, elliptic to oblanceolate lamina, abundant round to fusiform resin bodies, and absence of interveinal striae. We also propose an emendation to the genus diagnosis so that Sphenobaiera encompasses also unlobed leaves such as most of those attributed to S. insecta. Such leaves may be distinguished from morphologically similar co-occurring leaf taxa, such as Heidiphyllum elongatum (Pinales) and Rochipteris spp. (Petriellales), based on the characteristic resin bodies and sporadic occurrence of vein dichotomies in the central lamina. Sphenobaiera insecta leaves show common evidence of a particular type of herbivory damage along the leaf margin in the form of small (1-1.5-mm-long) semi-circular patches each lined by a crescent-shaped, darkened reaction rim.

AB  - Rice chaff, sawdust, and rape straw are commonly used as padding materials in the ectopic fermentation system. However, the characteristics of greenhouse gas emissions the ectopic fermentation system using rice chaff, sawdust, as well as the effects of rape straw on these emissions, remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of different proportions of rape straw (0, 10 %, 25 %, and 50 %) on greenhouse gas emission characteristics in this system. The experimental results indicated that the treatment group containing rice chaff, sawdust, and more than 25 % rape straw significantly increased fermentation temperature, prolonged the thermophilic phase, enhanced the maturity of fermentation products, and altered microbial community structures compared to the control group with only rice chaff and sawdust. Redundancy analysis revealed that replacing rice chaff and sawdust with 50 % rape straw significantly decreased the relative abundance of methanogens (e.g., Methanospirillum and Methanobacterium) and denitrifying species (e.g., Denitrificimonas caeni and Aliarcobacter butzleri), resulting in reductions in cumulative emissions of CH4 and N2O by up to 44.6 % and 84.9 %, respectively, compared to the treatment group with rice chaff and sawdust alone. The absolute abundance of the nosZ gene was positively correlated with N2O emissions. Therefore, rape straw has been demonstrated to be an effective padding material that reduces CH4 and N2O emissions while enhancing the maturity of fermentation products in the ectopic fermentation system.

AB  - Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is an immunoinhibitory receptor required to suppress inappropriate immune responses such as autoimmunity. Immune checkpoint antibodies that augment the PD-1 pathway lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs), organ non-specific side effects due to autoimmune activation in humans. In this study, we generated a PD-1 mutant pig using electroporation-mediated introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into porcine zygotes to evaluate the PD-1 gene deficiency phenotype. We optimized the efficient guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting PD-1 in zygotes and transferred electroporated embryos with the optimized gRNAs and Cas9 into recipient gilts. One recipient gilt became pregnant and gave birth to two piglets. Sequencing analysis revealed that both piglets were biallelic mutants. At 18 mo of age, one pig showed non-purulent arthritis of the left elbow/knee joint and oligozoospermia, presumably related to PD-1 modification. Although this study has a limitation because of the small number of cases, our phenotypic analysis of PD-1 modification in pigs will provide significant insight into human medicine and PD-1-deficient pigs can be beneficial models for studying human irAEs.

AB  - Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is emerging as a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, similar as that of alternative splicing (AS), and plays a prominent role in regulating gene expression and increasing the complexity of the transcriptome and proteome. We use polyadenylation selected long-read isoform sequencing to obtain full-length transcript sequences in porcine muscles at five developmental stages. We identify numerous novel transcripts unannotated in the existing pig genome, including transcripts mapping to known and unknown gene loci, and widespread transcript diversity in porcine muscles. The top 100 most isoformic genes are mainly enriched in Gene Ontology terms related to muscle growth and development. It is revealed that intron retention/exon inclusion and the usage of distal polyadenylation site (PAS) are associated with ageing through analyzing changes of AS and PAS during muscle development. We also identify developmental changes in major transcripts and major PASs. Furthermore, genes/transcripts important for muscle development are identified. The results confirm the importance of AS and APA in pig muscles, substantially increasing transcriptional diversity and showing an important mechanism underlying gene regulation in muscles.

AB  - The aim of this experiment is to investigate the effects of optimizing the dietary energy supply of Songliao Black growing and fattening pigs on their growth performance, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen balance, energy metabolism and oxidation energy supply, slaughter performance, and meat quality at a low ambient temperature. Forty-eight 75-day-old Songliao Black growing barrows with an initial weight of 33.38 +/- 1.29 kg were randomized into two groups, with four replicates in each group and six pigs in each replicate. Two groups (CON group: low fat, normal energy; TES group: high fat, high energy) were fed isonitrogenous diets with different energy levels and fat contents. The experimental animals were raised at the same ambient temperature (10 +/- 1 degrees C) all day. After 5 days of pre-feeding, the formal experiment began. Four Songliao Black barrows weighing approximately 80 kg were selected from each group for a five-day experimental period for digestibility and metabolism and respiratory calorimetry tests. All pigs (185 days of age) were slaughtered simultaneously at the end of the 110-day experimental period when their average body weight reached approximately 110 kg. The results showed that the average daily feed intake of the TES group was lower than that of the CON group (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the feed-to-gain ratio was lower in the TES group during the fattening period (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the crude fat digestibility, deposition energy, energy deposition rate, deposition energy of fat, and fat oxidation were higher (p < 0.05), and the intake and urinary nitrogen, carbohydrate oxidation, urinary energy, and protein oxidation were lower in the TES group (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the serum high-density lipoprotein concentration, low-density lipoprotein concentration, and triglyceride concentration were higher in the TES group (p < 0.05), while alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were lower in the TES group (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the backfat thickness was higher in the TES group (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the weight gain/digestible protein and live lean meat mass/digestible protein were higher in the TES group (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the yellowness (b*45min) value of the longissimus thoracis was higher in the TES group (p < 0.05), and the shear force was lower (p < 0.05). Therefore, at a low ambient temperature, appropriately increasing the levels of dietary fat and energy was beneficial for improving the production performance and energy utilization efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions and protein oxidation, saving protein resources of Songliao Black pigs.

AB  - The study was conducted to evaluate the feed intake, digestibility, bodyweight change and carcass characteristics of Farta lambs fed Brachiaria (now: Urochloa) hybrid Mulato II and natural pasture hays in various proportions as a basal diet supplemented with a local concentrate mixture (CM). Twenty-five yearling male Farta lambs with a mean initial body weight of 19.6 +/- 0.29 kg (mean +/- s.e.) were used in feeding (90 days) and digestibility (7 days) trials. The lambs were randomly allocated to the following 5 dietary treatments on the basis of stratified body weight: 100% natural pasture hay (NPH) (T1); 75% NPH+25% Urochloa hybrid Mulato II hay (MH) (T2); 50% NPH+50% MH (T3); 25% NPH+75% MH (T4); and 100% MH (T5). A local concentrate mixture [300 g dry matter (DM)/hd/d] was fed to all animals. Crude protein (CP) concentration of the basal diet increased as proportion of MH in the ration increased (P<0.05). Intake of DM and nutrients, and nutrient digestibility coefficients increased significantly (P<0.05) as proportion of MH in the roughage component of the ration increased. Final body weight, average daily bodyweight gain, feed conversion efficiency and most carcass parameters measured were significantly (P<0.05) higher as proportion of MH increased from 0 to 100% in the basal diet. Based on the biological performance of the experimental lambs, performance of sheep in the region could be enhanced significantly by incorporating MH with native pasture hay and concentrate supplement in feeding rations. Economic assessments would reveal the optimal combinations of native pasture and MH for feeding to achieve particular outcomes. Other improved grass and legume species may fill the same role and should be investigated in differing environments.

AB  - Simple Summary In the realm of intelligent animal husbandry, the fundamental underpinning of intelligence lies in the capability to identify individual livestock and perform automatic headcounts. Presently, many farming operations still rely on manual counting methodologies, which exhibit notable deficiencies, particularly when confronted with the challenges posed by the substantial populations of sheep and the frequent need for counting. Manual counting is marred by inefficiency and susceptibility to errors such as duplication and omission, thereby presenting formidable hurdles. In response to these challenges within the domain of animal husbandry, this research introduces a deep neural network model that leverages contactless computer vision technology for the automatic detection and enumeration of sheep. We have systematically deployed a series of advanced and efficacious strategies to enhance the model's performance. Empirical investigations substantiate that our approach can proficiently and accurately automate the counting of sheep within practical farming environments. This method holds significant promise for the intelligent management of sheep farms and possesses adaptability for application across diverse livestock types, underscoring its practical utility. In essence, this study furnishes an effective and practical solution that advances precision and automation in animal husbandry.Abstract To achieve rapid and precise target counting, the quality of target detection serves as a pivotal factor. This study introduces the Sheep's Head-Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SH-SSD) as a solution. Within the network's backbone, the Triple Attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance the MobileNetV3 backbone, resulting in a significant reduction in network parameters and an improvement in detection speed. The network's neck is constructed using a combination of the Spatial Pyramid Pooling module and the Triple Attention Bottleneck module. This combination enhances the extraction of semantic information and the preservation of detailed feature map information, with a slight increase in network parameters. The network's head is established through the Decoupled Head module, optimizing the network's prediction capabilities. Experimental findings demonstrate that the SH-SSD model attains an impressive average detection accuracy of 96.11%, effectively detecting sheep's heads within the sample. Notably, SH-SSD exhibits enhancements across various detection metrics, accompanied by a significant reduction in model parameters. Furthermore, when combined with the DeepSort tracking algorithm, it achieves high-precision quantitative statistics. The SH-SSD model, introduced in this paper, showcases commendable performance in sheep's head detection and offers deployment simplicity, thereby furnishing essential technical support for the advancement of intelligent animal husbandry practices.

AB  - The present study seeks to investigate the use of husbandry waste and sawdust in the construction of degradable pots as a suitable alternative to plastic pots. Six mixture ratios of cattle manure and sawdust (85:15, 80:20, 75:25, 70:30, 65:35, and 60:40) were used along with three types of natural binders (sheep's wool, cornstarch, and sheep's wool:cornstarch) in phase I of the project. Phase I was replicated in triplicate to identify the best composition for each binding agent. International standards dictate that evaluations of biological pots include investigations into thickness swelling, internal bonding, and water absorption. Mean comparison of the resultant factorial data using the Tukey and TOPSIS methods indicated that production of bio-pots with a mixture of 80% manure and 20% sawdust may provide the best results for all three pot types. Phase II of the project involved using field experiments and cultivation of tomato plants in direct comparison to a commercial sample pot. The optimal pots for each binding agent in phase I were used in the evaluation. Field tests showed pots produced with 80% manure and 20% sawdust using cornstarch for binding adhesion performed best in terms of degradability and physical and mechanical properties.

AB  - The paper proposes the use of Sheep wool fibers (SWF) deriving from the fleece of domestic sheep ("Valle del Belice" from Sicily) as reinforcement for rammed earth building components. Addition of natural fibers to the mix design of earth-based building materials allows to improve their tensile strength, ductility, impact resistance, toughness, and to reduce drying shrinkage. To this aim, an experimental campaign on more than 180 fibers has been carried out, determining the main mechanical properties of interest for their use as reinforcement. Since wool is highly hydrophilic, three different conditioning programs (wet, dry and an intermediate condition) were compared, in order to get useful information about the preservation of the mechanical properties in wet environments like those present in lime mixes. The dependency of the properties from the fibers' diameter was investigated, and the results were statistically analyzed using a modified Weibull distribution as function of the fiber diameters, finding a strong correlation with the mechanical properties. The use of natural fibers as reinforcement could enhance the environmental sustainability of the building components, especially when natural fibers are obtained from agricultural wastes deriving from sheep of lowquality wool not used in the textile industry and that must be disposed of in landfills.

AB  - Gut microbiota impacts fish metabolism, nutrient utilization, and health. We know little about how temperature and diet interact with rainbow trout gut microbes. A total of 288 fish (average body weight: 45.6 g) fed four iso-caloric, -lipidic, and -nitrogenous diets comprised crude protein (40%) and lipid (20%) manufactured as 100% animal-based protein (AP) and blend of 50 fish oil (FO)/50 camelina oil (CO), 100% AP and 100% CO, 100% plant-based protein (PP) and blend of 50 FO/50 CO or 100% PP and 100% CO at 14 or 18 degrees C water temperature. Gut content was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing. Alpha-diversity did not change significantly. Regardless of diet, Tenericutes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria dominated. At family level, Aeromonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae dominated at 18(degrees)C, while Mycoplasmataceae dominated at 14 degrees C. Moreover, genes relating to amino acid, carbohydrate, fat, and energy metabolisms and fatty acid biosynthesis significantly increased at 18 degrees C. Functional profiles did not vary significantly among diets, except for a higher methionine and cysteine metabolism in fish fed plant ingredient compared animal diet, suggesting trout fed plant-derived protein mixed with CO could be as effective as those fed fish meals mixed with 50/50 FO and CO.

AB  - Homeopathy is widely used as a complementary therapy, but its effects on the behavior of production animals remain underexplored. This study evaluated the influence of a homeopathic complex on the behavior of castrated male and female piglets in the nursery phase. The experiment lasted 35 days and involved 105 animals. Piglets were allotted to five treatments in a completely randomized block design with seven replicates using three piglets per experimental unit. Tested treatments were: negative control-basal diet without additives; basal diets with 4.5, 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0 kg/ton of the homeopathic complex in the feed. Behavioral tests included open field (OF), novel object (NO), sociability, discriminative learning, judgment bias, and reactivity during weighing (RDW). Vocalizations were lower in females than males during the OF test (p = 0.016). In the RDW test, a trend was identified (p = 0.076): as the level of the homeopathic complex increased, escape attempts decreased in females and increased in males (sex x treatment interaction). Females also showed greater resistance to movement (p = 0.018). Our study suggests that the homeopathic complex does not impact the behavior of castrated male and female nursery piglets. The findings further illustrate that the sex of the animals affects their behavior, with females displaying higher levels of inactivity compared to castrated male piglets.

AB  - Abroma augustum (L.) L. f. is characterized by its fibrous structure, spiny trichomes, and distinctive leaf formations, which collectively contribute to its unique morphology and potential medicinal applications. This study aims to investigate the phytochemical constituents and elucidate the pharmacognostic and physicochemical characteristics of the stem bark powder, including evaluation of its antioxidant capacity and hepatoprotective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity in both in vitro and ex vivo experimental models. Comprehensive phytochemical screening identified 50 distinct phytochemicals, including a range of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenes, phenolics, and coumarins, among others. The extract displayed substantial solubility, with total phenolic and flavonoid content quantified as 12.32 +/- 0.01 mg/g and 42.14 +/- 3.5 mg/g, respectively. The antioxidant activity revealed IC50 values obtained from 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2 '-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid (ABTS), measured at 214.007 mu g/mL, 132.307 mu g/mL, and 45.455 mu g/mL, respectively. Additionally, the methanolic extract exhibited significant hepatoprotective properties, with observable reductions in lipid peroxidation and decreased concentrations of liver damage biomarkers (ALT, AST, and LDH) in both HepG2 cells and goat liver homogenate. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these effects, including histopathological examinations and biochemical assays, followed by the administration of plant methanolic extracts.

AB  - Memory consolidation is associated with the regulation of protein kinases, which impact synaptic functions and promote synaptogenesis. The administration of spermidine (SPD) has been shown to modulate major protein kinases associated with memory improvement, including the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (PKC) and cAMPdependent protein kinase (PKA), key players in the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. Nevertheless, the initial mechanism underlying SPD-mediated memory consolidation remains unknown, as we hypothesize a potential involvement of the memory consolidation precursor, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-alpha (CaMKII alpha), in this process. Based on this, our study aimed to investigate potential interactions among PKC, PKA, and CREB activation, mediated by CaMKII alpha activation, in order to elucidate the SPD memory consolidation pathway. Our findings suggest that the post-training administration of the CaMKII inhibitor, KN-62 (0.25 nmol, intrahippocampal), prevented the memory enhancement induced by SPD (0.2 nmol, intrahippocampal) in the inhibitory avoidance task. Through western immunoblotting, we observed that phosphorylation of CaMKII alpha in the hippocampus was facilitated 15 min after intrahippocampal SPD administration, resulting in the activation of PKA and CREB, 180 min after infusion, suggesting a possible sequential mechanism, since SPD with KN-62 infusion leads to a downregulation in CaMKII alpha/PKA/CREB pathway. However, KN-62 does not alter the memory-facilitating effect of SPD on PKC, possibly demonstrating a parallel cascade in memory acquisition via PKA, without modulating CAMKII alpha. These results suggest that memory enhancement induced by SPD administration involves crosstalk between CaMKII alpha and PKA/CREB, with no PKC interaction.

AB  - Although generally abundant, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations in the southeastern United States have recently experienced several localized declines attributed to reduced fawn recruitment following the establishment of coyotes (Canis latrans). The Southern Appalachians is a mountainous region suggested to be experiencing white-tailed deer declines, as harvest numbers and hunter success rates have substantially decreased in northern Georgia since 1979. Low fawn survival (16%) was also recently documented in the Chattahoochee National Forest (CNF) in northern Georgia, necessitating further examination. We radio-collared 14 yearling and 45 adult female white-tailed deer along with 71 fawns during 2018-2020 in the CNF to estimate field-based vital rates (i.e., survival and fecundity) and parameterize stage-structured population models. We projected population growth rates (lambda) over 10 years to evaluate the current rate of decline and various other management scenarios. Our results indicated that the observed population would decline by an average of 4.0% annually (lambda = 0.960) under current conditions. Only scenarios including antlerless harvest restrictions in addition to improved fawn survival resulted in positive growth (lambda = 1.019, 1.085), suggesting these measures are likely necessary for population recovery in the region. This approach can be applied by wildlife managers to inform site-specific management strategies.

AB  - Boron (B) has been established as a beneficial micronutrient for some farm animals. However, its impact on coping negative energy balance during transition and subsequent production performance needs critical perusal. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine the effect of B supplementation on productive performance, apparent nitrogen (N), and mineral utilization in peripartum Murrah buffaloes. Thirty advanced pregnant buffaloes (60 days prior to expected date of calving) were allocated into three groups, i.e. control, B-200, and B-400, and supplemented with pharmacological concentration of B at 0, 200, and 400 ppm, respectively, from 45 days prior to expected date of calving till 120 days post calving. Two metabolism trials were conducted (with animals having similar expected date of calving), one during prepartum (30 days prior to the expected date of calving) and another during postpartum (90 days post calving) phase to evaluate nutrient utilization and balance of N as well as minerals. Results revealed that B supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) overall plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), whereas plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyric acid, insulin, triglyceride, and glucose did not differ (P > 0.05) among the groups. Dry matter intake, nutrient digestibility, and N balance remained unaffected with B supplementation. Higher (P < 0.05) apparent absorption coefficient for magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) was observed in pregnant animals, while during lactation, absorption coefficient of calcium, Mg, and Zn was increased (P < 0.05) in B-supplemented groups. Hence, it can be concluded that alteration in NEFA concentration and variation in apparent absorption coefficient of minerals with B supplementation suggest its role in energy and mineral metabolism. However, further investigations are required to determine the underlying mechanism of action for the present findings.

AB  - Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) consist of six-carbon volatile aldehydes, alcohols, and their esters. They are formed from polyunsaturated fatty acids and are involved in the defense of plants against herbivores and pathogens. GLVs generally have low concentrations in intact healthy plant tissues, but the biosynthetic pathway to form GLVs is quickly activated by mechanical damage to tissues, an event called the GLV-burst. Most seed plants have the ability to implement GLV-burst; however, this potential in non-seed plants has not been extensively researched. In this study, we examined the GLV-burst capacity of monilophytes, lycophytes, and bryophytes, and confirmed that monilophytes and lycophytes showed substantial GLV-burst ability, while bryophytes did not, with a few exceptions. When the genome sequence of a model lycophyte, Selaginella moellendorffii was reviewed, 10 genes were found that showed high similarity with the non-canonical cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP74s, specialized in oxylipin formation. Recombinant proteins expressed with Escherichia coli showed that one of them had the ability to encode allene oxide synthase, and another encoded hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), preferring linolenic acid 13-hydroperoxide, and it was inferred that this gene was responsible for GLV-burst in S. moellendorffii. Based on the phylogenetic tree constructed with CYP74s of non-seed and seed plants, we hypothesized that HPL was acquired independently in the lycophyte and seed plants through diversification of CYP74 genes.

AB  - The red palm weevil (RPW; Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier (Coleoptera Curculionidae)) is an invasive insect pest that is difficult to manage due to its nature of infesting the host palm trees from within. A holistic, molecular-based approach to identify proteins that correlate with RPW infestation could give useful insights into the vital processes that are prevalent to the host's infestation response and identify the potential biomarkers for an early detection technique. Here, a shotgun proteomic analysis was performed on oil palm (Elaeis guineensis; OP) under untreated (control), wounding by drilling (wounded), and artificial larval infestation (infested) conditions at three different time points to characterise the RPW infestation response at three different stages. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed many overlapping pathways between the control, wounded, and infested groups. Further analysis via literature searches narrowed down biologically relevant proteins into categories, which were photosynthesis, growth, and stress response. Overall, the patterns of protein expression suggested abscisic acid (ABA) hormone signalling to be the primary driver of insect herbivory response. Interspecies molecular docking analysis between RPW ligands and OP receptor proteins provided putative interactions that result in ABA signalling activation. Seven proteins were selected as candidate biomarkers for early infestation detection based on their relevance and association with ABA signalling. The MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD028986. This study provided a deeper insight into the mechanism of stress response in OP in order to develop a novel detection method or improve crop management.

AB  - Theaflavin-3,3 '-digallate (TFDG), a polyphenol derived from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, is known to have many health benefits. In this study, the antibacterial effect of TFDG against nine bacteria and the sporicidal activities on spore-forming Bacillus spp. have been investigated. Microplate assay, colony-forming unit, BacTiter-Glo(TM), and Live/Dead Assays showed that 250 mu g/mL TFDG was able to inhibit bacterial growth up to 99.97%, while 625 mu g/mL TFDG was able to inhibit up to 99.92% of the spores from germinating after a one-hour treatment. Binding analysis revealed the favorable binding affinity of two germination-associated proteins, GPR and Lgt (GerF), to TFDG, ranging from -7.6 to -10.3 kcal/mol. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that TFDG treatment lowered the expression of gpr, ranging from 0.20 to 0.39 compared to the control in both Bacillus spp. The results suggest that TFDG not only inhibits the growth of vegetative cells but also prevents the germination of bacterial spores. This report indicates that TFDG is a promising broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-spore agent against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, acid-fast bacteria, and endospores. The potential anti-germination mechanism has also been elucidated.

AB  - Use of cooled stored boar semen for artificial insemination accounts for 99% of inseminations in pork production sectors worldwide. The aim of the present study was to examine use of GameteGuard (R)-CP, a natural plant derived blend of antioxidants, supplemented in one commercially available semen extender on sperm quality, conception rate, farrowing rate, and litter size. Ejaculates from 16 commercial Duroc boars were used in a split-ejaculate single-sire artificial insemination study. Sperm were evaluated for motility, viability, acrosome integrity, membrane stability, mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA intactness, and total antioxidant reactivity on both day 1 and 4 subsequent to ejaculate collection. Sows were inseminated after a treatment regimen was imposed to synchronize time of ovulation (n = 1476) among females using sperm collected 4 days subsequent to ejaculate collection extended in AndroStar Plus (R) or GameteGuard (R)-CP supplemented extender. At day 4 post-ejaculate collection, there was maintenance of sperm viability, membrane stability, acrosome intactness, mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA intactness (P < 0.01) when there was use of GameteGuard (R)-CP treatments. When control samples were used, there were lesser (P < 0.01) values from day 1-4 for all variables evaluated. Conception rate and farrowing rates were 7.4% and 9.7% greater, respectively (P < 0.05), but there was no difference as a result of GameteGuard (R)-CP-treatment in mean litter outcomes. The results in the present study indicate antioxidant supplementation using GameteGuard (R)-CP maintains sperm quality during cool sperm storage resulting in improved conception and farrowing rates when using semen stored in the cooled state for as long as 4 days.

AB  - Silicon occupies an important position in the nutrient requirements of wheat. It has been reported that silicon enhances plant resistance to phytophagous insects. However, only limited research has been carried out on the effects of silicon application to wheat and Sitobion avenae populations. In this study, three silicon fertilizer concentrations were treated for potted wheat seedlings, including 0 g/L, 1 g/L, and 2 g/L of water-soluble silicon fertilizer solution. The effect of silicon application on the developmental period, longevity, reproduction, wing pattern differentiation, and other vital life table parameters of the S. avenae were determined. The cage method and the Petri dish isolated leaf method were used to determine the effect of silicon application on the feeding preference of the winged and wingless aphid. The results showed silicon application had no significant effect on the aphid instar of 1-4; although, 2 g/L silicon fertilizer prolonged the nymph stage and 1 and 2 g/L of silicon application all shortened the adult stage and reduced the longevity and fertility of the aphid. Two instances of silicon application reduced the net reproductive rate (R-0), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), and finite rate of increase (lambda) of the aphid. A 2 g/L silicon application prolonged the population doubling time (t(d)), significantly reduced the mean generation time (T), and increased the proportion of winged aphids. The results also demonstrated that the selection ratio of winged aphids in wheat leaves treated with 1 g/L and 2 g/L silicon was reduced by 8.61% and 17.88%, respectively. The number of aphids on leaves treated with 2 g/L silicon was significantly reduced at 48 and 72 h of aphids released, and the application of silicon to wheat was detrimental to the feeding preference of S. avenae. Therefore, the application of silicon at 2 g/L to wheat has an inhibitory effect on the life parameters and feeding preference of S. avenae.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 1 mu mol/l zearalenone (ZEN) and 1 mu mol/l matairesinol (MAT), alone or in combination, on the morphology of in vitro-cultured ovarian preantral follicles. Ovaries from four adult sheep were collected at a local slaughterhouse and fragmented, and the ovarian pieces were submitted to in vitro culture for 3 days in the presence or absence of the test compounds. The morphology of primordial and primary follicles was impaired by ZEN. The plant lignan MAT alone did not maintain the morphology of the ovarian follicles; its combination with ZEN counteracted the negative effects observed when follicles were cultured in the presence of the mycotoxin alone. However, MAT was not able to promote the in vitro development of the ovarian follicles.

AB  - The magnitude and persistency of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rodent hippocampus is species-dependent: rats express more robust and more prolonged LTP in response to a broader afferent frequency range than mice. The C57Bl/6 mouse is an extremely popular murine strain used in studies of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial learning. Recently it was reported that it expresses impoverished LTP compared to other murine strains. Given the important role of the dopamine D1/D5 receptor (D1/D5R) in the maintenance of LTP and in memory consolidation, we explored to what extent strain-dependent differences in LTP in mice are determined by differences in D1/D5R-control. In CaOlaHsd mice, robust LTP was induced that lasted for over 24 h and which was significantly greater in magnitude than LTP induced in C57Bl/6 mice. Intracerebral treatment with a D1/D5R-antagonist (SCH23390) prevented both the early and late phase of LTP in CaOlaHsd mice, whereas only late-LTP was impaired in C57Bl/6 mice. Treatment with a D1/D5R-agonist (Chloro-PB) facilitated short-term potentiation (STP) into LTP (> 24 h) in both strains, whereby effects became evident earlier in CaOlaHsd compared to C57Bl/6 mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significantly higher expression of D1-receptors in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CaOlaHsd compared to C57Bl/6 mice. These findings highlight differences in D1/D5R- dependent regulation of strain-dependent variations in hippocampal LTP in C57Bl/6 and CaOlaHsd mice, that may be mediated, in part, by differences in the expression of D1R in the hippocampus.

AB  - Rehabilitation of disused mine sites through stabilisation and botanical restoration is ecologically important, but metal transfer pathways to colonising wildlife are often less understood and have never been studied in marsupials. The re-habilitated Royal George tin mine tailings (Tasmania, Australia) and colonisation by bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) represented an opportunity to examine potential metal transfer from mine tailings to an herbivorous marsupial. The aim of this study was to examine metal transfer pathways from the mine tailings to wombats, and to determine if wombats are at risk from metal exposure. Concentrations of metals were measured in the tailings substrate, surface water and vegetation, as well as fur samples from a resident wombat, and non-resident (control) wombats. The mineralogy of the tailings is dominated by quartz, muscovite, feldspars, topaz, kaolinite and calcite. Concentrations of several metals were high (exceeding varying health standards) in the tailings (As, Cu, Hg, Pb, Ni, Zn), water (As, Cd, Cu, Zn) and vegetation (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, Zn). Relative to non-resident wombats, elevated levels of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Sn were measured in the fur of a resident wombat. Based on modelling of the exposure pathways, consumption of plant material is the most likely metal transfer pathway for As, Cu and Pb, although the risks from in-gestion of tailings to this fossorial marsupial should not be discounted. This study is the first to investigate metal expo -sure pathways to marsupials using rehabilitated mine tailings. Further research is needed to accurately quantify ecological risks and toxicity for wombats and other marsupials native to mining landscapes.

AB  - Elephant grass (Cenchrus purpureus (Schumach.) Morrone) is recognized as a forage plant with high dry matter production potential and high nutritional value, can be used in different ways, which include grazing material, grassland formation, and use as preserved forage. The selection of the elephant grass genotypes most adapted to the soil-climatic conditions of the northern region of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, can increase forage supply, especially in the dry season, thus mitigating the effects of production seasonality in that region. This study proposes to examine the genotypic superiority of elephant grass genotypes based on productivity, adaptability, and stability; predict genetic gains for forage production-related traits; and infer the minimum number of evaluations necessary to obtain greater gains with selection. The experiment involved 53 elephant grass genotypes in a randomized-block design with two replications. Dry matter yield, number of tillers per clump, plant height, and stem diameter were measured. The statistical analysis was carried out via mixed models (REML/BLUP), using the computational resources of Selegem software. The obtained repeatability values demonstrate that the genotypes' performance is constant across measurements, with seven measurements required to reliably select elephant grass clones. There was agreement between the HMGV, RPGV, and HMRPGV statistics in choosing the most productive, adaptable, and stable genotypes. Clones Mercker 86 Mexico, Mercker Comum, Gramafante, Guacu/I.Z.2, and Pasto Panama were the most productive, adaptable, and stable.

AB  - Simple Summary The greater the number of animals, the harder it becomes to monitor the health status of individual animals. The purpose of this study was to calculate a measure of activity for individual pigs in a fattening barn by using an automatic detection system. The results show changes in the activity data of group-housed pigs during fattening periods. We assume a high potential to use this automatically calculated activity measure for various purposes.Abstract Monitoring the activity of animals can help with assessing their health status. We monitored the walking activity of fattening pigs using a UHF-RFID system. Four hundred fattening pigs with UHF-RFID ear tags were recorded by RFID antennas at the troughs, playing devices and drinkers during the fattening period. A minimum walking distance, or virtual walking distance, was determined for each pig per day by calculating the distances between two consecutive reading areas. This automatically calculated value was used as an activity measure and not only showed differences between the pigs but also between different fattening stages. The longer the fattening periods lasted, the less walking activity was detected. The virtual walking distance ranged between 281 m on average in the first fattening stage and about 141 m in the last fattening stage in a restricted environment. The findings are similar to other studies considering walking distances of fattening pigs, but are far less labor-intensive and time-consuming than direct observations.

AB  - Simple Summary Along with the traditional traits, swine breeding programs for Italian dry-cured ham production have recently aimed to include novel phenotypes. The identification of the genomic regions underlying such new traits helps to untangle their genetic architecture and may provide useful information to be integrated in genetic selection. With this aim, we estimated genetic parameters and conducted a single step genome wide association studies (GWAS) on untrimmed and trimmed thigh weight considering two pig crossbred lines approved for Italian Protected Designation of Origin ham production. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were characterized based on the variance of 10-SNP sliding windows genomic estimated breeding values. In particular, we identified interesting QTL signals on several chromosomes, notably on chromosome 4, 6, 7 and 15. A high heritability and genetic correlation were observed for the two traits under investigation and although independent studies including other pig populations are required to disentangle the possible effects of specific linkage disequilibrium in our population, our findings suggest that such QTL could be investigated in future pig breeding programs to improve the reliability of genomic estimated breeding values for the dry-cured ham production. Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) dry-cured ham is the most important product in the Italian pig breeding industry, mainly oriented to produce heavy pig carcasses to obtain hams of the right weight and maturity. Recently, along with the traditional traits swine breeding programs have aimed to include novel carcass traits. The identification at the genome level of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting such new traits helps to reveal their genetic determinism and may provide information to be integrated in prediction models in order to improve prediction accuracy as well as to identify candidate genes underlying such traits. This study aimed to estimate genetic parameters and perform a single step genome wide association studies (ssGWAS) on novel carcass traits such as untrimmed (UTW) and trimmed thigh weight (TTW) in two pig crossbred lines approved for the ham production of the Italian PDO. With this purpose, phenotypes were collected from similar to 1800 animals and 240 pigs were genotyped with Illumina PorcineSNP60 Beadchip. The single-step genomic BLUP procedure was used for the heritability estimation and to implement the ssGWAS. QTL were characterized based on the variance of 10-SNP sliding window genomic estimated breeding values. Moderate heritabilities were detected and QTL signals were identified on chromosome 1, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 15 for both traits. As expected, the genetic correlation among the two traits was very high (similar to 0.99). The QTL regions encompassed a total of 249 unique candidate genes, some of which were already reported in association with growth, carcass or ham weight traits in pigs. Although independent studies are required to further verify our findings and disentangle the possible effects of specific linkage disequilibrium in our population, our results support the potential use of such new QTL information in future breeding programs to improve the reliability of genomic prediction.

AB  - The potential transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from the rhizosphere to plants and humans poses a significant concern. This study aims to investigate the distribution of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) in rice using four genotypes and identify the primary source of TRGs in grains. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed to determine the abundance of seven TRGs and intI1 in four rice varieties and three partitions during the jointing and heading stages, respectively. The analysis of the bacterial community was conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the profiles of TRGs. It was observed that tetZ was pre-dominantly present in the rhizosphere and endoroot, whereas tetX became dominant in grains. The relative abundances of TRGs and intI1 exhibited significant variations across both the variety and partition. However, no significant differences were observed in grains, where the abundances of TRGs were several orders of magnitude lower compared to those in the rhizosphere. Nevertheless, the potential risk of the dissemination of TRGs to humans, particularly those carried by potential pathogens in grains, warrants attention. The increased likelihood of TRGs accumulation in the rhizosphere and endoroot of hybrid rice varieties, as opposed to japonica varieties, may be attributed to the heightened metabolic activities of their roots. The significant associations observed between intI1 and TRGs, coupled with the substantial alterations in potential hosts for intI1 across various treatments, indicate that intI1-mediated horizontal gene transfer plays a role in the diverse range of bacterial hosts for TRGs. The study also revealed that rhizosphere bacteria during the jointing stage serve as the primary contributors of TRGs in grains through the endoroot junction. The findings indicate that Japonica rice varieties exhibit superior control over TRGs compared to hybrid varieties, emphasizing the need for early interventions throughout the entire growth period of rice.

AB  - The migration of fish is influenced by the unique environmental characteristics of the destination and migratory habitat preferences. There are three fishways in Miyanaka Intake Dam. The rock-ramp fishway was newly established in 2012, creating an environment with different flow velocities and water depths. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the new rock-ramp fishway for native fish through two surveys. In the first survey, traps were installed during the survey period in all three fishways and all fish were caught. The run-up environment was quantified by measuring the flow velocity. In the second survey, fish were caught by spectrum methods upstream and downstream from the dam. It was found that bottom-dwelling fish and swimming fish not bound to the bottom with low migration abilities used the rock-ramp fishway for migration and as a habitat. After the new rock-ramp fishway was built, catches increased upstream from the dam. Further, the rock-ramp fishway is a potential habitat for certain species, such as Cottus pollux. As this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of rock-ramp fishways, the research results are expected to be valuable to fishery managers and those planning river engineering projects.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM), released into the air by a variety of natural and human activities, is a key indicator of air pollution. Although PM is known as the extensive health hazard to affect a variety of illness, few studies have specifically investigated the effects of PM 10 exposure on schizophrenic development. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the impact of PM 10 on MK -801, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, induced schizophrenia -like behaviors in C57BL/6 mouse. Preadolescent mice were exposed PM 10 to 3.2 mg/m 3 concentration for 4 h/day for 2 weeks through a compartmentalized whole -body inhalation chamber. After PM 10 exposure, we conducted behavioral tests during adolescence and adulthood to investigate longitudinal development of schizophrenia. We found that PM 10 exacerbated schizophrenia -like behavior, such as psychomotor agitation, social interaction deficits and cognitive deficits at adulthood in MK -801 -induced schizophrenia animal model. Furthermore, the reduced expression levels of brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the phosphorylation of BDNF related signaling molecules, extracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element -binding protein (CREB), were exacerbated by PM 10 exposure in the adult hippocampus of MK -801treated mice. Thus, our present study demonstrates that exposure to PM 10 in preadolescence exacerbates the cognitive impairment in animal model of schizophrenia, which are considered to be facilitated by the decreased level of BDNF through reduced ERK-CREB expression.

AB  - The persistence of the novel brominated flame retardant, bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), in the environment and its potential for bioaccumulation in living organisms, including humans, further exacerbate its health risks. Therefore, ongoing research is crucial for fully understanding the extent of TBPH's neurotoxicity and for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study aims to investigate the potential neurotoxicity of TBPH on mouse neurobehavior and to evaluate the protective effects of the natural antioxidant astaxanthin (AST) against TBPH-induced neurotoxicity. The results indicate that exposure to TBPH can lead to a decline in learning and memory abilities and abnormal behaviors in mice, which may be associated with oxidative stress responses and apoptosis in the hippocampus. TBPH may disrupt the normal function of hippocampal neurons by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Mice exposed to TBPH treated with AST showed improved learning and memory abilities in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Step-down test (SDT). AST, through its antioxidant action, was able to significantly reduce the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels induced by TBPH, the increased expression of apoptosis markers, and the activation of the ERK1/2-FOS signaling pathway, alleviating TBPH-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons and improving neurobehavioral outcomes. These findings suggest that AST may alleviate the neurotoxicity of TBPH by modulating molecular events related to apoptosis and the ERK1/2-FOS signaling pathway. Thus, this study provides evidence for AST as a potential interventional strategy for the prevention or treatment of cognitive decline associated with environmental neurotoxicant exposure.

AB  - Simple Summary Horses are herbivores and hindgut fermenters, which makes forage-based diets a natural choice. Traditionally, diets for horses have comprised large portions of starch-rich concentrate shown to adversely affect intestinal health. Feeding more forage and less concentrate benefits health and performance in horses. However, forage nutritional quality can differ greatly and further studies on forage diets for horses are needed. Increased knowledge on which type of forages are suitable for different horse categories is important for the horse industry, advisors, veterinarians and the diet formulations industry. This study compared a grass forage diet, a legume forage diet and a concentrate and forage diet, on the fluid balance, body weight and function of the large intestine in French trotters. The results showed that an early-harvested grass forage diet implied greater faecal water-holding capacity without increasing body weight and greater faecal concentrations of total bacteria. In conclusion, early-harvested forage might promote the fluid balance of high-performing horses. Early-harvested forage that can fulfil the energy and protein requirements with no need to add concentrate also promotes hindgut health. Racing events challenge the fluid balance of athletic horses. The equine large intestine functions as a fluid reservoir, since the properties of dietary forage fibre affect the digesta water content and the milieu of this ecosystem. This study aimed to investigate the effect of grass maturity and legume forage on the faecal water-holding capacity (WHC) and microbial ecosystem, and the fluid balance and body weight (BW) of French trotters in race training. Six geldings were offered three diets with different fibre compositions: concentrate and late-harvested mature grass haylage (35:65 energy ratio) (CMGH); early-harvested grass haylage and mature grass haylage (80:20) (EGH); and lucerne and mature grass haylage (80:20) (LH), for 24 days in a Latin square design. Body weights were lower and faecal WHC higher when the horses were fed EGH compared to CMGH and LH (485 vs. 492 and 492 kg, p < 0.001; 12.6 vs. 11.1 and 11.4 g H2O/g dry faeces, p = 0.014, respectively). Total water intake and output did not differ between diets, but water excretion via faeces was lower and via urine was greater on EGH compared to CMGH and LH (13.1 vs. 18.8 and 17.6 kg, p = 0.001; 10.5 vs. 7.6 and 7.9 kg, p = 0.032, respectively). Total bacteria concentrations were higher on EGH than CMGH and LH (5.4 x 10(11) vs. 2.8 x 10(11) and 2.8 x 10(11) CFU/mL, p = 0.018, respectively). Concentrations of butyrate were greater, and pH was lower when fed EGH compared to CMGH and LH (3.0 vs. 2.0 and 1.6 mmol/L, p = 0.034; 6.5 vs. 6.9 and 7.2, p = 0.005, respectively). In conclusion, forage harvested at an early stage of maturity could benefit athletic horses' fluid balance by providing a more available large intestine fluid reservoir without increasing BW.

AB  - Experimental data presented in the article were obtained from isolated olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of adult Wistar rats. The aim of the study was to demonstrate, using in vivo fluorescent confocal microscopy and pharmacological analysis, whether the GluN3A subunit is localized in OSNs of adult animals. Analysis of the results revealed the presence of the GluN3A subunit in OSNs of adult rats as part of the excitatory glycine receptor and the GluN3A-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (GluN3A-NMDAR). In addition, typical NMDARs and non-NMDARs were also localized in OSNs. All these receptors can be located either in the same or in different receptor cells, reflecting the heterogeneity of OSNs in the olfactory epithelium.

AB  - Supplementation of a mother's diet with antioxidants, such as hydroxytyrosol (HTX), has been proposed to ameliorate the adverse phenotypes of fetuses at risk of intrauterine growth restriction. In the present study, sows were treated daily with or without 1.5 mg of HTX per kilogram of feed from day 35 of pregnancy (at 30% of total gestational period), and individuals were sampled at three different ages: 100-day-old fetuses and 1-month- and 6-month-old piglets. After euthanasia, the brain was removed and the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex were dissected. The profile of the catecholaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitters (NTs) was characterized and an immunohistochemical study of the hippocampus was performed. The results indicated that maternal supplementation with HTX during pregnancy affected the NT profile in a brain-area-dependant mode and it modified the process of neuron differentiation in the hippocampal CA1 and GD areas, indicating that cell differentiation occurred more rapidly in the HTX group. These effects were specific to the fetal period, concomitantly with HTX maternal supplementation, since no major differences remained between the control and treated groups in 1-month- and 6-month-old pigs.

AB  - Current treatments for trauma-related disorders remain ineffective for many patients.(1,2) Fear extinction deficiency is a prominent feature of these diseases,(3) and many behavioral treatments rely on extinction training.(4,5) However, in many patients, therapy is followed by a relapse of symptoms, and the underpinnings of such interindividual variations in vulnerability to relapse remain unknown.(6-8) Here, we modeled interindividual differences in post-therapy fear relapse with an ethologically relevant trauma recovery paradigm. After fear conditioning, male rats underwent fear extinction while foraging in a large enriched arena, permitting the expression of a wide spectrum of behaviors. An automated multidimensional behavioral assessment revealed that post-conditioning fear response profiles clustered into two groups: some animals expressed fear by freezing more, whereas others darted more, as if fleeing from danger. Remarkably, the tendency of an animal to dart or to freeze after CS presentation during the first extinction session was, respectively, associated with stronger or weaker fear renewal. Moreover, genome-wide transcriptional profiling revealed that these groups differentially regulated specific sets of genes, some of which were previously implicated in anxiety and trauma-related disorders. Our results suggest that post-trauma behavioral phenotypes and the associated gene expression landscapes can serve as markers of fear relapse susceptibility and thus may be instrumental for future development of more effective treatments for psychiatric patients.

AB  - The marine environment is abundant in natural products that are beneficial to humans. Among these compounds are the polyphenols produced by marine flora as secondary metabolites and used as a defense against stressful environmental conditions. Accordingly, recent pharmacological and biomedical studies showed that polyphenols from marine and coastal floras have several important bioactivities including antioxidant property. In this study, we measured the total polyphenol content (TPC) of 75 species of marine-associated flora. The TPC of their methanolic extracts was measured spectrophotometrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and was expressed both as mg phloroglucinol equivalent per g of dry weight (mg PGE g(-1) DW) and as mg gallic acid equivalent per g dry weight (mg GAE g(-1) DW). The TPC values are higher when expressed in terms of GAE compared to PGE. Also, the mean TPC of tracheopytes (229 & PLUSMN; 43.0 mg PGE g(-1) DW) was higher compared to the mean TPC of macroalgae (69.4 & PLUSMN; 9.59 mg PGE g(-1) DW). For macroalgae, ochrophytes (97.9 & PLUSMN; 22.7 mg PGE g(-1) DW) had the highest mean TPC followed by chlorophytes (80.0 & PLUSMN; 20.5 mg PGE g(-1) DW) and rhodophytes (49.5 & PLUSMN; 8.60 mg PGE g(-1) DW). Moreover, our study also showed that TPC varied between young and mature tissues, among different color morphotypes and different parts of the plants. Although the concentrations of total polyphenols varied among species, ages, strains and parts of the plant, our study showed that marine and coastal floras are rich sources of polyphenols that could be further examined for their biological activities and other applications in food industry.

TI  - H2O2 Mediates VEGF- and Flow-Induced Dilations of Coronary Arterioles in Early Type 1 Diabetes: Role of Vascular Arginase and PI3K-Linked eNOS Uncoupling

AB  - In diabetes, the enzyme arginase is upregulated, which may compete with endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) for their common substrate L-arginine and compromise NO-mediated vasodilation. However, this eNOS uncoupling can lead to superoxide production and possibly vasodilator hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation to compensate for NO deficiency. This hypothesis was tested in coronary arterioles isolated from pigs with 2-week diabetes after streptozocin injection. The NO-mediated vasodilation induced by flow and VEGF was abolished by NOS inhibitor L-NAME and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin but was not affected by arginase inhibitor N-omega-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA) or H2O2 scavenger catalase in control pigs. With diabetes, this vasodilation was partially blunted, and the remaining vasodilation was abolished by catalase and wortmannin. Administration of L-arginine or nor-NOHA restored flow-induced vasodilation in an L-NAME sensitive manner. Diabetes did not alter vascular superoxide dismutase 1, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase mRNA levels. This study demonstrates that endothelium-dependent NO-mediated coronary arteriolar dilation is partially compromised in early type 1 diabetes by reducing eNOS substrate L-arginine via arginase activation. It appears that upregulated arginase contributes to endothelial NO deficiency in early diabetes, but production of H2O2 during PI3K-linked eNOS uncoupling likely compensates for and masks this disturbance.

AB  - Invasive plants typically escape specialist herbivores but are often attacked by generalist herbivores in their introduced ranges. The shifting defense hypothesis suggests that this will cause invasive plants to evolve lower resistance against specialists, higher resistance against generalists, and greater tolerance to herbivore damage. However, the duration and direction of selective pressures can shape the evolutionary responses of resistance and tolerance for invasive plants. Two critical factors are (1) residence time (length of time that an invasive species has been in its introduced range) and (2) specialist herbivore reassociation (attack by purposely or accidentally introduced specialists). Yet, these two factors have not been considered simultaneously in previous quantitative syntheses. Here, we performed a meta-analysis with 367 effect sizes from 70 studies of 35 invasive plant species from native and invasive populations. We tested how the residence time of invasive plant species and specialist reassociation in their introduced ranges affected evolutionary responses of defenses against specialists and generalists, including herbivore resistance traits (physical barriers, digestibility reducers and toxins), resistance effects (performance of and damage caused by specialists or generalists) and tolerance to damage (from specialists or generalists). We found that residence time and specialist reassociation each significantly altered digestibility reducers, specialist performance, generalist damage, and tolerance to specialist damage. Furthermore, residence time and specialist reassociation strongly altered toxins and generalist performance, respectively. When we restricted consideration to invasive plant species with both longer residence times and no reassociation with specialists, invasive populations had lower resistance to specialists, similar resistance to generalists, and higher tolerance to damage from both herbivore types, compared with native populations. We conclude that the duration and direction of selective pressure shape the evolutionary responses of invasive plants. Under long-term (long residence time) and stable (no specialist reassociation) selective pressure, invasive plants generally decrease resistance to specialists and increase tolerance to generalist damage that provides mixed support for the shifting defense hypothesis.

AB  - The river otter is considered to be an important bioindicator of water clarity. This study focuses on mercury contamination within this species. Throughout the study, individuals from habitats in the foothills and surroundings of the Liptovska Mara reservoir were analyzed. Twenty-three samples of liver tissue, and twenty-two samples of hair and kidney tissue were collected. Of these samples, the average mercury concentration detected in tissues was 10.6 mg/kg in guard hairs; 12.9 mg/kg in under hairs; 3.3 mg/kg in kidney tissue; and 4.3 mg/kg in liver tissue. Analysis of certified reference material (ERM-BB186-Pig Kidney) was used to assist in the development of an accurate method for total mercury determination in animal tissues, to check the quality of measurements, and to validate the measurement method. Our method represented a high average percentage of recovery (> 95%) in the standard reference material matrix and a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 5% or less. Seasonality was determined to be a significant factor influencing the level of contamination of a given individual, both through mercury methylation within the aquatic environment and through fish ingestion by this apex semi-aquatic predator (guard hairs (p = 0.01); underfur (p = 0.04); kidney (p = 0.03); liver (p = 0.03)). Sex, location, and body size were not found to have a significant influence on heavy metal concentrations in river otters sampled in terms of season.

AB  - Sodium is an essential micronutrient for herbivores, yet its role in influencing dietary breadth remains poorly understood. The cotton-melon aphid Aphis gossypii, a polyphagous species, provides an ideal model for exploring the mechanisms influencing dietary breadth, as its populations are divided into distinct host-specialized biotypes. Cottonspecialized aphids cannot use cucumber plants as a host, and conversely, cucumber-specialized aphid cannot utilize cotton. In this study, cotton-specialized aphids acquired the ability to use cucumber plants after feeding on a moderate-concentration sodium diet for five days. Sodium-rich diets proved attractive to aphids and significantly enhanced their growth rate, net reproductive rate, and intrinsic rate of natural increase. Additionally, feeding on a sodium diet markedly increased the activities of key detoxification enzymes, including glutathione S-transferase, carboxylesterase, and cytochrome P450. This suggests that sodium-enriched diets prime aphids' detoxification systems, enabling them to alter their dietary range. These findings highlight sodium's potential role in modulating herbivore dietary breadth and suggest that sodium availability in plants could influence the structure and dynamics of food webs in agricultural ecosystems.

AB  - Background Reductions of ammonia volatilization resulting from slurry applications to intensively managed grassland may be achieved via slurry acidification. However, it remains uncertain if this may result in pollution swapping, that is, due to reduced ammonia volatilization and increased soil N availability, emission of nitrous oxide from soils may increase. Aims In this study, we compared control (no fertilizer) and slurry fertilized grassland treatments [not acidified (S) and acidified (AS)] to assess whether slurry acidification results in changes of soil N availability, denitrification potential and activity as well as soil fluxes of nitrous oxide. Methods The study was carried out in a montane grassland system in southern Germany, and parameters were followed over a 43-days period with continuous measurements of soil GHG fluxes and biweekly measurements of microbial and soil parameters preceding and following two fertilizing events. Results Over the entire observation period cumulative N2O emissions were significantly elevated for treatments receiving slurry applications, with differences between acidified and non-acidified slurry treatments being overall insignificant. Transcripts of the nirK type nitrite reductase showed significantly higher numbers in soils of the AS treatment. While soil potential denitrification rates (PDR) did not differ between treatments, there was a strong tendency of increased PDRs for the AS treatment. Conclusions Against expectation, we did not find that application of AS affects PDR or soil N2O emissions significantly, though in tendency higher rates of soil N2O emissions as well as higher potential denitrification rates were found in treatments receiving acidified slurry as compared to the slurry only treatment. Our results indicate that longer observation periods and given the significant spatial variability, higher numbers of replicates are needed, to finally assess if slurry application indeed results in increased soil denitrification activity, soil N2O production and soil-atmosphere N2O emissions.

AB  - Objective: To test whether recombinant human diamine oxidase (rhDAO) with a mutated heparin-binding motif (mHBM), which shows an increased alpha-distribution half-life, prevents histamine-induced hemodynamic effects.Material: Thirty-eight female guinea pigs were either pretreated with rhDOA_mHBM or buffer.Treatment and methods: Guinea pigs received a continuous infusion of histamine. Heart rate (HR), body core temperature and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured and blood was collected.Results: Continuous intravenous infusion of 8 mu g/kg/min histamine increased mean peak plasma histamine levels from 5 (+/- 0.3 SEM) to 28 ng/mL (+/- 4.9 SEM) after 30 min but had no effect on oxygen saturation. Guinea pigs pretreated with 4 mg/kg rhDAO_mHBM showed lower mean HR (p = 0.008), histamine plasma concentrations (p = 0.002), and higher body core temperatures at the end of the histamine challenge (p = 0.02) compared to controls. Cessation of histamine infusion led to a rebound increase in MAP, but this hemodynamic instability was prevented by rhDAO_mHBM. Pretreatment with 4 mg/kg rhDAO_mHBM reduced urinary histamine (p = 0.004) and 1-Methylhistamine (p < 0.0001) concentrations compared to controls.Conclusions: Prophylactic infusion of rhDAO_mHBM prevents hemodynamic effects in a guinea pig model of continuous histamine infusion. These findings might help in the translation from animals to humans and in the selection of the optimal dosing of rhDAO_mHBM during human histamine challenge studies.

AB  - Mechanically regulated wound dressings require a rational combination of contraction and adhesion functions as well as balancing exudate-induced swelling issues. However, many of the reported dressings face the dilemma of impaired function and impeded wound self-contraction due to fluid-absorbing swelling. In this study, inspired by the tree ring, a core-ring structured hydrogel dressing capable of mechanical modulation is designed, and prepare it using a simple two-step photopolymerization process. The core covers the center of the wound, contracts spontaneously at body temperature to generate a contractile force of 3.4 kPa, and resists swelling. Meanwhile, the ring adheres to the normal epidermis around the wound and transfers the contraction stress to the wound edge. The integration of a functionally independent core and ring ultimately achieves effective wound traction and avoids dressing swelling. In murine and porcine skin wound-healing models, this hydrogel with a closely connected core and ring promotes healing by accelerating epidermal closure (50% closure in mouse skin on day 2, 85% closure in pig skin on day 8), collagen deposition, vascular maturation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These results can guide further research on mechanical force modulation in wound healing, with the potential for clinical translation.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a complex chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and possesses characteristic motor symptoms including bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, postural instability, and dystonia, resulting in nerve cell damage that further leads to reduction in the dopamine level. However, the symptomatology of Parkinson disease is diverse, including clinically significant non-motor characteristic symptoms such as anxiety, depression, pain, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, gastrointestinal disturbance, difficulty in walking and fatigue. Although there are various conventional treatment approaches used for Parkinson disease such as monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, catecholamine-O-methyl transferase inhibitors, dopamine agonist, and anticholinergics but are associated with various side effects. In Asian countries, herbal products are being used as an alternative approach for treating neurogenerative diseases. Herbal medicines are used worldwide as these have fewer side effects than that of allopathic drugs. In this review, we will summarize recent studies demonstrating use of herbs in treating parkinsonism. A search for possibly relevant literature was done using four electronic databases: Google, Pub Med, Web of Science, and Scopus. Several key phrases were used to conduct the search, including "Parkinson Disease", "Herbal Drugs", "Etiology of PD", "Conventional treatment for PD", "motor/non-motor symptoms", Clinical trials", "Symptomatology", Natural products" etc. More research was conducted by examining the abstracts, reference lists, and consulting previously published review articles. A large number of herbal medicines and their formulations are currently in use for treatment of Parkinson disease. Some of these include Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst., Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, Curcuma longa L., Gingko biloba L., and Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, Alpinia oxyphyll Miq, Hypericum perforatum L., Panax ginseng C.A. Mey. and Crocus sativus L. Although, many preclinical trials have been already reported that signifies the importance of herbal products in Parkinson disease, however, further investigation is demanded to prove their usefulness in clinics.

AB  - With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multiaccess problem-solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high-solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased nonneuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin-based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the HC dentate gyrus where high-solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.

AB  - Plants rely on cross-resistance traits to defend against multiple, phylogenetically distinct enemies. These traits are often the result of long co-evolutionary histories. Biological invasions can force naive plants to cope with novel, coincident pests, and pathogens. For example, European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is substantially threatened by the emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, a wood-boring beetle, and the ash dieback (ADB) pathogen, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. Yet, plant cross-resistance traits against novel enemies are poorly explored and it is unknown whether na_ive ash trees can defend against novel enemy complexes via cross-resistance mechanisms.
   To gain mechanistic insights, we quantified EAB performance on grafted replicates of ash genotypes varying in ADB resistance and characterized ash phloem chemistry with targeted and untargeted metabolomics.
   Emerald ash borer performed better on ADB-susceptible than on ADB-resistant genotypes. Moreover, changes in EAB performance aligned with differences in phloem chemical profiles between ADB-susceptible and ADB-resistant genotypes.
   We show that intraspecific variation in phloem chemistry in European ash can confer increased cross-resistance to invasive antagonists from different taxonomic kingdoms. Our study suggests that promotion of ADB-resistant ash genotypes may simultaneously help to control the ADB disease and reduce EAB-caused ash losses, which may be critical for the long-term stability of this keystone tree species.

AB  - Pineapple (Ananas comosus L.), cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) and mango (Mangifera indica L.) are among the most cultivated plants in tropical and subtropical regions due to the high demand around the world. Following the harvesting and processing of pineapple, cashew and mango fruits, a huge amount of waste is generated, which is generally discarded into the environment, contributing to global pollution and water contamination. This study aims to propose alternative feeds for pigs by characterizing cashew, pineapple and mango fruit by-products through an in vitro two-step (gastro-intestinal and caecum) study to provide feeds not competing with humans and promoting eco-sustainable livestock. Ten by-products [i.e., pineapple peel and pomace; cashew nut testa, cashew (var. yellow) whole fruit and pomace; cashew (var. red) whole fruit and pomace; mango peel, kernel and testa] were sampled in Benin. The samples involved chemical analysis and an in vitro two-step digestion method (enzymatic + microbial digestibility). The results report a low dry matter (DM) content specifically in the pomace, peel and whole apple (13.0-27.2%), while higher lipids were observed for cashew nut testa and mango kernel (26.4 and 11.2% DM). The investigated by-products fall within the interval of referenced feeds for structural carbohydrates (NDF: 7.6-47.1% DM) and protein (6.21-51.2% DM), except mango by-products with a low content of protein (2.51-4.69% DM). The total dry matter digestibility, short-chain fatty acid and gas production were low for cashew by-products and stopped after 48 h of incubation. Pineapple pomace, cashew whole apple, pomace and testa can be considered as feedstuff in fattening pigs, presenting characteristics partly similar to beet pulp. Indeed, mango peel and kernel should be combined with a protein feed source to feed pigs. Presently, fruit by-products, such as those from cashew, pineapple and mango, are thrown into the environment, contributing to global warming and water pollution. These problems would be reduced by recycling these wastes in other fields, such as pig nutrition, creating a circular economy to provide feeds promoting eco-sustainable livestock. Indeed, in vivo studies are needed before proposing these by-products for pig diets.

AB  - Worm infections pose a significant challenge to goat farming in the tropics. While individual variations in the animals' response to this disease are observed, understanding its genetic component is crucial for establishing effective herd production management, prioritizing the selection of goats with higher resistance to parasitism. This study aimed to assess goat response to worm infection under natural field conditions using data on eggs per gram of feces (EPG), body condition score (BCS), and conjunctival mucosa coloration (FAMACHA((c))). Cluster analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques were applied to 3,839 data points from 200 individuals in an experimental goat herd in Piaui, Brazil. The study considered the phenotypic expression of resistance, sensitivity, and resilience to worm infection as responses to parasitism. Three clustering methods, namely Ward, Average, and k-means, were employed and compared with fuzzy logic obtained through the CAPRIOVI web software. The analysis revealed statistically significant differences (P<0.05) between the groups of animals classified as resistant, resilient, and sensitive to parasitism. Pregnancy and peripartum were identified as stages of heightened sensitivity to parasitism (P<0.05). Among the clustering techniques, traditional statistical methods exhibited excellent performance, with an overall accuracy percentage exceeding 90.00%. In contrast, CAPRIOVI's fuzzy logic demonstrated lower overall accuracy (77.00%). The clustering methods showed similar efficiency, but differed in terms of the distribution of animals per group, with a tendency towards greater numbers in the resistant category. Fuzzy logic circumvented this limitation by enabling the formation of groups tailored to meet the producer's interests, adding consistency in terms of the animals' response to worm infection. This finding highlights the potential of the software for goat health management.

AB  - Epidermal hairs are specialized structures on the epidermis of plants that function in crop defense against biotic and abiotic stresses, particularly in warding off herbivores and pests. However, the regulatory mechanism governing epidermal hair formation in rice remains unclear. Here, we report that OsSCR1 (SCARECROW1) and OsSCR2 redundantly promote development of three types of rice trichomes (macro hairs, micro hairs, and glandular hairs), as shown through the reduced and increased trichomes in their knockout and overexpression lines. We demonstrate that OsSCR1 acts upstream of OsWOX3B (WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 3B) in that overexpression of OsWOX3B could rescue the macro hair development defects in osscr1 osscr2 double mutants, and that OsSCR1 protein activates OsWOX3B expression using luciferase activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) assays. In addition, OsSPL10 (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE10) acts upstream of OsSCR1 and enhances its expression to promote the development of macro and micro hairs. Additionally, increasing leaf trichome density through overexpressing OsSCR2 could enhance seedling resistance to locust feeding. Collectively, our findings indicate that OsSPL10 facilitates the process of OsSCR1 inducing OsWOX3B activity to promote the formation of macro and micro hairs in rice.

AB  - Simple Summary Balantioides coli is a protozoan parasite that can infect humans, and its main reservoir is pigs. Recent studies suggested that one of B. coli variants, named variant A, has zoonotic potential. Previous studies have reported B. coli infection in pigs in different countries; however, the prevalence of the zoonotic variant is limited due to a lack of molecular information. In this study, we developed a molecular technique-based method that could differentiate B. coli variant A from B without sequence analysis. Using the method, 174/188 (94.6%) pig fecal samples collected in domestic pigs in Korea were positive for B. coli, and of the samples, 62 (33.7%) were the zoonotic variant. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a method to differentiate B. coli variants A and B without sequence analysis and to assess the molecular epidemiology of B. coli in pigs. Balantioides coli is a zoonotic protozoan parasite whose main reservoir is pigs. Recent studies have shown that B. coli variant A but not B has zoonotic potential. While B. coli infection has been reported in different animals and countries, the prevalence of the zoonotic variant is limited due to a lack of molecular information. Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence of B. coli in domestic pigs in Korea and assessed its zoonotic potential. A total of 188 pig fecal samples were collected from slaughterhouses in Korea. B. coli was identified by microscopy and molecular methods. B. coli was identified in 79 (42.9%) and 174 (94.6%) samples by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. This study also developed a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to differentiate B. coli variant A from B without sequence analysis. Using this method, 62 (33.7%) and 160 (87.0%) samples were positive for variants A and B, respectively, and 48 (26.1%) samples were co-infected with both variants. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed a high genetic diversity of B. coli in pigs in Korea. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a method to differentiate B. coli variants A and B without sequence analysis and to assess the molecular epidemiology of B. coli in pigs. Continuous monitoring of zoonotic B. coli in pigs should be performed as pigs are the main source of human balantidiasis.

AB  - Cortisol is the primary biomarker associated with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This research aimed at assessing the predictive potential and the relationship of cortisol concentrations in four media (blood, milk, whey and hair) with parity, lactation stage and productive classes. Multiparous (n = 30) and primiparous (n = 38) Italian Mediterranean buffaloes were used and assigned to four productive classes (based on percentiles of mature equivalent milk yield (EMY) and mature equivalent energy corrected milk (eECM)), and cortisol concentrations were measured using a in house radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. Parity did not show a significant effect on cortisol concentrations of the four media. The catabolic stage of lactation (up to 90 d in milk (DIM)) was characterised by higher cortisol concentrations compared to the second anabolic stage (beyond 150 DIM) in milk formulations. The plasmatic concentrations of cortisol were higher at the catabolic and the first anabolic stage (91-150 DIM) compared to the second anabolic (p = 0.022 and p = 0.009, respectively). Buffaloes beyond 150 DIM differed from those below 90 DIM (p < 0.001) and between 91 and 150 DIM (p < 0.05) in hair. Finally, hair cortisol concentrations were negatively correlated to EMY, mature equivalent protein content (EPC) (p < 0.01) and eECM (p < 0.05). The whey showed a potential to predict the concentrations of cortisol in whole extracted milk (R-2 = 0.31). Hence the development of a real-time automated cortisol measurement in milk could be a valuable tool in Italian Mediterranean Buffalo farming.

AB  - The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a generalist mesopredator found throughout the UK. It has been linked to national declines in native wildlife, especially ground-nesting birds such as waders. In the New Forest National Park, nest predation and poor chick survival is primarily responsible for low breeding success of Eurasian curlew (Numenius arguata), a species of high conservation concern. To reduce predation losses, foxes are lethally controlled by wildlife managers. Here, we identified the major food resources that are being exploited by foxes in the New Forest area and examined temporal and spatial patterns in the presence of specific food categories, with special reference to anthropogenic food. Stomachs from foxes culled in curlew breeding areas were collected from April 2021 - July 2022 and the contents of these stomachs were quantified. Foxes exhibited a highly varied diet with no single food category predominating. Anthropogenic food comprised 14% of the overall diet, with its presence predicted by proximity to human settlements and other infrastructure. We also estimated the total annual volume of anthropogenic food consumed by the fox population and by extension how many individual foxes this volume of food could support in isolation. According to these calculations, at present the number of foxes subsidised by anthropogenic food is approximately 64.8% (50.2-79.7%) of those removed by culling per year. Our findings highlight that better local food sanitation and education should become important parts of a more holistic management approach to reduce the burden of fox predation experienced by breeding waders.

AB  - Larvae of some leaf beetles carry masses of feces covering parts or all of the body, which is called a "fecal shield". In general, the shield is thought to be a defense structure against natural enemies. However, some studies have suggested that defense effectiveness varies depending on the natural enemy. In this study, we used a fecal retention leaf beetle Ophrida xanthospilota (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), and 2 local generalist predators (an ant, Camponotus japonicus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and a stinkbug, Arma custos [Hemiptera: Pentatomidae]) as a system to test the hypothesis that the fecal shield of O. xanthospilota plays different roles in predation behavior of different predators and can provide multiple chemical communication signals in predator-prey interactions. Prey bioassays showed that the fecal shield of O. xanthospilota larvae repelled the ant C. japonicus while attracting the stinkbug A. custos. The results also strongly demonstrated that hexane extracts of the fecal shield significantly repelled C. japonicus, while dichloromethane (DCM) extracts did not inhibit ant predation. Interestingly, DCM extracts attracted A. custos, but hexane extracts did not. Therefore, we suggest that the fecal shield is a double-edged sword for the larvae of O. xanthospilota. Our results also indicated that the risk-benefit tradeoff of an insect should be estimated at a community level involving multiple enemies (predators and parasites) and herbivores, rather than in a single prey-predator pair.

AB  - The symptoms of human depression often include cognitive deficits. However, cognition is not frequently included in the behavioral assessments conducted in preclinical models of depression. For example, it is well known that repeated corticosterone (CORT) injections in rodents produce depression-like behavior as measured by the forced swim test, sucrose preference test, and tail suspension test, but the cognitive impairments produced by repeated CORT have not been thoroughly examined. The purpose of this experiment was to assess the effect of repeated CORT injections on several versions of object recognition memory and modulation of the acoustic startle response by relatively low intensity prepulses, along with the more traditional assessment of depressionlike behavior using the forced swim test. Rats received 21 days of CORT (40 mg/kg) or vehicle injections followed by a battery of behavioral tests. Importantly, during behavioral testing CORT treatment did not occur (CORT withdrawal). Corticosterone decreased body weight, increased immobility in the forced swim test, lowered startle amplitudes, and facilitated responding to trials with a short interval (30 ms) between the prepulse and pulse. Corticosterone also impaired both object location and object-in-place recognition memory, while sparing performance on object recognition memory. Collectively, our data suggest that CORT produces selective disruptions in prepulse facilitation, object location, and object-in-place recognition memory, and that these impairments should be considered as part of the phenotype produced by repeated CORT, and perhaps chronic stress.

AB  - Despite significant progress in vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro culture (IVC) of oocytes and embryos, their developmental competence remains low. To address this issue, we used buffalo oocytes as a model system to investigate the effects and mechanisms of oxygen concentration on IVM and IVC. Our findings demonstrated that culturing buffalo oocytes with 5% oxygen significantly enhanced the efficiency of IVM and developmental competence of early embryos. Immunofluorescence results suggested that HIF1a played a critical role in these progresses. RT-qPCR results showed that maintaining a stable expression of HIF1a in cumulus cells with 5% oxygen concentration enhanced glycolysis, expansion, and proliferation abilities, up-regulated the expression of development-related genes, and suppressed apoptosis level. Consequently, it improved the maturation efficiency and quality of oocytes, leading to improve devel-opmental capacity of buffalo early embryos. Similar outcomes were also observed when embryos were cultured with 5% oxygen. Collectively, our study provided insights into the role of oxygen regulation during oocytes maturation and early embryo development, and could potentially improve the efficiency of human assisted-reproduction technology.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The identification of sex pheromones in native New Zealand moths has been limited, largely due to their minimal pest impact on agricultural ecosystems. The k & omacr;whai moth, Uresiphita polygonalis maorialis, a native crambid, is known for its herbivory on Sophora spp. and Lupinus arboreus leaves. Understanding the chemical ecology of this species is essential for studying its behavior, population dynamics, and ecological interactions. In this study, the female sex pheromone of U. polygonalis maorialis was analyzed using coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD). This approach identified four antennally active compounds in the female gland extracts. Subsequent gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and chemical derivatization revealed these compounds to be tetradecyl acetate (14:Ac), (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11-14:Ac), (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (Z11-14:Ac), and (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate (Z11-16:Ac). Field trapping experiments evaluated various combinations of these four EAD-active compounds and (E)-11-hexadecenyl acetate (E11-16:Ac). Results indicated that traps baited with blends containing E11-14:Ac, Z11-14:Ac, and Z11-16:Ac captured significantly more males compared to unbaited delta traps. A blend ratio of 144:84:72 mu g (E11-14:Ac: Z11-14:Ac: Z11-16:Ac) proved the most effective, capturing the highest number of males. Male captures were recorded from late November to late February, peaking in late December, suggesting a univoltine population in Canterbury. Among the three tested doses, the 300 mu g and 1000 mu g doses of the three-component blend were the most effective. The identification of the sex pheromone components of U. polygonalis maorialis provides a valuable tool for monitoring this species, contributing to a deeper understanding of its population densities and distribution within its native range. It also offers insights into the evolutionary development of pheromone communication within the genus, shedding light on species divergence and adaptation.

AB  - A factorial experiment was arranged in a randomized complete blocks design with three replicates in 2018-19 and 2019-20 growing seasons in Karaj, Iran to investigate the effects of foliar application of different potassium silicate concentrations (0, 1, 2, 3 g L-1) on camelina plants under different irrigation regimes (optimal water supply, withholding irrigation from formation of silicles, and withholding irrigation from flowering). The results indicated that both restricted irrigation regimes negatively affected the physiologic (relative water content, stomatal resistance, canopy temperature, and total chlorophyll content) and agronomic (number of silicle per plant, number of seed per silicle, 1000-seed weight, seed yield, and water use efficiency) traits as well as oil content, while the potassium silicate alleviated the adverse effects of drought stress on studied traits. The highest camelina seed yield (2521 kg ha(-1)), water use efficiency (0.492 kg ha(-1) m(-3)), and oil content (33.53%) belonged to foliar application of 2 g L-1 under optimal water supply regime. On average across potassium silicate treatments, reductions of 45 and 64%, 27 and 28%, and 6 and 11% were detected for seed yield, water use efficiency, and oil content when irrigation was restricted from silicle formation and flowering stages compared with the optimal water supply regime, respectively. Overall, the foliar application of 2 g potassium silicate L-1 under an optimal water supply regime and 3 g potassium silicate L-1 under drought stress conditions can be recommended to achieve the best performance of camelina.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress commonly happens to goats raised in the Jianghuai region of China during the summer and inevitably contributes to a loss of animal production. Dietary supplementation with probiotics is one of the practical approaches to improve animal production. By dietary supplementation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Clostridium butyricum, and their combination to the heat-stressed goats, the present study showed these probiotics effectively alleviate heat stress by improving the rumen fermentation function and growth performance. Therefore, this study provides a reference for the application of these two probiotics in ruminant production during heat stress. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and their combination on rumen fermentation and growth performance of heat-stressed goats. Twelve heat-stressed goats (20.21 +/- 2.30 kg) were divided equally into four groups: control group (CG, fed the basal diet, Saccharomyces cerevisiae supplemented group (SC, 0.60% Saccharomyces cerevisiae added to the basal diet), Clostridium butyricum supplemented group (CB, 0.05% Clostridium butyricum added to the basal diet), and their combination supplemented group (COM 0.60% Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 0.05% Clostridium butyricum added to the basal diet) and were assigned to a 4 x 3 incomplete Latin square design. The rumen fluid and feces were collected for fermentation parameters and feed digestibility analysis, and animal growth performance was also assessed during all the experiment periods. The results showed that rumen pH, rumen cellulolytic enzymes (avicelase, CMCaes, cellobiase, and xylanase) activities, and the concentrations of rumen total volatile fatty acid (TVFA), acetic acid, and propionic acid were significantly increased with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Clostridium butyricum, and their combination supplementation (p < 0.05). Besides, the dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), and the digestibility of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acidic detergent fiber (ADF) were significantly increased (p < 0.05) with supplemented these probiotics. However, the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration only significantly increased in CB and A/P ratio (acetic acid to propionic acid ratio) only significantly increased in SC and CB. These results indicated that the supplementation with these probiotics could ameliorate rumen fermentation and growth performance of heat-stressed goats.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different vitrification and warming processes on the in vitro embryo survival of caprine morulae, considering the day of recovery. A total of 136 morulae of Criolla-Neuquina goats recovered on Days 7 or 8 after sponge removal, were exposed to three different vitrification processes; V1 (n = 48): glycerol (G) + ethylene glycol (EG); V2 (n = 44): EG + 0.5 M sucrose and V3 (n = 44): G + EG + 0.5 M sucrose. The morulae of each vitrification process were randomly assigned to three warming processes; W1 (n = 45): 0.5 M sucrose at 25 degrees C; W2 (n = 44): 0.5 M sucrose at 39 degrees C; and W3 (n = 47): solution containing half the concentration of the cryoprotectants + 0.5 M sucrose at 25 degrees C. After, embryos were cultured in 100 mL TCM 199 drops under mineral oil, at 39 degrees C and a 6.5% CO2 atmosphere for 72 h according to the different treatments. There were no viable embryos in V1 and V2 in none of their three respective warmings. Only V3 showed an embryo survival rate to hatched blastocyst stage of 59.1%. When considering embryo survival according to the warming processes, the survival rate was higher in V3W2 (76.9%) and V3W3 (66.7%) groups compared to the V3W1 group (37.5%; P < 0.05). The embryo survival of V3 for Day 8 after sponge removal (81.3%) was higher compared to Day 7 (46.4%; P < 0.05). In conclusion, a successful embryo survival is obtained by using a combination of cryoprotectants (G + EG) with addition of sucrose in the vitrification process for conservation of caprine morulae in embryo transfer programs. The survival rates in vitro of vitrified-warmed morulae in goats were influenced by their recovery day. Further studies should be conducted to determine if these results are reproducible in vivo embryo transfer on field situations. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary: Yunnan Semi-fine wool sheep is a recently developed breed of sheep in China for meat and wool production. However, the nutrient requirements of this breed are scarcely studied, especially regarding minerals. This study aims to evaluate the effects of dietary calcium levels on the growth performance, calcium utilization, and serum biochemical indexes of Yunnan semi-fine wool rams as well as to estimate their calcium requirement. Diets with calcium levels ranging from 0.73% to 0.89% can improve the growth performance and calcium utilization efficiency of rams, which could serve as baseline when formulating diets for Yunnan semi-fine wool rams. Abstract Calcium (Ca) is required for the growth and development of sheep, but the requirement of Yunnan semi-fine wool (YSW) rams remains uncovered. The current study aims to estimate the Ca requirement of growing YSW rams based on their growth performance, Ca utilization, and serum biochemical indexes. Forty-five YSW rams (10-month-olds) were randomly allocated to five dietary treatments with varying Ca levels of 0.50% (D1), 0.68% (D2), 0.73% (D3), 0.89% (D4), and 0.98% (D5). A higher value for average daily gain and a lower value for the feed conversion ratio were observed in the D3 group compared to the D5 group (p < 0.05). The dry matter intake amount changed quadratically with the increased Ca levels (p < 0.05). The levels of Ca intake, fecal Ca, and excreted Ca were significantly higher in the D5 group than those in the D1 group (p < 0.05). The apparent Ca digestibility rate and the Ca retention rate were significantly higher in the D4 group than in the D1 group (p < 0.05). The serum Ca concentration increased linearly with the incremental levels of dietary Ca (p < 0.05). The activity of alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher in the D1 group than in the D2 group (p < 0.05). The serum levels of hydroxyproline, osteocalcin, and calcitonin decreased from the D1 group to the D2 group, and then significantly ascended (p < 0.05) with the dietary Ca levels from the D3 group to the D5 group. The serum parathyroid hormone content was elevated from the D1 group to the D3 group and then decreased from the D4 group to the D5 group. After calculation, the daily net Ca requirement for the maintenance of YSW rams was 0.073 g/kg of BW0.75, and the daily total Ca requirement was 0.676 g/kg of BW0.75. To optimize the growth performance and the Ca utilization of YSW rams, the recommended dietary Ca level ranges from 0.73% to 0.89% based on this study.

AB  - Existence of crack causes reduction of the load carrying capacity of ship hull structural elements and eventually reduces the hull girder strength. Previous numerical and semi-analytical studies by the same authors revealed that in addition to the value of ultimate strength, the deflection shape and plastic collapse mechanism of ship hull structural elements will change due to existence of cracking damage. In this paper results from previous studies are used to investigate the way cracks affect ultimate longitudinal strength of ship hull girder. Progressive collapse analysis of an ISSC2000 bulk carrier is carried out to estimate its ultimate strength considering existence of cracking damages at different locations of the hull girder; namely bottom, double bottom, side and deck structures. For this reason, HULLST software which is based on Smith's method was modified to be able to model specific cracks anywhere in the ship hull girder. Results show that the way cracking damage effects the ultimate strength of the ship depends highly on the ship's collapse modes in hogging and sagging conditions as well as behavior of the ship structural elements.

AB  - Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep has been shown to modulate the consolidation of fear memories, a process that may contribute to the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the direction of this modulation and its differential effects on recall versus generalization. In two complementary experiments, we addressed this by employing sleep deprivation protocols together with a novel fear-conditioning paradigm that required the discrimination between coexisting threat and safety signals. Using skin conductance responses and functional imaging (fMRI), we found two opposing effects of REM sleep: While REM impaired recall of the original threat memories, it improved the ability to generalize these memories to novel situations that emphasized the discrimination between threat and safety signals. These results, as well as previous findings in healthy participants and patients diagnosed with PTSD, could be explained by the degree to which the balance between threat and safety signals for a given stimulus was predictive of threat. We suggest that this account can be integrated with contemporary theories of sleep and fear learning, such as the REM recalibration hypothesis.

AB  - The red mite, Oligonychus yothersi (McGregor) (Acari: Tetranychidae), is a serious foliar pest of avocado (Persea americana Mill.) orchards in Chile. In summer, avocado plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) in response to feeding behaviour of O. yothersi. These HIPVs recruit natural enemies of the red mite as Parastethorus histrio (Chazeau) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Oligota pygmaea (Solier) (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae). However, P. histrio and O. pygmaea remain in infested avocado trees throughout the summer until late autumn. Therefore, we collected HIPVs, in late autumn, to test the behavioural responses of the red mite and its coleopterans predators. Volatiles were collected under semi-field conditions using the headspace technique and Porapak Q as adsorbent. The chemical analysis revealed that infested plants emitted (Z)-beta-ocimene, alpha-farnesene, and methyl salicylate (MeSA), increasing the emissions of R-limonene. These variations triggered an attractive behaviour in P. histrio and O. pygmaea, yet O. yothersi remained indifferent. The emitted HIPVs by avocado infested plants, in late autumn, elicited tri-trophic interactions in avocado orchards, where higher R-limonene emissions and up-regulated three new volatile compounds in the volatiles profile could have influenced predator's choice, being necessary to examine.

AB  - When attacked by insect herbivores, plants emit blends of chemical compounds known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Although HIPVs are produced both aboveground and belowground, how HIPVs vary across plant tissues remains unresolved, as do the selective forces shaping interspecific HIPV emission patterns. Here, we compared foliar and root HIPVs within and among closely related plant species and evaluated if different eco-evolutionary forces, including plant domestication, coexistence histories with herbivores, or phylogenetic relatedness, explain HIPV blends. To examine aboveground and belowground patterns in HIPVs, we compared leaf and root volatile profiles for six species in the Cucurbitaceae that differed in domestication status and coexistence history with specialist insect herbivores. We predicted that within-species HIPVs from different tissues would be more similar than HIPV blends among different species, and that plant volatile chemodiversity was reduced by domestication and enhanced by coexistence histories with herbivores. We found that herbivory induced both quantitative and qualitative changes in volatile emissions across all plant species, which were more pronounced aboveground than belowground. Each species produced tissue-specific HIPVs, and foliar and root HIPVs differed among species. Contrary to our predictions, plant domestication enhanced foliar volatile diversity, while coexistence histories with herbivores reduced foliar and root volatile diversity. Additionally, phylogenetic relatedness did not correlate with aboveground or belowground volatiles. Overall, this work furthers our understanding of the eco-evolutionary forces driving patterns in aboveground and belowground HIPV emissions, elucidating an important and previously undescribed component of within-plant variation in chemodiversity.
   Herbivore-induced plant volatiles differ between aboveground leaves and belowground roots both within and among plant species in the Cucurbitaceae, and these differences are correlated with plant domestication and herbivore coexistence history, but not phylogenetic relatedness.image

AB  - Bats are a highly diversified order of mammals found all over the world; however, their population size and distribution are decreasing rapidly in Europe nowadays. The study of ancient bat populations by means of their fossil record is a valuable source of contextual information for modern bat conservation studies. This paper is a comprehensive review of published bat records in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands through Quaternary times, representing the first attempt to update and standardize the knowledge of chiropters in southwestern Europe during this time period. The main goal is to identify changes in bat assemblages that might be correlatable to palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironmental changes. Our data show that the Quaternary record of bats in the area is fragmentary and strongly dependent on the presence of karstic cavities. Thus, a strong preservation bias towards colonial cave-dwelling bats exists, and species with alternative ecological requirements are under-represented. Nevertheless, this work reveals that most of the bats inhabiting the area today were already present in the region from at least the Middle Pleistocene. Interestingly, we observe a frequent association between certain cave-dwelling bats (i.e., Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Miniopterus schreibersii, Myotis myotis and M. blythii) that is still observed in many caves today; this reflects a stable ecology that has remained undisturbed despite past climatic changes. Within the well-documented periods at the end of the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene, a reduction in some common components of Quaternary assemblages (Rhinolophus species and M. schreibersii) is observed, coinciding with the Late Glacial Maximum and the Northgrippian Neoglacial (a cooling event in the Holocene). Finally, the Balearic record shows interesting palaeobiogeographical characteristics, including some eastern taxa absent in the Iberian Peninsula (Rhinolophus variabilis and R. cf. blasii) as well as an unusual abundance of Rhinolophus hipposideros.

AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic residues and antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (ARE) in closed (CSF) and open (OSF) pig farming systems was analysed. Results showed that a high level of E. coil populations, antibiotic contamination in supplied water, and additional antibiotics used, such as neomycin (NEO) or colistin (CLT), were observed in OSF. Similar ARE resistance to five antibiotics, including NEO, was observed in the water source, dung, and wastewater/sludge but were different from those of CLT. An increased occurrence of ARE was found in the sludge of anaerobic digestion (AD) and the waste stabilisation pond (WSP), but they were not well correlated with their residual antibiotic concentrations. CLT administration yielded higher ARE prevalence in pig excreta and wastewater in OSF, but its absence in CSF also resulted in ARE occurrence with increased minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels in the anaerobic digester/waste stabilisation ponds. This study revealed that ARE prevalence and MIC levels of CLT could be developed during the wastewater treatment process in the pig farm, although none of the AREs were found in the original excreta/wastewater.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a widespread beverage plant that prefers aluminum-enriched acidic soils. However, rare earth elements (REEs) might be highly phyto-available in these soils. With the increasing demands for REEs in high-technology industries, understanding the dynamics of REEs in the environment is essential. Thus, this study identified the total concentration of REEs in the root-zone soils and corresponding tea buds (n = 35) collected from tea gardens in Taiwan. Additionally, the labile REEs in the soils were extracted with 1 M KCl, 0.1 M HCl, and 0.05 M ethylenedi-aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to elucidate the fractionation tendency of REEs in the soil-plant system and the relation-ships between REEs and Al in the tea buds. The concentration of light REEs (LREEs) was higher than those of medium REEs (MREEs) and heavy REEs (HREEs) in all soil and tea bud samples. According to the upper continental crust (UCC) normalization, MREEs and HREEs were more abundant than LREEs in the tea buds. Furthermore, REEs remarkably in-creased with increasing Al in the tea buds, whereas the linear correlations between Al and MREEs and HREEs were stronger than between LREEs. Compared with LREEs, the extractabilities of MREEs and HREEs by all single extractants in the soils were higher, coinciding with their higher UCC-normalization-based enrichments in the tea buds. Moreover, the 0.1 M HCl-and 0.05 M EDTA-extractable REEs were affected by soil properties and significantly correlated with the total REEs in the tea buds. The concentration of REEs in the tea buds was successfully predicted by empirical equations of extractable REEs with 0.1 M HCl and 0.05 M EDTA, as well as general soil properties including pH, organic carbon, dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate-extractable iron, aluminum, and phosphorus. However, this prediction should be fur-ther verified using many soil and tea types in the future.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Gynura japonica (Thunb.) Juel is often confused with the non-pyrrolizidine alkaloid-producing herbs, Tu-San-Qi ( Sedum aizoon L.) and San-Qi ( Panax notoginseng L.), due to similarities in name, appearance, and medicinal use. It contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which cause over 50% of cases of hepatic sinus obstruction syndrome. However, the mechanisms underlying G. japonica-induced hepatotoxicity remain poorly understood. Aim of the study: In this study, we aimed to investigate the toxic effects of a G . japonica decoction on liver and Buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells and elucidate the associated mechanisms. Materials and methods: This study employed G. japonica decoction and examined its effects on liver function and tissue damage in Sprague-Dawley rats. Bioinformatics analysis was employed to identify gene expression and enriched pathways related to hepatotoxicity. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and flow cytometric annexin V/PI labeling assays were utilized to observe apoptosis in BRL cells induced by G. japonica. . Transmission electron microscopy and JC-1 staining were used to determine the effects of G. japonica on mitochondrial ultrastructure and membrane potential in BRL cells. The bicinchoninic acid method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and caspase-3 activity, respectively. Results: Comparisons of body weight, liver histopathology, and serum liver function-related indices in rats, t showed that exposure to G. japonica may cause liver damage. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that hepatotoxicity might be related to apoptotic signaling pathways, the positive regulation of programmed cell death, and responses to toxic substances. BRL cells exposed to the G. japonica decoction exhibited mid-to late-stage apoptosis and necrosis, along with alterations in mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential. Furthermore, expression of cytochrome C (Cyt C) and pro-apoptotic proteins was increased, anti-apoptotic proteins decreased, and caspase-3 activity elevated. Conclusions: These findings indicate that G. japonica-induced hepatotoxicity involves the activation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Our research enhances the scientific and theoretical foundation for clinical therapy and improves public awareness of the potential toxicity of herbal remedies.

AB  - This study aimed to reuse different agro-industrial by-products (poultry litter, pig manure, sewage sludge and coffee husk) for biochar production and to evaluate their Cr(VI) removal capacities in aqueous medium. The biochars showed different morphologies with porous structures. The percentages of Cr(VI) removal from solution were higher in acid medium (pH = 2), reaching values up to 87%. For all biochars, Cr(VI) removal occurs via both adsorption and reduction, being a rapid (30 min) process, which fits best to the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The biochars, especially from coffee husk, were able to reduce up to 20% of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The maximum Cr(VI) removal capacities ranged from 10.86 mg g(-1) (sewage sludge biochar) to 18.52 mg g(-1) (coffee husk biochar). Therefore, the production of biochars from the agro-industrial by-products using the same experimental conditions in one single study is important to compare the Cr(VI) removal capacities from different biomasses. Thus, this study explored the corresponding raw material without the need of further treatment. Biochars showed potential for environmental applications considering Cr(VI)-polluted environments. It is hoped to provide basis to future studies using real wastewater samples.

AB  - Simple Summary Phytogenic supplements can be used as natural feed additives through their potential effects on rumen fermentation and the growth performance of lambs. Compared to monensin (MON), dietary supplementation with neem leaf powder (NLP) could promote body weight gain with no detrimental effects on the ruminal fermentation profile, nutrient intake, or digestibility. The results of this study suggest that NLP could be used as a promising phytogenic supplement in sheep diets rather than synthetic growth promoters. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of the dietary addition of neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf powder (NLP) when compared to monensin (MON) on ruminal fermentation, feed intake, digestibility, and performance of growing lambs. Eighteen Omani lambs (22.8 +/- 2.18 kg of body weight (BW)) were equally divided into three groups (n = 6 lambs/group) for 90 days. Animals were fed an ad lib basal diet consisting of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay (600 g/kg) and a concentrated mixture (400 g/kg) offered twice daily. Experimental treatments were control (basal diet without supplements); MON (control plus 35 mg/kg DM as a positive control); and NLP (control plus 40 g/kg DM). Lambs fed NLP had reduced ruminal ammonia nitrogen concentrations, protozoal counts, total volatile fatty acid, and blood urea nitrogen concentrations compared to the control. Compared to MON, lambs fed NLP had increased ruminal acetate and decreased propionate proportions. Inclusion of NLP in the diet increased blood total protein, globulin, and liver enzyme concentrations in comparison with the control, which was similar to MON. The lamb's final BW and average BW gain were also increased with the NLP relative to the control. Further, adding NLP to the diet increased the digestibility of crude protein compared to the control diet. In conclusion, adding NLP to the diet with 40 g/kg DM could be used as a promising phytogenic supplement for growing lambs with no detrimental effects on the ruminal fermentation profile, nutrient intake, or digestibility.

AB  - Simple Summary The characterization of small ruminant lentiviruses in autochthonous goat and sheep populations, like the Moroccan one, represents an excellent source of information to understand their evolution from domestication to present day and improve the knowledge of the genetic diversity of these viruses. Serological data confirmed a low prevalence likely due to extensive breeding and management practice in this area. However, the low rate of success of routinely used serological tests led us to suppose that divergent strains might have escaped diagnostic tools thanks to mutations' diagnostic epitopes. This hypothesis is confirmed by next-generation sequencing results, which highlighted the presence of an A subtype carrying a mismatch in the serotyping epitope. Moreover, the circulation of novel B and recombinant A/B subtypes was also revealed.Abstract Recent studies that investigated the origins of SRLV strains offered new insights into their distribution among domestic ruminants. The aim of the study was to investigate SRLV circulation in Morocco. A total of 51 farms were selected in different geographical locations and tested by screening and genotyping ELISA. Whole blood was used for DNA extraction and nested gag PCR. The sample size allowed for an estimation of prevalence lower than 20% (CI 95%). Surprisingly, a large proportion of screening-positive samples were not correctly serotyped. Sanger and NGS amplicon sequencing approaches allowed us to obtain new sequences even from difficult-to-amplify samples. The serological data support the evidence of an intrinsic difficulty of SRLV to spread, likely due to management practices. The low rate of success by genotyping ELISA led us to suppose that divergent strains might have escaped from diagnostic tools, as partially confirmed by the evidence of an A subtype carrying a mismatch in serotyping epitope. The sequence analysis revealed the circulation of novel B and recombinant A/B subtypes. This study highlights the importance of monitoring viral sequences and their evolution to develop specific diagnostic tests, particularly in countries where control measures are in place.

AB  - Natural infection by intestinal nematodes was assessed in Santa Ines and Ile de France sheep breeds, over a five-month grazing period, with emphasis on the development of the immune response in lambs under two anthelmintic treatment regimens. Nineteen Santa Ines and 19 Ile de France male lambs were allocated into two treatment groups: animals under suppressive treatment with anthelmintics; and animals under targeted selective treatment (TST). The nematodes Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Strongyloides papillosus showed the highest infection intensity in the TST animals in both breeds. Parasite-specific immunoglobulin G levels were significantly higher and more rapidly induced in Santa Ines lambs. Additionally, these lambs had higher levels of parasite-specific immunoglobulin A in intestinal mucus. Animals under TST had higher means of mast cells and globule leukocytes in the intestinal mucosa due to longer and greater parasite challenge in comparison with the suppressive group. A breed effect (P < 0.05) was recorded for mast cells, with Santa Ines lambs presenting the highest counts. Although Santa Ines lambs had lower intestinal nematode counts than Ile de France lambs, they had shown a large variation in T. colubriformis burden, with most of them presenting a marked worm burden, despite showing an earlier and more intense immune response to intestinal nematode infection.

AB  - Background Branch angle is a pivotal component of tea plant architecture. Tea plant architecture not only affects tea quality and yield but also influences the efficiency of automatic tea plant pruning. However, the molecular mechanism controlling the branch angle, which is an important aspect of plant architecture, is poorly understood in tea plants. Results In the present study, three CsLAZY genes were identified from tea plant genome data through sequence homology analysis. Phylogenetic tree displayed that the CsLAZY genes had high sequence similarity with LAZY genes from other plant species, especially those in woody plants. The expression patterns of the three CsLAZYs were surveyed in eight tissues. We further verified the expression levels of the key CsLAZY1 transcript in different tissues among eight tea cultivars and found that CsLAZY1 was highly expressed in stem. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the CsLAZY1 protein was localized in the plasma membrane. CsLAZY1 was transferred into Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate its potential role in regulating shoot development. Remarkably, the CsLAZY1 overexpressed plants responded more effectively than the wild-type plants to a gravity inversion treatment under light and dark conditions. The results indicate that CsLAZY1 plays an important role in regulating shoot gravitropism in tea plants. Conclusions The results provide important evidence for understanding the functions of CsLAZY1 in regulating shoot gravitropism and influencing the stem branch angle in tea plants. This report identifies CsLAZY1 as a promising gene resource for the improvement of tea plant architecture.

AB  - Sheep were vital to Alpine subsistence strategies during the Neolithic as well as the Bronze and Iron Ages. The present study deals with the question of phenotypic alterations in Alpine sheep during these 4500 years of prehistoric Alpine livestock farming. It furthermore addresses the issue of to what extent morphological developments were triggered by processes of economic, cultural or ecological change. To answer these questions, bone measurements of sheep from 59 find complexes in an Alpine model region were examined. The region stretches between the Northern Pre-Alps and the Padanian Plain and comprises the valleys of Inn, Isarco and Adige along with adjacent regions. As shown by the application of logarithmic size index analyses and withers height calculations, the phenotypic development of sheep was characterised by micro-regional differences; for example, while the Inn Valley population underwent a size reduction from the Late Bronze Age onwards, the conspecifics of the southern Alpine fringe grew synchronously larger. For other regions, no diachronic changes were observed. Based on the osteometric analysis, the following factors are discussed as potential triggers for phenotypic alterations in Alpine livestock: climatic fluctuations, a physical adaptation to high altitude pasturing, the emergence of wool farming, the introduction of allochthonous livestock in the context of cultural transfer and shifts in the sex ratios caused by changing exploitation patterns. In order to evaluate the possible influence of these aspects on sheep morphology, the osteometric results are compared to different data on the cultural and climatic development of the Alpine region.

AB  - Coral gardening is a reef restoration technique in which corals are first grown in nurseries and then outplanted onto degraded reefs. However, coral gardening does not yet achieve restoration at ecologically -relevant scales due to associated high costs. Coral nurseries are often manually cleaned to remove biofouling and improve coral performance, although putative benefits of this costly activity remain unconfirmed. We quantified the benefits and costs of various cleaning frequencies to identify the most cost-effective coral nursery approach at a study site with low herbivorous fish biomass. During this one-year study, nurseries were either cleaned weekly, monthly, quarter -yearly or never. Nurseries contained four coral species in three fragment sizes to examine species- and size -specific effects. Coral production (combined coral growth and fraction live coral tissue) and associated costs were quantified. No significant differences in coral production were found across cleaning frequencies and this result was consistent among coral species and fragment sizes. Therefore, no cleaning was clearly identified as the most cost-effective option. Costs could be further reduced by selecting fast-growing corals (e.g. Acropora) and stocking nurseries with large fragments, as these contributed most to coral production. The resulting minimum production cost is then US$0.26 per fragment including dive, wage and material costs for the building, deployment and filling of nurseries and sourcing of corals. For this study location and potentially many others with a similar or higher fish biomass, less frequent cleaning can substantially reduce reef restoration costs without having negative impacts on coral nursery production.

AB  - The intergenic SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) rs80860411A>C was identified as a major QTL for drip loss measured on semimembranosus muscle (SM) in pigs. The SNP is located near the GALNT15. The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between rs80860411A>C and fattening, slaughter, and quality traits of Polish pigs. This study was conducted on 235 individuals belonging to two breeds, Polish Large White (n = 187) and Pulawska (n = 48). The rs80860411 genotypes were determined using the PCR-RFLP method. Association analysis was performed for each breed separately. It was shown that rs80860411A>C had a significant effect on fattening performance traits, on several slaughter performance traits, including width of the loin eye and carcass meat content (p <= 0.01, p <= 0.05), as well as on meat color-redness (a*) (p <= 0,05) in Pulawska breed. The obtained results indicate that the studied SNP has the potential to be a QTN and could be included in pig selection programs, especially in Pulawska pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Campylobacteriosis is recognised as a leading food-borne zoonotic enteric disease of humans, mainly caused by Campylobacter jejuni, and to a minor extent by C. coli. In general, pigs are symptomless carriers primarily of C. coli, but may also harbour C. jejuni. In a swine infection model, weaned piglets were intragastrically inoculated with C. coli (ST-5777; n = 8), with C. jejuni (ST-122; n = 10), or with both strains (n = 8) and 11 piglets served as control. The health status was monitored and the influence on the intestinal barrier was investigated using the Ussing chamber technique and histological examinations. After inoculation, no clinical manifestations were noted. No gross lesions were observed during dissection four weeks post inoculation, and no pathohistological changes were detected in the intestinal mucosal sections. On the other hand, in the caecum of C. jejuni mono-inoculated pigs, we recognized an impact on transepithelial transport processes. We observed an increased Cl- secretion by using the Ussing chamber technique. Campylobacter (C.) is the most common food-borne zoonosis in humans, which mainly manifests with watery to bloody diarrhoea. While C. jejuni is responsible for most cases of infection, C. coli is less frequently encountered. The object of the study was to prove the clinical impact of mono- and co-colonisation of C. coli and C. jejuni on weaned piglets in an infection model and to investigate the impact on transepithelial transport processes in the jejunum and caecum. At an age of eight weeks, eight pigs were infected with C. coli (ST-5777), 10 pigs with C. jejuni (ST-122), eight pigs with both strains, and 11 piglets served as control. During the four-week observation period, no clinical signs were observed. During dissection, both strains could be isolated from the jejunum and the caecum, but no alteration of the tissue could be determined histopathologically. Mono-infection with C. jejuni showed an impact on transepithelial ion transport processes of the caecum. An increase in the short circuit current (I-sc) was observed in the Ussing chamber resulting from carbachol- and forskolin-mediated Cl- secretion. Therefore, we speculate that caecal colonisation of C. jejuni might affect the transport mechanisms of the intestinal mucosa without detectable inflammatory reaction.

AB  - New materials in 85 configurations were tested relative to standard fabric Nzi traps to improve catches of tabanids based on artificial visual cues that mimic those used in nature for locating hosts or water. Colour-fast synthetic fabrics and photo-selective horticultural mesh were tested to facilitate insecticide impregnation and for improved durability. Many plastics were explored to document how flies react to polarized and visible vs. ultraviolet light. Lastly, sticky horizontal, linearly polarizing ground-level shiny plastic targets were tested for capturing water-seeking tabanids relative to traps and vertical fabric targets. Based on the capture of 281 786 female Tabanidae (Tabanus Linnaeus, Hybomitra Enderlein, Chrysops Meigen), four alternative formats provided higher catches and/or durability. They were substituting: (1) phthalogen turquoise for phthalogen blue, (2) solution-dyed fabrics for blue and black cotton, (3) clear/white horticultural mesh for mosquito netting, and (4) clear, reflective plastic for some or all netting. A Sunbrella/BioNet fabric trap (portable) and a blue-black Plexiglas (R)/netting trap (fixed applications) consistently performed best (1.5-3 x higher catches). Ground-level targets captured many male and gravid female Hybomitra but were ineffective for Tabanus. Traps and vertical fabric or transparent sticky targets captured mainly unfed females.

AB  - Simple Summary In this research, we studied the effects of feeding frequency (three meals per day vs. free access to feed) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, carcass quality, and lipid metabolism in growing-finishing pigs. The results showed that reducing feeding frequency can effectively improve the feed conversion ratio. The three meals per day group had a different growth performance in terms of reduced fat deposition and changed carcass composition. This study provides a new scheme for the feeding and management of growing-finishing pigs. An experiment was conducted to examine the effect of meal frequency on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, carcass quality, and lipid metabolism in growing-finishing pigs. Sixty-four Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire barrows and gilts (26.40 +/- 2.10 kg initial body weight) were used in a 112-d experiment in a randomized complete blocked design. The two treatments were the free-access feed group (FA) and the three meals per day group (M3), respectively. The result showed that the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and F: G of the FA group were significantly higher than that in the M3 group during the whole experiment (p < 0.05). Reducing meal frequency also decreased the concentration of triglycerides and urea nitrogen but increased the concentration of insulin and free fatty acids in the blood (p < 0.05). Reducing meal frequency decreased compositions of backfat, belly, and fatty pieces but increased compositions of ham, longissimus muscle, and lean pieces in the carcass (p < 0.05). Greater enzyme activities of ME and FAS and higher mRNA expression of FAS and PPAR gamma were found in the LM of FA pigs compared with M3 pigs (p < 0.05). In summary, a lower meal frequency improves feed efficiency by regulating lipid metabolism and reducing fat deposition.

AB  - PurposeEnterocytozoon bieneusi (E. bieneusi) is a microsporidium that causes intestinal disease in animals and humans, and transmits person to person and/or animals to people. A survey was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity E. bieneusi infection in cattle in Hebei Province, China.MethodsA total of 2,746 cattle fecal samples were collected from 11 cities in Hebei Province. PCR amplification targeting the ITS gene of E. bieneusi was performed to detect infections. The subtypes, sequence signatures, pairwise genetic distances, and genetic diversity indices were analyzed using MEGA, PhyloSuite, and PopART.ResultsThe overall prevalence of E. bieneusi in cattle was 4.70% (129/2746). The infection rate varied significantly by region, age, breeding mode, and cattle type: higher in southern Hebei, cattle under one year old, intensively raised cattle, and dairy cattle. Six genotypes were identified (CHG3, SX1, BEB4, BEB6, BEB8, and J), with BEB6 being the dominant genotype. Sequence analysis revealed 260 polymorphic and conserved sites, including 41 variable sites (15.77% of total nucleotides). The nucleotide diversity index (Pi) was 0.06472, and the haplotype diversity index (Hd) was 1.000.ConclusionThis study provides the first comprehensive epidemiological data on E. bieneusi infection in cattle in Hebei Province and highlights its rich genetic diversity. These findings offer insights into the potential risk of zoonotic transmission and serve as a reference for further control and prevention strategies.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is listed as one of the main heavy metal pollutants, which poses potential health risks to humans. Excessive intake of Cu has shown toxic effects on the organs of many animals, and the liver is one of the most important organs to metabolize it. In this study, pigs, the mammal with similar metabolic characteristics to humans, were selected to assess the effects of long-term exposure to Cu on mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, which are of great significance for studying the toxicity of Cu to humans. Pigs were fed a diet with different contents of Cu (10, 125, and 250 mg/kg) for 80 days. Samples of blood and liver tissue were collected on days 40 and 80. Experimental results demonstrated that the accumulation of Cu in the liver was increased in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the curve of pig's body weight showed that a 125 mg/kg Cu diet promoted the growth of pigs during the first 40 days and then inhibited it from 40 to 80 days, while the 250 mg/kg Cu diet inhibited the growth of pigs during 80 days of feeding. Additionally, the genes and protein expression levels of Caspase-3, p53, Bax, Bak1, Bid, Bad, CytC, and Drpl in the treatment group were higher than that in the control group, while Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Opa1, Mfn1, and Mfn2 were decreased. In conclusion, these results indicated that long-term excessive intake of Cu could inhibit the growth of pigs and induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by breaking the mitochondrial dynamic balance.

AB  - Respiratory tract infections in sheep are among the important health problems that affect all sheep ages around the world. Nine bacterial isolates obtained from sheep with respiratory tract infections were selected to be used in the current study. The isolates included 3 Staphylococcus aureus, 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Following the primers design by the Primer3Plus software tool and optimization of the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the primers were validated for their use in the multiplex PCR experiments. The MFEprimer program was used to check the suitability of the primer set combinations for multiplex PCR. The MFEprimer software was successful in designing the multiplex-PCR experiments and determining the optimal primer set combinations. Multiplex PCR was able to amplify specific DNA sequences of one, two or three target genes of these mixed microorganisms in the same PCR reaction tube. This technique efficiently detected combinations of two organisms, either S. aureus with K. pneumoniae, S. aureus with P. aeruginosa or K. pneumoniae with P. aeruginosa. Moreover, multiplex PCR was also able to detect the presence of the three organisms together in the same reaction tube. To conclude, this study confirmed multiplex-PCR as a specific, sensitive, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective molecular diagnostic method for identification and differentiation of three clinically important bacteria associated with sheep respiratory tract infections, including S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. This can efficiently support control and treatment of such diseases and would increase the economy of the animals' owners and wellbeing of the animals.

AB  - Salt and alkali stress are considered major abiotic stresses in agriculture. Tea plant (Camellia sinensis), an acidophilic economic crop, is seriously affected by salt and alkali stress, which severely restricts its widespread planting. However, the mechanisms underlying the response of tea plants to salt and alkali stress remain unclear. To understand the physiological and molecular responses of tea plants to salt and alkali stress, tea plants were treated with NaCl and NaHCO(3 )to study the effects of salt and alkali stresses, respectively. Tea plants exhibited different symptoms under the NaCl and NaHCO3 treatments. The leaves of tea plants suffered varying degrees of damage, and concentrations of the quality components epigallocatechin gallate, caffeine, and theanine in the leaves decreased significantly under the NaCl treatment. However, after NaHCO3 treatment, epigallocatechin and theanine levels were significantly reduced. Photosynthesis and antioxidant enzymes changed significantly to varying degrees under both the NaCl and NaHCO3 treatments. The stomata closed under both NaCl and NaHCO3 treatments. After the transcriptome analysis of tea samples treated for one, three, and 7 days with NaCl or NaHCO3, a large number of differentially expressed genes related to photosynthesis and the antioxidant system were identified. Analysis of the promoters of key differentially expressed genes revealed many light-responsive, hormone-responsive, and stress-responsive elements, and many corresponding upstream transcription factors were also differentially expressed. These results provide a basis for understanding the physiological and molecular responses of tea plants to salt and alkali stress.

AB  - Waste control is a big challenge in industries. The aim of this study is to control degradation of farm structure using rice husk as corrosion inhibitor in pig dung, poultry dung and urea solution environment. The rice straw was subjected to phytochemical analysis. The four variables: rice straw, Pig dung, urea and poultry dung solutions were used to determine the best approach to reduce the corrosion rate of galvanized steel used for farm structures. Time variation used was 3-12 days. The result from the phytochemical analysis showed that rice husk has constituents of a good inhibitor. The result from the variables' mix in S1: A: 40 cm(3); B: 40 cm(3); C: 10 cm(3) and D: 10 cm(3) has the highest in-hibition efficiency of 88.59%. The SEM result from the best combination showed that passive film was formed which was attributed to the adsorption via rice straw extract. The rice straw used in this study was an effective inhibitor. It is an agricultural waste that was converted into a viable process which is of economic value.

These genes have also been found to regulate economic traits (e.g., morphometric traits) in animals. In this study, the researchers analyzed insertion-deletion (InDel) variations in the FTO and PLIN1 genes and their association with morphometric traits in three sheep breeds (Hu sheep, Dupor sheep, and Small Tail Han sheep). A total of six InDels (FTO-2, FTO-3, FTO-4, FTO-5, FTO-6, and PLIN1) were identified in the FTO and PLIN1 genes in the three breeds of sheep. Genetic variations of these InDels were evaluated on the basis of their polymorphism information content (PIC). The FTO-6 and PLIN1 genes showed low levels of polymorphism (0 < PIC < 0.25), while the other four InDels were moderately polymorphic (0.25 < PIC < 0.50) in the three breeds of sheep. The results of the association analysis revealed that four InDels from the FTO and PLIN1 genes were significantly associated with the morphometric traits in the three sheep breeds, such as body weight, body height, chest width, chest depth, cannon circumference, head length, coccyx length, forehead width, and back height. Based on these findings, the FTO and PLIN1 genes can serve as genetic markers to select sheep with desirable morphometric traits. This study aimed to identify InDels from the FTO and PLIN1 genes and to analyze their association with morphometric traits in Hu sheep (HS), Dupor sheep (DS), and Small Tail Han sheep (STHS). The FTO and PLIN1 genes were genotyped using the insertion/deletion (InDel) method. A one-way ANOVA with SPSS 26.0 software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to assess the effect of the InDel FTO and PLIN1 genes on morphometric traits. The results revealed significant associations between certain InDels and the morphometric traits in different breeds of sheep. Specifically, FTO-2 was significantly associated with cannon circumference (CaC) in HS rams and body height (BoH) in HS ewes (p < 0.05). FTO-2 was also significantly associated with chest width (ChW), CaC, head length (HeL), and coccyx length (CoL) in the STHS breed (p < 0.05). FTO-3 showed significant associations with BoH in HS rams and BoH, back height (BaH), ChW, and chest depth (ChD) in HS ewes (p < 0.05). FTO-3 was also significantly associated with ChW in the DS and STHS breeds (p < 0.05). FTO-5 was significantly associated with body weight (BoW) in the DS breed and BoH in the STHS breed (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PLIN1 was significantly related to BoW in the DS breed and was significantly associated with CoL and forehead width (FoW) in the STHS breed (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the study suggested that InDels in the FTO and PLIN1 genes could provide practical information to improve morphometric traits in sheep breeding.

AB  - Vitamins and amino acids are important trace nutrients that are essential for body growth and reproductive soundness, whereas the lack of these nutrients is directly related to reproductive performance. Hence, the antioxidants agents (L-cysteine and vitamin E) were added into semen diluent and assessed the freeze thawed semen quality parameters. The ejaculates were collected from two crossbred groups (Sahiwal x Holstein-Friesian), and (Achai x Jersey) and, split into seven aliquots while extended with three different concentration (5, 7.5 and10 mmol) of L-cysteine diluents and followed by other three concentrations (1.2, 2.4 and 4.8 mmol) of vitamin E diluents and, the last aliquot of semen was extended with control (no additives) to semen diluent. The spermatozoa freeze-thawed quality were assessed and found that total motility, progressive motility, membrane functionality, acrosomal integrity, and viability percentage were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the diluent groups treated with 7.5 mmol of L-cysteine or 4.8 mmol of vitamin E. Correspondingly the DNA integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential percentage were found significantly higher (P < 0.05) in diluent groups treated with 7.5 mmol L-cysteine or 4.8 mmol vitamin E. The juvenile results indicated that L-cysteine and vitamin E improves the freeze-thawed spermatozoa characteristics in crossbred bulls.

AB  - The Javan rhino is a critically endangered species that has become extinct in several Asian countries, including Thailand. There are three Javan rhino subspecies: Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus, R. s. annamiticus, and R. s. inermis, and the first two subspecies existed in Thailand decades ago. However, no genetic study on Thai rhinos has been reported. In this study, we amplified a partial D-loop region of two ancient rhino specimens dated to approximately 100 years before present, from southwest Thailand. Then, we constructed phylogenetic trees and a haplotype network based on the D-loop sequences of the Thai rhinos and 39 Javan, Sumatran, and Indian rhinos from the GenBank database. The ancient Thai rhino DNA belonged to Javan rhinos and was clearly separated from R. s. annamiticus and R. s. sondaicus. The nucleotide differences among the ancient Thai, R. s. annamiticus, and R. s. sondaicus rhino DNA were 5.14-8.30%, similar to those between two white rhino subspecies. Moreover, species delimitation analyses confirmed that the ancient Thai rhinos should belong to another Javan rhino subspecies, possibly the extinct Indian Javan rhino. This is the first report of rhino DNA from Thailand and possibly the Indian Javan rhino DNA, which could be used for evolutionary studies.

AB  - This study examined the effects of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) supplementation in maturation medium on in vitro maturation (IVM) rate, oxidative biomarkers and gene expression in buffalo oocytes. Ovaries from a slaughterhouse were aspirated and good quality cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) with at least four layers of compact cumulus cells and evenly granulated dark ooplasm were selected. COCs were randomly allocated during IVM (22 h) to one of four treatment groups: (1) control maturation medium (basic medium), or basic medium supplemented with (2) ZnCl2 (1.5 mu g/ml), (3) Na2SeO3 (5 mu g/l), or (4) ZnCl2 thorn Na2SeO3 (1.5 mu g/ml thorn 5 mu g/l, respectively). Oocytes were denuded after 22 h of IVM in the first four replicates. Specimens were fixed and stained to evaluate the stage of nuclear maturation. The spent medium was collected for biochemical assays of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide concentrations. A second four replicates were used for COCs forRNA extraction. The expression levels of antioxidant (SOD1, GPX4, CAT and PRDX1), antiapoptotic (BCL2 and BCL-XL) and proapoptotic (BAX and BID) genes were measured. Supplementation with ZnCl2 and Na2SeO3 during IVM increased the ratio of oocytes reaching metaphase II at 22 h, increased TAC and decreased MDA and H2O2 concentrations in the maturation medium (P < 0.05). Moreover, beneficial effects were associated with complementary changes in expression patterns of antioxidative, antiapoptotic and proapoptotic genes, suggesting lower oxidative stress and apoptosis. Supplementation medium with zinc chloride and sodium selenite improves the maturation rate, reduces oxidative stress and increases expression levels of antioxidative and antiapoptotic genes.

AB  - Post-traumatic spinal cord remodeling includes both degenerating and regenerating processes, which affect the potency of the functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Gene therapy for spinal cord injury is proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy to induce positive changes in remodeling of the affected neural tissue. In our previous studies for delivering the therapeutic genes at the site of spinal cord injury, we developed a new approach using an autologous leucoconcentrate transduced ex vivo with chimeric adenoviruses (Ad5/35) carrying recombinant cDNA. In the present study, the efficacy of the intravenous infusion of an autologous genetically-enriched leucoconcentrate simultaneously producing recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was evaluated with regard to the molecular and cellular changes in remodeling of the spinal cord tissue at the site of damage in a model of mini-pigs with moderate spinal cord injury. Experimental animals were randomly divided into two groups of 4 pigs each: the therapeutic (infused with the leucoconcentrate simultaneously transduced with a combination of the three chimeric adenoviral vectors Ad5/35-VEGF165, Ad5/35-GDNF, and Ad5/35-NCAM1) and control groups (infused with intact leucoconcentrate). The morphometric and immunofluorescence analysis of the spinal cord regeneration in the rostral and caudal segments according to the epicenter of the injury in the treated animals compared to the control mini-pigs showed: (1) higher sparing of the grey matter and increased survivability of the spinal cord cells (lower number of Caspase-3-positive cells and decreased expression of Hsp27); (2) recovery of synaptophysin expression; (3) prevention of astrogliosis (lower area of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1-positive microglial cells); (4) higher growth rates of regenerating beta III-tubulin-positive axons accompanied by a higher number of oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2-positive oligodendroglial cells in the lateral corticospinal tract region. These results revealed the efficacy of intravenous infusion of the autologous genetically-enriched leucoconcentrate producing recombinant VEGF, GDNF, and NCAM in the acute phase of spinal cord injury on the positive changes in the post-traumatic remodeling nervous tissue at the site of direct injury. Our data provide a solid platform for a new ex vivo gene therapy for spinal cord injury and will facilitate further translation of regenerative therapies in clinical neurology.

AB  - Simple Summary This study is to investigate the potential vectors of African horse sickness (AHS). Culicoides were collected near horse stables in Hua Hin district, Prachuab Khiri Khan province, Thailand, where horses were affected and died from AHS in 2020. Twelve Culicoides species were identified. The predominant Culicoides species in all farms was C. oxystoma followed by C. imicola. The Culicoides collected in this study fed on blood from horses, dogs, pigs, and humans for their blood meal. This study has identified the potential AHS vector Culicoides species and its zoonotic potential in this area for the first time. African horse sickness (AHS) was reported as an outbreak in Thailand in 2020. Hematophagous insects from the genus Culicoides are the suspected vector responsible for AHS transmission. Horses in Hua Hin district, Prachuab Khiri Khan province, Thailand, were affected and died from AHS in 2020. However, the potential Culicoides species and its host preference blood meal in the affected areas are unknown. To investigate the potential vectors of AHS, Culicoides were collected using ultraviolet light traps placed near horse stables. Six horse farms, including five farms with AHS history and one farm without AHS history, were included in this study. Morphological and molecular identification of the Culicoides species was performed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cytochrome b oxidase I (COXI) gene for confirmation of the Culicoides species, identification of the prepronociceptin (PNOC) gene for host preference blood meal, and bidirectional sequencing were conducted. Consequently, 1008 female Culicoides were collected, consisting of 708 and 300 samples captured at positions A and B at a distance of 5 m from the horse, respectively. Twelve Culicoides species identified by morphology were noted, including C. oxystoma (71.92%), C. imicola (20.44%), C. actoni (2.28%), C. flavipunctatus (1.98%), C. asiana (0.99%), C. peregrinus (0.60%), C. huffi (0.60%), C. brevitarsis (0.40%), C. innoxius (0.30%), C. histrio (0.30%), C. minimus (0.10%), and C. geminus (0.10%). The PCR detection of the Culicoides COXI gene confirmed Culicoides species in 23 DNA samples. PCR targeting the PNOC gene revealed that the Culicoides collected in this study fed on Equus caballus (86.25%), Canis lupus familiaris (6.25%), Sus scrofa (3.75%), and Homo sapiens (3.75%) for their blood meal. Human blood was identified from two samples of C. oxystoma and a sample of C. imicola. Three dominant species including C. oxystoma, C. imicola, and C. actoni that were reported in the Hua Hin area prefer to feed on horse blood. Moreover, C. oxystoma, C. imicola, and C. bravatarsis also feed on canine blood. This study revealed the species of Culicoides in Hua Hin district, Thailand, after the AHS outbreak.

AB  - Hydrostatic skeletons, such as an elephant trunk or a squid tentacle, permit the transmission of mechanical work through a soft body. Despite the ubiquity of these structures among animals, we generally do not understand how differences in their morphology affect their ability to transmit muscular work. Therefore, the present study used mathematical modeling, morphometrics, and kinematics to understand the transmission of force and displacement in the tube feet of the juvenile six-rayed star (Leptasterias sp.). An inversedynamic analysis revealed that the forces generated by the feet during crawling primarily serve to overcome the submerged weight of the body. These forces were disproportionately generated by the feet at more proximal positions along each ray, which were used more frequently for crawling. Owing to a combination of mechanical advantage and muscle mass, these proximal feet exhibited a greater capacity for force generation than the distal feet. However, the higher displacement advantage of the more elongated distal feet offer a superior ability to extend the feet into the environment. Therefore, the morphology of tube feet demonstrates a gradient in gearing along each ray that compliments their role in behavior.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the effects of adding alpha lipoic acid (ALA) to the in vitro ovarian tissue culture medium, either fresh or after vitrification/warming. For this purpose, 10 ovaries from five adult sheep were used. Each pair of ovaries gave rise to 16 fragments and were randomly distributed into two groups: fresh (n = 8) and vitrified (n = 8). Two fresh fragments were fixed immediately and considered the control, while another six were cultured in vitro for 14 days in the absence; presence of a constant (100 mu M/0-14 day) or dynamic (50 mu M/day 0-7 and 100 mu M/day 8-14) concentration of ALA. As for the vitrified fragments, two were fixed and the other six were cultured in vitro under the same conditions described for the fresh group. All the fragments were subjected to morphological evaluation, follicular development and stromal density (classical histology), DNA fragmentation (TUNEL), senescence (Sudan Black), fibrosis (Masson's Trichome), and endoplasmic reticulum stress (immunofluorescence). Measurements of the antioxidant capacity against the free radicals 2,2 '-azino-bis (3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) and estradiol (E2) levels in the culture medium was performed. The results showed that in the absence of ALA, in vitro culture of vitrified ovarian fragments showed a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in follicular morphology and increased the presence of senescence and tissue fibrosis (P < 0.05). Dynamic ALA maintained E2 levels unchanged (P > 0.05) until the end of vitrified ovarian tissue culture and controlled the levels of ABTS and DPPH radicals in fresh or vitrified cultures. Therefore, it is concluded that ALA should be added to the vitrified ovarian tissue in vitro culture medium to reduce the damage that leads to loss of ovarian function. To ensure steroidogenesis during in vitro culture, ALA should be added dynamically (different concentrations throughout culture).

AB  - From the point of view of farming utilization, investigations on the recognition of the mineral composition of sedges appears important, appropriate and useful. Sedges are often found in many meadow and pasture communities. It is therefore worth paying attention to the mineral content of their tissues and their possible impact on the organisms of farm animals such as pigs. The basic objective of this study was to determine the concentration of selected macro and microelements: phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), silicon (Si), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), chrome (Cr) and nickel (Ni) in the biomass of seven sedge species, potentially used as fodder, commonly occurring in natural sites in Central Europe. The material was collected twice during one growing season in the Krze & sacute;niczka (N 52 degrees 37 ' 14 ' E 14 degrees 46 ' 06 ')-lubuskie voivodeship. The first harvest was carried out at the beginning of May, during the shooting and earring phase. The collected plant material included stems and leaves. The second harvest-the end of June-was collected at a time when the seedlings were developing flowers and young fruits, and their vegetative organs were developing dynamically. In June, the collected material represented organs in all possible development phases. The collected material was dried at a temperature of 65 degrees C, ground, and analyzed. The obtained results showed a difference in the content of microelements between the May and June harvest dates in the dry matter of all analyzed sedge species, which differed statistically significantly only in relation to copper. The harvest date had a statistically significant impact on the change in the content of macroelements in the dry matter of all analyzed sedge species and was associated with a decrease in the content of phosphorus, magnesium and calcium, while in the case of silicon, the delay in mowing resulted in an increase in the content of this element.

AB  - The hippocampus can be divided into distinct segments that make unique contributions to learning and memory. The dorsal segment supports cognitive processes like spatial learning and navigation while the ventral hippocampus regulates emotional behaviors related to fear, anxiety and reward. In the current study, we determined how pyramidal cells in ventral CA1 respond to spatial cues and aversive stimulation during a context fear conditioning task. We also examined the effects of high and low frequency stimulation of these neurons on defensive behavior. Similar to previous work in the dorsal hippocampus, we found that cells in ventral CA1 expressed high-levels of c-Fos in response to a novel spatial environment. Surprisingly, however, the number of activated neurons did not increase when the environment was paired with footshock. This was true even in the subpopulation of ventral CA1 pyramidal cells that send direct projections to the amygdala. When these cells were stimulated at high-frequencies (20 Hz) we observed feedforward inhibition of basal amygdala neurons and impaired expression of context fear. In contrast, low-frequency stimulation (4 Hz) did not inhibit principal cells in the basal amygdala and produced an increase in fear generalization. Similar results have been reported in dorsal CA1. Therefore, despite clear differences between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, CA1 neurons in each segment appear to make similar contributions to context fear conditioning.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: This study aimed at determining the effects of saffron on depression as well as its neuroprotective and pharmacological effects on the intestinal function of crocetin in mice exposed to chronic restraint stress.
   Materials and methods: Chronic stress was induced in two-week-old ICR mice by immobilizing them for 6 h per day for 28 days. The mice were orally administered with crocetin (20, 40, 80 mg/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) or distilled water. The treatments were administered daily and open field and tail suspension tests were performed. Immunofluorescent and Western-bolt (WB) assays were conducted to determine the expression of mitogenactivated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), the precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein in the hippocampus. Serum levels of dopamine (DA), proBDNF, MKP-1 and CREB were measured by Elisa kits. High-throughput sequencing was carried out to analyze the composition of intestinal microbiota.
   Results: Crocetin ameliorated depressive-like behaviors caused by chronic restraint stress-induced depressive mice. It significantly attenuated the elevated levels of MKP-1, proBDNF, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and increased the serum levels of DA as well as CREB. Histopathological analysis showed that crocetin suppressed hippocampus injury in restraint stress mice by protecting neuronal cells. Immunofluorescent and WB analysis showed elevated expression levels of ERK1/2, CREB and inhibited expression levels of MKP-1, proBDNF in the hippocampus. The intestinal ecosystem of the crocetin group partially recovered and was close to the control group.
   Conclusions: Crocetin has neuroprotective properties and ameliorates the effects of stress-associated brain damage by regulating the MKP-1-ERK1/2-CREB signaling and intestinal ecosystem.

AB  - One of the challenges usually needs to be addressed in animal embryo production is to create the appropriate in vitro culture to improve blastocyst rate and produce high quality embryos. The present work was undertaken to investigate the impact of uterine epithelial cells and its conditioned medium (CM) on in vitro embryo production in buffalo. Buffalo uterine epithelial cells (UECs) were successfully isolated, cultured and characterized from slaughterhouse derived non gravid uteri. The well-characterized first passage UECs monolayer was exposed to steroid hormones (progesterone 3.14 ng/ml and estradiol-17 beta 5 pg/ml) supplemented fresh culture media and after 72 h conditioned media (CM) was harvested. Morula stage embryos were cultured in steroid supplemented modified synthetic oviductal fluid (mSOF-control), co-cultured with steroid treated UECs (T1) and CM of steroid treated UECs (T2). The attachment of single or clumps of variable sizes of UECs was observed after 24-48 h culture. The UE culture attained confluence with the formation of a tight, compact monolayer having the typical cuboidal shape in 7-8 days The UECs showed positive for cytokeratin and negative for vimentin expression on immunocytochemistry (ICC) and PCR assay. Blastocyst and hatching rate were evaluated on day 09 post IVF. Blastocyst rate in the T1 group was significantly higher (p < 0.05) followed by T2 than the control group. The hatching rate in both T1 and T2 groups were significantly higher (p < 0.05) as compared to control and no significant difference was observed between T1 and T2. Thus, it can be concluded that in vitro co-culture of embryos with steroid treated UECs and their CM improved the blastocyst rate as well as hatching rate. UECs and its secretions are essential to establish uterine receptivity and to mimic the internal in vivo environment. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Aims Understanding the molecular basis of rapid species radiation remains challenging in evolutionary biology. In angiosperms, Brassicaceae exemplifies rapid radiation following the At-alpha whole-genome duplication (At-alpha WGD) event similar to 35 million years ago (Mya). However, the molecular features associated with the early Brassicaceae radiation have not been fully elucidated, particularly due to lack of high-quality genomes from the super-tribe Hesperodae (clade E).Methods Utilizing recently released genomes from Arabodae (clade D) and Hesperodae (clade E), along with 36 additional Brassicaceae species representing all super-tribes of Brassicoideae and Aethionemoideae, we performed phylogenomic analyses to identify patterns of gene family expansion and contraction at key nodes during early radiation. We further investigated genomic synteny and gene expression, with a particular focus on the dynamic expansion of the FLOWERING LOCUS C/MADS-AFFECTING FLOWERING (FLC/MAF) gene family in response to artificial temperature fluctuations.Key Results Dating back to the Oligocene-Miocene transition and following the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Brassicaceae underwent significant radiation with similar to 540 expanded gene families, in which 66 genes were involved in flowering time regulation. FLC was first duplicated via the At-alpha WGD into MAF2/3, which is present in Brassicaceae. Subsequent tandem duplications gave rise to MAF4/5 in core Brassicaceae. Additional random duplications led to FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM or MAF1) in certain species of the Camelinodae (clade A). These duplicated MAFs exhibit significant diversified expression patterns under turbulent temperature conditions.Conclusions Our analyses reveal a dynamic, Brassicaceae-specific retention and expansion of FLC/MAFs along with other flowering time regulators during species radiation and historical environmental adaptation, highlighting the role of flowering diversity in Brassicaceae radiation. This work thus provides a valuable model for studying species evolution and diversification in other angiosperm families.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) affects female cancer survivors, with impairment recognised in populations such as breast cancer survivors, where 1 in 3 are affected. Impairments include issues with memory, learning, concentration, and processing speed, negatively impacting quality of life. Several mechanisms are proposed to drive these, with evidence implicating neuroinflammation as a key contributor. However, the time course over which impairments occur is less well-established, with fewer longer-term time-points investigated. This study aimed to understand the evolution of cognitive changes following methotrexate (MTX) or 5fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy, assessing three time-points: acute (96-hour), sub-acute (31-days) and chronic (93-days). Further, we investigated whether alterations in cognition were associated with concomitant changes in astrocytic reactivity. Female Sprague Dawley rats received two intraperitoneal injections of MTX, 5-FU or saline and were assessed on the novel object recognition, 5-choice serial reaction time task and Barnes maze. Hippocampal and prefrontal cortex tissue was examined for GFAP expression. Both MTX and 5-FU exposure were associated with spatial memory, task acquisition, and processing speed impairments at 31-days, with impairment ameliorated by 93-days. While both MTX and 5-FU induced changes in GFAP expression across various timepoints and regions, with most notable changes at 96-hours, 5-FU exhibited expression changes in the hippocampus consistently across all time-points. These results provide valuable insight into the complexity of a mediator of neuroinflammation in CICI. While neuroinflammation may be a promising therapeutic target, further markers should be assessed to elucidate the full neuroimmune response, and thus which aspects to target and when, to ensure optimal outcomes for cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.

AB  - Demographic Information on threatened species is important to plan conservation actions. Due to their aquatic lifestyle, the subtle nature of hippo sexual dimorphism, and their occurrence in inaccessible areas, it is difficult to visually determine hippo ages and sexes. Previously, hippo body lengths have been measured from drone images and used to estimate age. However, due to hippos' propensity to be partially submerged, it is often difficult to obtain the required measurements. We used the novel technique of multiple imputation to estimate missing body measurements. Further, we explored if male and female hippos could be differentiated in drone images based on body proportions, also examining body condition indices and how these varied seasonally. Multiple imputation increased the number of hippos that we aged threefold, and the body lengths we obtained fell within the range provided in literature, supporting their validity. We provide one of the first age structure breakdowns of a hippo population not from culled hippos. Accounting for overall size, males had wider necks and snouts than females. Hippo body condition varied seasonally, indicating responses to resources and reproduction. We provide a new technique and demonstrate the utility of drones to determine age and sex structures of hippo populations.

AB  - The study was conducted in the fields of Barakat Aba Al-Fadl Al-Abbas from the Al-Abbas's (p) Holy Shrine and the current work aimed to study the effect of substituting different levels of chemically treated crushed date seeds instead of barley in the concentrated diet of local male Awassi lambs to know its impact on productive and economic performance. Using a completely randomized design, forty-two male Awassi lambs (average body weights 22.6 +/- 0.8 kg) at the age of 4-5 months were used, for the period from 10/8/2022 to 17/10/2022 (63 days). Animals were randomly distributed into seven groups (6 animals/group) in separate cages and experimental treatments were provided. All animals were fed concentrated diets at 3 % of body weight and barley straw was the main source of roughage and was provided as ad libitum. The normal crushed date seeds were replaced by 25.50 % instead of barley and the same proportions for the crushed date seeds were soaked with acetic acid and citric acid in seven treatments. There were significant differences observed in the averages of daily weight gain, feed intake and efficiency of feed conversion. Non-significant differences appeared in the rumen fluid parameters of pH and volatile fatty acids, while the treatments T6 and T7 recorded the lowest significant values in urea nitrogen compared to the highest values in the treatment T1 control. Treatments T6 and T7 were significantly superior in the digestion of nutrients over all treatments. All treatments achieved replacing crushed date seeds by 25 and 50 %, normal and soaked with organic acids, instead of barley, the best economic efficiency compared with the treatment T1 control.

AB  - Selection of tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] cultivars with wide adaptability over diverse environments is an important criteria to get prior information to recommend the cultivar for a particular region. A study was carried out to identify the most adaptable and stable tea genotypes for recommendation in the Up-country tea growing region in Sri Lanka by evaluating several potential tea genotypes for their wide adaptability and stability over diverse environments based on the analysis of GE interaction using within location non-replicated multi-environmental yield trials and GGE biplot methods. Six promising tea genotypes with desirable agronomic traits selected based on preliminary yield trials were evaluated along with a standard check in large scale within location non-replicated multi-locational yield trials at six locations (tea estates) in the Up- country tea growing region in Sri Lanka. The crop yields were recorded by harvesting green leaves in every seven days for three years covering six seasons (1st pruning cycle). Yield data were analyzed by within location non-replicated multi-locational yield trials and GGE biplot analysis. The genotype 272 was identified as the most adaptable and stable genotype followed by 582 and rest of the genotypes showed poor adaptability in the test region.

AB  - A fundamental understanding of animal sensory systems is crucial for comprehending their interactions with the environment and with other conspecifics. However, knowledge gaps persist, particularly in arachnids like the order Solifugae. While certain solifuge setae and palpal papillae have been studied structurally and electrophysiologically, providing evidence of chemoreception and mechanoreception, the sensilla on their walking legs remain unexplored. Notably, elongated sensilla on the femur and tibia of the 4th walking legs resemble trichobothria in other arachnid orders yet their function remains unknown. Thus, this study investigates whether these sensilla serve a mechanosensory function. Using electrophysiological and behavioral assays on Eremobates pallipes (Eremobatidae), we assessed the response of the elongated 4th leg sensilla to- (i) air particle movement and- (ii) air pressure changes. Air particle movement stimuli were generated using a speaker placed in the near field of the elongated sensilla that emitted low-frequency pure tones (10-1000 Hz). Air pressure stimuli involved forceful blowing on the sensilla. No response to air particle movement was observed, but a mechanosensory response to air pressure stimuli was detected. Electrophysiological data identified a fast-adapting and fast-recovering cell, and behavioral observations revealed a startle response. Our electrophysiology results suggest a mechanosensory role of elongated sensilla on the 4th walking legs of solifuge, indicating that although they are not sensitive enough to detect air particle movement stimuli, they can receive and respond to air pressure stimuli. Our behavioral experiments similarly show that these sensilla are not sensitive enough to detect air particle movement but respond to more forceful mechanosensory stimuli.

AB  - When feeding livestock, particular attention should be paid to the production, and preparation of fodder, i.e. the meals, while at the same time determining the nutritional requirements in the various production periods. Selenium is an important microelement in animal nutrition. Together with vitamin E, it contributes to the normal functioning of many physical activities, such as the prevention and repair of oxidative cell damage, contributes to the growth and development of young animals, improves reproductive performance, milk quality, improves rumen fermentation and digestibility, and is involved in the body's immune defense. Selenium deficiency in ruminants also results in poor conversion, white muscle disease, and poor wool production and can lead to infertility in sheep. The most important factors that lead to insufficient levels of selenium in animals are fodder production on acidic basalt/granite soils and sandy soils, annual rainfall over 450 mm, predominantly clover pastures, heavy and long-term application of artificial fertilizers, especially fertilizers of sulfur-fortified with superphosphate or gypsum. Selenium deficiency in animals can also be observed in conditions of heat stress, a return to extensive and organic animal husbandry, nutrition imbalance, the presence of elements that are antagonistic to selenium in the ration, and consumption of poor-quality water. The concentration of selenium in the soil, and plant feed in the blood and tissues of animals is a good link to determine its status. The aim of this review is therefore to summarize in what conditions and due to what factors selenium deficiency occurs in animals, what its consequences are.

AB  - Based on different surveys, dairy farmers are concerned about extensive use of exogenous oxytocin in buffaloes, which is being held responsible for reproductive problems including irregular oestrous cycle and delayed ovulation. For these concerns, effects of oxytocin injection on postpartum follicular dynamics, postpartum oestrous interval (PEI), oestrous length, the interval from onset of ostrus to ovulation and blood progesterone (P4) were studied in Nili-Ravi buffaloes. For this purpose, 23 animals within 1 week after calving were randomly divided into three groups: without oxytocin (CON; n = 7), 10 i.u. oxytocin (LOW; n = 8), 30 i.u. oxytocin - (HIGH; n = 8) and used to record the PEI for the study period of 154 days. At subsequent estrus, three buffaloes from each group (not served) were selected randomly to monitor two cycles for 6 weeks. Transrectal ultrasonography was performed to evaluate follicular and corpus luteum (CL) development, and blood sampling was done for progesterone (P4) analysis. These results revealed that postpartum oestrous interval (PEI) decreased significantly in oxytocin-treated groups. The number of small, medium and total follicles on the left ovary was significantly higher in the HIGH group. However, an overall number of small and total follicles on both right and left ovaries was significantly higher in CON and HIGH groups. On the other hand, there was no difference in the number of follicles on the right ovary among all treatment groups. The same was true for the size of pre-ovulatory follicles, CL, P4 concentrations and oestrous cycle length. The intervals from onset of estrus to ovulation and from standing estrus to ovulation were increased considerably in the HIGH group. It is concluded that exogenous oxytocin administration resulted in the shortening of PEI but triggered a delay in ovulation. Moreover, a higher dose of oxytocin could stimulate the growth of small, medium, and total follicles in postpartum Nili-Ravi buffaloes.

AB  - Extinct South American mammals include several herbivorous lineages, most of whose palaeobiology remains poorly understood. The late Neogene deposits of the Santa Mar & iacute;a Group, northwestern Argentina, have yielded several fossil mammals, including abundant caviomorph rodents and native ungulates. The main goal of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the locomotor diversity and palaeoecology of late Neogene mammal communities from the Santa Mar & iacute;a Group in Northwestern Argentina. We infer their locomotory habits by analysing postcranial osteological indices and combine these results with available information related to dietary habits and other ecological features. The analysis indicates the presence of large-sized grazers or mixed-feeders with heavy columnar-legged, rhino-like taxa (toxodontids); large- to medium-sized high browsers or mixed-feeders with cursorial gaits (macraucheniids and proterotheriids); medium- to small-sized ambulatory and leaping-cursorial rodent-like forms, capable of digging, that consumed abrasive or hard food items (typotheres); and several medium- to small-sized grazers and mixed-feeders with digging, ambulatory, and leaping-cursorial locomotory habits (caviomorph rodents). Ecological segregation and niche partitioning in the studied paleocommunities appear largely aligned with phylogeny and are mostly consistent with phylogenetic niche conservatism patterns.

AB  - Simple Summary The success of semen preservation is vital for the use of artificial reproductive technologies in sheep. However, reduced temperatures can cause significant damage to the sperm cell. Recent investigations in other species have identified room-temperature liquid storage as a viable alternative if spermatozoa are protected from the increased risk of lipid peroxidation, a side effect of unaltered metabolism. The following review aims to summarise the factors which contribute to the survival of ram spermatozoa during liquid storage and the role of pro-survival factors and antioxidants in helping to ameliorate the damaging effects caused by lipid peroxidation on fertility. This would contribute towards establishing a new method of semen preservation for the sheep industry which maximises fertility following storage and artificial insemination. Semen preservation is an essential component of reproductive technologies, as it promotes genetic gain and long-distance semen transport and multiplies the number of ewes able to be inseminated per single ejaculate. However, the reduced temperature during cold storage at 5 or 15 degrees C inflicts sub-lethal damage to spermatozoa, compromising sperm quality and the success of artificial breeding. New and emerging research in various species has reported the advantages of storing spermatozoa at higher temperatures, such as 23 degrees C; however, this topic has not been thoroughly investigated for ram spermatozoa. Despite the success of storing spermatozoa at 23 degrees C, sperm quality can be compromised by the damaging effects of lipid peroxidation, more commonly when metabolism is left unaltered during 23 degrees C storage. Additionally, given the biosafety concern surrounding the international transport of egg-yolk-containing extenders, further investigation is critical to assess the preservation ability of synthetic extenders and whether pro-survival factors could be supplemented to maximise sperm survival during storage at 23 degrees C.

AB  - Adaptive radiations are characterized by the diversification and ecological differentiation of species, and replicated cases of this process provide natural experiments for understanding the repeatability and pace of molecular evolution. During adaptive radiation, genes related to ecological specialization may be subject to recurrent positive directional selection. However, it is not clear to what extent patterns of lineage-specific ecological specialization (including phenotypic convergence) are correlated with shared signatures of molecular evolution. To test this, we sequenced whole exomes from a phylogenetically dispersed sample of 38 murine rodent species, a group characterized by multiple, nested adaptive radiations comprising extensive ecological and phenotypic diversity. We found that genes associated with immunity, reproduction, diet, digestion, and taste have been subject to pervasive positive selection during the diversification of murine rodents. We also found a significant correlation between genome-wide positive selection and dietary specialization, with a higher proportion of positively selected codon sites in derived dietary forms (i.e., carnivores and herbivores) than in ancestral forms (i.e., omnivores). Despite striking convergent evolution of skull morphology and dentition in two distantly related worm-eating specialists, we did not detect more genes with shared signatures of positive or relaxed selection than in a nonconvergent species comparison. Although a small number of the genes we detected can be incidentally linked to craniofacial morphology or diet, protein-coding regions are unlikely to be the primary genetic basis of this complex convergent phenotype. Our results suggest a link between positive selection and derived ecological phenotypes, and highlight specific genes and general functional categories that may have played an integral role in the extensive and rapid diversification of murine rodents.

AB  - Despite years of a national deworming campaign, the incidence of intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) remains relatively high among certain ethnic groups, with lifestyle factors distinct from those of the general population. Despite existing studies on the prevalence of IPIs, there is limited research exploring the contextual associated factors within the Badi Indigenous community. Our objective in this study was to assess the prevalence of IPIs in the indigenous Badi community of Gurbhakot Municipality, Surkhet, Nepal, considering socioeconomic, lifestyle, and behavioral factors. A total of 205 stool samples were obtained from individuals aged 18-70 years through purposive sampling and preserved in a 2.5% potassium dichromate solution. A structured questionnaire was administered to the selected participants. Three diagnostic methods were used: direct wet mount, saturated salt flotation, and formal ether sedimentation. The study revealed an overall parasite prevalence of 27% (n = 55) in the indigenous Badi communities. Protozoan infections were found in 19% (n = 39) of the studied community, whereas helminthic infections were present in only 7.8% (n = 16). The highest prevalence was observed for Giardia lamblia at 16.1% (n = 33), followed by Ascaris lumbricoides at 5.9% (n = 12), Entamoeba histolytica at 2.9% (n = 6), and both Enterobius vermicularis and Hymenolepis nana at 1% (n = 2). The female population had a higher exposure to E. histolytica (5.8%, n = 6) than did the male population (0%, n = 0). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed increased odds of IPIs among participants involved in agriculture [aOR: 5.37, 95% CI: (2.31 to 12.47)], those who kept free-ranging pigs and poultry [aOR: 5.22, 95% CI: (1.87 to 14.53)], those who did not use soap before eating [aOR: 9.96, 95% CI: (2.11 to 46.99)], and those who consumed raw or undercooked meat [aOR: 2.76, 95% CI: (1.08 to 7.05)] compared with others. Therefore, health education, particularly regarding hygiene practices and lifestyle changes, is crucial for reducing the burden of intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) in indigenous Badi communities.

AB  - The technique of cloning has wide applications in animal husbandry and human biomedicine. However, the very low developmental efficiency of cloned embryos limits the application of cloning. Ectopic XIST-expression-induced abnormal X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a primary cause of the low developmental competence of cloned mouse and pig embryos. Knockout or knockdown of XIST improves cloning efficiency in both pigs and mice. The transcription factor Yin yang 1(YY1) plays a critical role in XCI by triggering the transcription of X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) and facilitating the localization of XIST RNA on the X chromosome. This study aimed to investigate whether RNA interference to suppress the expression of YY1 can inhibit erroneous XIST expression, rescue abnormal XCI, and improve the developmental ability of cloned pig embryos. The results showed that YY1 binds to the 5 ' regulatory region of the porcine XIST gene in pig cells. The microinjection of YY1 siRNA into cloned pig embryos reduced the transcript abundance of XIST and upregulated the mRNA level of X-linked genes at the 4-cell and blastocyst stages. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of YY1 altered the transcriptome and enhanced the in vitro and in vivo developmental efficiency of cloned porcine embryos. These results suggested that YY1 participates in regulating XIST expression and XCI in cloned pig embryos and that the suppression of YY1 expression can increase the developmental rate of cloned pig embryos. The present study established a new method for improving the efficiency of pig cloning.

AB  - BackgroundThe dynamics of mammalian follicular development and atresia is an intricate process involving the cell-cell communication mediated by secreted ovarian factors. These interactions are critical for oocyte development and regulation of follicular atresia which in part are mediated by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and kit ligand (KITLG), but their roles in the regulation of apoptosis in buffalo granulosa cells have not yet been defined. During mammalian follicular development, granulosa cell apoptosis triggers the atresia so similar to 1% follicles reach the ovulation stage. In the present study, we used buffalo granulosa cells to examine the effects of KGF and KITLG in apoptosis regulation and investigated potential mechanism on Fas-FasL and Bcl-2 signaling pathways.ResultIsolated buffalo granulosa cells were cultured with KGF and KITLG proteins using different doses (0, 10, 20, and 50 ng/ml) independently or in combination. Expression analysis for both anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and cFLIP) and pro-apoptotic (Bax, Fas, and FasL) genes at transcriptional levels were carried out by real-time PCR. Upon treatments, expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes were significantly upregulated in a dose-dependent manner, showing an upregulation at 50 ng/ml (independently), and at 10 ng/ml in combination. Additionally, upregulation of growth-promoting factors, bFGF, and alpha-Inhibin was also observed.ConclusionsOur findings suggest the potential roles of KGF and KITLG in determining granulosa cell growth and regulating apoptosis.

AB  - Previous studies on horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) have described many coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV (SARSCoVr) in China and only a few coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 (SARSCoV2r) in Yunnan (southern China), Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. Here, we report the results of several field missions carried out in 2017, 2021 and 2022 across Vietnam during which 1218 horseshoe bats were sampled from 19 locations. Sarbecoviruses were detected in 11% of faecal RNA extracts, with much more positives among Rhinolophus thomasi (46%). We assembled 38 Sarbecovirus genomes, including 32 SARSCoVr, four SARSCoV2r, and two recombinants of SARSCoVr and SARSCoV2r (RecSar), one showing a Spike protein very similar to SARS-CoV-2. We detected a bat co-infected with four coronaviruses, including two sarbecoviruses. Our analyses revealed that Sarbecovirus genomes evolve in Vietnam under strong geographical and host constraints. First, we found evidence for a deep separation between viruses from northern Vietnam and those from central and southern Vietnam. Second, we detected only SARSCoVr in Rhinolophus thomasi, both SARSCoVr and SARSCoV2r in Rhinolophus affinis, and only RecSar in Rhinolophus pusillus captured close to the border with China. Third, the bias in favour of Uracil in synonymous third codon positions of SARSCoVr extracted from R. thomasi showed a negative correlation with latitudes. Our results also provided support for an emergence of SARS-CoV in horseshoe bats from northern Yunnan and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in horseshoe bats from northern Indochina subtropical forests (southern Yunnan, northern Laos and north-western Vietnam).

AB  - Inbreeding depression is a central parameter underlying mating system variation in nature and one that can be altered by environmental stress. Although a variety of systems show that inbreeding depression tends to increase under stressful conditions, we have very little understanding across most organisms how the level of inbreeding depression may change as a result of adaptation to stressors. In this work we examined the potential that inbreeding depression varied among lineages of Ipomoea purpurea artificially evolved to exhibit divergent levels of herbicide resistance. We examined inbreeding depression in a variety of fitness-related traits in both the growth chamber and in the field, and paired this work with an examination of gene expression changes. We found that, while inbreeding depression was present across many of the traits, lineages artificially selected for increased herbicide resistance often showed no evidence of inbreeding depression in the presence of herbicide, and in fact, showed evidence of outbreeding depression in some traits compared to nonselected control lines and lineages selected for increased herbicide susceptibility. Further, at the transcriptome level, the resistant selection lines had differing patterns of gene expression according to breeding type (inbred vs. outcrossed) compared to the control and susceptible selection lines. Our data together indicate that inbreeding depression may be lessened in populations that are adapting to regimes of strong selection.

AB  - Simple Summary Consumers are increasingly turning to healthier and less environmentally harmful diet alternatives. Game is an ideal food from this point of view because it represents meat with a high protein content, low fat content, a favourable composition of fatty acids and minerals. Various types of packaging are often used to extend the shelf life of meats. Packaging can be combined with natural antimicrobials, such as various plant extracts and essential oils, for better effectiveness. Little is known about the microbial quality and preservation of deer meat. In the present study, deer meat was treated with essential oil from Litsea cubeba 0.5 and 1.0% concentration in rapeseed oil combined with aerobic and vacuum packaging. The meat was evaluated for microbiological quality (counts and microbiota identification) for 20 days under refrigerated storage. Our result show that Litsea cubeba essential oil is an effective natural agent against deer meat spoilage bacteria. The present study aimed to evaluate deer meat microbiological quality when treated with essential oil (EO) from Litsea cubeba (dissolved in rapeseed oil at concentrations 0.5 and 1%), in combination with vacuum packaging during 20 days of storage of meat at 4 degrees C. Total viable counts (TVC), coliforms bacteria (CB), lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Pseudomonas spp. were analysed at day 0, 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20. MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper technology was applied to identify microorganisms isolated from meat. The highest number of TVC at the end of the experiment was 5.50 log CFU/g in the aerobically packaged control group and the lowest number of TVC was 5.17 log CFU/g in the samples treated with 1.0% Litsea cubeba EO. CB were not detected in the samples treated with 1.0% Litsea cubeba EO during the entire storage period. Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas were detected only in the aerobically and vacuum packaged control group. The highest number of LAB was 2.06 log CFU/g in the aerobic control group, and the lowest number of LAB was 2.01 log CFU/g in the samples treated with 1.0% Litsea cubeba EO on day 20. The most frequently isolated bacteria from deer meat were Pseudomonas ludensis, Pseudomonas corrugata, Pseudomonas fragi, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Sphingomonas leidyi.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an Echinococcosis model with logistic growth. After giving the basic reproductive number R-0, we prove that R-0 can be used to govern the threshold dynamics of the model: if R-0 < 1, the disease will go to extinction, while if R-0 > 1, the disease will persist. Based on the data of Echinococcosis in & Uuml;r & uuml;mqi, Xinjiang, China during 2006-2016, we estimate the parameters in the model and calculate that R-0 = 1.42 (95% CI [0.767, 4.327]). The results show that Echinococcosis is endemic in & Uuml;r & uuml;mqi, China. In addition, we obtain that MAPE = 3.54% and RMSPE = 3.87%, which indicates that the model has certain reliability and rationality. Furthermore, we carry out the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters to identify the key factors affecting the prevalence of Echinococcosis, and the effective control efforts are suggested focusing on reducing the proportion rate from sheep to dogs and increasing the recovery rate of dogs to curb the prevalence of Echinococcosis in & Uuml;r & uuml;mqi, China.

AB  - A significant gap in exposure data for most livestock and zoonotic pathogens is common for several Latin America deer species. This study examined the seroprevalence against 13 pathogens in 164 wild and captive southern pudu from Chile between 2011 and 2023. Livestock and zoonotic pathogen antibodies were detected in 22 of 109 wild pudus (20.18%; 95% CI: 13.34-29.18) and 17 of 55 captive pudus (30.91%; 95% CI: 19.52-44.96), including five Leptospira interrogans serovars (15.38% and 10.71%), Toxoplasma gondii (8.57% and 37.50%), Chlamydia abortus (3.03% and 12.82%), Neospora caninum (0.00% and 9.52%), and Pestivirus (8.00% and 6.67%). Risk factors were detected for Leptospira spp., showing that fawn pudu have statistically significantly higher risk of positivity than adults. In the case of T. gondii, pudu living in "free-range" have a lower risk of being positive for this parasite. In under-human-care pudu, a Pestivirus outbreak is the most strongly suspected as the cause of abortions in a zoo in the past. This study presents the first evidence of Chlamydia abortus in wildlife in South America and exposure to T. gondii, L. interrogans, and N. caninum in wild ungulate species in Chile. High seroprevalence of livestock pathogens such as Pestivirus and Leptospira Hardjo in wild animals suggests a livestock transmission in Chilean template forest.

AB  - Reproductive abnormalities have been observed in fallow deer populations in Hungary. We supposed mycotoxin contamination to be one of the possible causes because multi-mycotoxin contamination is known to be dangerous even at low toxin levels, especially for young animals. We investigated the spatial pattern of mycotoxin occurrences and the relationship between maternal and fetal mycotoxin levels. A total of 72 fallow deer embryos and their mothers were sampled in seven forested regions in Hungary in the 2020/2021 hunting season. We analyzed Aflatoxin (AF), Zearalenone (ZEA), Fumonizin B1 (FB1), DON, and T2-toxin concentrations in maternal and fetal livers by ELISA. AF was present in 70% and 82%, ZEA in 41% and 96%, DON in 90% and 98%, T2-toxin in 96% and 85%, and FB1 in 84% and 3% of hind and fetus livers, respectively. All mycotoxins passed into the fetus, but only Fumonizin B1 rarely passed. The individual variability of mycotoxin levels was extremely high, but the spatial differences were moderate. We could not prove a relation between the maternal and fetal mycotoxin concentrations, but we found an accumulation of ZEA and DON in the fetuses. These results reflect the possible threats of mycotoxins to the population dynamics and reproduction of wild fallow deer.

AB  - The relevance of subcortical structures and interhemispheric subcortical-cortical interactions among positive/negative affect and approach/withdrawal tendencies during resting-state are not fully understood. Gaining this knowledge may foster the know-how on their role in subsequent task-engagement and also on the interlinkage among affective measures and approach/withdrawal dichotomy. Here we performed a study based on Region of Interest (ROI)-based analysis and graph-theory estimates for global and subnetworks on a limited sample of healthy 50 male volunteers who recorded resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and self-reported measures of Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and BAS-BIS (Behavioral Activation System-Behavioral Inhibition System) scores. Our study's initial results of region of interest-to-region of interest (ROI-to-ROI) connectivity revealed the connectivity of subcortical neural substrates of PANAS and BAS-BIS scores with bilateralized cortical regions. However, on probing the lateralization of strength of degree measures of the cortical-regions vital for subcortical-cortical interaction, we found, for positive affect, a left-hemispheric proclivity. Further, higher connectivity within the left hemisphere was also observed for the left-lateralized critical cortical regions of negative affect. Our study also revealed the association of emotion and memory-related subcortical-cortical interactions in positive and negative affect. Right amygdala-right thalamus-frontotemporal cortical areas emanated in positive affect, and right putamen-left hippocampus-frontotemporal cortical regions network stemmed for negative affect. Then, we show the involvement of basal-ganglia structures in approach-withdrawal dichotomy with tight coupling of right-caudate, left-accumbens with anterior cingulate, and insular regions for withdrawal/inhibition system. Further, distinct involvement of the insula (posterior) in affective states while insula (anterior) in approach/withdrawal systems builds up for the existence of a feedback loop between affective and approach/withdrawal systems.

AB  - Light is a strong stimulus for the sensory and endocrine systems. The opsins constitute a large family of proteins that can respond to specific light wavelengths. Hippocampus reidi is a near-threatened seahorse that has a diverse color pattern and sexual dimorphism. Over the years, H. reidi's unique characteristics, coupled with its high demand and over-exploitation for the aquarium trade, have raised concerns about its conservation, primarily due to their significant impact on wild populations. Here, we characterized chromatophore types in juvenile and adult H. reidi in captivity, and the effects of specific light wavelengths with the same irradiance (1.20 mW/cm2) on color change, growth, and survival rate. The xanthophores and melanophores were the major components of H. reidi pigmentation with differences in density and distribution between life stages and sexes. In the eye and skin of juveniles, the yellow (585 nm) wavelength induced a substantial increase in melanin levels compared to the individuals kept under white light (WL), blue (442 nm), or red (650 nm) wavelengths. In addition, blue and yellow wavelengths led to a higher juvenile mortality rate in comparison to the other treatments. Adult seahorses showed a rhythmic color change over 24 h, the highest reflectance values were obtained in the light phase, representing a daytime skin lightening for individuals under WL, blue and yellow wavelength, with changes in the acrophase. The yellow wavelength was more effective on juvenile seahorse pigmentation, while the blue wavelength exerted a stronger effect on the regulation of adult physiological color change. Dramatic changes in the opsin mRNA levels were life stage-dependent, which may infer ontogenetic opsin functions throughout seahorses' development. Exposure to specific wavelengths differentially affected the opsins mRNA levels in the skin and eyes of juveniles. In the juveniles, skin transcripts of visual (rh1, rh2, and lws) and non-visual opsins (opn3 and opn4x) were higher in individuals under yellow light. While in the juvenile's eyes, only rh1 and rh2 had increased transcripts influenced by yellow light; the lws and opn3 mRNA levels were higher in juveniles' eyes under WL. Prolonged exposure to yellow wavelength stimulates a robust increase in the antioxidant enzymes sod1 and sod2 mRNA levels. Our findings indicate that changes in the visible light spectrum alter physiological processes at different stages of life in H. reidi and may serve as the basis for a broader discussion about the implications of artificial light for aquatic species in captivity.

AB  - Simple Summary Swine have a large influence on livestock animals. In particular, Korean native pigs (KNPs) have unique traits in their body composition including lipids and proteins. In this study, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis to identify porcine transcriptomic changes during growing and finishing stages in the backfat tissue of KNP and Yorkshire pig crossbreeds. Enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly influenced by lipid metabolism and hormonal changes. Network analysis showed that the LEP and ACTC1 genes were connected with significant terminologies which resulted from up- and down-regulated DEGs. The results of our analysis indicate that backfat tissue could regulate swine biology during stages of growth. Consequently, our analysis provided comprehensive understanding for transcriptomic changes during growth periods. Recently, interest in the function of pig backfat (BF) has increased in the field of livestock animals, and many transcriptome-based studies using commercial pig breeds have been conducted. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies regarding the biological mechanisms of Korean native pigs (KNPs) and Yorkshire pig crossbreeds. In this study, therefore, BF samples of F1 crossbreeds of KNPs and Yorkshire pigs were investigated to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their related terms using RNA-sequencing analysis. DEG analysis identified 611 DEGs, of which 182 were up-regulated and 429 were down-regulated. Lipid metabolism was identified in the up-regulated genes, whereas growth and maturation-related terminologies were identified in the down-regulated genes. LEP and ACTC1 were identified as highly connected core genes during functional gene network analysis. Fat tissue was observed to affect lipid metabolism and organ development due to hormonal changes driven by transcriptional alteration. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of BF contribution to crossbreeds of KNPs and Yorkshire pigs during growth periods.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to forage seasonality, pregnant ruminants raised in pasture are commonly subjected to a period of feed restriction, which may lead to changes in the skeletal muscle metabolism of the offspring. Such alteration may have long-term consequences for the offspring's performance and carcass composition. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of feed restriction at different stages of gestation on the proteomic profile in the skeletal muscle of the offspring. The results showed that both periods of restriction, whether applied in the first or last half of gestation, influence muscle energy metabolism of the progeny. Specifically, the restriction in the first half of gestation influences muscle glycogen utilization, fatty acid oxidation, and the energy-investment phase of glycolysis, while the restriction in the second half of gestation influences the energy-generation phase of glycolysis and the production of glutamine in the skeletal muscle of the offspring. We aimed to investigate the effects of the maternal plane of nutrition during gestation on the proteome profile of the skeletal muscle of the newborn. Pregnant goats were assigned to the following experimental treatments: restriction maintenance (RM) where pregnant dams were fed at 50% of their maintenance requirements from 8-84 days of gestation, and then feed of 100% of the maintenance requirements was supplied from 85-parturition (n = 6); maintenance restriction (MR) where pregnant dams were fed at 100% of their maintenance requirements from 8-84 days of gestation, and then experienced feed restriction of 50% of the maintenance requirements from 85-parturition (n = 8). At birth, newborns were euthanized and samples of the Longissimus dorsi muscle were collected and used to perform HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The network analyses were performed to identify the biological processes and KEGG pathways of the proteins identified as differentially abundant protein and were deemed significant when the adjusted p-value (FDR) < 0.05. Our results suggest that treatment RM affects the energy metabolism of newborns' skeletal muscle by changing the energy-investment phase of glycolysis, in addition to utilizing glycogen as a carbon source. Moreover, the RM plane of nutrition may contribute to fatty acid oxidation and increases in the cytosolic alpha-KG and mitochondrial NADH levels in the skeletal muscle of the newborn. On the other hand, treatment MR likely affects the energy-generation phase of glycolysis, contributing to the accumulation of mitochondrial alpha-KG and the biosynthesis of glutamine.

AB  - Background: Tendinopathy or tendon injuries can affect many people, causing a huge impact on their movements and maintaining standing posture. Treatment options include physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, and alternative medicine. The use of physiotherapy or anti-inflammatory drugs may cause some side effects like pain and liver failure, respectively, therefore, alternative medicine will be a better choice. Method: Tenocytes were isolated from sheep Achilles tendon and used in Alamar blue assay to assess the metabolic activity, proliferation, and viability of tenocytes over 24 hrs. and 48 hrs., using natural and synthetic products [i.e., olive oil, oleic acid, corn oil, Inula viscosa oil, Inula viscosa extract, Nigella sativa oil, naproxen sodium, and paracetamol and LED photobiomodulation]. Furthermore, tenocytes viability was assessed by FDA/PI stain. For migration and healing of a wound, the scratch assay was used. Results: Alamar blue assay over 24 hrs. showed that Nigella sativa oil increased the metabolic activity, proliferation, and viability of tenocytes significantly, while Alamar blue over 48 hrs. showed that oleic acid, LED, and their combination increased these parameters for tenocytes significantly. Olive oil increased the viability of tenocytes significantly using FDA/PI stains. Scratch assay revealed that Inula viscosa oil, Inula viscosa extract, and paracetamol increased tenocyte migration and healing significantly. Conclusion: Nigella sativa oil, olive oil, oleic acid, Inula viscosa oil, and Inula viscosa extract may be used as an alternative therapy for tendinopathy with less side effects.

AB  - A total of 144 weaned piglets (6.80 +/- 0.46 kg, [Landrace x Yorkshire] x Duroc) were used in a 4-week feeding trial to determine the effect of nano zinc oxide or chelated zinc as alternatives to medical zinc oxide (ZnO) in weaned piglets. The pigs were randomly distributed to one of 6 treatment groups (4 pigs in a pen, 6 replicate pens per treatment). The dietary treatments were negative control (NC), no additional zinc oxide in the diet; positive control (PC), NC + 2500 mg/kg ZnO; 100 mg Chelate (NC + 100 zinc chelate); 200 mg Chelate (NC + 200 mg/kg of zinc chelate); 100 mg Nano (NC + 100 mg/kg ZnO nanoparticles), and 200 mg Nano (NC + 200 mg/kg nanoparticles). The growth performance of pigs fed the PC and Nano diets were significantly higher than that of pigs in the Chelate treatment groups (p < .05). In the overall periods, the faecal scores were significantly increased (p < .05) in the PC treatment group compared to the 100 mg/kg Chelate and Nano treatment groups. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of crude protein and faecal Lactobacillus concentrations were significantly decreased (p < .05) in the NC group compared to the other groups. The ATTD of zinc was significantly increased (p < .05) in the Chelate treatment groups compared to the other treatment groups. In conclusion, 200 mg/kg Nano showed similar effects on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and faecal Lactobacillus concentrations in weaning pigs as medical ZnO.

AB  - The tea-oil tree Camellia oleifera is native to China and is cultivated in many parts of southern China. Anthracnose on Ca. oleifera is one of the most serious diseases in China. The major causal pathogen of tea-oil anthracnose is Colletotrichum fructicola, but the detailed molecular mechanisms of its pathogenicity are still largely unclear. Vacuolar protein sorting 39 (Vps39) is a component of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex. To investigate the role of HOPS proteins in the fungal plant anthracnose pathogen C. fructicola, the CfVPS39 gene was deleted. This resulted in reduced mycelial growth, conidial production and complete loss of pathogenicity on tea-oil leaves and fruits. In addition, increment Cfvps39 showed increased sensitivity to cell wall stress, osmotic stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Further analysis revealed that CfVps39 is required for appressorium formation and homotypic vacuole fusion, both important for fungal pathogen invasion. Our study provides evidence that CfVps39 has a role in conidiation, stress response, appressorium formation, homotypic vacuole fusion and virulence against tea-oil. This research not only provides the theories for revealing the pathogenic molecular mechanism of C. fructicola, but also has important guiding significance to reveal new fungicide targets to control this devastating disease.

AB  - Infection by the parasite Dicrocoelium dendriticum has an impact on the production and health of sheep. Because the parasite cycle is complex, management is based on antiparasitic treatment. Albendazole at a dose of 15 mg/kg is known to be effective against the adult stages of D. dendriticum. Following a suspected lack of efficacy of this treatment in a French sheep farm, we carried out an efficacy test by treating 15 ewes at a dose of 15 mg/kg. We obtained a treatment efficacy of 39%, well below the 90% efficacy or more observed in other studies with the same compound at the same dosage. This lack of efficacy of albendazole on this farm is a warning for sheep farms, as there are no other active molecules against D. dendriticum currently available in France. Dicrocoeliosis is a common parasitic disease in European sheep farming. The prevalence of infection by this parasite can reach almost 70% in areas where the environment is favorable to intermediate hosts. In France, only one drug is currently available for the treatment of dicrocoeliosis: albendazole at a dose of 15 mg/kg in a single administration. However, a control coproscopy following a routine treatment led us to suspect that the efficacy of albendazole against Dicrocoelium dendriticum had diminished. Therefore, we carried out an efficacy test on 15 animals by treating them with albendazole at a dose of 15 mg/kg and performing a coproscopy on D0 and a control coproscopy 14 days later. We obtained a 39% reduction in the excretion of D. dendriticum eggs. This shows a reduction in the expected efficacy of albendazole, which is normally more than 90% in other studies involving this molecule at a dosage of 15 mg/kg. These results are of major concern as albendazole is currently the only drug available in France to treat dicrocoeliosis.

AB  - An electromagnetic field (EMF) may affect the functions of uterine tissues. This study hypothesized that EMF changes the estrogenic activity of pig myometrium during the peri-implantation period. Tissue was collected on days 15-16 of the gestation and incubated in the presence of EMF (50 and 120 Hz, 2 and 4 h). The cytochrome P450 aromatase type 3 (CYP19A3) and hydroxysteroid 17 beta dehydrogenase type 4 (HSD17B4) mRNA transcript abundance, cytochrome P450arom (aromatase), and 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 17 beta HSD) protein abundance and estrone (E-1) and estradiol-17 beta (E-2) release were examined using Real-Time PCR, Western blot and radioimmunoassay. Selected myometrial slices were treated with progesterone (P-4) to determine whether it functions as a protector against EMF. CYP19A3 mRNA transcript abundance in slices treated with EMF was less at 50 Hz (2 h) and greater at 120 Hz (2 and 4 h). HSD17B4 mRNA transcript was greater in slices treated with EMF at 120 Hz (2 h). Progesterone diminished EMF-related effects on CYP19A3 and HSD17B4. When P-4 was added, EMF had suppressive (50 and 120 Hz, 2 h) or enhancing (50 Hz, 4 h) effects on aromatase abundance. The E-1 release was lower after 4 h of EMF treatment at 50 Hz and P-4 did not protect myometrial E-1 release. In conclusion, EMF alters the synthesis and release of E-1 and did not affect E-2 release in the myometrium during the peri-implantation period.

AB  - Predator-prey interactions are important but difficult to study in the field. Therefore, laboratory studies are often used to examine the outcomes of predator-prey interactions. Previous laboratory studies have shown that moth hearing and ultrasound production can help prey avoid being eaten by bats. We report here that laboratory behavioural outcomes may not accurately reflect the outcomes of field bat-moth interactions. We tested the success rates of two bat species capturing moths with distinct anti-bat tactics using behavioural experiments. We compared the results with the dietary composition of field bats using next-generation DNA sequencing. Rhinolophus episcopus and Rhinolophus osgoodi had a lower rate of capture success when hunting for moths that produce anti-bat clicks than for silent eared moths and earless moths. Unexpectedly, the success rates of the bats capturing silent eared moths and earless moths did not differ significantly from each other. However, the field bats had a higher proportion of silent eared moths than that of earless moths and that of clicking moths in their diets. The difference between the proportions of silent eared moths and earless moths in the bat diets can be explained by the difference between their abundance in bat foraging habitats. These findings suggest that moth defensive tactics, bat countertactics and moth availability collectively shape the diets of insectivorous bats. This study illustrates the importance of using a combination of behavioural experiments and molecular genetic techniques to reveal the complex interactions between predators and prey in nature.

AB  - Local land-sea breezes play an important role in coastal air quality because they circulate air between coastal/urban and marine areas, potentially causing the accumulation of pollutants. This has been observed for the secondary photochemical pollutant ozone. However, particulate matter (PM) also warrants investigation. To understand the complicated interactions between coastal urban air quality and a local land-sea breeze, we analyzed historical monitoring data from Houston, Texas, which is the fourth most populous city in the United States. Using k-means clustering algorithms to analyze wind data from Houston, we successfully identified a sea breeze recirculation cluster. Additionally, we performed positive matrix factorization on PM2.5 (2.5 mu m in diameter or smaller) composition data for 2010-2018 from Houston Deer Park #2 monitoring site, 5 km south of the industrialized Houston Ship Channel. The resulting eight factors indicated a variety of anthropogenic, natural, primary and secondary sources. Emphasizing the PM2.5 sources in each of the wind clusters for June, July, and August, we discovered that on southernly wind and sea breeze recirculation days, the PM2.5 concentrations are similar to 30% higher than those under other wind patterns. Under southerly wind, 53% of PM2.5 was attributed to long-range transport of soil and 15% to aged and fresh sea salt. In contrast, on days identified as being impacted by a sea breeze, 60% of PM2.5 was attributed to anthropogenic emissions and only 15% to soil sources. Secondary organic aerosol from multiple sources also appeared to be important on sea breeze days.

AB  - Leaf wounding is a common stress that triggers a great number of plant mechanisms, while the overall plant status and age could also be critical for these mechanisms. However, there are not sufficient data about plants' physiological responses after leaf wounding that has been imposed at different developmental stages. In this study, physiological parameters, such as photosynthesis, transpiration, and stomatal conductance, as well as the chlorophyll and anthocyanin leaf contents, of Ocimum basilicum var. minimum L. plants were measured for seven days on wounded plants during three different developmental stages (vegetative, budding, and flowering). All of the measurements were conducted on control and wounded plants, while on the latter they were conducted on both wounded and intact leaves. The physiological parameters mentioned above revealed a remarkable decrease in wounded leaves of the budding and flowering plants, while they seemed to be only partially affected on the leaves of vegetative plants. The physiological parameters' decrease was not only an immediate plant response that was observed 1-2 h after wounding, but, in general, it was constant (during the seven days of treatments) and diurnal (from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.). The wounded leaves revealed an immediate and constant anthocyanin content decrease during all of the developmental stages, while the corresponding chlorophyll decrease was mainly evident in the flowering plants. Regarding the intact leaves, they exhibited, in general, a similar profile to that of the control ones. The results above reveal that at the vegetative stage, basil plants are more tolerant to leaf wounding than those at the budding and flowering stages, implying that the plant's response to wounding is a phenomenon that depends on the plant's developmental stage.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to explore the possible role of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), an epigenetic modifying enzyme, in the improvement of oocyte maturation recovered from the Tan sheep of China. We supplemented a specific inhibitor of HDAC1 to in vitro-cultured cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs). The results showed that the cumulus cell expansion and oocyte maturation ratio were impaired, while the production of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) was only slightly changed, despite the fact that the pan-acetylation levels of the histones were significantly elevated. This study implies that HDAC1 may participate in the maturation of oocytes in Tan sheep independently of the classic gonadotrophin-induction pathway. Previous studies have shown that some of the histone deacetylases (HDACs) play diverse roles in the regulation of ovarian somatic cell development, oocyte maturation and early embryonic development in different species including sheep. This study aimed to clarify whether HDAC1 also played pivotal roles in regulating oocyte maturation in Tan sheep. The results showed that HDAC1 was expressed in the nuclei of both the granulosa cells and oocytes of the growing follicles in the Tan sheep's ovaries. However, the level of HDAC1 was unaffected by luteinizing hormone (LH) induction in cultured granulosa cells. Meanwhile, the specific inhibition of HDAC1 using pyroxamide did not induce significant changes in the expression levels of EGF-like growth factors in vitro, whereas both the cumulus expansion and oocyte maturation of the cultured cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were significantly inhibited by pyroxamide. Additionally, the numbers of histone acetylation sites (H4K5, H4K12, H3K14 and H3K9) in ovarian granulosa cells were significantly increased. In conclusion, a constant expression of HDAC1 in the growing follicles of Tan sheep may be pivotal for supporting oocyte growth and maturation, although its action may not be closely correlated with LH induction, nor does it directly affect the expression of the EGF-like factors. Our study implies that there may exist diverse functions of the respective HDACs in modulating female reproduction in sheep.

AB  - The Cypriot pygmy hippopotamus is an extinct Mediterranean species that inhabited the island of Cyprus during the Late Pleistocene. This iconic species last appears at the archaeological site of Akrotiri Aetokremnos, dated to similar to 12 500 cal. BP. Taxonomically, the Cypriot pygmy hippopotamus has been assigned to Hippopotamus minor, which, based on morphology, is more closely related to the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; today present only in Sub-Saharan Africa) than to the West African pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis). Despite adverse conditions for preservation that greatly reduce the likelihood of DNA preservation in subfossil samples from hot environments, we recovered and analysed ancient DNA from petrous bones excavated from Akrotiri Aetokremnos. By whole mitogenome hybridization capture and exhaustive high-throughput sequencing, we were able to investigate the molecular phylogeny and taxonomic status of the Cypriot pygmy hippopotamus. The results of our low-coverage ancient mitogenomic analyses support the close phylogenetic affinity of H. minor to H. amphibius, with their divergence estimated at similar to 1.36 or 1.58 Mya, depending on the molecular dating method. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first step towards reconstruction of the molecular phylogeny of Mediterranean Hippopotaminae.

AB  - In order to achieve a better understanding of the factors that might have led our hominin ancestors to transition to a more terrestrial niche, including sleeping on the ground, we have conducted a study on the ground nesting behavior of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Chimpanzees, like all other species of great apes, build nests in which to sleep each night, but little is known about regional differences in their nesting habits. Previously, nesting on the ground was considered typical of gorillas, but rare in most populations of chimpanzees. Using data acquired during our extensive chimpanzee nesting survey conducted between 2004 and 2013 across a > 50 000 km2 region in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, we report a distinctive ground nesting behaviour of eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii). We have mapped the geographical distribution of ground nesting and compared its frequency at 20 survey areas on both sides of a large river, the Uele. We found that ground nests made up more than 1% of total nests at 15 of the 20 survey regions. For a subset of 16 of these regions, we utilized statistical models to investigate whether forest type and structure, as well as the abundance of carnivores and large herbivores, and the activities of humans impacted the frequency of ground nesting and nest height. We predicted that higher encounter rates of human and dangerous animal signs would be associated with lower rates of ground nesting as well as increased nest height. Overall, 10.4% of the Bili-Uere chimpanzee nests were terrestrial, but the frequency of ground nesting varied extensively between the survey areas (0-29% of nests). The occurrence of ground nests was positively associated with denser forests (p = 0.004), herb patches (p < 0.001), and light gaps (p < 0.001). Light gaps (p < 0.001), herb patches (p = 0.044), and vine tangles (p = 0.016) also had a strong negative effect on nest height. Hunting by humans had a negative effect on the probability of the occurrence of ground nests (p = 0.001) and a positive one on nest height (p = 0.013), with a similar but likely marginal effect of large herbivores on nest height (p = 0.023). In addition, the chimpanzees nested at significantly lower heights with increasing distance from roads and settlements (p < 0.001). Carnivore encounter rates, however, had no significant impact on ground nest frequency or nest height. Our results indicate that ground nesting can no longer be considered a rare and patchily-occurring phenomenon in Pan troglodytes, but is instead a major component of the chimpanzee behavioural repertoire across a considerable fraction of the range of the Eastern subspecies. Our study highlights that neither the large body size of gorillas nor the taming of fire are necessary conditions for hominids to sleep overnight on the ground, even in areas inhabited by multiple species of large carnivore. Human hunting, however, appears to reduce the probability of ground nesting, or eliminate the behavior altogether.

AB  - Simple Summary Subterranean termites are wood-feeding insects that construct foraging tunnels in soil to search for cellulose-based food sources. The Formosan subterranean termite is an invasive species to the United States and one of the most destructive termites in the world. Management of these termites depends on understanding termite behavior and the use of termiticides that are effective, safe, and cost-efficient. Menadione, also known as vitamin K3, is safely used in animal feeds but toxic to some insects due to disruption of energy production by interference with mitochondrial respiration. In this study, we examined how menadione affected the survival, feeding, and tunneling activity of the Formosan subterranean termite. We found that when menadione was applied to food (paper) or tunneling substrate (sand), this compound caused mortality and reduced feeding activity in termites in a dose-dependent manner. When provided with both treated and untreated sand, termites were deterred from tunneling and feeding on the side treated with menadione. Overall, our findings demonstrated strong toxicity and repellency of menadione against the Formosan subterranean termite, suggesting this compound can be potentially used as a termite control agent. The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, is a highly destructive pest and a cosmopolitan invasive species. Sustainable termite management methods have been improving with the search for novel insecticides that are effective, safe, and cost efficient. Menadione, also known as vitamin K-3, is a synthetic analogue and biosynthetic precursor of vitamin K with low mammalian toxicity. Menadione has shown insecticidal activity in several insects, presumably due to interference with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. However, little is known about its effectiveness against termites. In this study, we evaluated the toxicity and repellency of menadione in C. formosanus. Our results showed that menadione affected the survival and feeding activity of termites both in filter paper and substrate (sand) treatments, and menadione influenced termite tunneling activity in treated sand. In a no-choice assay, >= 90% mortality after seven days and minimal or no food consumption were recorded when sand was treated with menadione at 6 to 600 ppm. In a two-choice assay with a combination of treated and untreated sand, termites were deterred by menadione at 6 to 600 ppm and exhibited low mortality (<= 30%) over seven days, while tunneling activity was prevented with 60 to 600 ppm of menadione treatment. Overall, our study demonstrated dose-dependent toxicity and repellency of menadione in C. formosanus. The potential use of menadione as an alternative termite control agent is discussed.

To optimize additive's concentration, sperm pellet obtained from twenty-four ejaculates was supplemented with different concentrations of MitoQ (20 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM); and RESV (10 11M, 25 11M, 50 11M) against control in the extender. The post-thaw sperm motility, livability, and membrane integrity were higher (P < 0.05) in 200 nM MitoQ and 50 11M RESV than other concentrations used. In another experiment, sperm pellet from thirty-two ejaculates was supplemented with 200 nM MitoQ and 50 11M RESV in the extender. Pre-freeze and post-thaw progressive motility and livability were higher (P < 0.05) in MitoQ (200 nM) than RESV (50 11M) treatment. MitoQ supplementation improved post-thaw membrane integrity (CFDA-PI) higher (P < 0.05) than RESV, however, hypo-osmotic swelling response observed no improvement with RESV treatment. Post-thaw LPO rate was lower (P < 0.05) and Bovine cervical mucus penetration was higher (P < 0.05) in MitoQ than RESV treatment. In post-thaw semen, MitoQ showed higher (P < 0.05) proportion of acrosome intact (FITC-PNA), live non-apoptotic (P < 0.01) sperm with a higher reduction (P < 0.05) in membrane scrambling. MitoQ improved (P < 0.01) proportion of sperm with high Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and low LPO (P < 0.01) than RESV treatment. In conclusion, improvement in post-thaw in-vitro sperm functions and cryo-tolerance was more evident in MitoQ than RESV supplemented buffalo bull semen. Our study provides a better strategy to mitigate oxidative stress by enhancing mitochondrial antioxidant system with targeted antioxidants than cytosolic antioxidant supplementation.

AB  - With increasing agricultural production after green revolution in India, generation of agricultural waste is a concern for clean agricultural production system. The purpose of the study is to recycle locally available agricultural wastes into vermicompost and apply it on crops. In this study vermicomposts prepared from combinations of four sources of each plant biomass and animal excreta were characterized and tested for yield and quality of green bell pepper (Capsicum annum L.). Vermicompost samples were analyzed for macronutrients, micronutrients and enzymatic activities at intermediate (40 d) and final (80 d) stages of decomposition. During composting, total organic carbon content of the bedding material decreased and C: N ratio was narrowed down. Zinc, Cu, and Mn contents were decreased by 6.9-177.3%, 28.5-318.5% and 0.7-207.4%, respectively, while Fe content increased by 15.4-64.3% in the matured samples. Acid phosphomonoesterase and dehydrogenase activities were reduced by 2.5-26.0% and 15.5-84.1%, respectively; while the beta-glucosidase activity of vermicompost from cow dung and pig dung was increased by 2.0-30.7% at maturity. Application of vermicompost along with NPK fertilizers enhanced morphological, biochemical and yield attributes of green bell pepper which in-turn improved yield (7.1-135.7%) over the control. Vermicomposts also improved soil fertility by increasing organic C and plant-available N, P and K. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the properties of mature vermicomposts were mainly determined by the animal excreta. Poultry litter along with paddy straw and Azolla pinnata proved to be superior raw material in the production of high quality vermicompost which could produce good quality and quantity of fruits. The study also suggests that production of vermicompost from locally available plant biomass and animal excreta will sustain crop harvest with quality produce and improve soil fertility.

AB  - Plant sphingolipids are important membrane components and bioactive molecules in development and defense responses. However, the function of sphingolipids in plant defense, especially against herbivores, is not fully understood. Here, we report that Spodoptera exigua feeding affects sphingolipid metabolism in Arabidopsis, resulting in increased levels of sphingoid long-chain bases, ceramides, and hydroxyceramides. Insect-induced ceramide and hydroxyceramide accumulation is dependent on the jasmonate signaling pathway. Loss of the Arabidopsis alkaline ceramidase ACER increases ceramides and decreases long-chain base levels in plants; in this work, we found that loss of ACER enhances plant resistance to S. exigua and improves response to mechanical wounding. Moreover, acer-1 mutants exhibited more severe root-growth inhibition and higher anthocyanin accumulation than wild-type plants in response to methyl jasmonate treatment, indicating that loss of ACER increases sensitivity to jasmonate and that ACER functions in jasmonate-mediated root growth and secondary metabolism. Transcript levels of ACER were also negatively regulated by jasmonates, and this process involves the transcription factor MYC2. Thus, our findings reveal that ACER is involved in mediating jasmonate-related plant growth and defense and that jasmonates function in regulating the expression of ACER.
   Herbivore feeding affects Arabidopsis sphingolipid metabolism; alkaline ceramidase is regulated by the jasmonate pathway and its loss enhances plant resistance to Spodoptera exiguaand improves response to wounding and exogenous jasmonate.

AB  - In today's world, where information keeps growing rapidly and changing constantly, language models play a crucial role in making our lives easier across different fields. However, it is tough to keep these models updated with all the new data while making sure they stay accurate and relevant. To tackle this challenge, our study proposes an innovative approach to facilitate the propagation of complex entity knowledge within language models through extensive triplet representation. Using a specially curated dataset (CTR-KE) derived from reliable sources like Wikipedia and Wikidata, the research assesses the efficacy of editing methods in handling intricate relationships between entities across multiple tiers of information. By employing a comprehensive triplet representation strategy, the study aims to enrich contextual understanding while mitigating the risks associated with distorting or forgetting critical information. The study evaluates its proposed methodology using various evaluation metrics and four distinct editing methods across three diverse language models (GPT2-XL, GPT-J, and Llama-2-7b). The results indicate the superiority of mass-editing memory in a transformer (MEMIT) and in-context learning for knowledge editing (IKE) in efficiently executing multiple updates within the triplet representation framework. This research signifies a promising pathway for deeper exploration of data representation for knowledge editing within large language models, and improved understanding of contexts to facilitate continual learning.

AB  - The routine procedure of estrous cycle synchronization in pigs allows for the use of gonadotropins to stimulate ovarian activity. The applied protocols of eCG and hFSH priming similarly affected development of ovarian follicles in two classes 3-6 mm and >6 mm of diameter, however, the number of small follicles (<3 mm) was 2-fold higher in hFSH- than in eCG-primed prepubertal gilts. The attainment of sexual maturity increased concentration of estradiol, testosterone and androstenedione in the follicular fluid of hFSH/eCG-primed gilts, however, prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha metabolite increased in mature hFSH- and eCG-primed gilts, respectively. The maturity increased mRNA and/or protein expression of key steroidogenic enzymes, prostaglandin synthases or luteinizing hormone receptors in follicular walls. Both hormonal primers played a moderate role in affecting expression of steroidogenic enzymes in follicular walls. In vitro studies showed higher estradiol production in r-hLH (p = 0.04)- and r-hCG (p = 0.049)-stimulated follicular walls of mature gilts than in prepubertal hFSH-primed gilts. Both ovulatory triggers decreased the abundance of LHCG/FSH mRNA receptors in follicular walls, which mimic downregulation of these receptors by a preovulatory LH surge, confirmed in vivo. These data revealed the importance of sexual maturity in the protection of the estrogenic environment, and the selective, moderate role of eCG and FSH in the activation of steroidogenic enzymes in preovulatory follicles.

AB  - Bats are important pest control agents in agriculture. Yet, the underlying fine-scale biotic and abiotic mechanisms that drive their foraging behaviors and responses to insect outbreaks are unclear. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can attract both invertebrate and vertebrate natural enemies that use the chemical plant cues to locate insect prey. The ability of HIPVs to attract multiple species raises the question of whether they may also be a biotic factor influencing insectivorous bat activity. Additionally, abiotic factors, such as weather conditions, can affect bat activity in agricultural settings, but little is known about how bats respond to shifting environmental conditions on short timescales in this landscape context. Using a model crop system, soybean (Glycine max), our study asked three questions: (1) Which bat species are active in eastern Maryland soybean fields? (2) Is insectivorous bat activity affected by naturally occurring soybean HIPVs and/or synthetic soybean HIPVs (indole or farnesene)? (3) How is insectivorous bat activity affected by hourly weather conditions in this landscape? In soybean fields in eastern Maryland, we created paired treatment plots: HIPV plots (damaged plants or synthetic HIPV dispensers) and control plots (undamaged plants or empty dispensers). We measured bat activity using ultrasonic recorders, summarizing hourly and nightly activity, and detected 10 total species. The most abundant species were big brown/silver-haired bats (Eptesicus fuscus/Lasionycteris noctivagans). Bat activity did not significantly differ between control and HIPV plots in any of the three experiments. Thus, our results do not support our expectation that bats in eastern Maryland use soybean HIPVs to locate insect prey. However, bat activity did increase with increasing average hourly temperature and wind speed. This initial study of bats and HIPVs, as well as the fine-scale examination of weather conditions on bat activity, may serve as a guide for future research on bat-plant interactions that can support the development of new strategies for sustainable pest management.

AB  - Context Melatonin administration during pregnancy can influence fetal development and lactation.Aims This study aimed to verify whether melatonin treatment of pregnant Sarda ewes in spring improved lamb weight at birth, 7 and 21 days of age, time to first colostrum intake, birth behavior and survival. Additionally, we examined melatonin's effect on milk yield and composition.Methods On 18 April, 200 ewes were assigned to two groups of 100 each, based on lambing date, body condition score, parity, age and milk yield. One group received melatonin implants on 20 April, 4 July and 17 September; the other served as control. Rams (12 per group) were introduced on 25 May and removed after 40 days. Lamb weight was recorded at birth, 7 and 21 days, while milk yield and composition were assessed bi-weekly from day 30 of lactation.Key results Lambs born to melatonin-treated ewes were heavier at birth (3.54 vs 2.89 kg), and at 7 (5.21 vs 4.40 kg) and 21 days of age (11.3 vs 10.1 kg) and reached colostrum intake sooner than lambs from untreated ewes (55.5 +/- 5.3 vs 69.4 +/- 5.6 min). Milk yield was higher in melatonin-treated ewes, with somatic cell counts decreasing in treated animals and increasing in controls over the five samplings. Milk fat was higher in treated ewes than controls during early lactation, although protein and lactose levels remained similar between groups.Conclusion Melatonin treatment throughout pregnancy improved lamb growth and milk production and quality, suggesting a potential management advantage for sheep.

AB  - Background: The crucial role of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) for the immune response to infectious diseases is well-known, but no information is available on the 3D nuclear organization of this gene-dense region in immune cells, whereas nuclear architecture is known to play an essential role on genome function regulation. We analyzed the spatial arrangement of the three MHC regions (class I, III and II) in macrophages using 3D-FISH. Since this complex presents major differences in humans and pigs with, notably, the presence of the centromere between class III and class II regions in pigs, the analysis was implemented in both species to determine the impact of this organization on the 3D conformation of the MHC. The expression level of the three genes selected to represent each MHC region was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated states were investigated to ascertain whether a response to a pathogen modifies their expression level and their 3D organization.
   Results: While the three MHC regions occupy an intermediate radial position in porcine macrophages, the class I region was clearly more peripheral in humans. The BAC center-to-center distances allowed us to propose a 3D nuclear organization of the MHC in each species. LPS/IFN gamma activation induces a significant decompaction of the chromatin between class I and class III regions in pigs and between class I and class II regions in humans. We detected a strong overexpression of TNF alpha (class III region) in both species. Moreover, a single nucleus analysis revealed that the two alleles can have either the same or a different compaction pattern. In addition, macrophage activation leads to an increase in alleles that present a decompacted pattern in humans and pigs.
   Conclusions: The data presented demonstrate that: (i) the MHC harbors a different 3D organization in humans and pigs; (ii) LPS/IFN gamma activation induces chromatin decompaction, but it is not the same area affected in the two species. These findings were supported by the application of an original computation method based on the geometrical distribution of the three target genes. Finally, the position of the centromere inside the swine MHC could influence chromatin reorganization during the activation process.

AB  - Clinical data suggest that cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) could modify post-infarction scar and ventricular remodeling and reduce the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT). This paper assesses the effect of CDCs on VT substrate in a pig model of postinfarction monomorphic VT. We studied the effect of CDCs on the electrophysiological properties and histological structure of dense scar and heterogeneous tissue (HT). Optical mapping and histological evaluation were performed 16 weeks after the induction of a myocardial infarction by transient occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery in 21 pigs. Four weeks after LAD occlusion, pigs were randomized to receive intracoronary plus trans-myocardial CDCs (IC+TM group, n: 10) or to a control group. Optical mapping (OM) showed an action potential duration (APD) gradient between HT and normal tissue in both groups. CDCs increased conduction velocity (53 +/- 5 vs. 45 +/- 6 cm/s, p < 0.01), prolonged APD (280 +/- 30 ms vs. 220 +/- 40 ms, p < 0.01) and decreased APD dispersion in the HT. During OM, a VT was induced in one and seven of the IC+TM and control hearts (p = 0.03), respectively; five of these VTs had their critical isthmus located in intra-scar HT found adjacent to the coronary arteries. Histological evaluation of HT revealed less fibrosis (p < 0.01), lower density of myofibroblasts (p = 0.001), and higher density of connexin-43 in the IC+TM group. Scar and left ventricular volumes did not show differences between groups. Allogeneic CDCs early after myocardial infarction can modify the structure and electrophysiology of post-infarction scar. These findings pave the way for novel therapeutic properties of CDCs.

AB  - Ovulation and artificial insemination rates have been observed to decrease in sheep and cows when exposed to dietary phytoestrogens at concentrations greater than 25 mg/kg DM. A grazing trial was undertaken to investigate the effects of coumestrol and other key phytoestrogens on the superovulatory response, embryo numbers and quality in beef cows grazing legume pastures. A 7-week controlled grazing trial was conducted with legume and ryegrass pasture treatments, with cows exposed to legumes at two timed treatments, 4 and 7 weeks. Twenty Angus cows were subjected to a conventional estrus synchronization and superovulation protocol. Embryos were recovered via conventional uterine body flushing 7 days post artificial insemination (AI). Numerous phytoestrogens were identified in both pasture and plasma samples, including coumestrol and formononetin. Concentrations of phytoestrogens in the pasture ranged from 0.001 to 47.5 mg/kg DM and 0 to 2.6 ng/mL in plasma. Approximately 50% of cows produced viable embryos 7 days post AI. A significant interaction between the effect of treatment groups on the embryo stage was observed (p < 0.05). The results suggest that concentrations of >25 mg/kg DM of phytoestrogens less than 20 days preceding AI may negatively affect oocyte developmental competence, reduce progesterone production and thus contribute to early embryonic loss.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that the combined effect of fetal hypoxia and maternal stress hormones predetermines tendency to nicotine addiction in adulthood. This study in rats aimed to investigate the effect of prenatal severe hypoxia (PSH) on acetylcholine metabolism in the developing brain, as well as on expression of acetylcholine receptors chrna4 and chrna7 in both the developing brain and adult brain structures following nicotine consumption. In the developing brain of PSH rats, no changes were found in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or disturbances in the acetylcholine levels. However, decreased chrna4 expression was detected on the day 15 of pregnancy, while elevation in the chrna7 expression was observed on the days 15 and 16 of embryogenesis. In adulthood, the consequences of PSH were manifested as decreased expression of chrna4 in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAacc), and hypothalamus (HT), decreased expression of chrna7 in the PFC and hippocampus (HPC). Whereas, nicotine consumption did not decrease the expression levels of chrna4 and chrna7 compared to the control group in the adult PSH rats. Thus, prenatal hypoxia predisposes to impaired expression of the chrna4 and chrna7 genes in adult rats without affecting acetylcholine metabolism during embryonic development.

AB  - Bats have evolved highly adapted auditory mechanisms associated with ecological specialisation. However, there is scattered knowledge about the neurophysiological and cellular basis underlying high-frequency hearing in echolocating bats. Herein, the total cochlear cell atlas of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (constant frequency (CF) bat) and Myotis pilosus (frequency modulated (FM) bat) was conducted using the 10x Genomics single-nucleus RNA sequencing method. Differences in the proportion of cochlear cell types, especially for the neural cells, were detected between these two bat species. Previously, genes upregulated in the cochlea of CF compared with FM bats, were found to be mostly related to nervous activities. After mapping to the cochlear cell atlas, we found that the upregulated genes were from neural cells, lateral wall cells and neurosensory epithelium cells. A class of specific neurons and associated functions was detected in the cochlea of R. ferrumequinum, revealed by cross-species single-cell transcriptomic analyses. Furthermore, molecular evidence for the differentiation from glial cells to neuronal cells was also uncovered in the cochlea of R. ferrumequinum. Overall, this study identified specific cellular molecular properties that constitute the neuroanatomical evolutionary dynamics underlying distinct echolocating types of bats and provided new molecular evidence for high-frequency hearing of echolocating bats, promoting related studies about ecological adaptation and evolution.

AB  - Diversification of plant chemical phenotypes is typically associated with spatially and temporally variable plant-insect interactions. Floral scent is often assumed to be the target of pollinator-mediated selection, whereas foliar compounds are considered targets of antagonist-mediated selection. However, floral and vegetative phytochemicals can be biosynthetically linked and may thus evolve as integrated phenotypes. Utilizing a common garden of 28 populations of the perennial herb Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae), we investigated integration within and among floral scent compounds and foliar defense compounds (both volatile compounds and tissue-bound glucosinolates). Within floral scent volatiles, foliar volatile compounds, and glucosinolates, phytochemicals were often positively correlated, and correlations were stronger within these groups than between them. Thus, we found no evidence of integration between compound groups indicating that these are free to evolve independently. Relative to self-compatible populations, self-incompatible populations experienced stronger correlations between floral scent compounds, and a trend toward lower integration between floral scent and foliar volatiles.<br /> Our study serves as a rare test of integration of multiple, physiologically related plant traits that each are potential targets of insect-mediated selection. Our results suggest that independent evolutionary forces are likely to diversify different axes of plant chemistry without major constraints.

AB  - Zinc contaminated steelmaking by-products such as blast furnace (BF) dust and basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) dust present a significant recycling challenge at integrated steelmaking plants. Rotary Hearth Furnaces (RHFs) provide an attractive route for recovery of Fe and Zn from these materials through carbothermal reduction of the oxides in the material to yield Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) and crude zinc oxide. The next generation of RHF processes such as ITmk3 and e-nugget produce pig iron nuggets from iron ore concentrates and coal, as iron and gangue separate in-situ without an additional melting unit. A computational study of the metal-slag system using FACTSAGE 7.3 suggests that production of pig iron nuggets of good quality (93.75 wt.% Fe, 4.3 wt.% C, 0.116 wt.% S, 0.66 wt.% Mn) can be produced from BF dust and BOS dust in a ratio of 37:63 with addition of 5.4 wt.% SiO2 and 1.51 wt% MgO at 1450 degrees C. These computational results are in good agreement with experimental studies on similar material and, as such, suggest a practically feasible process.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can provide multiple benefits to the host plant, including improved nutrition and protection against biotic stress. Mycorrhiza induced resistance (MIR) against pathogens and insect herbivores has been reported in different plant systems, but nutrient availability may influence the outcome of the interaction. Phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient for plants and insects, but also a regulatory factor for AM establishment and functioning. However, little is known about how AM symbiosis and P interact to regulate plant resistance to pests. Here, using the tomato-Funneliformis mosseae mycorrhizal system, we analyzed the effect of moderate differences in P fertilization on plant and pest performance, and on MIR against biotic stressors including the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea and the insect herbivore Spodoperta exigua. P fertilization impacted plant nutritional value, plant defenses, disease development and caterpillar survival, but these effects were modulated by the mycorrhizal status of the plant. Enhanced resistance of F. mosseae-inoculated plants against B. cinerea and S. exigua depended on P availability, as no protection was observed under the most P-limiting conditions. MIR was not directly explained by changes in the plant nutritional status nor to basal differences in defense-related phytohormones. Analysis of early plant defense responses to the damage associated molecules oligogalacturonides showed primed transcriptional activation of plant defenses occurring at intermediate P levels, but not under severe P limitation. The results show that P influences mycorrhizal priming of plant defenses and the resulting induced-resistance is dependent on P availability, and suggest that mycorrhiza fine-tunes the plant growth vs defense prioritization depending on P availability. Our results highlight how MIR is context dependent, thus unravel molecular mechanism based on plant defence in will contribute to improve the efficacy of mycorrhizal inoculants in crop protection.

AB  - Elemental defense hypothesis (EDH) proposed that metal accumulation in plants could increase plant resistance to herbivores. However, the over-accumulation of metals in low-accumulators such as woody plants will cause adverse effects on plant health. Thus, the application of EDH on low-accumulators in metal contaminated areas is strongly limited. Since the supplement of exogenous spermidine (Spd) was reported to alleviate metal-induced toxicity in plants while stimulating metal accumulation in plant tissues, we hypothesized that such application will further improve plant resistance to herbivores. In this study, we employed a woody plant species, Populus yunnanensis, to test this hypothesis. We first tested a Spd concentration series applied on plants subjected to soil cadmium (Cd) stress and found that the 1 mM Spd strongly promoted plant growth while stimulated Cd accumulation in plant leaves and roots. We further conducted herbivore bioassays to test the growth performance and feeding preference of two leaf herbivore species and a root herbivore species that fed on plants from different treatments. The results showed that the inhibition effect of Cd stressed-plants on herbivore growth was significantly magnified by the addition of Spd. The growth weight of all the three tested herbivores were negatively correlated with increased Cd concentrations in plant tissues. In addition, the feeding preferences of the two leaf herbivore species were strongly repelled by leaf discs from Cd-treated plants with Spd supplement. The results suggested that the application of exogenous Spd at a certain dose could enhance elemental defense of plants against herbivory.

AB  - Systemic injections of the flavonoid chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) exert anxiolytic-like effects in ovariectomised and cycling female rats through actions on gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptors; however, it is unknown if chrysin directly acts on brain structures that are involved in regulating emotional processes, such as the hippocampus. The present study evaluated the effects of intrahippocampal microinjections of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mu g of chrysin on anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and locomotor activity test (LAT) in female rats in proestrus and dioestrus. Similar doses of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone were used as a reference GABAergic anxiolytic drug. The participation of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complex was evaluated by administering the antagonists picrotoxin, bicuculline and flumazenil. In proestrus, 0.5 and 1 mu g of chrysin and allopregnanolone induced anxiogenic-like behaviour. In dioestrus, chrysin, and allopregnanolone (0.5 mu g) induced anxiolytic-like effects. Picrotoxin, bicuculline and flumazenil prevented the effects of chrysin and allopregnanolone in both proestrus and dioestrus. None of the treatments significantly affected locomotor activity. These results indicate that the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the dorsal hippocampus regulates the effects of chrysin on anxiety-like behaviour, similar to the actions of allopregnanolone. The divergent effects of treatments across the oestrous cycle phases suggest complex interactions between GABA(A) receptors and compounds with an anxiolytic potential.

AB  - In response to growing environmental awareness and the need for sustainable practices, the construction sector is seeking innovative solutions to reduce its environmental impact. This study examines the use of low-quality sheep wool, typically discarded by the textile industry as a potential resource for the construction sector. Unlike natural plant fibers which must be specifically cultivated sheep wool is an agricultural by-product produced in large quantities without a designated end-use, despite its potential applications. The primary objective is to assess the mechanical properties of sheep wool yarn, tested through various experimental methods, to evaluate its potential as a reinforcement in biocomposites. The research investigates yarn performance in both its dry state and after impregnation with a bio-based resin. Two testing configurations were employed for dry yarns: capstan grips (DYR) and straight sample configurations (DYC). For impregnated yarns, two polymerization strategies were assessed: with pre-tensioning (IYT) and without pre-tensioning (IY). Results revealed no significant differences between the two testing configurations for dry yarns (DYR and DYC). The pre-tensioned impregnated yarn (IYT) exhibited the best mechanical performance, with tensile strength increasing from 89.45 MPa (average of DYR and DYC) to 142.92 MPa, and elastic modulus rising from 1.30 GPa to 11.07 GPa. These improvements are attributed to better fiber alignment and structural compaction promoted by the pre-tensioning process. These findings demonstrate the potential of waste wool as a reinforcement material for construction applications. Despite promising results, challenges remain. Wool's hygroscopic nature affects fiber-matrix adhesion, and further research is needed to evaluate compatibility with various polymer matrices. Addressing these issues could establish waste wool as a sustainable resource, aligning with global demand for circular economy and ecofriendly materials.

AB  - Simple Summary The shovel-tusked gomphotheres have long intrigued paleontologists and the general public as they are one of the most notable of all elephant ancestors. This is due to their highly distinctive and broad, flattened lower tusks that look remarkably like the head of a shovel. There has been much speculation regarding how these bizarre mammals lived as well as the possible functions of their tusks. This study aims to provide evidence as to their ancient diet as well as the likely functions of their upper and lower tusks by examining scars left in their molar as well as the scratch patterns left on their tusks. We show that the Florida shovel-tusked gomphotheres browsed on leaves and twigs, and thus, most likely occupied a dietary niche similar to living forest elephants. We demonstrate that they used their tusks for a wide variety of purposes. Upper tusks were used for scraping and slicing, whereas lower tusks were used for shoveling in some forms and scraping in others. The obvious importance of tusks in the life of proboscideans such as the shovel-tuskers underscores the vital importance of saving modern elephant populations from poachers that callously steal their tusks for profit. The paleodiet of the shovel-tusked gomphotheres from Florida (Amebelodon floridanus, Konobelodon britti, and Serbelodon barbourensis) was assessed via microwear analysis of molar dental enamel and compared to a large database of both extant proboscideans and ungulates. Scratch and pit results show a consistent browsing signal in A. floridanus, K. britti and S. barbourensis. Fossil results are more similar to those of the extant Loxodonta cyclotis than to Loxodonta africana or Elephas maximus, the latter two taxa exhibiting a mixed feeding result. Scratch width scores are high in all three shovel tuskers as well as in the extant proboscideans indicating the ingestion of some coarse vegetation, most likely bark, and twigs. Gouging is relatively low in A. floridanus and S. barbourensis. Only K. britti has levels of gouging approximating that seen in extant elephants. Large pitting is relatively low in both fossil and extant forms although L. cyclotis has higher levels of large pitting including more puncture-like pits seen with fruit and/or seed consumption. A variety of scratch patterns indicating variation in tusk usage behavior was found. Some Serbelodon and Konobelodon mandibular tusks exhibited digging behavior, although Konobelodon digging behavior was much more common and obvious, whereas Amebelodon mandibular tusks did not exhibit digging behavior and were more likely used for stripping and scraping. Unusual distal tusk wear was found in Amebelodon and Serbelodon most likely due to stripping off tree bark. Upper tusk usage varied with all three fossil species exhibiting scraping and/or cutting behavior. Results indicate that shovel-tusked gomphotheres from Florida occupied a narrow dietary niche but employed a variety of strategies to obtain the vegetation that they consumed.

AB  - During the postpartum period, domestic ruminants suffer elevated endogenous cortisol levels, which are associated with an increased risk of uterine infections. Selenium is a trace mineral nutrient with beneficial impacts on animals. The study aimed to investigate whether selenium yeast (SeY) could attenuate Escherichia coli (E. coli)-induced endometrial injury in goats with high cortisol background. Goats were examined after oral SeY administration for 21 days and were treated with glacial acetic acid, E. coli, and hydrocortisone to establish an endometritis model with high cortisol background. The results showed that endometrial injury caused by E. coli was aggravated under high cortisol background. Supplementation with SeY alleviated endometrial inflammation and serum LDH content. The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and defensin beta 2 and the phosphorylation level of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-b (NF-kappa B) signaling pathways were decreased by SeY supplementation. Total antioxidant capacity and antioxidant enzymes activities were increased by SeY supplementation, but malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal content were decreased. Moreover, nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (NRF2) in the nucleus, heme oxygenase-1, and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 were increased by SeY supplementation. So, supplementation with SeY alleviated E. coli-induced endometritis in goats by activating the NRF2 pathway and inhibiting the activation of the MAPK and NF-kappa B pathways under postpartum stress.

AB  - Pig and monkey are widely used models for exploration of human diseases and evaluation of drug efficiency and toxicity, but high cost limits their uses. Organoids have been shown to be promising models for drug test as they reasonably preserve tissue structure and functions. However, colonic organoids of pig and monkey are not yet established. Here, we report a culture medium to support the growth of porcine and monkey colonic organoids. Wnt signaling and PGE2 are important for long-term expansion of the organoids, and their withdrawal results in lineage differentiation to mature cells. Furthermore, we observe that porcine colonic organoids are closer to human colonic organoids in terms of drug toxicity response. Successful establishment of porcine and monkey colonic organoids would facilitate the mechanistic investigation of the homeostatic regulation of the intestine of these animals and is useful for drug development and toxicity studies.

AB  - Plants can respond to insect egg deposition by emitting oviposition-induced plant volatiles (OIPVs) recruiting parasitoids. The recruitment of carnivore insects in response to egg deposition is considered an indirect defence strategy that is widespread in the plant kingdom. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence showing that microbial colonization can influence the strength of plant responses to insect herbivory, yet no information is available on how beneficial microbes modulate indirect defences induced by insect egg deposition.<br /> In this work, we evaluated the effects of inoculation with the beneficial soil fungus Trichoderma harzianum strain T22 on a tritrophic system consisting of tomato, the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula and its associated egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis. We used Y-tube olfactometer assays to evaluate the behavioural responses of the parasitoids to OIPVs emitted by plants colonized with beneficial soil microbes. We also used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to investigate whether and how root inoculation with T. harzianum T22 affects the chemical composition of induced plant volatiles.<br /> In olfactometer assays, we found that root inoculation with T. harzianum T22 enhanced the attraction of the egg parasitoid towards tomato plants induced by N. viridula feeding and oviposition activities. In particular, the egg parasitoid preferred OIPVs emitted by tomato plants previously inoculated with T. harzianum T22 over OIPVs emitted by non-inoculated plants. Furthermore, chemical analysis showed that root inoculation with T. harzianum T22 resulted in changes in the composition of OIPVs, which was consistent with the behavioural observations. Among the compounds that strongly contribute to the chemical differences between OIPVs from non-inoculated and inoculated plants, chemical analysis identified green leaf volatiles ((Z)-3-hepten-1-ol, (E,E)-2,4-hexadienal), along with terpenoids (terpinen 4-ol, alpha-tujene and delta-elemene).<br /> Taken together our results indicate that beneficial soil microbes enhance indirect plant defences induced by feeding and oviposition, broadening our understanding of plant responses to insect eggs. Our results underscore the importance of taking into account the role of microorganisms to fully comprehend the intricate interactions among plants, herbivore eggs and their associated egg parasitoids.

AB  - Improving resource use is a pressing research issue because of the huge potential organic waste market. Composting is a recycling technique, treatment to achieve the dual effect of resource recovery and zero waste. Waste composition varies: for example, chicken manure is rich in protein, straw contains wood fibres, fruit and vegetables contain sugar, and food waste contains starch. When considering combining waste streams for composting, it is important to ask if this approach can reduce overall composting costs while achieving a more concentrated result. Chicken manure, in particular, presents a unique challenge. This is due to its high protein content. The lack of precursor sugars for glucosamine condensation in chicken manure results in lower humus content in the final compost than other composting methods. To address this, we conducted experiments to investigate whether adding sugary fruits and vegetables to a chicken manure composting system would improve compost quality. To improve experimental results, we used sucrose and maltose instead of fruit and vegetable waste. Sugars added to chicken manure composting resulted in a significant increase in humic substance (HS) content, with improvements of 9.0% and 17.4%, respectively, compared to the control. Sucrose and maltose have a similar effect on the formation of humic substances. These results demonstrate the feasibility of composting fruit and vegetable waste with chicken manure, providing a theoretical basis for future composting experiments.

AB  - European pig farmers are challenged by increasingly stringent EU regulations to protect the environment from pollution, to meet animal welfare standards and to make pig farming more sustainable. Economic sustainability is defined as the ability to achieve higher profits by respecting social and natural resources. This study is focused on the analysis of the economic resilience of intensive and extensive farming systems, based on data collected from 56 farms located in Denmark, Poland, Italy and Spain. Productive and economic performances of these farms are analyzed, and economic resilience is assessed through a survey including a selection of indicators, belonging to different themes: [i] resilience of resources, [ii] entrepreneurship, [iii] propensity to extensification. The qualitative data from the questionnaire allow for an exploration of how production systems relate to the three dimensions of resilience. Different levels of resilience were found and discussed for intensive and extensive farms. The findings suggest that intensive farms benefit from high standards and greater bargaining power within the supply chain. Extensive systems can achieve profitability through value-added strategies and generally display good resilience. Policies that support investment and risk reduction are essential for enhancing farm resilience and robustness, while strengthening farmer networks can improve adaptability.

AB  - Plants can deploy chemical defenses that poison herbivorous insects or deter their feeding; however, insects can counter by secreting effector proteins that modulate these defense responses. In principle, plants might therefore interfere with the expression of insect effector proteins, but knowledge about such a process remains limited. Here, we explored the mechanisms underlying how resistant tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) influences the effector proteins of whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), thereby affecting the interaction of B. tabaci with tomato. Using two near-isogenic tomato lines that differ greatly in flavonoid levels, we found that whitefly-resistant high-flavonoid-producing tomato inhibited the expression of a B. tabaci effector protein 3, (BtE3) in the salivary gland, which was found to act as a salicylic acid elicitor and induce tomato susceptibility to B. tabaci by suppressing jasmonic acid-dependent defense responses. Moreover, we confirmed that the resistance of high-flavonoid-producing tomato to B. tabaci could mainly be attributed to the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on the expression of BtE3. Artificial diet feeding assays suggested that quercetin and rutin inhibited the expression of BtE3 gene. Combining with exogenous stem applications and CRISPR/Cas9-generated S. lycopersicum flavonol synthase mutants, we further demonstrated that quercetin and rutin were responsible for the resistance of high-flavonoid-producing tomato to B. tabaci. Taken together, these results indicate that resistant plants are able to interfere with the expression of effector proteins from their insect attackers, and thus insect effectors are potential targets for the development of pest control strategies.
   Tomato flavonoids inhibit the expression of a whitefly salivary effector protein and enhance plant resistance, indicating insect effectors can be used as targets for pest control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Semen cryopreservation results in deleterious effects on spermatozoa, including lipid peroxidation and a reduction in the total antioxidant components of seminal plasma. The ultimate outcome of these changes is a reduction in post-thaw semen quality. A mitochondrial derived peptide, humanin, a potent cytoprotective and antioxidant agent was used in the present study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a mitochondrial-derived peptide, humanin to improve the post-thaw quality of buffalo spermatozoa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 18 ejaculates from three Murrah buffalo bulls (n=6 each) were collected. Each ejaculate was divided into four aliquots. The first aliquot was diluted with standard EYTG dilutor (Group I, control), whereas the other three aliquots were diluted with EYTG supplemented with 2 mu M (Group II), 5 mu M (Group III) and 10 mu M humanin (Group IV), respectively. Semen was evaluated for physico-morphological and functional attributes such as progressive motility, viability, abnormality, acrosome integrity, plasmamembrane integrity of fresh samples, pre-freeze and post-thaw stages. Oxidative stress parameters [lipid peroxidation (LPO) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)] were also measured at the pre-freeze and post-thaw stages. RESULTS: Humanin supplementation resulted in significantly higher (p <= 0.05) post-thaw motility in all treatment groups and, higher (p <= 0.05) viability in Groups III and IV in comparison to the control at the post-thaw stage. Spermatozoa with intact acrosome and plasma membrane were higher (p <= 0.05) in Groups III and IV as compared to Groups I and II. The LPO levels at the post-thaw stage were found to be lower (p <= 0.05) in all treatment groups versus the control group, whereas, higher (p <= 0.05) TAC values were recorded in Groups III and W in comparison to the control and Group II. CONCLUSION: Humanin supplementation in the extender improved the freezabilty of buffalo spermatozoa.

AB  - Simple Summary Immune stress is an important stressor in domestic animals that leads to decreased feed intake, slow growth, and reduced disease resistance of pigs and poultry. Especially in high-density animal feeding conditions, the risk factor of immune stress is extremely high, as they are easily harmed by pathogens, and frequent vaccinations are required to enhance the immunity function of the animals. This review mainly describes the causes, mechanisms of immune stress and its prevention and treatment measures. This provides a theoretical basis for further research and development of safe and efficient prevention and control measures for immune stress in animals. Immune stress markedly affects the immune function and growth performance of livestock, including poultry, resulting in financial loss to farmers. It can lead to decreased feed intake, reduced growth, and intestinal disorders. Studies have shown that pathogen-induced immune stress is mostly related to TLR4-related inflammatory signal pathway activation, excessive inflammatory cytokine release, oxidative stress, hormonal disorders, cell apoptosis, and intestinal microbial disorders. This paper reviews the occurrence of immune stress in livestock, its impact on immune function and growth performance, and strategies for immune stress prevention.

AB  - Untreated wastewater is routinely used for agricultural activities in water-stressed regions, thereby causing severe ecological risks by various pollutants. Hence, management strategies are needed to cope with the environmental issues related to wastewater use in agriculture. This pot study evaluates the effect of mixing either freshwater (FW) or groundwater (GW) with sewage water (SW) on the buildup of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in soil and maize crop. Results revealed that SW of Vehari contains high levels of Cd (0.08 mg L-1) and Cr (2.3 mg L-1). Mixing of FW and GW with SW increased soil contents of As (22%) and decreased Cd (1%), Cu (1%), Fe (3%), Mn (9%), Ni (9%), Pb (10%), and Zn (4%) than SW "alone" treatment. Risk indices showed high-degree of soil-contamination and very-high ecological risks. Maize accumulated considerable concentrations of PTEs in roots and shoot with bioconcentration factor > 1 for Cd, Cu, and Pb and transfer factor > 1 for As, Fe, Mn, and Ni. Overall, mixed treatments increased plant contents of As (118%), Cu (7%), Mn (8%), Ni (55%), and Zn (1%), while decreased those of Cd (7%), Fe (5%), and Pb (1%) compared to SW "alone" treatments. Risk indices predicted possible carcinogenic risks to cow (CR 0.003 > 0.0001) and sheep (CR 0.0121 > 0.0001) due to consumption of maize fodder containing PTEs. Hence, to minimize possible environmental/health hazards, mixing of FW and GW with SW can be an effective strategy. However, the recommendation greatly depends on the composition of mixing waters.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hanchuan Zupa Granule (HCZP), a traditional Chinese ethnodrug, has the functions of supressing a cough, resolving phlegm, warming the lungs, and relieving asthma. In clinical practice employing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), HCZP is commonly used to treat acute colds, cough and abnormal mucous asthma caused by a cold, or "Nai-Zi-Lai" in the Uygur language. Studies have confirmed the use of HCZP to treat cough variant asthma (CVA) and other respiratory diseases. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of HCZP remain unrevealed.
   Aim of the study: To investigate the anti-tussive and anti-asthmatic effects and the possible pharmacological mechanisms of HCZP in the treatment of CVA.
   Materials and methods: A guinea pig CVA animal model was established by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) combined with intraperitoneal injection of aluminium hydroxide adjuvant and atomized OVA. Meanwhile, guinea pigs with CVA received oral HCZP (at dosages of 0.571, 0.285 and 0.143 g/kg bodyweight). The number of coughs induced by aerosol capsaicin was recorded, and the airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) of CVA guinea pigs was detected with the FinePointe series RC system. H&E staining of lung tissues was performed to observe pathological changes. ELISA was used to detect inflammatory cytokines. qRT-PCR and western blotting analyses were used to detect the expression of Th1-specific transcription factor (T-bet), Th2-specific transcription factor (GATA3), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signal transduction elements. These methods were performed to assess the protective effects and the potential mechanisms of HCZP on CVA.
   Results: Great changes were found in the CVA guinea pig model after HCZP treatment. The number of coughs induced by capsaicin in guinea pigs decreased, the body weights of guinea pigs increased, and inflammation of the eosinophilic airway and AHR were reduced simultaneously. These results indicate that HCZP has a significant protective effect on CVA. A pharmacological study of HCZP showed that the levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum decreased. The amount of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increased, mRNA and protein expression of TLR4 and GATA3 weakened, and mRNA and protein expression of T-bet increased.
   Conclusions: HCZP ameliorated the symptoms of guinea pigs with CVA induced by OVA by regulating the Th1/Th2 imbalance and TLR4 receptors.

AB  - The hippocampus is a brain region crucially involved in regulating stress responses and highly sensitive to environmental changes, with elevated proliferative and adaptive activity of neurons and glial cells. Despite the prevalence of environmental noise as a stressor, its effects on hippocampal cytoarchitecture remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of acoustic stress on hippocampal proliferation and glial cytoarchitecture in adult male rats, using environmental noise as a stress model. After 21 days of noise exposure, our results showed abnormal cellular proliferation in the hippocampus, with an inverse effect on the proliferation ratios of astrocytes and microglia. Both cell lineages also displayed atrophic morphologies with fewer processes and lower densities in the noise-stressed animals. Our findings suggest that, stress not only affects neurogenesis and neuronal death in the hippocampus, but also the proliferation ratio, cell density, and morphology of glial cells, potentially triggering an inflammatory-like response that compromises their homeostatic and repair functions.

AB  - Variation in body size is thought as one of the main responses to climate change, yet studies exploring the existence of this pattern are limited by the scarcity of long temporal datasets. Bats are promising candidates for the occurrence of climate-driven changes in body size because their life cycle is highly sensitive to ambient temperature. Although a reduction in body size would adaptively imply more efficient heat dissipation under a climate change scenario, dehydration caused by heatwaves would in fact be limited by a larger body size, so either responses may be predicted. An increasing body size over time might also be the consequence of a longer growth season secured by a warmer climate. On such bases, we tested the hypothesis that body size varied in the bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum from Italian populations between 1869 and 2005 by examining forearm length (FAL) in 78 spatially independent specimens, and found that FAL increased over that period. We also ruled out that body size varied over space in relation to latitude (as predicted by Bergmann's rule) or insularity, besides confirming the occurrence of sexual dimorphism (females being larger than males). This study illustrates a rare example of an increasing body size trend in a mammal species measured over ca. a century and a half, potentially unveiling a response to environmental variation.

AB  - Simple Summary: Intramuscular fat (IMF) is a key factor affecting many meat quality traits of pigs, such as pork tenderness, flavor, and many more. In this study, a systematic identification and comparison of the expressed profiles of messenger RNA (mRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) with associated co-expression networks longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) in Large White x Min pigs F2 resource population were performed. The results contain high-throughput genomic data, which are helpful to clarify the regulatory role of a variety of RNAs in regulating intramuscular fat formation and lipid metabolism at the genomic level and provide new insights for studying the mechanism of fat formation and the regulation of meat quality related genes at the molecular level.Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a complex trait that affects meat quality and determines pork quality. In order to explore the potential mechanisms that affect the intramuscular fat content of pigs, a Large white x Min pigs F2 resource populations were constructed, then whole-transcriptome profile analysis was carried out for five low-IMF and five high-IMF F2 individuals. In total, 218 messenger RNA (mRNAs), 213 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 18 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 59 circular RNAs (circRNAs) were found to be differentially expressed in the longissimus dorsi muscle. Gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations revealed that these differentially expressed (DE) genes or potential target genes (PTGs) of DE regulatory RNAs (lncRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs) are mainly involved in cell differentiation, fatty acid synthesis, system development, muscle fiber development, and regulating lipid metabolism. In total, 274 PTGs were found to be differentially expressed between low- and high-IMF pigs, which indicated that some DE regulatory RNAs may contribute to the deposition/metabolism of IMF by regulating their PTGs. In addition, we analyzed the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of DE RNAs co-located in high- and low-IMF groups. A total of 97 DE regulatory RNAs could be found located in the QTLs related to IMF. Co-expression networks among different types of RNA and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks were also constructed, and some genes involved in type I diabetes mellitus were found to play an important role in the complex molecular process of intramuscular fat deposition. This study identified and analyzed some differential RNAs, regulatory RNAs, and PTGs related to IMF, and provided new insights into the study of IMF formation at the level of the genome-wide landscape.

This study will help to workout best potting media ratio for them. We will conclude to highlight a best combination of potting media, among, T1: Soil + Farm Yard Manure + Cocopeat (50:25:25), T2: Soil + Farm Yard Manure + Cocopeat (25:50:25), T3: Soil + Farm Yard Manure + Cocopeat (25:25:50), T4: Soil + Vermicompost + Cocopeat (25:50:25), and T5 (Control): Soil + Farm Yard Manure (50:50) and best plant species among Syngonium podophyllum, Dracaena compacta (Red), Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, Dracaena reflexa, and Pedilanthus tithymaloides. Each treatment contained 15 plants replicated thrice under the Completely Randomized Block Design. The potting media ratio combination in T4: Soil + Vermicompost + Cocopeat (25:50:25) proved to be the best for improvement of vegetative parameters and for the attractive foliage of the selected ornamental plants, having more ratio of vermicompost thus capable of providing good amount of all beneficial benefits with more moisture retention capacity and nutrients value than other combination of media used. The minimum value of all the observations recorded was found to be in T5 (Control): Soil + Farm Yard Manure (50:50).

AB  - In addition to cocaine's addictive properties, cocaine use may lead to heightened risk-taking behavior. The disruptive effects of cocaine on aversive memory formation may underlie this behavior. The present study investigated the effects of cocaine on fear memory using a cued fear conditioning paradigm in female Sprague Dawley rats, and further determined the role of D2 receptors in modulating the effect of cocaine on cued fear expression. Animals received six evenly spaced shocks preceded by a tone. The following day, rats were returned to the fear chamber where tones, but no shocks, were delivered. In Experiment 1, separate or concurrent administrations of cocaine (15 mg/kg; i.p.) and the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride (0.1 mg/kg; i.p.) were given immediately after conditioning trials. It was determined that cocaine administration during the consolidation period diminished the expression of cued fear during the subsequent test day. Concurrent eticlopride administration attenuated this effect, indicating the involvement of D2 receptors in the deleterious effects of cocaine on fear memory consolidation. In Experiment 2, eticlopride (0.05 mu g) was infused directly into the ventral hippo- campus (VH) after fear conditioning and before cocaine administration. Cocaine continued to disrupt consolidation of cued and contextual fear memory, and concurrent intra-VH eticlopride blocked this effect, thereby demonstrating that VH D2 receptors mediate cocaine-induced impairment of fear memory consolidation. Overall, the present study provides evidence that acute cocaine administration impairs aversive memory formation and establishes a potential circuit through which cocaine induces its detrimental effects on fear memory consolidation.

AB  - Many animals exhibit preferential viewing of fear-inducing stimuli with their left eyes, reflecting cerebral lateralisation in emotion processing. In novel object tests, often used to assess fear, spatial positioning of the objects relative to the animal can vary. This study aimed to investigate visual lateralisation in calves' responses in novel object tests, evaluate its effectiveness as an indicator of fear, and examine how initial monocular presentation of fear-inducing stimuli impacts fear responses and their reliability. Thirty-six dairy calves underwent a novel object test at six weeks of age and a second at seven weeks of age using a different object, with behavioural responses towards the novel objects recorded. There was no correlation in latency to first contact with novel objects between tests. On average, proportion of time viewing novel objects with the left eye did not significantly differ from the right eye across the two tests, nor did it correlate with latency to first contact with novel objects. The probability of contact with novel objects and latency to first contact with novel objects did not differ based on initial eye with which novel objects were seen, although among calves that showed an avoidance response, they were less likely to have used the right eye for viewing than either the left eye or both eyes just before the locomotor response. Overall, fear responses in calves during repeated novel object tests were inconsistent, and this inconsistency was not clearly attributable to the random presentation of objects to different visual fields. This may suggest either a lack of cerebral lateralisation in fear processing at this age or that alternative methods may be needed to more accurately assess it.

AB  - Ostrinia furnacalis is a disreputable herbivorous pest that poses a serious threat to corn crops. Phototaxis in nocturnal moths plays a crucial role in pest prediction and control. Insect opsins are the main component of insect visual system. However, the inherent molecular relationship between phototactic behaviour and vision of insects remains a mystery. Herein, three opsin genes were identified and cloned from O. furnacalis (OfLW, OfBL, and OfUV). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that all opsin genes had visual pigment (opsin) retinal binding sites and seven transmembrane domains. Opsin genes were distributed across different developmental stages and tissues, with the highest expression in adults and compound eyes. The photoperiod-induced assay elucidated that the expression of three opsin genes in females were higher during daytime, while their expression in males tended to increase at night. Under the sustained darkness, the expression of opsin genes increased circularly, although the increasing amplitude in males was lower when compared with females. Furthermore, the expression of OfLW, OfBL, and OfUV was upregulated under green, blue, and ultraviolet light, respectively. The results of RNA interference showed that the knockout of opsin genes decreased the phototaxis efficiency of female and male moths to green, blue, and ultraviolet light. Our results reveal that opsin genes are involved in the phototactic behaviour of moths, providing a potential target gene for pest control and a basis for further investigation on the phototactic behaviour of Lepidoptera insects.

AB  - Introduction. Zinc is one of the essential micronutrients for living organisms; so, the right performance of several enzymes depends on this element. This micronutrient is a regulator of phytohormones and chlorophyll synthesis, and also, it is an essential element for the carbohydrates' metabolisms in plants. Considering the relatively high solubility of ZnO-NPs and also the ability of plants to uptake and accumulate these nanoparticles in their biomass, ZnO-NPs can be used as an effective nanofertilizer for plants' growth. Methods. In the present study, zinc oxide nanoparticles synthesized using chemical method and the effect of ZnO-NPs (as a nanofertilizer) on seeds' germination, seedlings' rootlet, seedlings' plumule, and seedling's vigour index in two oilseed crops from the Brassicaceae family, including Brassica napus L. and Camelina sativa, were investigated. After treating the seeds with different concentrations of ZnO-NPs (from 0.1 to 1000 ppm) for 6 days, the germination percentage (GP) of each treatment was measured. Results. The results indicated an increase in GP for both plants treated with 10 ppm ZnO-NPs. For B. napus, the maximum GP occurred in treated seeds with 5 ppm ZnO-NPs which showed a 30% increase of GP compared with the control condition. For Camelina, this maximum GP was observed in 0.1 ppm concentration of ZnO-NPs which showed a 15% increase compared with the control condition. After the germination test, germinated seedlings were planted in Hoagland hydroponic solution and treated with ZnO-NPs again for a week. For both species, treatment with ZnO-NPs showed a great effect on rootlet growth, while the effects of these treatments on plumule were negligible. The maximum rootlet length was observed in treated B. napus seedlings with 5 ppm ZnO-NPs which showed a 32% increase in this parameter compared with the control condition. In contrast, the high concentrations of ZnO-NPs showed toxic effects on B. napus seedlings' rootlets. Results showed a 41% decrease in B. napus seedlings treated with 50 ppm ZnO-NPs compared with control seedlings. Similar results were observed in the treated seedlings of Camelina. For Camelina seedlings treated with 1 ppm ZnO-NPs, 15% increase in rootlets' length was observed, while treated Camelina seedlings with 50 ppm ZnO-NPs showed a 68% decrease in rootlet length compared with the control condition. The results of this study indicated the potential of using ZnO-NPs as nanofertilizer for B. napus and Camelina in low concentrations (lower than 10 ppm). In addition, these results suggest the toxicity effects of these nanoparticles on both species in concentrations higher than 50 ppm.

AB  - All organisms emit odour, providing 'open-access' olfactory information for any receiver with the right sensory apparatus. Characterizing open-access information emitted by groups of organisms, such as plant species, provides the means to answer significant questions about ecological interactions and their evolution. We present a new conceptual framework defining information reliability and a practical method to characterize and recover information from amongst olfactory noise. We quantified odour emissions from two tree species, one focal group and one outgroup, to demonstrate our approach using two new R statistical functions. We explore the consequences of relaxing or tightening criteria defining information and, from thousands of odour combinations, we identify and quantify those few likely to be informative. Our method uses core general principles characterizing information while incorporating knowledge of how receivers detect and discriminate odours. We can now map information in consistency-precision reliability space, explore the concept of information, and test information-noise boundaries, and between cues and signals.

AB  - An intense bloom of Asterionellopsis glacialis (Family: Flagilariaceae; Class: Bacil-lariophyceae; Phylum: Ochrophyta) was observed in the near-shore waters at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu. Proliferation was supported by the favorable temperature, salinity, and nutrient levels in the coastal waters prevailing in the post-northeast monsoon period. BIOENV analysis and PCA confirmed salinity and nitrate as the key environmental factors responsible for the A. glacialis abundance. Cluster analysis further supported the distinct state of coastal water dur-ing the bloom with respect to physicochemical properties. The bloom period was floristically and faunistically richer than the pre-and post-bloom periods. The cluster and nMDS analysis confirmed the effects of bloom on plankton dynamics in the near-shore waters at Kalpakkam. The dominance of meroplankters especially, Cirripedia nauplii and Bivalvia larvae over Cope-poda during the peak bloom period, was a significant result of the study. PCA ordination plot for the quantitative aspects of phytoplankton and zooplankton groups further supported the above observation. Among Copepoda, Cyclopoida and Poecilostomatoida (mostly carnivorous) exceeded the Calanoida (mostly herbivorous) during the peak bloom period unlike the reverse trend observed during other periods. Fish eggs and larvae were available in substantial numbers during the bloom which indicated their proliferation in the presence of the blooming diatom standing stock as the food material.

AB  - Artificial lakes (reservoirs) accumulate sediment and organic carbon (OC) over time. We investigated sedimentation processes in a dryland reservoir and informed OC burial and potential preservation. Our study site, Elephant Butte Reservoir on the Rio Grande, New Mexico, USA receives inflows from sediment-laden, monsoon-driven flash floods. Using field data, historical reservoir sedimentation survey and river flux (water, sediment, and OC) data, we estimated sedimentation and carbon burial volumes and rates within the delta, reservoir bottom, and whole reservoir during wet (1980-1988) and dry (2007-2017/2019) climate periods. During severe drought (2021-2022), we measured suspended sediment and OC concentrations for characteristic (seasonal) phases of the river hydrograph, monitored delta sedimentation patterns, and observed river outflow plume dynamics. Measured suspended sediment concentrations (mean = 8,818 mg/l, median = 1,769 mg/l) frequently surpassed the hyperpycnal plume threshold (1,000 mg/l), especially during flash floods (maximum = 46,718 mg/l). River total OC content averaged 5.2% +/- 12.2%, increasing to 6.3% +/- 10.3% in the summer. Whole reservoir linear sedimentation averaged 3.1 +/- 1.4% (dry)-4.0 +/- 4.2% (wet) cm/yr, with higher rates on the reservoir bottom (5.0 +/- 0.3% cm/yr) than the delta (0.8 +/- 1.1% cm/yr) during drought from hyperpycnal plume deposition, potentially preserving OC. Comparisons of OC content in suspension and deposited OC in the delta indicate partial OC preservation. Estimated whole reservoir OC burial is higher during dry than wet conditions (391 +/- 43.6% vs. 82.4 +/- 56.4% g C/m2yr), suggesting that dryland reservoirs may be efficient carbon sinks during these periods.

AB  - The most important disease for plants of the Aesculus genus is leaf spot caused by the leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae), which limits the use of Aesculus in landscaping in urban areas. The leaf miner C. ohridella is an insect widely spread in most European countries. The study was carried out in an urban area with six species of the genus Aesculus L. (& Acy;e. hippocastanum L., Ae. pavia L., Ae. parviflora Walt., Ae. flava Sol., Ae. glabra Willd. and hybrid Aesculus x carnea). The article reflects the results of research on the influence of the leaf miner C. ohridella on the peculiarities of changes in the chemical composition of chestnut leaf extracts. The component composition of the leaves of different chestnut species was determined using chromatographic analysis. The study shows the results of the phytochemical screening of the leaves of different species from genus Aesculus, uninfested and infested with C. ohridella. A total of 186 chemical components were identified from the leaf extracts of Aesculus plants with six main groups of chemical components - carbohydrates, polyphenols, steroids, hydrocarbons, fatty acids and miscellaneous. The carbohydrates group is represented in the leaves of all studied Aesculus species in the maximum degree. The obtained data demonstrate significant change in the number of all chemical components under the influence of C. ohridella. The studied species showed an increase in carbohydrates content with the influence of leaf miner C. ohridella, except for such species as Ae. flava and Ae. parviflora. The qualitative composition of polyphenolic compounds was species-specific. The analysis of the composition of extracts of uninfested leaves established that four components were contained in extracts of Ae. hippocastanum and Ae. pavia, but they were different in their composition. In comparison with the composition of polyphenols in leaves without damage and leaves infected with C. ordidella, the absence of (2R-trans)-catechine in extracts from infected leaves of Ae. hippocastanum and Ae. glabra was found. Using principal component analysis, it was established that Ae. glabra shows a clear separation between chemical composition of the infested and uninfested samples. We identified two components of a phenolic nature only in extracts of infested leaves of Ae. flava, (trimethylsilyl catechollactate tris(trimethylsilyl) ether and epigallocatechin (6TMS)), and quercetin was identified only in infected leaf extracts of Ae. glabra. These results can indicate a greater potential resistance of these Aesculus species to damage by the studied herbivory.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined the reproductive systems of threatened orchids to develop effective conservation strategies. However, the detrimental effects of seed predators on seed production are often overlooked. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the seed-parasitic fly Japanagromyza tokunagai on the seed production of the endangered orchid Cephalanthera falcata, based on observations from five locations over one year and from a single location over four years in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Our findings showed that J. tokunagai caused 100% capsule damage across all sites and years examined. Although some infested fruits still produced seeds in certain locations and years, the quantities were very low. Consequently, we observed a 99.1-100% reduction in seed production across all populations investigated. These results suggest that reduced seed production could limit generational turnover, potentially threatening the reproductive success and long-term survival of C. falcata, at least in the populations studied. This highlights the need to mitigate the negative impact of J. tokunagai on seed production in C. falcata. Combining artificial pollination with the bagging of individual inflorescences could be an effective approach, capable of increasing seed production by more than 100-fold. Given the fungal dependence and low germination rates of C. falcata, future work should also examine seedling recruitment to better understand the impacts of seed loss and improve estimates of long-term resilience.

AB  - Weeds in agricultural settings continually adapt to stresses from ecological and anthropogenic sources, in some cases leading to resistant populations. However, consequences of repeated sub-lethal exposure of these stressors on fitness and stress "memory" over generations remain poorly understood. We measured plant performance over a transgenerational experiment with Arabidopsis thaliana where plants were exposed to sub-lethal stress induced by the herbicides glyphosate or trifloxysulfuron, stresses from clipping or shading in either one (G1) or four successive generations (G1-G4), and control plants that never received stress. We found that fourth-generation (G4) plants that had been subjected to three generations of glyphosate or trifloxysulfuron stress produced higher post-stress biomass, seed weight, and rosette area as compared to that produced by plants that experienced stress only in the first generation (G1). By the same measure, clipping and shade were more influential on floral development time (shade) and seed weight (clipping) but did not show responsive phenotypes for vegetative metrics after multiple generations. Overall, we found that plants exhibited more rapid transgenerational vegetative "stress memory" to herbicides while reproductive plasticity was stressor dependent and similar between clipping/shade and anthropogenic stressors. Our study suggests that maternal plant stress memory aids next-generation plants to respond and survive better under the same stressors.
   We show differential transgenerational phenotypes to different stressors over four generations in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Buffalo bull sperm suffer more cryoinjuries due to lipid peroxidation of high structural polyunsaturated fatty acid contents than cattle sperm. Consequently, the post-thaw fertilization potential of buffalo bull sperm is compromised. Crocin is a carotenoid known for its antioxidant potential through scavenging reactive oxygen species. Objectives of the current study were to investigate the effect of crocin addition in the semen extender on post-thaw quality, fertility-associated gene expression and fertilization potential of buffalo bull sperm. Semen samples (n = 32) from four Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls were extended with tris-citric acid extender containing different concentrations of crocin (0 mM; control, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 mM). The extended semen was packed in 0.5 mL French straws (25 x 10(6) sperm/straw) and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Computer-assisted semen analysis, hypo-osmotic swelling test, normal apical ridge assay, Rhodamine 123, acridine orange, propidium iodide staining, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay were performed to assess sperm motility parameters, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA integrity, viability, and lipid peroxidation, respectively. Expression levels of sperm acrosome-associated SPACA3, DNA condensation-related PRM1, anti-apoptotic BCL2, pro-apoptotic BAX, and oxidative stress-associated ROMO1 genes were evaluated through qPCR. The fertility of semen doses containing the most potent concentration of crocin (based on optimum post-thaw semen quality) was compared with control during the breeding season. Buffaloes (n = 400; 200/group) were inseminated 24 h after the onset of oestrus and transrectally palpated for pregnancy at least 60 days post-insemination. Results revealed that 0.5 and 1 mM crocin improved sperm post-thaw total motility, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and viability, and 1 and 1.5 mM crocin enhanced catalase activity and reduced lipid peroxidation compared to control (p < .05). Moreover, 1 mM crocin improved sperm post-thaw progressive motility, kinematics, and DNA integrity, and 1.5 mM crocin enhanced plasma membrane integrity than control (p < .05). Expression levels of SPACA3, PRM1 and BCL2 genes were higher (p < .05) with 1 mM crocin compared to other groups. In contrast, no difference (p > .05) was noticed in expressions of BAX and ROMO1 genes among all groups. The fertility rate of semen doses containing the most potent concentration (1 mM) of crocin was higher (p = .0465) compared to control (56 +/- 0.03% vs. 46 +/- 0.04%, respectively).

AB  - Enteric methane (CH4) emissions from sheep contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. However, as already available for dairy and beef cattle, empirical models are needed to predict CH4 emissions from sheep for accounting purposes. The objectives of this study were to: 1) collate an intercontinental database of enteric CH4 emissions from individual sheep; 2) identify the key variables for predicting enteric sheep CH4 absolute production (g/d per animal) and yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)] and their respective relationships; and 3) develop and cross-validate global equations as well as the potential need for age-, diet-, or climatic regionspecific equations. The refined intercontinental database included 2,135 individual animal data from 13 countries. Linear CH4 prediction models were developed by incrementally adding variables. A universal CH4 production equation using only DMI led to a root mean square prediction error (RMSPE, % of observed mean) of 25.4% and an RMSPE-standard deviation ratio (RSR) of 0.69. Universal equations that, in addition to DMI, also included body weight (DMI + BW), and organic matter digestibility (DMI + OMD + BW) improved the prediction performance further (RSR, 0.62 and 0.60), whereas diet composition variables had negligible effects. These universal equations had lower prediction error than the extant IPCC 2019 equations. Developing age-specific models for adult sheep (>1-year-old) including DMI alone (RSR = 0.66) or in combination with rumen propionate molar proportion (for research of more refined purposes) substantially improved prediction performance (RSR = 0.57) on a smaller dataset. On the contrary, for young sheep (<1-year-old), the universal models could be applied, instead of age-specific models, if DMI and BW were included. Universal models showed similar prediction performances to the diet- and region-specific models. However, optimal prediction equations led to different regression coefficients (i.e. intercepts and slopes) for universal, age-specific, diet-specific, and regionspecific models with predictive implications. Equations for CH4 yield led to low prediction performances, with DMI being negatively and BW and OMD positively correlated with CH4 yield. In conclusion, predicting sheep CH4 production requires information on DMI and prediction accuracy will improve national and global inventories if separate equations for young and adult sheep are used with the additional variables BW, OMD and rumen propionate proportion. Appropriate universal equations can be used to predict CH4 production from sheep across different diets and climatic conditions.

AB  - PARL is a rhomboid membrane protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the metabolism and maintaining the homeostasis of mitochondria which provide important energy and material reserves for oocyte maturation. However, the impact of PARL on oocyte maturation remains poorly understood. Here, we elucidated the pivotal role of PARL in oocyte maturation through its regulatory effects on mitochondrial activity. Specifically, our findings revealed that inhibiting PARL expression by interfering with RNA transcription in oocytes led to a substantial decrease in the rate of first polar body extrusion and early development of parthenogenetically activated embryos. Moreover, PARL deficiency disrupted mitochondrial distribution and activity, leading to the accumulation of ROS, abnormal distribution of CGs and actin, increased tubulin acetylation modification, disturbed spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, ultimately caused DNA damage in porcine oocytes at the metaphase II stage. Intriguingly, PARL deficiency did not cause occurrence of apoptosis in oocytes. Furthermore, our study highlighted that PARL deficiency caused the aberrant expression of genes associated with oocyte maturation, particularly those genes associated with mitochondrial function and DNA integrity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the indispensable role of PARL in orchestrating porcine oocyte meiotic maturation though its modulation of mitochondrial activity.

AB  - The pursuit of structural designs that simultaneously exhibit exceptional mechanical performance, enhanced functionality, and reduced weight has been a challenge in the structural engineering field. Here, a series of novel biomimetic core rod structures inspired by the microarchitecture of mineralized fibrous bundles interconnecting dense bone plates in goat tibiae are introduced. Design principles for such structures are yielded through rigorous theoretical analysis, load-bearing tests, and wave propagation experiments. This study reveals that due to the core rods having the potential to confine vibration in the core layer, these novel biomimetic core rod structures show better vibroacoustic suppression ability. Furthermore, the cross-core rods have better bearing capacity and vibroacoustic suppression performance than the non-cross-core rods. Increasing material density and material damping can further reduce vibration transmission, especially at the resonance frequency. It is worth noting that the bearing capacity and the vibroacoustic suppression performance are mutually restricted to a certain extent, so it is necessary to weigh and adjust according to the actual requirements.

AB  - As a rare complication of liver injury and certain interventions, bile can enter the bloodstream depending on the pressure gradient, resulting in bilhemia. Its micro-rheological and hemodynamic effects are still unclear. We aimed to study these parameters in experimental bilhemia models. Under general anesthesia, via laparotomy, bile was obtained by gallbladder puncture from pigs and by choledochal duct cannulation from rats. In vitro, 1 mu L and 5 mu L of bile were mixed with 500 mu L of anticoagulated autologous blood. The systemic effect was also assessed (i.v. bile, 200 mu L/bwkg). Hemodynamic and hematological parameters were monitored, and red blood cell (RBC) deformability and aggregation were determined. RBC deformability significantly decreased with the increasing bile concentration in vitro (1 mu L: p = 0.033; 5 mu L: p < 0.001) in both species. The RBC aggregation index values were concomitantly worsened (1 <mu>L: p < 0.001; 5 <mu>L: p < 0.001). The mean arterial pressure and heart rate decreased by 15.2 +/- 6.9% and 4.6 +/- 2.1% in rats (in 10.6 +/- 2.6 s) and by 32.1 +/- 14% and 25.2 +/- 11.63% in pigs (in 48.3 +/- 18.9 s). Restoration of the values was observed in 45 +/- 9.5 s (rats) and 130 +/- 20 s (pigs). Bilhemia directly affected the hemodynamic parameters and caused micro-rheological deterioration. The magnitude and dynamics of the changes were different for the two species.

AB  - Simple Summary Over the past decades, the number of studies employing the pig brain as a model for neurochemical studies has dramatically increased. The key translational features of the pig brain are its size and similarities with the cortical and subcortical structures of other mammalian species; the brain seems to resemble a humans' from an anatomical and histological point of view. Here we focus on the motor cortex during development, describing its cytoarchitecture and distribution of neural cells expressing two calcium-binding proteins: parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR). PV and CR play an important role in the control of motor neuron output. The morphometric and immunohistochemical analysis of the present study revealed age-associated changes similar to those reported in the human motor cortex. These results confirm the pig brain is a valuable translational animal model during development. The pig has been increasingly used as a suitable animal model in translational neuroscience. However, several features of the fast-growing, immediately motor-competent cerebral cortex of this species have been adequately described. This study analyzes the cytoarchitecture of the primary motor cortex (M1) of newborn, young and adult pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus). Moreover, we investigated the distribution of the neural cells expressing the calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) (calretinin, CR; parvalbumin, PV) throughout M1. The primary motor cortex of newborn piglets was characterized by a dense neuronal arrangement that made the discrimination of the cell layers difficult, except for layer one. The absence of a clearly recognizable layer four, typical of the agranular cortex, was noted in young and adult pigs. The morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses revealed age-associated changes characterized by (1) thickness increase and neuronal density (number of cells/mm(2) of M1) reduction during the first year of life; (2) morphological changes of CR-immunoreactive neurons in the first months of life; (3) higher density of CR- and PV-immunopositive neurons in newborns when compared to young and adult pigs. Since most of the present findings match with those of the human M1, this study strengthens the growing evidence that the brain of the pig can be used as a potentially valuable translational animal model during growth and development.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles, ER bodies, participate in the defense against herbivores in Brassicaceae plants. ER bodies accumulate beta-glucosidases, which hydrolyze specialized thioglucosides known as glucosinolates to generate bioactive substances. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leaf ER (LER) bodies are formed in large pavement cells, which are found in the petioles, margins and blades of rosette leaves. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in establishing large pavement cells are unknown. Here, we show that the ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA MERISTEM L1 LAYER (ATML1) transcription factor regulates the formation of LER bodies in large pavement cells of rosette leaves. Overexpression of ATML1 enhanced the expression of LER body-related genes and the number of LER body-containing large pavement cells, whereas its knock-out resulted in opposite effects. ATML1 enhances endoreduplication and cell size through LOSS OF GIANT CELLS FROM ORGANS (LGO). Although the overexpression and knock-out of LGO affected the appearance of large pavement cells in Arabidopsis, the effect on LER body-related gene expression and LER body formation was weak. LER body-containing large pavement cells were also found in Eutrema salsugineum, another Brassicaceae species. Our results demonstrate that ATML1 establishes large pavement cells to induce LER body formation in Brassicaceae plants and thereby possibly contribute to the defense against herbivores.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal nutrition during gestation and lactation is essential for offspring's health. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of betaine hydrochloride addition to sow diets during gestation and lactation on suckling piglet's immunity and intestine microbiota composition. Forty Bama mini-pigs were randomly allocated into two groups and fed a basal diet (control group) and a basal diet supplemented with 3.50 kg ton-1 betaine hydrochloride (betaine group) from day 3 after mating to day 21 of lactation. After 21 days of the delivery, 12 suckling piglets from each group with similar body weight were selected for sample collection. RESULTS: The results showed that maternal betaine hydrochloride addition decreased (P < 0.05) the plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1., IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-. in suckling piglets. Furthermore, dietary betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets increased (P < 0.05) the villus height (VH) and VH to crypt depth ratio in the jejunum and ileum of suckling piglets. In the piglets' intestinal microbiota community, the relative abundances of Roseburia (P < 0.05) and Clostridium (P = 0.059) were lower in the betaine group compared to those in the control group. Moreover, betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets decreased the colonic tyramine (P = 0.091) and skatole (P = 0.070) concentrations in suckling piglets. CONCLUSION: Betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets enhanced the intestinal morphology, improved immunity, and altered intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets. These findings indicated that betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets during gestation and lactation will impact suckling piglets' health.

AB  - Floral stickiness is a rare trait with unknown function, but it is common in the mega-diverse Cape genus Erica (Ericaceae). This study investigated the role of stickiness measured as adhesive strength in Erica as protection against nectar robbing and its correlation with floral traits. We compared the incidence of nectar robbing in flowers of the same species with or without experimentally added stickiness, and amongst communities of co-occurring species with flowers differing in stickiness. Additionally, we tested the relationship between stickiness and pollination syndrome, corolla shape, corolla length and sepal-corolla ratio across the whole genus. Stickiness was correlated with lower floral damage rates within and between species, indicating it functions as an anti-nectar robbing trait. Across the genus Erica, stickiness is most strongly correlated with bird and long-proboscid fly pollination, presumably because of their larger nectar rewards. Stickiness was also correlated with floral traits that are often associated with high risk of being damaged by nectar robbers: narrow-mouthed corollas, long corollas and shorter sepals. These results show that corolla stickiness defends Erica flowers against nectar robbing and thereby potentially improves fitness.

AB  - Weaning stress damages the intestines and disrupts the intestinal barrier in piglets, which significantly impacts the pig farming industry's economy. We aimed to examine the effects of ShenQiGan extract (CAG) on intestinal barrier function and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms in stress-challenged weaned piglets. The experimental design involved 80 weaned piglets aged 28 days (with an average body weight of 7.78 +/- 0.074 kg) that were randomly allocated into four groups: Control, LCAG (0.1% CAG), MCAG (0.5% CAG), and HCAG (1.0% CAG). After a 28-day trial period, the growth performance and incidence of diarrhea in piglets were evaluated. CAG increased the average daily gain of weaned piglets, reduced the feed-to-gain ratio, and decreased the incidence of diarrhea. It significantly lowered serum inflammatory cytokine levels while elevating immunoglobulin levels. The supplement notably enhanced concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid. Furthermore, CAG demonstrated intestinal morphology restoration and upregulation of tight junction proteins and MUC2 protein expression in jejunum. At the mRNA level, it significantly upregulated the expression of Occludin, Claudin1, and MUC2 genes. CAG improves growth performance and mitigates diarrhea in weaned piglets by enhancing intestinal barrier integrity, modulating systemic inflammatory responses, elevating immunoglobulin levels, and promoting short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in the cecum.

AB  - ABS T R A C T The Lower Palaeolithic site of Cimitero di Atella is located in the Basilicata region (Southern Italy), about 10 km south of the extinct Monte Vulture volcano. The site was discovered in the early 1990s and was continuously excavated for nearly twenty years under the supervision of Professor E. Borzatti von Lo center dot wenstern (University of Florence). This open-air site contained a 5-m-thick fluvio-lacustrine sequence characterized by the occurrence of two main archaeological units with lithic industries and faunal remains. Based on the composition of the lithic assemblages, and in particular the presence of handaxes in the Lower unit, Borzatti von Lo center dot wenstern (et al., 1997) attributed the site to the Early Acheulean. Cimitero di Atella was interpreted as the result of various lake shore occupations linked to the exploitation of large mammals (Palaeoloxodon antiquus and Bison sp.) and the oppor-tunistic use of raw materials to produce simple small and large lithic tools (Borzatti von Lo center dot wenstern et al., 1997). The purpose of this paper is to present the last five years of research at the site. Geochronological, palae-ontological and palynological investigations have been conducted to shed light on the environmental and chronological context of the site and the associated human occupations levels. This essential step enables us to evaluate the nature and potential of archaeological data in order to place the results in a broader framework. The accurate study of the context and of the archaeological material of Cimitero di Atella enable us to rethink the crucial question of the emergence of the bifacial phenomenon in Europe.

   The aim of this study was to classify placental characteristics of Akkaraman, Morkaraman, Karayaka, Awassi, Malya, and Bafra native sheep breeds using the hierarchical clustering method. As a result, six breeds were separated into three clusters: the first cluster consisted of Bafra, Karayaka, and Awassi breeds; the second consisted of Akkaraman and Malya breeds; and the third cluster included only the Morkaraman breed.
   The aim of this study was to classify placental characteristics of Akkaraman, Morkaraman, Karayaka, Awassi, Malya, and Bafra sheep breeds using the hierarchical clustering method. In total, 240 individual data records were used as experimental material. Placental characteristics such as total cotyledon surface area, small and large cotyledon length, small cotyledon depth, etc. were used as explanatory variables to classify the breeds' characteristics. Hierarchical clustering was used with the nearest neighbour method with Euclidean distance in order to classify the sheep breeds' variations. As a result, six breeds were separated into three clusters: the first cluster consisted of Bafra, Karayaka, and Awassi breeds; the second consisted of Akkaraman and Malya breeds; and the third cluster included only the Morkaraman breed. Bafra and Karayaka were pointed as the nearest breeds, with a similarity of 98.7% in terms of placental characteristics. The similarity rate of the Akkaraman and Malya breeds was at a level of 97.5%, whereas it was 96.8% for Bafra, Karayaka, and Awassi breeds. The similarity of Akkaraman, Karayaka, Awassi, Malya, and Bafra sheep breeds was estimated as 95.7%. The overall similarity was found to be at a level of 93.2% among sheep breeds. The outcomes of the study might be useful as a selection tool for reproductivity and can be used to select the breed to be reared.

AB  - Fungal metabolites are known to have potent and diverse properties such as antiviral, antidiabetic, antitumour, antioxidant, free radical scavenging, and antibacterial effects which can be utilized to treat diseases. In this study, we investigated the functional activity of stereumamide A (StA) derived from a culture broth of Trichaptum fuscoviolaceum during the in vitro fertilization (IVF) of pig oocytes, to determine its effects on sperm penetration. Oocytes matured in vitro were fertilized in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of StA (0-50 mu g/ml StA). When StA was directly added into the IVF medium, significantly lower fertilization rates were seen with the 20 or 50 mu g/ml StA (2.0-17.5%) treatments compared with those of 10 mu g/ml StA or the controls (60.9-62.3%), whereas StA had no influence on the survival of oocytes and spermatozoa throughout the IVF process. For evaluating the control of sperm entry, mature oocytes were pre-incubated in a medium containing 20 mu g/ml StA for 1 h, and then IVF was subsequently performed. The incidence of polyspermy was significantly reduced when oocytes were pre-incubated with StA (15.0% vs. 50.4-57.5% in controls). In conclusion, sperm penetration was inhibited in the medium in the presence of StA during IVF, while StA did not affect sperm motility and fertility competence. Fertilization was controlled when mature oocytes were incubated with StA prior to IVF, suggesting the possible use of the fungal metabolite in assisted reproductive technology for humans and animals.

AB  - Repairing and replacing of tumor tissues have been grown due to the genetic changes and environmental factors. Conventional cancer therapies apply the systemic approaches for delivery of anticancer agents in which normal and cancer cells are not discriminated. Therefore, the risk of cancer recurrence in the resection site increases. In this paper, we studied a graphene reinforced gelatin hydrogel for tissue engineering and local controlled release of chemotherapeutic agents. Protein-integrated graphene (PIG) synthesized by ultrasonic-supported technique was incorporated into gelatin matrix, where the swelling ratio of hydrogels decreased with increasing the PIG concentration. In hydrogels, doxoru-bicin (DOX) was released in a controlled and pH-sensitive manner and the release rate was controlled by PIG concentration. The effect of PIG on the controlled release system was detected in MCF-7 cell viability. Moreover, 3D tumor spheroid test studied the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell aggregation as an in vivo model. Generally, we introduced a novel hydrogel nanocomposite, which is a suitable candidate for post-surgery treatment and localized therapy.

AB  - Flesh flies comprise a large fly family distributed worldwide that has great importance for forensic entomology. A robust and updated checklist of Sarcophaginae flies recorded in Southern Brazil is presented, based on material collected in the Rio Grande do Sul state and on a literature review. The forensic importance (high, moderate, or none) of the recorded flesh flies for estimating the postmortem interval (PMI) or inferring cases of neglect was determined based on their ecological habits. A total of 2,831 specimens representing 38 taxa were collected from three studies. Oxysarcodexia was the most abundant and species-rich genus in all three studies. Dexosarcophaga carvalhoi (Lopes) was registered for the first time in Southern Brazil. The checklist for Southern Brazil comprises 91 species distributed in 19 genera, with Oxysarcodexia, Peckia, and Lepidodexia representing the richest genera. Considering the importance of species for PMI estimation, 10, 42, and 39 species were classified as having high, moderate, or no forensic relevance, respectively. Moreover, five myiasis-causing sarcophagine flies recorded in Southern Brazil were considered to have the potential to reveal cases of neglect or mistreatment. This study revealed that Microcerella halli (Engel) and Peckia (Euboettcheria) australis (Townsend) are the most important species for PMI estimation in Southern Brazil, as they are often found breeding in corpses in this region.

AB  - Domestication significantly altered the phenotypic and chemical traits of murtilla, notably reducing the emission of volatile compounds essential for plant-insect interactions. This reduction may affect the plant's natural defense mechanisms, influencing its interactions with herbivores and predators. Therefore, this study tests whether domestication reduces volatile emissions in murtilla, increasing aphid preference and decreasing lacewing attraction. We selected wild ancestors (19-1, 22-1, and 23-2) from a longterm Ugni molinae germplasm bank. Crosses between these wild ancestors generated four first-generation domesticated ecotypes, 10-1, 16-16, 17-4, and 66-2, used in this study. These first-generation domesticated ecotypes were six years old at the time of the study and were used for comparisons in volatile profile and insect interaction analyses. The olfactometric preference index (OPI) for lacewing larvae and aphids revealed that wild ancestors attracted more predators than domesticated plants. For example, Ecotype 19-1 had an OPI of 1.64 for larvae and 1.49 for aphids, while Ecotype 10-1 showed lower attraction (OPI of 1.01 for larvae and 1.00 for aphids). Gas chromatography analysis identified differences in volatile organic compounds, with wild ancestor ecotypes emitting higher levels of compounds such as 2-hexanone, 1,8-cineole, and alpha-caryophyllene. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering confirmed these chemical distinctions. In olfactometer assays, lacewing larvae preferred alpha-caryophyllene and 2,4-dimethyl acetophenone, while aphids favored 2-hexanone and 3-hexanol. In Y-tube assays, lacewing adults showed strong attraction to alpha-pinene and 2,4-dimethyl acetophenone, with preferences increasing with concentration. These results indicate that domestication altered the volatile murtilla profile, reducing its attractiveness to natural predators while increasing its susceptibility to herbivores, supporting the plant domestication defense theory.

AB  - Herbivorous animals that regularly consume tannin-rich food are known to secrete certain tannin-binding salivary proteins (TBSPs), especially proline-rich proteins and histidine-rich proteins, as an effective measure to counteract the antinutritive effects of dietary tannins. Due to their high binding capacity, TBSPs complex with tannins in the oral cavity, and thereby protect dietary proteins and digestive enzymes. Although the natural diet of great apes (Hominidae) is biased toward ripe fruits, analyses of food plants revealed that their natural diet contains considerable amounts of tannins, which is raising the question of possible counter-measures to cope with dietary tannins. In our study, we investigated the salivary amino acid profiles of zoo-housed Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo abelii, and compared their results with corresponding data from Homo sapiens. Individual saliva samples of 42 apes and 17 humans were collected and quantitated by amino acid analysis, using cation-exchange chromatography with postcolumn derivatization, following acid hydrolysis. We found species-specific differences in the salivary amino acid profiles with average total salivary protein concentration ranging from 308.8 mg/dL in Po. abelii to 1165.6 mg/dL in G. gorilla. Total salivary protein was consistently higher in ape than in human saliva samples (174 mg/dL). All apes had on average also higher relative proline levels than humans did. Histidine levels had the highest concentration in the samples from Po. abelii followed by P. paniscus. In all ape species, the high salivary concentrations of proline and histidine are considered to be indicative of high concentrations of TBSPs in hominids. Given that the species differences in salivary composition obtained in this study correspond with overall patterns of secondary compound content in the diet of wild populations, we assume that salivary composition is resilient to acute and long-lasting changes in diet composition in general and tannin content in particular.

AB  - There are now a growing number of observations on the transgenerational impact of paternal stress on various offspring functions without involving direct interaction between offspring and father. In the offspring of parents who suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been observed an increase in PTSD-like symptoms. In experiments where a chronically elevated level of corticosterone was created in male mice during the entire period of spermatogenesis, a decrease in the stress reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the offspring of both sexes was shown. However, PTSD in patients creates a reduced level of glucocorticoids in the blood, and there are no experimental data on the effect of modeling PTSD in fathers on the activity of HPA axis of the offspring. The current study examined the relative influences of PTSD-like status ("stress-restress" paradigm) and depression-like status ("learned helplessness" paradigm) in male rats before mating on the HPA axis activity of their adult offspring. In addition to HPA axis activity, the expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the offspring was analyzed by quantitative immunocytochemistry in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We demonstrated that in female offspring of fathers with a PTSD-like or depressive-like status there is a decrease in basal and stress activity of the HPA axis in response to 30-min immobilization, which was accompanied by an increase in GR expression in the hippocampus and the 2nd layer mPFC. A similar profile of HPA axis activity was found in male offspring of fathers with modeling of PTSD. However, in male offspring of fathers with a depression-like status, the sensitivity of HPA axis to feedback signals decreased and was accompanied by a decrease in GR expression in the hippocampus and the 2nd layer of mPFC. We concluded that the PTSD- or depression-like status of male rats during the period of spermatogenesis has a differential effect on HPA axis activity and GR expression in the brain of their male offspring.

AB  - The pig is an important animal model increasingly used for biomedical research, particularly in transplantation strategies involving xenotransplantation or the development of human organs in pig for exotransplantation. Pigs, however, are less characterized than other animal models. In this study, we produced wildtype (WT) pig embryos via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology and compared them to skeletal muscle null embryos (lacking MYF5/MYOD/MYF6) at embryonic day 41, 62, and 90, critical stages of porcine myogenesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological analyses revealed progressive development of skeletal muscle in WT embryos but not in null embryos whereas development of viscera progressed equally in both groups. Molecular analyses highlighted dynamic changes in myogenic gene expression and myofiber formation, demonstrating an organized progression of myogenesis in WT embryos. Morphologically, the null embryos exhibited abnormalities, including marked edema and underdeveloped limbs. MRI revealed severe skeletal abnormalities, including the absence of ribs, sternum, and associated vertebral malformations. In addition, histological analysis confirmed the complete lack of myofiber formation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the absence of myogenic stem cells and muscle differentiation, and RNA sequencing demonstrated that the skeletal muscle development process was entirely disrupted in null embryos. Additionally, analysis of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the null embryos revealed that functional NMJ formation was absent, consistent with the lack of skeletal muscle formation. Importantly, these defects culminated in embryonic lethality after day 62 in the null embryos. We determined that the myogenic regulatory gene cascade is crucial for porcine embryo development and viability. The deletion of skeletal muscle is essential for the creating a vacant niche to allow for complementation of null porcine embryos with human induced pluripotent stem cells. Characterization of this skeletal muscle null pig model provide an important platform for engineering humanized muscle in gene-edited pigs.

AB  - In brief GATA3 is a transcription factor exclusively expressed by the trophectoderm. In this paper, we demonstrate that although GATA3 ablation is dispensable for trophectoderm specification and blastocyst formation in sheep, its ablation negatively affects epiblast survival during post-hatching development, making the first such observation in non-rodent mammals.Abstract Early embryo mortality represents a major challenge in livestock production, leading to significant economic losses. However, the molecular determinants underpinning early embryo development in these species remain poorly understood. GATA3 is a key transcription factor exclusively expressed by the trophectoderm (TE) in mammalian embryos. Although its ablation does not impede trophectoderm differentiation or blastocyst formation in mice, it is lethal at later developmental stages. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of GATA3 in ovine pre- and post-hatching development in vitro as well as during conceptus elongation in vivo. By generating GATA3 knockout (KO) embryos, we confirmed that GATA3 is dispensable for TE specification and blastocyst formation in ovine. GATA3 ablation did not impact developmental rates or TE development at post-hatching stages developed in vitro but it significantly reduced epiblast survival. Following embryo transfers to evaluate the effect of GATA3 ablation at later stages, the development of extraembryonic membranes (TE and hypoblast) during conceptus elongation was unaffected by GATA3 loss. However, a significantly reduced proportion of conceptuses developed an embryonic disc after GATA3 ablation. These findings indicate that GATA3 may play a previously unrecognised role in supporting epiblast development beyond the blastocyst stage in ovine.

AB  - Simple Summary There is a need to explore alternative feed ingredients to reduce feed costs in the context of international maize price fluctuation. Rice is a staple cereal grain for human consumption. Currently, the self-sufficiency rate for rice is close to 100% in China. Due to the high yield production and poor taste quality, there is a serious backlog of early indica rice in China, especially in the southern rice-producing provinces. Thus, rice may have the potential to be used as an alternative energy source for pigs in the context of international maize price fluctuation. As a result of evaluating the effects of replacing corn with paddy rice in pig diets, using paddy rice in swine diets at up to 15% for growing pigs, 20% for early-finishing pigs, and 30% for late-finishing pigs did not cause adverse impacts on growth performance. Therefore, paddy rice can be evaluated as a valuable feed ingredient for swine diets during the growing-finishing period, if favorably priced.Abstract Three experiments were conducted to evaluate paddy rice as an alternative energy feedstuff in low-protein diets for pigs. In Experiment 1, a total of 400 growing pigs (20.68 +/- 0.29 kg initial bodyweight), were randomly allocated four dietary treatments with 0, 10, 15, and 20% paddy rice for 30 days. Feeding 10% or 15% paddy rice had no adverse impacts on average daily gain (ADG) and feed to gain ratio (F:G), while the inclusion of 20% rice in diets significantly influenced the growth performance of pigs. In Experiment 2, 364 early-finishing pigs (42.25 +/- 0.47 kg) were divided into four treatments with 0, 15, 20, and 25% paddy rice for 35 days. Feeding 15% or 20% paddy rice had no negative consequences on growth performance, while pigs fed with 25% rice had the lowest ADG and the greatest F:G. In Experiment 3, 364 late-finishing pigs (79.52 +/- 1.28 kg) were divided into four treatments with 0, 20, 25, and 30% paddy rice for 60 days. Paddy rice can be included at up to 30% in diets without compromising growth performance, while feeding with 25% rice significantly improved the performance for pigs compared with the corn-fed control.

AB  - Simple Summary: In the last years, many domesticated and wild animal species, as well as local and transboundary breeds, have been threatened with genetic depletion and extinction. The application of conservation strategies to sheep breeds is necessary to safeguard the productive characteristics but also the historical and cultural value that they exert on their territory and inhabitants. Despite many advances that have been made in gamete cryopreservation, in vitro embryo production (IVEP) and juvenile in vitro production (JIVET), the efficiency of these technologies is still low, and the application is restricted in the ovine species. In the present study, a high concentration-rapid exposure (HC-RE) and a low concentration-slow exposure (LC-SE) vitrification protocol, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene glycol (EG) as permeating cryoprotectants (CPAs), were applied to pre-pubertal lamb immature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) and evaluated on nuclear and cytoplasmic parameters after in vitro maturation (IVM). Slightly more encouraging results were observed with the LC-SE vitrification protocol, leading to the hypothesis that low CPA concentrations in association with prolonged exposure times could be more promising to pursue in order to improve pre-pubertal lamb immature COC vitrification. Oocyte vitrification allows for the storing of endangered breed female gametes. Cryoprotectant (CPA) concentration and exposure time should ensure cell protection with minimal toxicity. In the present study, a high concentration-rapid exposure (HC-RE) and a low concentration-slow exposure (LC-SE) vitrification protocol, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene glycol (EG) as permeating CPAs, were evaluated on meiotic competence and bioenergetic-oxidative status of pre-pubertal lamb immature COCs after in vitro maturation (IVM). For each protocol, COCs vitrified through a traditional protocol and fresh ones were used as controls. Both protocols allowed COC morphology preservation after vitrification-warming (V-W) and cumulus expansion after IVM. The maturation rate (7% and 14%) was comparable to the vitrified control (13% and 21%) but not satisfactory compared to fresh ones (58% and 64%; p < 0.001). The rate of mature oocytes displaying a perinuclear/subcortical (P/S) mitochondrial distribution pattern, an index of cytoplasmic maturity, was comparable between vitrified and fresh oocytes. The LC-SE vitrification protocol did not affect quantitative bioenergetic-oxidative parameters compared to both controls whereas HC-RE protocol significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, indicating cell viability loss. In conclusion, to improve pre-pubertal lamb immature COC vitrification, the combination of low CPA concentrations with prolonged exposure time could be more promising to investigate further.

AB  - Neuropathic pain arises from damage or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system and manifests itself in a wide variety of sensory symptoms and cognitive disorders. Many studies demonstrate the role of neuropathic pain-induced neuroinflammation in behavioral disorders. For effective neuropathic pain treatment, an integrative approach is required, which simultaneously affects several links of pathogenesis. One promising candidate for this role is synaptamide (N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine), which is an endogenous metabolite of docosahexaenoic acid. In this study, we investigated the activity of synaptamide on mice behavior and hippocampal plasticity in neuropathic pain induced by spared nerve injury (SNI). We found a beneficial effect of synaptamide on the thermal allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia dynamics. Synaptamide prevented working and long-term memory impairment. These results are probably based on the supportive effect of synaptamide on SNI-impaired hippocampal plasticity. Nerve ligation caused microglia activation predominantly in the contralateral hippocampus, while synaptamide inhibited this effect. The treatment reversed dendritic tree degeneration, dendritic spines density reduction on CA1-pyramidal neurons, neurogenesis deterioration, and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment. In addition, synaptamide inhibits changes in the glutamatergic receptor expression. Thus, synaptamide has a beneficial effect on hippocampal functioning, including synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent cognitive processes in neuropathic pain.

AB  - Pollution by heavy metals is a threat to public health because of the adverse effects on multiple organ systems including the brain. Here, we used the African giant rat (AGR) as a novel sentinel host to assess the effect of heavy metal accumulation and consequential neuropathology upon the brain. For this study, AGR were collected from distinct geographical regions of Nigeria: the rain forest region of south-west Nigeria (Ibadan), the central north of Nigeria (Abuja), and in oil-polluted areas of south Nigeria (Port-Harcourt). We found that zinc, copper, and iron were the major heavy metals that accumulated in the brain and serum of sentinel AGR, with the level of iron highest in animals from Port-Harcourt and least in animals from Abuja. Brain pathology, determined by immunohistochemistry markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, was most severe in animals from Port Harcourt followed by those from Abuja and those from Ibadan were the least affected. The brain pathologies were characterized by elevated brain advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels, neuronal depletion in the prefrontal cortex, severe reactive astrogliosis in the hippocampus and cerebellar white matter, demyelination in the subcortical white matter and cerebellar white matter, and tauopathies. Selective vulnerabilities of different brain regions to heavy metal pollution in the AGR collected from the different regions of the country were evident. In conclusion, we propose that neuropathologies associated with redox dyshomeostasis because of environmental pollution may be localized and contextual, even in a heavily polluted environment. This novel study also highlights African giant rats as suitable epidemiological sentinels for use in ecotoxicological studies.

AB  - The parvorder Rhynchopthirina contains three currently recognised species of lice that parasitize elephants (both African savanna elephant Loxodonta africana and Asian elephant Elephas maximus), desert warthogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) and Red River hogs (Potamochoerus porcus), respectively. The Asian elephant lice and the African savanna elephant lice are currently treated as the same species, Haematomyzus elephantis (Piaget, 1869), based on morphology despite the fact that their hosts diverged 8.4 million years ago. In the current study, we sequenced 23 mitochondrial (mt) genes of African savanna elephant lice collected in South Africa and analysed the sequence divergence between African savanna elephant lice and previously sequenced Asian elephant lice. Sequence comparisons revealed >23% divergence for the 23 mt genes as a whole and similar to 17% divergence for cox1 gene between African savanna and Asian elephant lice, which were far higher than the divergence expected within a species. Furthermore, the mt gene sequence divergences between these lice are 3.76-4.6 times higher than that between their hosts, the African savanna and Asian elephants, which are expected for the co-divergence and co-evolution between lice and their elephant hosts. We conclude that (1) H. elephantis (Piaget, 1869) contains cryptic species and (2) African savanna and Asian elephant lice are different species genetically that may have co-diverged and co-evolved with their hosts.

AB  - Simple Summary Selenium Auricularia cornea culture (SAC) is a dried product via full fermentation, containing organic-Se, Auricularia cornea (AC) mycelium, and various metabolites of AC. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether SAC could effectively improve the health, growth, meat quality, and oxidative stability of meat in growing-finishing pigs. Currently, dietary SAC supplementation positively impacts growth performance and oxidative stability of fresh meat. Selenium Auricularia cornea culture (SAC) is a new source of organic selenium. Two experiments were conducted to determine the available energy of SAC fed to pigs and to evaluate the effects of dietary SAC supplementation on growth performance, serum biochemical profiles, fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA), meat quality, tissue selenium concentration, and oxidative stability of fresh meat in growing-finishing pigs. In Experiment (Exp.) 1, 12 barrows with average body weight (BW) of 42.40 +/- 5.30 kg were randomly allotted to two groups and fed the basal diet and SAC-supplemented diet, individually. In Exp. 2, 96 growing-finishing pigs (BW: 91.96 +/- 7.55 kg) were grouped into four dietary treatments; each treatment contained six replicates with four pigs per replicate. The four treatments fed a control diet and three experimental diets supplemented with 0.6%, 1.2%, and 2.4% SAC, respectively. The trial lasted for 45 days. The results revealed that digestible energy (DE) of SAC was 11.21 MJ/kg. The average daily gain (ADG) was improved in pigs fed 1.2% and 2.4% SAC during day 24 to 45 and the overall period. Dietary 1.2% and 2.4% SAC supplementation had a lower F/G (p < 0.05) than the control diet during different stages. Dietary SAC supplementation increased fecal butyrate contents (p < 0.05), and pigs fed 1.2% and 2.4% SAC diets had a higher MCT1 mRNA expression (p = 0.04) in the colon. Pigs fed 2.4% SAC had higher GSH-Px contents (p < 0.05) in serum, liver, and longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) than those in the control group. The 2.4% SAC-supplemented group revealed a higher Se content (p < 0.05) in LDM and a lower MDA concentration (p < 0.05) in fresh meat during the simulated retail display on day six. In conclusion, this study suggested that SAC was more effective in improving growth, enhancing the antioxidant status, depositing Se in muscle, and increasing meat oxidative stability of pigs.

AB  - Volatiles are important 'infochemicals' that play a crucial role in structuring life on our planet, fulfilling diverse functions in natural and artificial systems. Algae contribute significant quantities to the global budget of volatiles, but the ecological roles of aquatic volatiles are not well understood. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of volatile compounds from freshwater and marine microalgae and marine macroalgae, with a focus on their ecological roles. We highlight the multiple reported functions of biogenic volatiles, ranging from intraspecific communication for reproduction, intra-bloom signalling and antioxidant functions, to various interspecific signal exchanges that may allow herbivores to locate them and function in defence against competitors and predators. Beyond reviewing our current understanding, we specifically highlight major knowledge gaps and emerging questions for algal volatile research. These novel perspectives have the potential to improve our understanding of aquatic ecosystems and thus need to be addressed in future research. Filling these gaps and addressing these questions will facilitate humanity's efforts to exploit aquatic volatiles in various applications.

AB  - c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun in response to stress stimuli and contributes to both hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory processing in mammals. Object recognition memory (ORM) is essential for remembering facts and events. In rodents, ORM consolidation and reconsolidation require a functional hippocampus. However, the possible involvement of hippocampal JNK on ORM processing has not yet been studied. Here we show that when injected into dorsal CA1 5 min, but not 6 h, after training adult male rats in the novel object recognition learning task, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 impaired ORM for at least 7 days without affecting exploratory activity, short-term ORM retention, or the functional integrity of the hippocampus. SP600125 did not hinder ORM retention when given in CA1 after a memory reactivation session carried out 24 h post-training in the presence of the same two objects presented during the training session, but caused time-dependent amnesia when one of the objects presented at training was replaced by a different but behaviorally equivalent novel one. Taken together, our results indicate that hippocampal JNK activity is necessary for ORM consolidation and reconsolidation but not for ORM recall or short-term retention.

AB  - Featured Application Introduction of lactic acid solution treatment of game meat carcasses as a relevant critical control point (CCP) in the HACCP plan of game handling establishment, according to EC regulations. Solutions of lactic acid 2% and aromatic vinegar were investigated for microbial load reduction on the surfaces of wild boar carcasses. The animals were hunted and processed according to production specifications to obtain the best hygiene for carcasses. The solutions were sprayed on carcass surfaces after skinning, and sites of 5 x 5 cm were sampled 2 h and 48 h post-treatment, with the carcasses under refrigeration conditions. The values of the microbial loads were lower for lactic-acid-treated sites, compared with control, after both 2 and 48 h. Nonetheless, the differences in the microbial loads were only higher than 1 Log/CFU 25 cm(2) for the aerobic colony count. The aromatic vinegar resulted in lower values than in controls only after 48 h for the aerobic colony count, Staphylococcus count, and Lactobacillus count, with values always below 1 Log/CFU 25 cm(2). The implementation of a lactic acid solution could represent a valuable strategy to reduce microbial growth on wild boar carcasses, thus becoming a relevant critical control point in this peculiar and niche meat production process.

AB  - Although often referred to as a hunger hormone, recent evidence highlights a neuroprotective function of acylated ghrelin (AG) and a substantial role in the regulation of declarative and aversive memories as well as fear behavior. As such, in this review, we i) evaluate what specific stages and forms of memory, as well as which respective brain areas are affected by acylated ghrelin, ii) illustrate the plasticity-associated signaling pathways of AG in the hippocampus, also involving memory resolution-enhancing neurogenesis, iii) elucidate how the peptide modulates neurotransmitter systems (glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, serotonin), iV) clarify the role of AG in conditioned taste aversion, novelty learning and the formation of spatial, recognition, auditory fear, contextual fear and passive avoidance memories in the hippocampus and amygdala as well as V) solve the mystery behind AG, its impact on the 5-HT system, the recently established link to post-traumatic stress disorder and the either fear-suppressing or fear-potentiating effects under neutral and acutely stressed conditions or chronic stress, respectively.

AB  - Plant yield and productivity are being impacted significantly by global climate change. Since water scarcity is one of the main risks to agriculture's future, developing plants that can withstand water stress is crucial. The peach is an essential fruit crop for examining how plants respond to drought stress, which lowers crop performance through yield and quality losses. Melatonin, a versatile, beneficial stress-relieving hormone, can be used to alter how plants respond to environmental stresses. The current investigation examined how melatonin may improve early peach seedlings' resistance to drought stress. Our findings revealed a significant decrease in plant biomass and photosynthetic activity and increased oxidative damage under drought stress. Melatonin application promotes plant development and reduces oxidative damage by increasing photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll contents. Melatonin also increases soluble sugars and proline contents. Furthermore, an increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) was also recorded in peach seedlings. According to the results of our investigation, melatonin applied at a concentration of 100 mu M had the highest effect on increasing plant survival under drought stress and contributed to the development of a practical approach for peaches under drought stress conditions.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of oil quality and trace mineral source on the growth performance, antioxidant activity, and meat quality of growing-finishing pigs. A total of 180 crossbred pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Large White [64.4 +/- 1.95]) were randomly allocated five dietary treatments based on body weight (BW) and sex in a 30 d trial. Pigs were fed five diets: (i) fresh soy oil + inorganic trace minerals (ITMs) + inorganic selenium (FISI), (ii) oxidized soy oil + ITMs + inorganic selenium (OISI), (iii) fresh soy oil + ITMs + selenium yeast (FISY), (iv) oxidized soy oil + ITMs + selenium yeast (OISY), and (v) oxidized soy oil + organic trace minerals (OTMs) + selenium yeast (OOSY). Each dietary treatment included six replicates and six pigs per replicate (three barrows and three gilts). Feeding OISI resulted in lower average daily gain (ADG) and dressing percentage (p < 0.05). The OOSY group had a higher dressing percentage and activities of serum CAT and GSH-Px in growing-finishing pigs (p < 0.05). In addition, the relative abundance of Campylobacterota in the colonic digesta varied with the quality of soy oil and source of trace minerals (p < 0.05), but no significant differences in short-chain fatty acid concentrations were observed among all dietary groups. In conclusion, adding oxidized soy oil to the diet negatively impacted the ADG and dressing percentage of growing-finishing pigs, and replacing ITMs with OTMs and SY alleviated these negative impacts. A combination of OTMs and SY can support antioxidant capacity to mitigate the negative impacts of oxidized oil on the growth performance and dressing percentage of growing-finishing pigs.

AB  - In the global pig farming industry, the decrease in growth rate of fattening pigs during hot seasons is a common and challenging issue. Especially in hot and humid environments, pigs are prone to heat stress, which can even lead to death in severe cases, causing significant economic losses to the farming industry. Therefore, timely detection of heat stress and taking appropriate measures is of great importance for saving the pigs. The ASPPYOLOv5 model for pig heat stress facial expression recognition enhances the feature extraction capability by incorporating coordinated attention mechanisms. The CReToNeXt module is used to improve feature extraction and fusion, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity and performance. The ASPP module better adapts to the multi-scale features of pig heat stress expressions, improves the network's perception of differentscale expression features, and enhances the model's recognition ability for pig heat stress expressions. The mean Average Precision(mAP) reached 93.2 %, representing a 7 % improvement compared to the YOLOv5s model. It also outperformed the Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 models by achieving a remarkable 47.7 % and 48.8 % increase, respectively, in mAP. This model can be applied to a pig farm's heat stress unmanned and contactless real-time monitoring system, enabling timely warning for heat stress.

AB  - Simple Summary In the Republic of Serbia, pig selection in recent decades has been based on genetic improvement of growth and carcass quality traits. Genetic improvement of reproductive traits of pigs was based on the so-called phenotypic selection. The introduction of modern information systems and the availability larger dataset have opened the possibility to perform genetic estimation of reproductive traits within the main breeding programme of the Republic of Serbia. Using the methods of gene flow and connectedness evaluation, our study investigated the possibility of improving the reliability of estimating the breeding value of reproductive traits in highly productive sows. We believe that these methods could lead to a systematic improvement of the genetic value of reproductive traits in sows. Thus far, none of the methods for estimating the degree of connectedness between herds in pigs has been used in the preparation of the National Breeding Programme of the Republic of Serbia. This study investigated the influence of the degree of connectedness on the reliability of the estimated breeding values (EBVs). The focal trait in the study was the number of piglets born alive (NBA) from sows of the highly prolific Large White and Landrace sows. An analysis included total of 58,043 farrowing's during the 2008-2020 period. BLUP procedure was used to estimate the breeding values for NBA for the three herds separately and after merging all three herds into one herd. The model for EBV estimation included the following fixed factors: parity, genotype, seasons, litter sire, herds, sow age at farrowing, weaning-conception interval, length of previous lactation, and the following random effects: common litter environment, permanent litter environment, and direct additive genetic effect of animal. Heritability values for NBA ranged from 0.048 to 0.097, depending on the data included in the analysis. The connectedness between herds was analysed using the connectedness rating (CR) and the gene flow (GF) methods. CR among the observed herds ranged from 0.245 to 0.994%, depending on the data included. The exchange of genetic material between all three herds was determined using GF method. The high degree of connectedness determined by the CR and GF method had a strong effect on EBV reliability. The average EBV reliability ranged from 0.520 to 0.867, depending on the data included. The increase in average reliability was observed in both cases when the data were added, both in the analysis of average reliability for purebred animals and when crossbreeds were added, where an increase in this value was also observed. The increase in average EBV reliability is a consequence of the greater amount of information included in the joint evaluation. In conclusion, we believe that our research will improve EBV reliability and help in further selection work in the Republic of Serbia.

AB  - Sample size sufficiency is a critical consideration for estimating resource selection functions (RSFs) from GPS-based animal telemetry. Cited thresholds for sufficiency include a number of captured animals M >= 30 and as many relocations per animal N as possible. These thresholds render many RSF-based studies misleading if large sample sizes were truly insufficient, or unpublishable if small sample sizes were sufficient but failed to meet reviewer expectations. We provide the first comprehensive solution for RSF sample size by deriving closed-form mathematical expressions for the number of animals M and the number of relocations per animal N required for model outputs to a given degree of precision. The sample sizes needed depend on just 3 biologically meaningful quantities: habitat selection strength, variation in individual selection and a novel measure of landscape complexity, which we define rigorously. The mathematical expressions are calculable for any environmental dataset at any spatial scale and are applicable to any study involving resource selection (including sessile organisms). We validate our analytical solutions using globally relevant empirical data including 5,678,623 GPS locations from 511 animals from 10 species (omnivores, carnivores and herbivores living in boreal, temperate and tropical forests, montane woodlands, swamps and Arctic tundra). Our analytic expressions show that the required M and N must decline with increasing selection strength and increasing landscape complexity, and this decline is insensitive to the definition of availability used in the analysis. Our results demonstrate that the most biologically relevant effects on the utilization distribution (i.e. those landscape conditions with the greatest absolute magnitude of resource selection) can often be estimated with much fewer than M=30 animals. We identify several critical steps in implementing these equations, including (a) a priori selection of expected model coefficients and (b) regular sampling of background (pseudoabsence) data within a given definition of availability. We discuss possible methods to identify a priori expectations for habitat selection coefficients, effects of scale on RSF estimation and caveats for rare species applications. We argue that these equations should be a mandatory component for all future RSF studies.

AB  - Variation in reproductive success is the basis of evolution and allows species to respond to the environment, but only when it is based on fixed individual variation that is heritable. Several recent studies suggest that observed variation in reproduction is due to chance, not inherent individual differences. Our aim was to quantify inherent versus neutral variation in fitness of northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris (Gill, 1866)) females, including both quality and quantity of their offspring. Using 44 years of observations at A & ntilde;o Nuevo in California, we assembled lifetime pup production of 1065 individual females and mass at weaning for 2120 of their pups. Females varied significantly in mean lifetime mass of their pups, with 28% of the variance due to fixed individual differences among mothers. Variation was repeatable over 6 years of a mother's lifetime and heritable (h = 0.48). Moreover, pup mass at weaning was associated with future lifetime fitness, since larger pups had a higher chance of surviving to breed. Larger pups, however, did not produce more offspring once breeding, and lifetime pup production was not heritable. Traits related to offspring quality in elephant seals were inherently different among females, but variation in pup production was neutral.

AB  - Context Declining fertility is an issue in multiple mammalian species. As the site of fertilisation and early embryo development, the oviduct plays a critical role in embryo survival, yet there is a paucity of information on how the oviduct regulates this process.Aims We hypothesised that differences in steroid hormone signalling and/or immune function would be observed in a model of poor embryo survival, the peripubertal ewe.Methods We examined expression of steroid hormones in systemic circulation, oviductal expression of oestrogen receptor alpha and genes important in steroid hormone signalling, and immune function in pregnant and cyclic peripubertal and adult ewes on day 3 after oestrus.Key results Concentrations of progesterone, but not oestradiol, were decreased in the peripubertal ewe compared to the adult ewe. Oestrogen receptor alpha protein expression was increased in the peripubertal ewe, but pathway analysis of gene expression revealed downregulation of the oestrogen signalling pathway compared to the adult ewe. Differential expression of several genes involved in immune function between the peripubertal and adult ewe was consistent with an unfavourable oviductal environment in the peripubertal ewe lamb. Oestradiol concentration was positively correlated with the expression of multiple genes involved in the regulation of immune function.Conclusions Differences in the immune environment of the oviduct, potentially linked to differential modulation by steroid hormones, may partially underly the poor fertilisation and early embryo survival observed in the peripubertal ewe.Implications A unfavourable oviductal environment may play an important role in limiting reproductive success.
   Declining fertility is an issue in multiple mammalian species, with around 15% of couples experiencing infertility. Differential expression of genes involved in inflammation, linked with altered steroid signalling in the oviduct, was observed in peripubertal ewes, a model of poor fertility. Ensuring that the oviductal environment does not become hostile to fertilisation and early embryo development may provide a novel approach to improve fertility, particularly in conditions associated with chronic low-grade inflammation.

AB  - Methanol is noxious to insect pests, but most plants do not make enough of it to shield themselves from encroaching insects. Methanol emission is known to increase in the instance of herbivory. In the current study, we showed that Aspergillus niger pectin methylesterase over-expression increases methanol emission and confers resistance to polyphagous insect pests on transgenic cotton plants by impeding the possible methanol detoxifi-cation pathways. Transgenic plants emitted similar to 11 fold higher methanol displaying insect mortality of 96% and 93% in Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera litura, respectively. The larvae were unable to survive and finish their life cycle and the surviving larvae exhibited severe growth retardation. Insects try to detoxify methanol via catalase, carboxylesterase and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes, amongst which cytochrome P450 plays a major role in oxidizing methanol to formaldehyde and formaldehyde to formic acid, which is broken down into carbon dioxide and water. In our study, catalase and esterase enzymes were found to be upregulated, but cytochrome P450 monooxygenase levels were not much affected. Leaf disc assays and In-planta bioassays also showed 50-60% population reduction in the sap sucking pests, such as Bemisia tabaci and Phenacoccus solenopsis. These findings imply that elevated methanol emissions confer resistance in plants against chewing and sap-sucking pests by tampering the methanol detoxification pathways. Such mechanism will be useful in impart-ing expansive resistance against pests in plants.

AB  - The sinonasal microbiota in human upper airway may play an important role in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the human upper airway microbiome in patients with unilateral CRS, and compare the sinonasal microbiome of the unilateral diseased site with that of a contralateral healthy site. Thirty samples, 15 each from the diseased and healthy sites, were collected from the middle meatus and/or anterior ethmoid region of 15 patients with unilateral CRS during endoscopic sinus surgery. DNA extraction and bacterial microbiome analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing were then performed. Corynebacterium showed the highest relative abundance, followed by Staphylococcus in samples from both the diseased and healthy sites. Further, the relative abundances of Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas were significantly lower in samples from diseased sites than in those from healthy sites. Conversely, anaerobes, including Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Propionibacterium, were abundantly present in samples from both sites, more so in samples from diseased sites. However, the sites showed no significant difference with respect to richness or diversity (p > 0.05). Our results indicate that CRS might be a polymicrobial infection, and also suggest that Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus may exist as commensals on the sinus mucosal surface in the upper respiratory tract.

AB  - This study was motivated by the increasing interest in finding ways to preserve organs in a supercooled state for transplantation. Previous research with small volumes suggests that the isochoric (constant volume) thermo-dynamic state enhances the stability of supercooled solutions. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of storing a large organ, such as the pig liver, in a metastable isochoric supercooled state for clinically relevant durations. To achieve this, we designed a new isochoric technology that employs a system consisting of two domains separated by an interior boundary that can transfer heat and pressure, but not mass. The liver is preserved in one of these domains in a solution with an intracellular composition, which is in osmotic equilibrium with the liver. Pressure is used to monitor the thermodynamic state of the isochoric chamber. In this feasibility study, two pig livers were preserved in the device in an isochoric supercooled state at-2 degrees C. The experiments were terminated voluntarily, one after 24 h and the other after 48 h of supercooling preservation. Pressure measurements indicated that the livers did not freeze during the isochoric supercooling preservation. This is the first proof that organs as large as the pig liver can remain supercooled for extended periods of time in an isotonic solution in an isochoric system, despite an increased probability of ice nucleation with larger volumes. To serve as controls and to test the ability of pressure monitoring to detect freezing in the isochoric chamber, an experiment was designed in which two pig livers were frozen at-2 degrees C for 24 h and the pressure monitored. Histological examination with H&E stains revealed that the supercooled liver maintained a normal appearance, even after 48 h of supercooling, while tissues in livers frozen to-2 degrees C were severely disrupted by freezing after 24 h.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the most promising alternatives to the use of prophylactic antibiotics in production is the use of essential oils; the most studied route of administration has been orally through feed. In Mexico, one of the most studied essential oils is oregano essential oil (Lippia berlandieri Shauer). However, its use faces several problems, such as preserving the bioactive properties of the essential oil during its passage through the rumen. In addition, its use has been studied mainly in non-ruminants, so characterizing its effects in the rumen is necessary to standardize doses. One way to preserve bioactive properties is through encapsulation, so this work evaluated nanoencapsulated oregano essential oil on in vitro fermentation using goat ruminal fluid. The treatments used were diet without oregano oil or nanoparticles (CON); diet with 100 ppm of oregano oil in nanoparticles (100N); diet with 300 ppm of liquid oregano oil (300L); diet with 300 ppm of oregano oil in nanoparticles (300N); and diet with 300 ppm of empty nanoparticles (300CHN). The results indicate that the treatment of 100N had similar effects to 300L, proving that minor doses of oregano nanoparticles can be used to reduce doses in the rumen. This study evaluated the effects of liquid oregano oil, chitosan nanoparticles with encapsulated liquid oregano oil, and a negative control of empty chitosan nanoparticles on in vitro ruminal fermentation. Three Boer goats were used as ruminal fluid donors, fed with a formulated ration for 21 d for inoculum adaptation. Treatments tested on in vitro assays were diet without oregano oil or nanoparticles (CON); diet with 100 ppm of oregano oil in nanoparticles (100N); diet with 300 ppm of liquid oregano oil (300L); diet with 300 ppm of oregano oil in nanoparticles (300N); and diet with 300 ppm of empty nanoparticles (300CHN). The variables studied were in vitro dry matter digestibility (ivDMD), in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility (ivNDFD(om)), total gas production (TGP), ammonia nitrogen concentration (NH3), and pH. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design. Linear and quadratic regressions were used to identify dependence and inflection points. The ivDMD increased at 12, 36, and 48 h, with 300N and with 300L exhibiting increased ivNDFD(om) at 36 h. Ruminal pH was highest (p < 0.05) with 300CHN at 36 h. For first-order regression analysis of TGP, coefficients (beta) were highest (p < 0.05) for 300N. In conclusion, 300N increased ruminal fermentation in vitro, as reflected by increases in ivDMD, ivNDFD(om), and TGP.

AB  - Milk composition is a fundamental aspect of mammalian reproduction. Differences in milk composition between species may reflect phylogeny, dietary ecology, lactation strategy, and infant growth patterns, but may also vary within a species due to maternal body condition. This study presents the first published data on milk macronutrient composition of southern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) and compares the results with data on two other Cercopithecine species. Milk samples were obtained from five dams at 10- and 14-weeks postparturition. Macronutrient composition was determined at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute using proven methods developed over 30 years. On average (+/- SEM), the milk contained 83.9 +/- 0.4% water, 6.7 +/- 0.4% fat, 7.6 +/- 0.1% sugar, 1.8 +/- 0.1% protein, and 0.22 +/- 0.01% mineral content. The Ca:P ratio was 1.8; concentrations of Ca and protein were correlated. Mean gross energy was 1.02 +/- 0.03 kcal/g with most of the energy coming from fat (59.6 +/- 1.5%), followed by sugar (29.9 +/- 1.4%) and protein (10.5 +/- 0.5%). The milks at 14 weeks of infant age were higher in energy than the milks at 10 weeks, with an increase in energy from fat (p = 0.005) and decrease in energy from sugar (p = 0.018). The energy from protein did not change (p = 0.272). Compared to captive rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and olive baboon (Papio anubis) milk assayed by identical methods, captive pig-tailed macaque milk was higher in energy, but after accounting for the higher milk energy there was no difference in the proportions of milk energy from protein, fat, and sugar. The captive pig-tailed dams were significantly heavier than reported values for wild pig-tailed macaques, suggesting high body condition. High body condition in captive Cercopithecines appears to result in milk higher in energy, with more energy coming from fat and less from sugar. However, variation in the proportion of milk energy from protein in captive Cercopithecine milks appears relatively constrained.

AB  - Single-cell protein from torula yeast (Cyberlindnera jadinii) grown on lignocellulosic biomass has been proven to be an excellent alternative protein source for animal feed. This study aimed to evaluate the amino acid (AA) digestibility by estimating intestinal absorption from three yeast-based ingredients, produced by cultivating C. jadinii on hydrolysate, using either mixed woody species (drum- (WDI) or spray-dried (WSI)) or corn dextrose (drum-dried (DDI)) as the carbon source. Further, the protective effect of intestinal digests on activated THP1-Blue (TM)-induced epithelial damage and cytokine profile was evaluated. Total protein content from these three ingredients ranged from 34 to 45%, while the AA dialysis showed an estimated bioaccessibility between 41 and 58%, indicating good digestibility of all test products. A protective effect against epithelial-induced damage was observed for two of the three tested products. Torula yeast cultivated on wood and drum-dried (WDI) and torula yeast cultivated on wood and spray-dried (WSI) significantly increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values (111-147%, p < 0.05), recovering the epithelial barrier from the inflammation-induced damage in a dose-dependent manner. Further, WSI digests significantly reduced IL8 (250.8 +/- 28.1 ng/mL), IL6 (237.9 +/- 1.8 pg/mL) and TNF (2797.9 +/- 216.3 pg/mL) compared to the blank control (IL8 = 485.7 +/- 74.4 ng/mL, IL6 = 478.7 +/- 58.9 pg/mL; TNF = 4273.5 +/- 20.9 pg/mL) (p < 0.05). These results align with previous in vivo studies, supporting torula yeast-based ingredients as a high-quality protein source for pigs, protecting the intestinal barrier from inflammatory damage, and reducing the pro-inflammatory response. We provided novel insights into the mechanisms behind the health improvement of pigs fed on torula yeast-based ingredients, with potential applications for designing nutritional interventions to recover intestinal homeostasis during critical production periods, such as weaning.

AB  - Hierarchical compound topologies of interaction networks that are segmented into internally nested modules have received scant attention, compared to simple nested and modular topologies. This is due to the lack of a theoretical model that encompasses all relevant alternative topologies, and an effective method to differentiate compound from simple topologies. Here we present a framework to address compound topologies in ecological networks. We propose a mechanistic schema of processes that generate modular, nested and compound topologies, based on differences in availability and preferences among species. We show that, in combination, these processes produce a unique signature in the structure of compound topologies. Then, we propose a procedure to identify this signature and hence discriminate among simple and compound topologies. We test the efficiency of this procedure in a set of synthetic matrices and then apply it to an actual plant-herbivore network (Asteraceae and their flowehead feeders in Brazil). In this case, the compound topology is clearly substantiated, demonstrating that these advances are applicable to empirical ecological networks and that compound patterns decidedly belong to the array of topologies to be probed in interaction assemblages at various scales. By including extramodular structures in the analysis of compound topologies, we enhance our understanding of how community-wide networks are organized and their responses to various drivers.

AB  - AimDiet is a key aspect of life in animals. There have been numerous independent origins of herbivorous diet across animals, but the factors that explain these origins remain poorly understood. One potentially crucial factor is body temperature (Tb), as the gut-dwelling bacteria that help digest cellulose in many herbivores are thought to require high temperatures. However, analyses in birds, lizards and mammals found only limited evidence for higher Tb in herbivores than in carnivores. These analyses tested whether diet explains Tb evolution. Here, we focus instead on testing whether Tb helps explain the evolution of diet across tetrapods.LocationGlobal.Time PeriodPast 350 million years.Major Taxa StudiedTetrapods.MethodsWe analysed 1712 species with matched data on diet and Tb using diverse phylogenetic methods.ResultsAncestral reconstructions indicated that tetrapods likely had a carnivorous ancestor, followed by repeated transitions to omnivory and herbivory, especially in the last 110 million years. Thus, extant herbivorous lineages in tetrapods are relatively young, in contrast to many older carnivorous lineages. They are also relatively unstable in that reversals from herbivory back to omnivory and from omnivory back to carnivory were as frequent as the origins of herbivory and omnivory. Using phylogenetic logistic regression, we support the hypothesis that higher Tb helps explain the evolution of herbivory across tetrapods and within birds, mammals, lepidosaurs and turtles. Phylogenetic path analyses suggest that Tb generally drives the evolution of herbivory, and not vice versa. Our analyses also suggest that Tb is more important for the evolution of herbivory than large body size or diurnal diel activity, which are both significant predictors of herbivory in some cases.Main ConclusionsOur results show for the first time that Tb is a significant predictor of diet evolution among and within many major animal clades.

AB  - Simple Summary Skin lesions in cattle associated with feeding by Haematobia fly species are a significant health issue in northern Australian cattle. These lesions have most commonly been attributed to the effects of Stephanofilaria nematodes vectored by the Haematobia spp. flies. However, the exact etiology of these lesions and reasons for the variation between the cattle in the severity of lesions was unclear. This study investigated the cutaneous responses to fly and nematode antigens in lesion-resistant and susceptible cattle, which indicated that differences in the hypersensitivity response to buffalo fly (Haematobia irritans exigua) antigens is a key factor underlying the variation amongst the cattle in susceptibility-to-lesion development. There was no association found between the intensity of fly infestation and lesion susceptibility. The findings from this study suggest that further characterization of the skin response could lead to the identification of the biomarkers for selecting cattle with an increased resistance to buffalo fly lesion development. This study investigated the role of cattle immune responses in the pathogenesis of buffalo fly (Haematobia irritans exigua) (BF) lesions. Brangus steers phenotyped for lesion development were divided into three groups: high lesion susceptibility (HL), low lesion susceptibility (LL) and no lesions (NL), based on lesion severity scores. Each steer was injected intradermally with different concentrations of BF, Onchocerca gibsoni (Og), and Musca domestica (Md) antigens. At 1 h post-injection, wheal areas at BF injection sites were found to be significantly larger in HL than NL cattle, but there were no significant differences (p < 0.05) found between either the HL or NL cattle and LL cattle. At 24, 48, and 72 h post-injection, the skinfold thickness response to both BF and Md antigens was significantly greater in the HL group than the NL group. However, skin thickness was significantly greater for the BF antigens than the Md antigens (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences found between the LL and NL animals in response to the BF antigens at any time, and no significant differences were determined between any of the lesion groups in response to the Og antigens. Histological examination of skin sections taken from the BF antigen injection sites in HL cattle at 72 h post-injection revealed necrosis of the epidermis and superficial dermis, along with severe eosinophilic inflammation. This study suggests that differences in the hypersensitivity to BF antigens underlie differences amongst the cattle in their susceptibility to the development of BF lesions, and breeding for immune-related biomarkers may assist in selecting more BF lesion-resistant cattle.

AB  - Hyperglycemia is a symptom and damaging factor of diabetes mellitus (DM) that leads to systemic complications in the body, including cerebral macro- and microangiopathies, impaired blood supply, appearance of neurodegeneration foci, and triggering neuroinflammation. Nervous tissue is characterized by a high level of energy consumption and is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the level of metabolic substrates. Therefore, it is extremely important to study the effect of high glucose levels on the functional state of the central nervous system. This review attempts to comprehensively assess the effects of hyperglycemia on brain cells. Analysis of experimental data on the morphofunctional state of neurons, microglia and astrocytes, obtained in in vivo and in vitro models of diabetes, showed that direct and indirect effects of high glucose concentrations depend on the cell type. Astrocytic and microglial receptors and intracellular signaling cascades, which mediate the effects of hyperglycemia and the development of neuroinflammation, can act as therapeutic targets for correcting diabetic consequences. Thus, the search for new ways to modulate the functional activity of glial cells may be an effective strategy in reducing the severity of CNS injuries and their aftereffects.

AB  - Polymorphisms in the human ABO gene determine the major blood classification system based on the three well-known forms: A; B; and O. In pigs that carry only two main alleles in this gene (A and O), we still need to obtain a more comprehensive distribution of variants, which could also impact its function. In this study, we mined more than 500 whole-genome sequencing datasets to obtain information on the ABO gene in different Suidae species, pig breeds, and populations and provide (i) a comprehensive distribution of the A and O alleles, (ii) evolutionary relationships of ABO gene sequences across Suidae species, and (iii) an exploratory evaluation of the effect of the different ABO gene variants on production traits and blood-related parameters in Italian Large White pigs. We confirmed that allele O is likely under balancing selection, present in all Sus species investigated, without being fixed in any of them. We reported a novel structural variant in perfect linkage disequilibrium with allele O that made it possible to estimate the evolutionary time window of occurrence of this functional allele. We also identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms that were suggestively associated with plasma magnesium levels in pigs. Other studies can also be constructed over our results to further evaluate the effect of this gene on economically relevant traits and basic biological functions.

AB  - The effect of sugar cane molasses, as a partial replacement to corn in the diet, on blood parameters and composition of the M. longissimus thoracis (LT) in growing pigs was explored in this study. Twenty female pigs aged 63 days, and weighing 28.98 +/- 3.56 kg, were randomly assigned to either the control or sugar cane molasses treatments. Molasses was included at the 3% level to partially replace corn in their diet. Blood samples were collected at the beginning and end of the experiments. The animals were slaughtered at 110 days of age after 47 days in the experiment, weighing 67.9 +/- 5.58 kg, and an LT muscle sample was extracted and evaluated. Each animal was considered an experimental unit. The treatment had no effect on the length and area of the LT muscle. Backfat thickness was reduced when using the sugar cane molasses treatment (5.80 mm) compared to the control treatment (8.90 mm) (P < 0.05). Higher enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were observed in animals of the control treatment (67.10 IU/L) compared to animals treated with the sugar cane molasses treatment (49.90 IU/L) (P < 0.05). Moreover, the proximal composition, fatty acid profile, and quality were not influenced by treatment. Sugar cane molasses, used as an energy source to partially replace corn in the diet of growing pigs at a level of 3%, reduced the backfat thickness of the pig carcass and improved the serum concentration of the enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase in pigs.

AB  - This paper summarizes previous studies of Palaeoloxodon naumanni, including stratigraphic distribution, chronology, morphological characteristics, taxonomy, habitat, and accompanying fauna. P. naumanni has been reported from over 300 sites on the Japanese Islands, ranging from 44 degrees to 33 degrees N latitude. Many of them have been dated by tephra stratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, or C-14 dating. Based on the age-dated specimens, P. naumanni is thought to have lived in Japan from 340,000 to 26,000 years ago. Skeletal morphology of P. naumanni is well known. In particular, the skull has been identified as male and female. And the examination of the skulls indicate that Palaeoloxodon is an independent genus within Elephantinae, and also P. naumanni as an independent species within Palaeoloxodon. Based on the vegetation data obtained from P. naumanni localities and the co-existed animal species with P. naumanni indicate that it has inhabited mixed forests with deciduous broad-leaved trees and conifers in the temperate zone. During the latter half of the Late Pleistocene, when the mammoth fauna migrated southwards to Japan, the deciduous broad-leaved forests that were widespread in Honshu were inhabited by the fauna accompanied by P. naumanni. These two faunas repeatedly shifted north and south in response to global climatic changes.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a major pathogenic factor in many intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). The Nrf2 signaling pathway and mitophagy can reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviate oxidative stress, but their relationship is unclear. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a polyphenolic compound abundant in olive oil, has strong antioxidant activity and may help treat these diseases. We used pigs as a model to investigate HT's effect on intestinal oxidative damage and its mechanisms. Diquat (DQ) induced oxidative stress and impaired intestinal barrier function, which HT mitigated. Mechanistic studies in IPEC-J2 cells showed that HT protected against oxidative damage by activating the PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 signaling pathway and promoting mitophagy. Our study highlighted the synergistic relationship between Nrf2 and mitophagy in mediating HT's antioxidant effects. Inhibition studies confirmed that disrupting either pathway compromised HT's protective effects. Maintaining redox balance through Nrf2 and mitophagy is important for eliminating excess ROS. Nrf2 increases antioxidant enzymes to clear existing ROS, while mitophagy removes damaged mitochondria and reduces ROS generation. This study demonstrates that these pathways collaboratively modulate the antioxidant effects of HT, with neither being dispensable. Targeting Nrf2 and mitophagy could be a promising strategy for treating oxidative stress-related intestinal diseases, with HT as a potential treatment.

AB  - Culicoides Latreille (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) biting midges are hematophagous flies that can transmit several disease-causing pathogens to animals. Surveillance of Culicoides is important for understanding pathogen transmission risk. The most commonly used traps for midge surveillance are suction traps baited with UV light or CO2. Culicoides species are understudied in the southern California desert region and trapping methods for these desert midges remain largely unexplored. In this study, capture rates of different Culicoides species were compared using suction traps baited with either UV or CO2 placed at two locations at a southern California desert site where a narrow canyon (Deep Canyon) drains the adjacent peninsular mountain range and leads to an expansive floodplain. Over all trap nights and locations, UV-baited traps outperformed CO2-baited traps for most Culicoides species captured at the study site, except for Culicoides sonorensis Wirth and Jones and C. mohave Wirth. Capture rates varied for each species by trap location, with desert Culicoides species captured in greater numbers at the canyon mouth while C. sonorensis and C. mohave were captured in greater numbers on the floodplain nearer to urban development including a golf course and small zoo. An interaction of trap type with trapping location on the capture rate was noted for some Culicoides species, especially for C. mohave which was captured in greater numbers using UV traps at the canyon mouth but captured in greater numbers using CO2 traps in the floodplain. This trap efficiency study will facilitate future research targeting Culicoides species in the southern California desert.

AB  - The Canadian Federal Government promulgated new and lower NO2 Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) that went into effect in 2020 with additional decreases scheduled for 2025. The new hourly and annual NO2 CAAQS are 60 and 17 ppb, respectively, and the 2025 hourly and annual CAAQS are 42 and 12 ppb, respectively. The province of Alberta has also promulgated Ambient Air Quality Objectives (AAAQO) for NO2 currently set to 159 and 24 ppb on an hourly and annual basis, respectively. The Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA) in northeastern Alberta, Canada monitors NO2 at 21 community and industrial sites throughout the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR), for regulatory compliance using Thermo-Environmental (TEI) Model 42i Federal Reference Method (FRM) designated NO-NO2-NOx analyzers. The 42i measures NO directly via NO-O-3 chemiluminescence, and NOx following the reduction of oxidized nitrogen to NO by a heated internal molybdenum converter. The difference between the NOx and NO channels is reported as NO2. This study presents the results of a three-year (2018-2021) WBEA comparison of four continuous NO2 analyzers: TEI 42i FRM; the API Model T500U cavity attenuated phase shift (CAPS) Federal Equivalent Method (FEM); a total reactive odd nitrogen analyzer (TEI Model 42i-Y); and a TEI 42i equipped with an external photolytic converter. The study showed that NO2 data from all analyzers were highly correlated and in general agreement, with r(2) values (vs. the CAPS) ranging from 0.990-0.997 and slopes ranging from 0.933-0.992. Mean NO2 concentrations over the study period ranged from 7.2-7.5 ppb. Differences between the TEI 42i, TEI 42i-Y, and PhoNO, relative to the CAPS were all positive and highly significant (p < 0.0001), based upon nonparametric tests. The potential impact from the selection of different FRM/FEM measurement methods on current and future Canadian 2025 regulatory compliance in the region is evaluated.<br />Implications: The study objective was to compare/evaluate different regulatory NO2 measurement techniques from a regional monitoring authority in a routine network operational context. Relatively small NO2 differences resulted in significant differences with respect to regulatory compliance triggers, particularly hourly standards based on daily extreme value statistics (e.g., 99th percentiles). For example, mean hourly NO2 triangle differences ranged from 0.02-0.26 ppb over the study period but resulted in 2-3 ppb differences in the 3-year hourly CAAQS metrics. These differences could affect regulatory CAAQS and LARP compliance (management level) at monitoring sites observed during 2019 annual and 2020 hourly LARP trigger exceedances.<br />

AB  - The maintenance of optimum mineral nutrient fertility is a limiting factor in organic vegetable systems, with many growers resorting to applications of off-farm commercial fertilizer inputs. In this study, pelleted sheep's wool was compared against a standard commercial fertilizer product for effects on productivity and plant growth in spinach and tomato. Two rates of wool pellets were applied; one was standardized to the nitrogen inputs of the 'grower standard' commercial treatment, and a second higher rate which was suggested by the pellet manufacturer with about 2.5 times the nitrogen content. Overall, few differences were observed among the fertilized treatments. Crop yield for both tomato and spinach generally increased with increasing fertility application, with no differences between commercial and wool pellet fertilizers applied at the same rate of nitrogen. The uptake of mineral nutrients in spinach plant tissues differed for K, Mg, P, S, B, and Ca, but there was no general trend that could be attributed to a particular treatment. Tomato fruit quality was the same for all treatments, but non-fertilized fruit had lower total polyphenols than the highest-fertility treatment. Overall, wool pellets performed very similarly to commercial organic fertilizer for both crops and could be a promising alternative that may open up opportunities for greater integration of plant and animal systems on diversified farms.

AB  - Tea plants are highly susceptible to the adverse effects of a high-temperature climate, which can cause reduced yield and quality and even lead to plant death in severe cases. Therefore, reducing the damage caused by high-temperature stress and maintaining the photosynthetic capacity of tea plants is a critical technical challenge. In this study, we investigated the impact of small oligopeptides (small peptides) and surfactants on the high-temperature-stress tolerance of tea plants. Our findings demonstrated that the use of small peptides and surfactants enhances the antioxidant capacity of tea plants and protects their photosynthetic system. They also induce an increase in gibberellin (GA) content and a decrease in jasmonic acid (JA), strigolactone (SL), auxin (IAA), and cytokinin (CTK) content. At the same time, small peptides regulate the metabolic pathways of diterpenoid biosynthesis. Additionally, small peptides and surfactants induce an increase in L-Carnosine and N-Glycyl-L-Leucine content and a decrease in (5-L-Glutamyl)-L-Amino Acid content, and they also regulate the metabolic pathways of Beta-Alanine metabolism, Thiamine metabolism, and Glutathione metabolism. In summary, small peptides and surfactants enhance the ability of tea plants to resist high-temperature stress.

AB  - The objective was to describe the behavior of Pantaneiro ewes and their lambs during the peripartum and to correlate these behavioral characteristics with the maternal behavior score (MBS) and productive characteristics of the lambs until weaning. During 2 years, on paddocks with Brachiaria brizantha pasture, 288 ewes aged of 3.5 +/- 1.5 years and weighing 41.3 +/- 8.1 kg were evaluated. Ewes were sired to Pantaneiro rams and to Morada Nova or Santa Ines rams. The characteristics observed were separation of the parturient ewe from the flock, agitation intensity, care for the lamb, nursing facilitation, latency of the first attempt of the lamb to stand up and suckle, vocalizations, sex of the lamb, weight at birth (BW) and weaning (WW), and the type of delivery. MBS was assessed approximately 12 hours after delivery, using a 6-point scale (1 = very poor and 6 = very good). Data were submitted to descriptive, univariate variance and principal factor analysis (PFA). Linear correlations were tested between behavior of animals at lambing and the lamb's productive indexes. Most ewes did not separate from the flock to deliver (74%), showed adequate maternal behavior as they facilitated the first suckling (86%) and kept close to their offspring (92%), presenting high MBS ( >4). Pantaneiro-sired lambs spent less time searching for the udder and sucking compared with crossbred lambs. Three principal factors (PF) with eigenvalues >1.0 explained 68.7% of the total variance for the ewes' behavior at lambing. Latency to vocalize and latency to care for the lambs were positively associated, while they were negatively associated with ingestion of amniotic fluid and placenta. Agitation intensity at lambing was positively associated with separation from the flock. Three PF with eigenvalues >1.0 explained 63.0% of the total variance for the lambs' behavior at lambing. The PFA evidenced positive association between the latencies to vocalize, stand up, search for the udder and suck, females and heavier animals presented lower durations of latency. Most ewes showed low reactivity to the human presence, but MBS did not correlate with behavior at lambing. The WW and the body weight gain of the lambs correlated positively only with the agitation intensity of the ewes. Behavior of Pantaneiro ewes at lambing is influenced by management and environment of Pantanal region, as ewes do not separate from the flock. In general, behavior of ewes at peripartum does not correlate with MBS and lambs's performance at weaning. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dietary betaine supplementation can ameliorate physiological responses to heat exposure (HE) in sheep. This experiment measured metabolic responses to glucose (intravenous glucose tolerance, IVGTT), insulin (insulin tolerance test, ITT), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenges in Merino ewes (n = 36, 39.7 kg) maintained at thermoneutral (TN, 21 ffi C) or HE (18-43 ffi C) and supplemented with either 0, 2, or 4 g/day dietary betaine (n = 6 per group). Sheep had ad libitum access to water and were pair-fed such that the intake of the TN sheep mimicked that of the HE sheep. After 21 days of treatment, sheep were fitted with jugular catheters and subjected to consecutive daily challenges (IVGTT, ITT, and ACTH, d 21-23, respectively), followed by skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy collections for gene expression analysis (d 24). The HE-treated sheep had a greater insulin:glucose ratio (p = 0.033), a greater estimated homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR; p = 0.029), and a reduced revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (RQUICKI; p = 0.015). Sheep fed betaine (2 + 4 g/day) had a greater basal plasma insulin (p = 0.017) and a reduced basal non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA; p = 0.036) concentration, while the RQUICKI was reduced (p = 0.001) in sheep fed betaine. The results suggested that betaine supplementation alters lipid metabolism by potentially improving insulin signaling, although these responses differ between TN and HE conditions. There was no other impact of temperature or dietary treatments on the tissue gene expressions measured. Our results support the notion that betaine, in part, acts to modify lipid metabolism.

AB  - Categorization requires a balance of mechanisms that can generalize across common features and discriminate against specific details. A growing literature suggests that the hippocampus may accomplish these mechanisms by using fundamental mechanisms like pattern separation, pattern completion, and memory integration. Here, we assessed the role of the rodent dorsal hippocampus (HPC) in category learning by combining inhibitory DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) and simulations using a neural network model. Using touchscreens, we trained rats to categorize distributions of visual stimuli containing black and white gratings that varied along two continuous dimensions. Inactivating the dorsal HPC impaired category learning and generalization, suggesting that the rodent HPC plays an important role during categorization. Hippocampal inactivation had no effect on a control discrimination task that used identical trial procedures as the categorization tasks, suggesting that the impairments were specific to categorization. Model simulations were conducted with variants of a neural network to assess the impact of selective deficits on category learning. The hippocampal inactivation groups were best explained by a model that injected random noise into the computation that compared the similarity between category stimuli and existing memory representations. This model is akin to a deficit in mechanisms of pattern completion, which retrieves similar memory representations using partial information.

AB  - Simple Summary Nowadays, animal nutritionists are more aware of how expensive and limited protein is in animal feedings. Understanding the role of sampling time in evaluating the nutritional status of small ruminants could be helpful to assess more efficiently dietary crude protein content. However, faeces or blood samples to analyse dietary changes are taken at indistinct times of the day, depending on the availability of the technicians. Thereby, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of sampling time (8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m.) on some apparent nutrient digestibility and blood catabolites related to nutritional status. Our findings revealed that one sample of faeces or blood in the morning enables the optimal evaluation of the impact of crude protein variations in diet formulations. This experiment aimed to evaluate the effects of sampling time on organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and phosphorous (P) apparent digestibility and plasma urea and creatinine concentration in growing and finishing male Ripollesa lambs fed different CP concentrations in the diet. Twenty-four male Ripollesa lambs with 14.5 kg body weight (BW) were randomly assigned to two groups differing in CP content in the growing (14 to 19 kg of BW) and finishing (19 to 25 kg of BW) phases (20% vs. 18% CP and 19% vs. 17% CP, respectively). Faeces collected from the rectum and blood samples collected from the jugular vein were taken at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m. During the growing period, the OM, CP and P apparent digestibility were higher in the lower CP diet (p < 0.05), but only P was affected by the sampling time, being highest at 8:00 a.m. (p < 0.05) compared to other sampling hours. During the finishing period, there were no differences in these digestibility coefficients between diets or sampling times (p > 0.05). Sampling time did not affect (p > 0.05) plasma urea concentrations either in the growing or finishing period. Plasma creatinine concentrations did not differ (p > 0.05) between lambs receiving 18% or 20% CP diets, but during the finishing period, it was lower at 4:00 p.m. in lambs fed 17% CP (p < 0.05) than those offered 19% CP. Overall, the results suggest that the collection schedule to evaluate the protein nutritional status can be shortened through one spot sample of faeces or blood in the morning.

AB  - Novel and unexpected stimuli are often prioritised in memory, given their inherent salience. Nevertheless, not all forms of novelty show such an enhancement effect. Here, we discuss the role expectation plays in modulating the way novelty affects memory processes, circuits, and subsequent performance. We first review independent effects of expectation on memory, and then consider how different types of novelty are characterised by expectation. We argue that different types of novelty defined by expectation implicate differential neurotransmission in memory formation brain regions and may also result in the creation of different types of memory. Contextual novelty, which is unexpected by definition, is often associated with better recollection, supported by dopaminergichippocampal interactions. On the other hand, expected stimulus novelty is supported by engagement of medial temporal cortices, as well as the hippocampus, through cholinergic modulation. Furthermore, when expected stimulus novelty results in enhanced memory, it is predominantly driven by familiarity. The literature reviewed here highlights the complexity of novelty-sensitive memory systems, the distinction between types of novelty, and how they are differentially affected by expectancy.

AB  - The wet and highly dynamic environment of the mouth makes local treatment of oral mucosal diseases challenging. To overcome this, a photo-crosslinking hydrogel adhesive is developed inspired by the success of light-curing techniques in dentistry. The adhesive operates on a fast (within 5 s) phototriggered S-nitrosylation coupling reaction and employs imine anchoring to connect to host tissues. Unlike other often-used clinical agents that adhere weakly and for short durations, this thin, elastic, adhesive, and degradable cyclic o-nitrobenzyl-modified hyaluronic acid gel protects mucosal wounds from disturbance by liquid rinsing, oral movement, and friction for more than 24 h. The results from both rat and pig oral mucosa repair models demonstrate that this new gel adhesive creates a favorable microenvironment for tissue repair and can shorten tissue healing time. This study thus illustrates a therapeutic strategy with the potential to advance the treatment of oral mucosal defects in the clinic.

AB  - An undisturbed and well-controlled hearth state is an essential prerequisite for achieving a long campaign life and low production costs in an ironmaking blast furnace, because hearth wear and hot metal and slag drainage are crucial factors in its operation. With the objective to estimate the hearth state of the refractory of a three-taphole blast furnace, a wear model of the hearth erosion and skull formation was developed. The model is based on thermocouple readings in the hearth lining and solves an inverse heat conduction problem for a series of co-axial vertical slices, where the erosion and skull lines are optimized simultaneously. The model is optimized for fast computation by adopting a novel procedure featuring fixed mesh during the looping calculation. The results revealed that the hearth refractory showed an elephant-foot-shaped profile with excessive erosion in the hearth periphery, indicating that liquid flows are suppressed in the hearth bottom and that the permeability of the core of the deadman is low. These findings were further elaborated and confirmed by a comparison between the estimated hearth state and other key operation variables, including the coke rate, blast kinetic energy, and residual carbon appetite of the hot metal.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution is a serious global environmental issue. It threatens human and ecological health. Heavy metals can accumulate in the soil over extended periods and inevitably transfer through the food chain to herbivorous insects and their natural enemies, leading to various adverse effects. This study aimed to investigate the stress responses and biochemical metabolic changes of aphids and one of aphids' predators, ladybugs, under cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) stress by constructing a food chain of Vicia faba L., Megoura crassicauda, and Harmonia axyridis. The results showed that aphids and ladybugs had a notable accumulation of Cd2+ and Pb2+. Insects can adapt to heavy metal stress by regulating their energy metabolism pathways. Glycogen content in the first filial generation (F1) aphids decreased significantly, glucose content in the second filial generation (F2) to the fourth filial generation (F4) adult aphids significantly increased, and trehalose content in the F1 adult aphids increased significantly. Moreover, the relative expression levels of trehalase (TRE) and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) in the F1 adult aphids were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the expression levels of TPS genes in the second filial generation to the fifth filial generation (F2 to F5) aphids decreased, suggesting that insects can resist heavy metal stress by regulating trehalose metabolism. The fertility of female aphids in all treatment groups was reduced compared to the control group. Additionally, the relative expression level of vitellogenin (Vg) was down-regulated in all aphid generations except the F1 aphids. There was interaction between heavy metal concentration and aphid generation, and it significantly affected the number of aphids' offspring and the expression of the aphid Vg gene. The developmental duration of the ladybugs from the second to fourth instars was prolonged, and the weight decreased significantly from the prepupa to the adult stages. These results contribute to understanding the effects of Cd2+-Pb2+ accumulation on phytophagous insects and higher trophic levels' natural enemies, laying the foundation for protecting natural enemies and maintaining ecosystem stability.

AB  - Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) extract nutrients from host plant phloem via stylets that facilitate salivation and sap uptake. When navigating to the phloem, aphids periodically puncture nonvascular cells and sample cell contents, but rarely cause significant cell damage. As a result, aphids are considered "stealthy" feeders. In contrast, insects that do cause damage, such as chewing herbivores, will take up host cell contents-including DNA-into their guts. Researchers can use molecular barcoding methods to identify recent host use patterns of chewing herbivores. This information is valuable for both pest management and basic ecological studies. Because of their stealthy feeding style, it was assumed that host plant DNA could not be recovered from aphids and other Sternorrhyncha. However, several recent studies document host plant DNA uptake by psyllids, which feed in a similar manner to aphids. Therefore, we hypothesized that aphids may also acquire DNA from host plants. Since aphids puncture and sample cytosol contents from cells, we predicted that aphids would be most likely to acquire DNA from chloroplasts. To test this, we performed host feeding and host transfer experiments with Myzus persicae (Sulzer), then used PCR to recover and sequence a region between the trnT and trnF genes from acquired chloroplast DNA. We found that M. persicae readily acquires chloroplast DNA, even prior to phloem contact, and that fragment sizes sufficient for host plant identification can be recovered. Our work suggests that molecular gut content analysis is a viable tool for studying aphid-host interactions.

The assessment of antioxidant potential was made by ABTS, DPPH, TPC and FRAP methods. The work also assessed metabolic activity of tested lactic acid bacteria using measurement of electrical impedance changes in the growing medium. The highest values describing the antioxidant potential were found for fermented milk by L. acidophilus. It was also found that the time of cooling storage causes significantly increasing the antioxidant potential of most analyzed samples. Metabolic activity of tested lactic acid bacteria was the highest for cow's milk. The course of curves for goat's milk and whey from goat's milk was similar, which confirms the differences between cow and goat milk.

AB  - Currently, an effective repair method that can promote satisfactory cartilage regeneration is unavailable for cartilage damages owing to inevitable inflammatory erosion. Cartilage tissue engineering has revealed considerable treatment options for cartilage damages. Icariin (ICA) is a flavonoid component of Epimedii folium with both chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we prepared an ICA/CTS hydrogel by loading ICA into chitosan (CTS) hydrogel to impart chondrogenesis and anti-inflammatory properties to the ICA/CTS hydrogel. In vitro results revealed that ICA showed sustained release kinetics from the ICA/CTS hydrogel. In addition, compared to the CTS hydrogel, the ICA/CTS hydrogel exhibited a favorable in vitro anti-inflammatory effect upon incubation with lipopolysaccharide pre-induced RAW264.7 macrophages, as indicated by the suppression of inflammatory-related cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha). Additionally, when co-cultured with chondrocytes in vitro, the ICA/CTS hydrogel showed good cytocompatibility, accelerated chondrocyte proliferation, and enhanced chondrogenesis compared to the CTS hydrogel. Moreover, the in vitro engineered cartilage from the chondrocyte-loaded ICA/CTS hydrogel achieved stable cartilage regeneration when subcutaneously implanted in a goat model. Finally, the addition of ICA endowed the ICA/CTS hydrogel with a potent anti-inflammatory effect compared to what was observed in the CTS hydrogel, as confirmed by the attenuated IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and TUNEL expression. The prepared ICA/CTS hydrogel offered an effective method of delivery for chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory agents and served as a useful platform for cartilage regeneration in an immunocompetent large animal model.

AB  - The reproductive function of ewes and the development of their offspring are largely influenced by their clinical condition and the temperature of the environment. The maximum temperature values have significantly increased over the last two decades, making climate change a pressing issue for sheep breeding worldwide, including Ukraine. The consequences of exposure to high temperatures of the outside air, above all, in the mating season, can be marked by a significant increase in the heat load on the body of the brood stock, a decrease in clinical indicators and reproductive capacity. On the other hand, the current understanding of how these components interact is insufficient, which conditions the relevance of this work. In order to determine the effective terms of insemination of sheep in the mating season of 2021, taking into account the terms of insemination and the characteristics of the outside air temperature, three technological groups of ewes were formed, which were in the same flock and were artificially inseminated with freshly obtained sperm from the same breeders in August-September: from August 15 to August 27; from August 28 to September 9 and from September 10 to September 21. It was discovered that ewes inseminated between August 28th and September 9th were less adaptable to environmental conditions, experiencing increased daily fluctuations of body temperature, pulse and breathing rates, stillborn lambs, cases of abortion, and decreased preservation of young animals, including ewe lambs, which are highly valuable in breeding - by 15.8% and 10.9% concerning the initial and final phases of the insemination period. However, the young lambs born from ewes inseminated between August 15th and August 27th had the highest survival rate until weaning due to better survival of ewe lambs compared to those inseminated during later phases of the mating season against the background of a lower percentage of output of rams until the moment of weaning against ewes that were inseminated from August 28 to September 9. It has been shown that the growth rate of lambs during early postnatal development varies depending on the timing of their mothers' insemination. Ewes inseminated between August 15th and 27th produced lambs with the highest weight at 90 days, reaching 26.81 and 24.18 kg, respectively; 20.1% and 26.8% more than rams, and 19.1% and 18.8% more than female lambs whose mothers were inseminated in the middle and at the end of the breeding season. A similar picture is characteristic of the average daily growth values. It was determined that the formation of clinical indicators, and above all, the body temperature of young animals born from mothers fertilized at the beginning and in the middle of the mating season, was the most intense. The results of this study made it possible to understand the adaptive mechanisms of the response of sheep to changes in environmental temperature, which will be useful in future investigations to determine its effect on the thermopotential and clinical condition of lambs during the first day after birth, which is the most critical.

AB  - Genetic monogamy is the rule for many species of seahorse, including the West Australian seahorse Hippocampus subelongatus. In this paper, we revisit mark-recapture and genetic data of H. subelongatus, allowing a detailed characterization of movement distances, home range sizes and home range overlaps for each individual of known sex, paired status (paired or unpaired) and body size. As predicted, we find that females have larger home ranges and move greater distances compared to males. We also confirm our prediction that the home ranges of pair-bonded individuals (members of a pair known to reproduce together) overlap more on average than home ranges of randomly chosen individuals of the opposite or same sex. Both sexes, regardless of paired status, had home ranges that overlapped with, on average, 6-10 opposite-sex individuals. The average overlap area among female home ranges was significantly larger than the overlap among male home ranges, probably reflecting females having larger home ranges combined with a female biased adult sex ratio. Despite a prediction that unpaired individuals would need to move around to find a mate, we find no evidence that unpaired members of either sex moved more than paired individuals of the same sex. We also find no effect of body size on home range size, distance moved or number of other individuals with which a home range overlapped. These patterns of movement and overlap in home ranges among individuals of both sexes suggest that low mate availability is not a likely explanation for the maintenance of monogamy in the West Australian seahorse.

AB  - Excessive or insufficient application of phosphorus (P) fertilisers can lead to soil P build-up or reduced crop productivity, respectively. Variable-rate P fertilisation offers a sustainable solution to this challenge. This study compared the efficiency of pig slurry (PgS) as a P fertiliser to a mineral P fertiliser (superphosphate, SPP) by evaluating their impacts on soil P availability, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nutrient leaching in different laboratory experiments. PgS was applied at three increasing rates (R1, R2 and R3) to soils with varying P levels: very low (VL), low (L) or medium (M). A control (CTRL) without P application was included. Results showed PgS was as efficient as, or superior to, SPP in increasing soil extractable P content (1%-104%). Excessive PgS application indicated to soil P build-up. CO2 emissions were highest with PgS (204.85 mg C kg-1 soil) compared with SPP (171.26 mg C kg-1 soil), though no significant differences in N2O and CH4 emissions were observed. GHG emissions were influenced by original soil P values, with the highest emissions in VL soil (1.36 g CO2-eq kg-1 soil). Optimal fertilisation (R2 for L soils) minimised emissions (647.56 mg CO2-eq kg-1 soil). Total P (TP) leaching was exacerbated in our selected sandy soils and increased with higher PgS application (11.95 mg TP kg-1 soil in R3) and higher soil P levels (8.18 mg TP kg-1 soil in soil M). Similar trends were observed for N leaching. This study highlighted PgS as a vial alternative to mineral P fertilisers and underscored the importance of site-specific variable-rate P application, to optimise fertiliser efficiency while minimising environmental impacts.

KW  - African buffalo-inspired part segregation algorithm (AB-PSA)
AB  - In multilevel or additive production, reduction of the total manufacturing duration is crucial. This may be achieved by harmonizing assembly and production time and by simultaneous collaboration with component manufacturers, thus incurring fewer delays. Here, a novel approach, the African buffalo-inspired part segregation algorithm, is proposed for optimal structural and functional assemblies in additive manufacturing. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to assess the near-term optimum criteria area and dispersed materials in a computational manufacturing context. The number of support substances, total production period and total assembly costs are reduced in the time-reduction approach. A specific swarm intelligence-part-based segregation strategy is used to choose the appropriate number of element assemblages, and a part division strategy that complies with the criteria for transverse effect, dimensions and elevations is applied. The proposed approach is evaluated for structures with conventional and free-form borders using two real-size three-dimensional representations. The results indicate that this method may reduce overall production time compared to the time spent constructing one component, under all investigated circumstances.

AB  - Crabs are economically important crustaceans as they are essential delicacies consumed worldwide and are also an excellent environmental indicator. Portunus reticulatus, the blue swimming crab, is a highly valued seafood throughout Asia. The invertebrates protect themselves from invading pathogens by the innate immune response, and lectins play an essential role in recognizing non-self-agents. The present study was aimed at purification and bacterial agglutinating properties of lectin from the serum of P. reticulatus. Initially, the species identity was confirmed using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) region and accessions were submitted to the NCBI and BOLD. Then, the lectin (PrLec) was purified using a chitosan-based affinity column chosen based on the preliminary characterization consisting of haemagglutination (HA), cross-adsorption, carbohydrate-binding specificity and physicochemical parameters. The PrLec showed the highest HA titre value of 64 against Human A and buffalo erythrocytes and greater affinity towards N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The divalent cations and EDTA did not alter the PrLec activity. The molecular weight of the PrLec was 126 kDa (heterodimers of 66 and 60 kDa). Bacterial agglutination activity of the PrLec was examined with Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria, Micrococcus luteus. The lectin agglutinated both the bacterial strains efficiently.

AB  - Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can cause rapid snowmelt, leading to flooding and avalanches in the pan-Arctic and can also lead to starvation and the death of massive ungulates. Reanalysis products (e.g., ERA-I, ERA5-land, JRA55, MERRA2) are the primary source data for the research about ROS events in the large-scale region. However, the accuracy and reliability of reanalyses have never been evaluated with respect to the determination of terrestrial ROS events. The present study aims to statistically evaluate the performance of reanalysis datasets in identifying ROS events with different criteria based on in-situ rainfall data and MODIS snow cover product. The results show that all reanalysis datasets exhibit poor performance (Recall <= 0.16, Kappa coefficient <= 0.26, F-score <= 0.42, MCC <= 0.33) in all criteria in the pan-Arctic, mainly due to the low accuracy of rainfall data (r <= 0.56). Nevertheless, the spatial distribution pattern and hot spots of ROS from all reanalysis datasets are essentially close. The hot spots of ROS are mainly located on the coast of Alaska, Norway, and Greenland. All reanalyses demonstrate an increase in rainy days, but there is little overall change in ROS events due to the reduction in snow cover days. This work suggests that none of the current reanalyses are reliable in the determination of ROS events due to the poor representation of the rainfall parameterization scheme. The development of alternative strategies that can investigate ROS events at large-scale is urgently needed in a changing Arctic under rapid warming.

AB  - Carbon dots (CDs) are a new class of fluorescent nanomaterials that can be used in optical devices, fluorescence sensing and bio-imaging. Recently, the preparation of CDs from biomass gained great interest because the source is plentiful and they are friendly to environment. However, there still exist some problems including low quantum yield (QY) and limited application. Although CDs have been successfully applied in detection of various ions, the sensing of Cr(VI) and the corresponding mechanism is rarely proposed. Here, a facile and effective preparation of N-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) from sweet potatoes was developed through hydrothermal synthesis, using urea as passivator. The characterization was performed to demonstrate the morphology and chemical composition of the N-CDs. In particular, it is confirmed that N element exists in NH2 group on the surface of the N-CDs. Because of doing with N element, the QY of these CDs significantly increases to 31%. In addition, the N-CDs exhibit favorable free radical scavenging activities toward DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide anion free radicals. This antioxidant property, combined with inner filter effect, endows the N-CDs with florescence response to Cr(VI). The further study showed that linear range of Cr(VI) concentration is from 1 mu M to 80 mu M with a detection limit of 0.61 mu M. Subsequently, the N-CDs were competent to detect trace Cr(VI) both in human serum and pig liver. Based on the fact that the N-CDs are biocompatible by MTT experiment, the N-CDs were excellent in fluorescent sensing of Cr(VI) in living cells. In a word, the N-CDs are suitable to be applied for Cr(VI) detection in bio-systems, as well as in antioxidant fields.

AB  - Climatic and environmental changes have been commonly proposed as driving factors behind the decline of Neanderthals in Europe. The Cantabrian region, in northern Iberia, is a key area for understanding the replacement of Neanderthals by Anatomically Modern Humans, where an early disappearance of Neanderthals in relation to other areas of Iberia has been proposed. To evaluate how climate might have influenced human behaviour during Marine Isotope Stage 3, an accurate review of palaeoecological conditions is required. For the first time, an assessment of the regional available terrestrial proxies linked to archaeo-palaeontological sites, including small vertebrate assemblages, pollen sequences, charcoal data and stable isotope studies on macromammals is undertaken in this region. In addition, records from macrofaunal assemblages and glacial records have also been considered. To standardise the information and allow inter-site comparison, data from pollen and small vertebrate sequences were transformed into quantitative climatic estimations of temperature and precipitation. Results show highly variable climatic shifts between archaeological levels, being consistent with the climatic fluctuations observed in the marine and ice core records. Small mammal assemblages reveal a mosaic landscape of open meadows followed by scattered forested areas. A progressive trend towards aridity from the end of the Mousterian to the early Aurignacian is reflected by changes in arboreal pollen, macromammal species and stable isotopes evidence on ungulates consumed by late Neanderthals and Anatomically Modern Humans in the region. This review suggests a decrease in temperatures and rainfall from 48,000 to 44,000 cal BP (after Heinrich Event 5) which coincides with the late Neanderthals in the region and followed by a populational hiatus until 43,000 cal BP. Despite the multiple intra-site environmental proxies available, this study challenges the fragmentary regional record during this key period for human evolution and reveals that further research is needed to obtain a complete regional highresolution palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstruction.

AB  - In social groups, competition for individual advantage is balanced with cooperation, for the collective benefit. Selection against aggression has favored cooperation and non-aggressive competitive strategies. Because social play is a behavioral system that fluctuates between cooperation and competition, selection against aggression might have especially influenced this behavior. African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) are a low aggressive species, therefore suitable to investigate this aspect. We collected all occurrences observational audio-video data on social play, aggression/threats, and affiliation on an African elephant colony housed in a 25-ha open space at Parque de la Naturaleza de Cabarceno (Cantabria, Spain) and composed of 4 family groups (3 immature males, 3 immature females, and 7 adult females) and 2 adult males. Anticipating the influence of reduced aggression, we found that social play decreased with age, persisting in adults, and that it was highest in males. Social play was associated with affiliation (informing cooperation). Indeed, individuals that were central in the social play network were also central in the affiliation network. For immature subjects, we found a correlation between social play and affiliation sociomatrices. However, such correlation was absent in adults and social play mostly occurred between families. Despite the limitations related to dealing with a small captive group, this study largely supports the idea that the features of social play in African savannah elephants may be related to low aggression. This investigation hints toward a non-purely cooperative use of play, possibly as a non-aggressive interaction that accommodates different levels of cooperation and competition.

AB  - The Brazilian Amazon is heavily impacted by mining activities, especially by gold and cassiterite mining. Pb is a contaminant released during cassiterite extraction, and it stands out for its high toxicity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of flood pulse on Pb dynamics in four fish species with different feeding habits (Cichlapleiozona: carnivorous, Mylossomaduriventre: herbivorous, Prochilodus nigricans: detritivorous, and Serrasalmus rhombeus: piscivorous) over four hydrological periods in Puruzinho Lake (Brazilian Amazon), which receives water from the Madeira River. The risk assessment for daily Pb intake through the consumption of these fish by the local riverside population was also carried out. Fish species were sampled during four Amazonian hydrological periods: rising water, high water, falling water, and low water. Pb and stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) measurements were carried out on fish muscle. The flood pulse had the same effect on Pb concentrations of all the fish species regardless of their feeding habits, as we found a nonsignificant interaction between these variables. The Pb in fish muscle increased in the flood season (rising and high water) and decreased in the dry season (falling and low water). The Pb concentration in fish increased significantly with their trophic level (delta N-15), evidencing the occurrence of biomagnification of the element along the trophic chain (R-2 = 0.24). The main food source of the herbivorous fish (delta C-13) was very distinct from that of the others, which had a large overlap in their values. Regarding risk assessment, the daily Pb intake through consumption of the herbivorous species during high water (17.82 +/- 19.68 mu g.day(-1)) exceeded the limit determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of 12.5 mu g.day(-1), representing a health risk to the riverside population of Puruzinho Lake.

AB  - Livestock farms produce a large amount of livestock manure, which, if not disposed of properly, will become an environmental pollution source. However, limited research has been conducted on identifying livestock farms with a potential risk of environmental pollution. In this study, a model for returning livestock manure to cultivated land was constructed. Livestock manure was returned to cultivated land, and the amount of surplus livestock manure nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, in livestock farms was calculated with pig manure as an example. Then, livestock farms with a potential risk of environmental pollution in Shanggan Town and part of Xiangqian Town in Fuzhou City were identified using phosphorus as an index. Results showed that the spatial distributions of nitrogen and phosphorus from pig manure in the cultivated land varied. All cultivated lands exhibited the maximum carrying capacity for phosphorus, and 1811 cultivated lands exhibited potential nitrogen carrying capacity. A total of 13,958.997 kg of phosphorus from pig manure in 144 livestock farms could not be disposed to cultivated lands. In all, 144 livestock farms with surplus phosphorus from pig manure were identified as potential environmental pollution sources. These findings can serve as a scientific basis for the utilization of livestock manure, prevention of environmental pollution caused by livestock farms, and layout planning of livestock farms.

AB  - Simple Summary Nutrition is one of the strategies for improving animal welfare because it meets the metabolic, functional, and physical needs of animals. Tritordeum is a robust cereal with yields like different wheat varieties, with high resistance to drought, a high-temperature stress, pathogens, and low fertiliser requirements; these characteristics that make it suitable for its use in sustainable production systems with low environmental impact. In addition, it has specific properties and functionalities that are not found in any other cereal. Physiological indicators of animal welfare have been evaluated in line with the new regulatory guidelines of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, making ovine farmers aware and respectful of animal welfare, considering strategies like the inclusion of this new cereal with beneficial health effects in their livestock diets.Abstract Tritordeum is a new cereal resistant to drought and high temperatures, and it is a very healthy crop. The aim of this study was to compare two different diets (tritordeum meadow vs. oat meadow) for grazing pregnant ewes to determine if there was any effect on the objective physiological indicators of animal welfare. A total of 150 pregnant Merino ewes (3-5 years) were randomly divided into two groups (n = 75 each) to be fed with two different meadows, being evaluated during the spring season. Red blood cells count, haemoglobin, packed cell volume, white blood cell count, neutrophiles/lymphocytes ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, cortisol, total plasma proteins, albumin, globulins, albumin/globulins ratio, alkaline phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase, IgA, and IgG were determined. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the welfare of pregnant ewes fed with tritordeum meadow was better than that of pregnant ewes fed with oat meadow. Tritordeum meadow had a positive influence on the physiological parameters of animal welfare studied in pregnant Merino ewes. Therefore, tritordeum meadow can be considered a functional feed, as it has a beneficial effect on health beyond its basic nutritional value. Farmers are recommended to feed a cereal such as tritordeum grassland to their sheep, as it not only ensures that the animals benefit from all the nutrients, but also prevents diseases and improves their quality of life. In addition, the cereal's resistance to fungal diseases makes it suitable for use in sustainable production systems with a reduced environmental footprint.

AB  - Turfgrasses hosts a diverse community of predators that contribute to herbivore suppression. However, there is little evidence that predators directly consume a common turfgrass herbivore, the billbug (Sphenophorus sp.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Given low rates of direct consumption by predators, prospects for strong non-consumptive effects in billbugs were underappreciated. However, this assumed lack of non-consumptive effects presupposes that herbivorous prey, like billbugs, can identify predators and the level of threat that they pose. Here, we examined this assumption and quantified the extent to which exposure to predators and predator cues altered the behavior (predator avoidance, feeding, and mating) of bluegrass billbug, Sphenophorus parvulus Gyllenhal. First, using a series of behavioral assays within microcosms, we exposed billbugs to predators - Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) (Coleoptera: Carabidae), Harpalus sp. (Coleoptera: Carabidae), Philonthus sp. (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), and Hogna sp. (Araneae: Lycosidae) - singly and in combination to measure the effect of contact with predators and potential synergy among predator species pairs. Indirect exposure to predators, predator odor, and non-predatory arthropods were also used to measure effects of various predator cues on billbug behavior. In subsequent Y-tube choice assays we determined whether billbugs discriminated between filtered air and predator odor to isolate chemical signaling as a potential mechanism for billbug predator detection. Direct exposure to predators increased billbug predator avoidance (up to 201%), and decreased billbug feeding (down to -78%), though no predation was observed. Similar behavioral changes were observed when billbugs were exposed indirectly to a predator, and to predator odor. In Y-tube assays billbugs avoided predator odor, further suggesting billbugs use chemical cues to detect predator presence and that these may be a driver in their observed behavior. Our results show that billbugs exhibit strong non-consumptive effects, even in the absence of strong direct consumptive effects. These results provide the foundation for further research concerning the role of chemical signaling in billbug predator detection.

AB  - Flower colour polymorphisms are uncommon but widespread among angiosperms and can be maintained by a variety of balancing selection mechanisms. Anemone palmata is mostly yellow-flowered, but white-flowered plants coexist in some populations.<br /> We analysed the distribution of colour morphs of A. palmata across its range. We also characterised their colours and compared their vegetative and sexual reproductive traits, pollinator attention and fitness.<br /> The range of A. palmata is limited to the Western Mediterranean, while white-flowered plants are restricted to Portugal and SW Spain, where they occur at low proportions. Yellow flowers have a characteristic UV pattern, with a UV-absorbing centre and UV-reflecting periphery, which is absent in the white morph. Colour features of both morphs were highly delineated, making it easy for pollinators to distinguish them. Both morphs were protogynous, with the same duration of sexual stages, and the main floral traits related to pollinator attraction, apart from flower colour, were similar. Hymenoptera and Diptera were the main pollinators, showing preference for the yellow morph, clear partitioning of pollinator groups between the two colour morphs and a marked constancy to flower colour during foraging. Both morphs combined clonal propagation with sexual reproduction, but sexual reproductive potential was lower in white-flowered plants. Finally, female fitness was higher in the yellow morph.<br /> Pollinator partitioning and colour constancy could maintain this polymorphism, despite the lower visitation rate and fitness of white-flowered plants, which could facilitate their clonal propagation.

AB  - Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurosteroids, including allopregnanolone (ALLO), play critical roles in modulating neuronal activity in the brain. Levels of these compounds dynamically fluctuate in response to physiological and environmental conditions, particularly stress, suggesting complex regulatory interactions. This study aimed to explore the effects of acute stress and ALLO (individually and combined) on hippocampal expression of BDNF, its TrkB receptor, and other neurotrophins in sheep, a translational large animal model. Adult, luteal-phase sheep (n = 24), implanted with a guide cannula into the third brain ventricle, were divided into four experimental groups: (i) 3 days of Ringer-Locke solution (RL) infusion as the control; (ii) 3 days of RL infusion with 4 h acute stress on day three; (iii) 3 days of ALLO infusion (4 x 15 mu g/60 mu L/30 min) with 4 h acute stress on day three; and (iv) 3 days of ALLO infusion alone (n = 6 per group). Both acute stress and ALLO alone significantly reduced BDNF concentration and BDNF transcript abundance in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 fields compared to the control group. The combined application of both stress and ALLO resulted in decreased levels of these parameters, except for BDNF concentration in the CA3 region. Additionally, TrkB mRNA expression in both hippocampal fields was significantly reduced in all treatment groups. Changes in mRNA levels for other neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and 4 (NT4), varied under experimental conditions. While an inhibitory effect was predominant, NGF expression in the CA1 region remained unaffected by stress or ALLO. Interestingly, stress alone induced a significant increase in NT4 mRNA expression in the CA3 field compared to the control. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that a 4 h acute stress exposure inhibited the synthesis of BDNF, TrkB, and several other neurotrophins in the sheep hippocampus. Furthermore, ALLO, whose increased levels are highly correlated with the initial stress response, may serve as a mediator of this stress effect, temporarily preventing over-stimulation of hippocampal BDNF release and signaling.

AB  - Coastal polynyas are key formation regions for dense shelf water (DSW) that ultimately contributes to the ventilation of the ocean abyss. However, not all polynyas form DSW. We examine how the physiographic setting, water-mass distribution and transformation, water column stratification, and sea-ice production regulate DSW formation in four East Antarctic coastal polynyas. We use a salt budget to estimate the relative contribution of sea-ice production and lateral advection to the monthly change in salinity in each polynya. DSW forms in Mackenzie polynya due to a combination of physical features (shallow water depth and a broad continental shelf) and high sea-ice production. Sea-ice formation begins early (March) in Mackenzie polynya, counteracting fresh advection and establishing a salty mixed layer in autumn that preconditions the water column for deep convection in winter. Sea-ice production is moderate in the other three polynyas, but saline DSW is not formed (a fresh variety is formed in the Barrier polynya). In the Shackleton polynya, brine rejection during winter is insufficient to overcome the very fresh autumn mixed layer. In Vincennes Bay, a strong inflow of modified Circumpolar Deep Water stratifies the water column, hindering deep convection and DSW formation. Our study highlights that DSW formation in a given polynya depends on a complex combination of factors, some of which may be strongly altered under a changing climate, with potentially important consequences for the ventilation of the deep ocean, the global meridional overturning circulation, and the transport of ocean heat to Antarctic ice shelves.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal polynyas are regions of open water surrounded by sea ice. As sea ice forms, it is pushed offshore by strong winds blowing from the Antarctic continent, keeping the polynya ice-free. Salt is released into the water below as sea ice forms, increasing the salinity and density of the water column. In some polynyas, this water is dense enough to sink from the continental shelf to supply a network of bottom ocean currents that influences global climate. In other polynyas, the water in winter never gets dense enough to reach the ocean abyss. Using data collected by instrumented elephant seals, we investigated the main factors controlling dense water formation in four East Antarctic polynyas. We found that dense water production is related to the strength of sea-ice formation, as expected, but also depends on the salinity at the start of winter. The geographical and physical characteristics of the polynyas and regional circulation also modulate the final water density. Our findings provide insight into how dense water formation in East Antarctic polynyas might respond to future changes in climate and thereby influence the transport of ocean heat to the Antarctic continent and the melt of ice shelves.

AB  - Simple Summary Use of BioPlus YC probiotic preparation containing specific Bacillus strains as a feed additive resulted in improved health and growth performance of fatteners due to a significant increase in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count and a decrease in the number of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacillus sp. in gut microbiota. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of probiotic bacteria Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis on microbiological properties of feed mixtures and on the digestive tract content as applicable to production traits and carcass characteristics of fatteners. The experiment was performed on 83,838 fatteners from four successive (insertions) productions in two groups. From the seventy eighth day of age till marketing to the slaughter plant, the pigs were supplied with BioPlus YC probiotic (Chr. Hansen) in the amount of 400 g/t. The preparation contained a complex of probiotic bacteria Bacillus licheniformis DSM 5749, and Bacillus subtilis DSM 5750 spores in a 1:1 ratio. From the fourth insertion, after reaching a body weight of approximately 112 kg, 60 fatteners were selected from each group to measure carcass quality and half of them for meat quality evaluation. Moreover, microbiological analyses in feed and colon were performed. The study showed that BioPlus YC probiotics supplementation resulted in a significantly higher count of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis in the feed, a higher count of B. subtilis, B. licheniformis and LAB, as well as a lower count of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacillus sp. in the mucosa and in the colorectal content of the test pigs. Our work has shown that supplementation with the BioPlus YC probiotic had a positive effect on the production traits of pigs mainly by reducing mortality (2.83%, p = 0.010), lowering feed conversion ratio-FCR (2.59 kg/kg, p = 0.013), better average daily gain-ADG (0.95 kg/day, p = 0.002) and shorter fattening period (77.25 days, p = 0.019) when compared to the control group (4.19%; 2.79 kg/kg; 0.89 kg/day; 92.8 days, respectively). The addition of the specific Bacillus bacteria did not influence carcass and meat characteristics of the test fatteners.

AB  - Simple Summary Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) is a common agricultural pest that can harm hundreds of crops. Carbohydrates and proteins are the two key nutrients affecting the development of insect populations. To study the development of the S. exigua population under different carbohydrate and protein nutrition conditions, we constructed a life table of S. exigua under different nutrient conditions: high nitrogen, medium nitrogen-medium sugar, and high sugar. The results showed that there was no significant difference in net reproductive rate among the three nutritional conditions. S. exigua on medium nitrogen-medium sugar diets had the shortest generation time and significantly higher intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase, fecundity, and predicted population at 100 days. These results suggested that an appropriate protein:carbohydrate ratio was beneficial to the rapid development of Spodoptera exigua on farmland. These findings are important for scientifically predicting the population dynamics of S. exigua and constructing a system for controlling the insect population. Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) is a common agricultural pest that can harm hundreds of crops. Nutrition conditions can significantly affect the development of insects, especially carbohydrates (C) and proteins (P), which are the two most critical nutrients. To study the development of the S. exigua population under different carbohydrate and protein nutrition conditions, we constructed a life table of both sexes of an S. exigua population under three artificial diets: high nitrogen (P:C = 7:1), medium nitrogen, medium sugar (P:C = 1:1), and high sugar (P:C = 1:7). The results showed that the generation time of S. exigua was 26.38 +/- 0.54 d under the medium nitrogen-medium sugar diet, which was the shortest among the three nutrition conditions. The intrinsic rate of increase (0.18 +/- 0.01), finite rate of increase (1.20 +/- 0.01), fecundity (605.42 +/- 36.33 eggs/female), and predicted population at 100 days (8,840,000) were significantly higher under the medium nitrogen-medium sugar condition. There was no significant difference in the net reproductive rate among the three conditions. These results suggested that an appropriate protein:carbohydrate ratio is beneficial to the rapid development of S. exigua on farmland. These findings are important for scientifically predicting the population dynamics of S. exigua from the perspective of nutritional ecology, understanding its catastrophic mechanism, and constructing a prevention and control system.

AB  - Simple Summary Myoglobin (Mb) is the sarcoplasmic heme protein primarily responsible for meat's color. The transcription pattern of the porcine Mb gene has not been studied because its genome structure information has not been officially annotated. In our study, we attempted to reveal the possible mechanism of pig-meat color formation by integrating the public data of genome and transcriptome. Myoglobin is a key chemical component that determines meat's color and affects consumers' purchase intentions. In this work, we firstly identified the promoter sequence of the Mb gene from the primary assembly of high-throughput genome sequencing in pigs, and predicted its potential transcription factors by LASAGNA. Through the data mining of the mRNA expression profile of longissimus dorsi muscle of different pig breeds, we constructed a hierarchical interplay network of Mb-TFs (Myoglobin-Transcription Factors), consisting of 16 adaptive transcription factors and 23 secondary transcription factors. The verification of gene expression in longissimus dorsi muscle showed that the Mb mRNA and encoded protein were significantly (p < 0.05) more abundant in Bama pigs than Yorkshire pigs. The qRT-PCR (Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR) validation on genes of the Mb-TFs network showed that FOS, STAT3, STAT1, NEFL21, NFE2L2 and MAFB were significant positive regulatory core transcription factors of Mb-TFs network in Bama pigs, whereas ATF3 was the secondary transcription factor most responsible for the activation of the above transcription factors. Our study provides a new strategy to unravel the mechanism of pork color formation, based on public transcriptome and genome data analysis.

AB  - Artificial insemination is widely used in swine reproductive management, allowing a single high-genetic-value male to fertilize a larger number of females. However, the dilution of spermatozoa in cooling media does not prevent oxidative processes that reduce the fertilizing capacity of sperm cells. This study investigated the effects of the antioxidant compounds cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-rutinoside, present in a & ccedil;a & iacute; extract, on sperm motility and the integrity of the plasma and acrosomal membranes of boar spermatozoa cooled to 17 degrees C for up to 168 hours and the impact of these compounds on preventing the formation of superoxide anions. Semen samples were diluted with different concentrations of these compounds and compared with a long-term extender (Vitasem (R)) and a negative control. The results were evaluated at three time points: initial (time 0), after 96 hours, and after 168 hours of cooling. Vitasem (R) maintained high levels of motility and sperm plasma membrane integrity, while the cyanidins did not provide significant improvements compared to the negative control. Statistical analysis indicated that the addition of cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-rutinoside at the tested concentrations did not result in significant improvements in sperm characteristics. These findings suggest the need to explore other concentrations and combinations of antioxidants to optimize sperm preservation during cold storage.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel. is an economically important woody oil plant native to China. To explore the genetic diversity of wild C. oleifera phenotypic traits and effectively protect these germplasm resources, this study provides a thorough evaluation of the phenotypic variability of a cluster of 143 wild C. oleifera germplasm resources. A total of 41 characters, including leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, and oil quality characters, were investigated based on the quantization of physical and chemical descriptors and digital image analysis. The findings revealed significant variations among the 41 characters with a high range of Shannon-Wiener indexes (H ') from 0.07 to 2.19. The coefficient of variation (CV) among 32 quantitative characters ranged from 5.34% to 81.31%, with an average of 27.14%. High genetic diversity was also detected among the 143 germplasm. Based on the analysis of hierarchical clustering, 143 accessions were separated into six categories. All the individuals can be clearly distinguished from each other according to the result of the principal component analysis (PCA). The M-TOPSIS exhaustive evaluation method based on correlation and PCA analyses of 32 quantitative characters was applied for the 143 wild C. oleifera accessions, and the top 10 varieties were identified as YA53, YA13, YA40, YA34, YA57, YA19, YA33, YA41, DZ8, and YA7. This research optimized the germplasm evaluation system and perfected the statistical phenotypic traits for distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) testing. Some top-notch germplasm sources were also screened for oil-tea Camellia breeding.

AB  - Simple Summary Conventional rearing systems for heavy pigs intended for Italian dry-cured ham production require pigs to be slaughtered at 160 +/- 16 kg and a minimum age of 9 months. With the current animal genetic trends providing progressively leaner animals, the conventional rearing system fails to provide pigs with optimal characteristics for the dry-cured ham industry. In this research, new combinations of age and weight at slaughter were explored, using different feeding conditions, as possible alternative rearing strategies for heavy pigs. Such alternative rearing strategies aimed to manipulate the growth rate of pigs, first allowing them to reach 160 +/- 16 kg slaughter weight at a younger age; second, allowing pigs to maximize their slaughter weight at 9 months of age; and third, inducing slow growth in the pigs to reach the 160 +/- 16 kg body weight at an older age. The first two strategies were the most promising alternatives as they improved the rate of gain, feed efficiency, and ham adiposity of the pigs. While the first strategy was the most economically convenient, the second produced the hams with the highest quality. Italian dry-cured ham production requires pigs to be slaughtered at 160 +/- 16 kg at 9 months of age (control, C). The study explored three alternatives, based on different feeding conditions: (1) allowing pigs to express their growth potential by letting them reach 160 +/- 16 kg slaughter weight (SW) at younger slaughter age (SA) (younger Age, YA); (2) allowing pigs to express their growth potential by maximizing their SW at 9 months SA (greater weight, GW); (3) increasing the SA required to reach 160 +/- 16 kg SW (older age, OA). Pigs (336 C21 Goland, 95 kg initial body weight) were slaughtered on average at 257, 230, 257, and 273 d SA and 172.7, 172.3, 192.9, and 169.3 SW kg for the four treatments, respectively. C pigs had an average daily gain (ADG) of 715 g/d and feed efficiency (FE) of 0.265 (gain to feed). Compared to C, YA pigs had higher ADG (+32%), FE (+7.5%), and better ham adiposity; GW pigs had higher carcass weight (+12%), ADG (+25%), trimmed ham weight (+10.9%), and better ham adiposity. OA treatment affected ADG (-16.4%), FE (-16.6%), and trimmed ham weight (-3.6%). YA and GW could be promising alternatives to C as they improved FE and ham quality traits.

AB  - IntroductionIndigofera L. is the third largest genus in Fabaceae and includes economically important species that are used for indigo dye-producing, medicinal, ornamental, and soil and water conservation. The genus is taxonomically difficult due to the high level of overlap in morphological characters of interspecies, fewer reliability states for classification, and extensive adaptive evolution. Previous characteristic-based taxonomy and nuclear ITS-based phylogenies have contributed to our understanding of Indigofera taxonomy and evolution. However, the lack of chloroplast genomic resources limits our comprehensive understanding of the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary processes of Indigofera. MethodsHere, we newly assembled 18 chloroplast genomes of Indigofera. We performed a series of analyses of genome structure, nucleotide diversity, phylogenetic analysis, species pairwise Ka/Ks ratios, and positive selection analysis by combining with allied species in Papilionoideae. Results and discussionThe chloroplast genomes of Indigofera exhibited highly conserved structures and ranged in size from 157,918 to 160,040 bp, containing 83 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes. Thirteen highly variable regions were identified, of which trnK-rbcL, ndhF-trnL, and ycf1 were considered as candidate DNA barcodes for species identification of Indigofera. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods based on complete chloroplast genome and protein-coding genes (PCGs) generated a well-resolved phylogeny of Indigofera and allied species. Indigofera monophyly was strongly supported, and four monophyletic lineages (i.e., the Pantropical, East Asian, Tethyan, and Palaeotropical clades) were resolved within the genus. The species pairwise Ka/Ks ratios showed values lower than 1, and 13 genes with significant posterior probabilities for codon sites were identified in the positive selection analysis using the branch-site model, eight of which were associated with photosynthesis. Positive selection of accD suggested that Indigofera species have experienced adaptive evolution to selection pressures imposed by their herbivores and pathogens. Our study provided insight into the structural variation of chloroplast genomes, phylogenetic relationships, and adaptive evolution in Indigofera. These results will facilitate future studies on species identification, interspecific and intraspecific delimitation, adaptive evolution, and the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Indigofera.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deer oil (DO), a byproduct of deer meat processing, possesses high nutritional value. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of DO on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice and to explore its potential mechanisms of action. RESULTS: DO was found to inhibit weight loss and colon shortening in colitis mice, significantly reduce disease activity index scores, and notably enhance the levels of tight junction proteins in colon tissues, thus improving intestinal barrier function. ELISA results indicated that DO markedly alleviated the mice's oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Western blot analysis further demonstrated that DO significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B while up-regulating the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins. Additionally, DO increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Odoribacter, Blautia, and Muribaculum, reduced the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Bacteroides, Helicobacter, and Escherichia-Shigella, and promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Our study provides the first evidence that DO can effectively improve DSS-induced UC in mice. The underlying mechanisms may involve maintaining intestinal barrier function, inhibiting inflammation, alleviating oxidative stress, and modulation of gut microbiota. These findings offer valuable insights for developing DO as an adjunct treatment for UC and as a functional food. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - To evaluate the interaction between dietary L-carnitine (LC) and lipid levels on the lipid metabolism, antioxidant capacity and growth of juvenile golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus), an 8-week trial was conducted. Six experimental diets were formulated by adding 0.02 % and 0.04 % LC to feeds with lipid levels of 9 %, 12 %, and 15 %, resulting in the following groups: C2L9, C4L9, C2L12, C4L12, C2L15, and C4L15. The results showed the weight gain rate and specific growth rate were significantly higher in the C4L15 group (P < 0.05), whereas the feed conversion ratio was significantly lower in the C2L12 group. Serum total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase activities were higher in the L12 and L15 groups compared to the L9 group. The expression of cpt1 and atgl mRNA in the C4L12 group was significantly upregulated, whereas the expression of acc mRNA was significantly downregulated. The levels of lipid and LC significantly influenced malondialdehyde content and superoxide dismutase activity in the liver. At the same LC level, amylase and lipase activities tended to increase with higher lipid levels. Likewise, intestinal protease activity increased with increasing LC levels at the same lipid level. At the same LC level, foregut fold height significantly increased with higher lipid levels. Additionally, intestinal wall thickness was greatest in the C2L12 group. Higher lipid levels decreased gut flora diversity and abundance, promoting the growth of the pathogenic bacterium Photobacterium. Conversely, elevated LC levels positively impacted the abundance of the beneficial bacterium Mycoplasma and effectively reduced the abundance of the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio. Therefore, adding carnitine to high-lipid diets can help reduce lipid peroxidation in the liver of T. ovatus, improve lipid and carbohydrate utilization, promote intestinal development, and enhance the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

AB  - Trichinella britovi is a parasite prevalent in the temperate regions of the vast Palearctic realm, including Iran. In this study, we investigated Trichinella infection in road-killed animals and carcasses in northern and northeastern Iran by artificial digestion. We assessed species identification and intraspecific genetic diversity using the markers 5S ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer (5S rDNA), internal transcribed spacer I (ITS1), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI). Of the 80 encountered carcasses, 10 had Trichinella infection, including seven golden jackals, one wolf, one wild cat, and one wild boar. BLAST analysis exhibited the highest similarities with T. britovi sequences in the GenBank database, at 99.79%, 99.84%, and 100% for COXI, 5S rDNA, and ITS1, respectively. All 5S rDNA sequences were identical, while analysis using DnaSP software identified eight haplotypes in the ITS1 region and six haplotypes in the COXI sequences. The phylogenetic analysis based on the COXI marker clustered all T. britovi sequences, including those from Iran, into a distinct clade. Furthermore, this marker revealed shallow branching, dividing T. britovi sequences into two subclades. The first subclade, the "European" group, consisted exclusively of haplotypes from Poland. In contrast, the second subclade, "Euro-Asiatic," included haplotypes of Asian and European origins. The Euro-Asiatic and European populations exhibited a 0.52% genetic distance while showing 0.59% and 0.15% intrapopulation divergence, respectively. Further studies involving specimens from other regions of Iran, particularly the southeast adjoining the Oriental zoogeographical zone, could provide additional insights into the molecular identity and population structures of T. britovi and potentially other species in Iran.

AB  - The present work was designed to investigate whether fenofibrate could ameliorate olanzapine deleterious effect on insulin resistance via its effect on fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21)-adiponectin axis without affecting olanzapine antipsychotic effect in postweaning socially isolated reared female rats. Treatment with olanzapine (6 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or fenofibrate (100 mg/kg, orally) have been started 5 weeks after isolation, then behavioral tests, hippocampal content of neurotransmitters, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were assessed. Moreover, insulin resistance, lipid profile, FGF-21, adiponectin, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers of adipose tissue were assessed. Treatment of isolated-reared animals with olanzapine, or fenofibrate significantly ameliorated the behavioral and biochemical changes induced by postweaning social isolation. Co-treatment showed additive effects in improving hippocampal BDNF level. Besides, fenofibrate reduced the elevation in weight gain, adiposity index, insulin resistance, lipid profile, and FGF-21 level induced by olanzapine treatment. Also, fenofibrate increased adiponectin level which was reduced upon olanzapine treatment. Moreover, fenofibrate improved both adipose tissue oxidative stress and inflammatory markers elevation as a result of olanzapine treatment. Fenofibrate could ameliorate olanzapine-induced insulin resistance without affecting its central effect in isolated reared rats via its action on FGF-21-adiponectin axis.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is a function operating in three successive phases: encoding (sample trial), holding (delay), and retrieval (test trial) of information. Studies point to a possible implication of the thalamic reuniens nucleus (Re) in spatial WM (SWM). In which of the aforementioned 3 phases the Re has a function is largely unknown. Recently, in a delayed SWM water-escape task, we found that performance during the retrieval trial correlated positively with c-Fos expression in the Re nucleus, suggesting participation in retrieval. Here, we used the same task and muscimol (MUSC) inhibition or DREADD(hM4Di)-mediated inhibition of the Re during information encoding, right thereafter (thereby affecting the holding phase), or during the retrieval trial. A 6-hour delay separated encoding from retrieval. Concerning SWM, MUSC in the Re nucleus did not alter performance, be it during or after encoding, or during evaluation. CNO administered before encoding in DREADD-expressing rats was also ineffective, although CNO-induced inhibition disrupted set shifting performance, as found previously (Quet et al., Brain Struct Function 225, 2020), thereby validating DREADD efficiency. These findings are the first that do not support an implication of the Re nucleus in SWM. As most previous studies used T-maze alternation tasks, which carry high proactive interference risks, an important question to resolve now is whether the Re nucleus is required in (T-maze alternation) tasks using very short information-holding delays (seconds to minutes), and less so in other short-term spatial memory tasks with longer information holding intervals (hours) and therefore reduced interference risks.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a significant air pollutant with major environmental and health impacts, largely attributed to agriculture. Pig production is a major contributor, accounting for 25% of livestock NH3 emissions. This study developed a new system based on gas-permeable membranes (GPM) technology for NH3 recovery from the atmosphere obtaining a solution of ammonium sulfate as the resulting fertilizer product. Various experimental configurations were evaluated in the novel system using a synthetic NH3-emitting solution. The optimal arrangement was a GPM system with recirculation of the generated NH3 and without recirculation of the acidic trapping solution, yielding a nitrogen (N) recovery rate of up to 237 g m-2 d-1. Subsequent tests using pig manure (PM) at varying durations achieved rates of up to 73 g m-2 d-1, representing a four-fold increase in N capture efficiency compared to previous research. The influence of manure temperature on NH3 emission and capture were analyzed, simulating the possible differences between seasons (summer and winter), and revealing higher N recovery rates at elevated temperatures. At 21.5 degrees C, the recovery rate was 7.7 g m-2 d-1, while increased temperatures of 38.8 degrees C and 49.3 degrees C yielded rates of 15.9 and 27.2 g m-2 d-1, respectively.

TI  - Protective Effect of CXCR4 Antagonist DBPR807 against Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in a Rat and Porcine Model of Myocardial Infarction: Potential Adjunctive Therapy for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

AB  - CXCR4 antagonists have been claimed to reduce mortality after myocardial infarction in myocardial infarction (MI) animals, presumably due to suppressing inflammatory responses caused by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, thus, subsequently facilitating tissue repair and cardiac function recovery. This study aims to determine whether a newly designed CXCR4 antagonist DBPR807 could exert better vascular-protective effects than other clinical counterparts (e.g., AMD3100) to alleviate cardiac damage further exacerbated by reperfusion. Consequently, we find that instead of traditional continuous treatment or multiple-dose treatment at different intervals of time, a single-dose treatment of DBPR807 before reperfusion in MI animals could attenuate inflammation via protecting oxidative stress damage and preserve vascular/capillary density and integrity via mobilizing endothelial progenitor cells, leading to a desirable fibrosis reduction and recovery of cardiac function, as evaluated with the LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) in infarcted hearts in rats and mini-pigs, respectively. Thus, it is highly suggested that CXCR4 antagonists should be given at a single high dose prior to reperfusion to provide the maximal cardiac functional improvement. Based on its favorable efficacy and safety profiles indicated in tested animals, DBPR807 has a great potential to serve as an adjunctive medicine for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) therapies in acute MI patients.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) leaves are an important beverage crop due to their high caffeine content. Although the north of Iran is the main region for high-quality tea plants, there is no document on variations of phenotypic traits of different accessions. The present study was to assess the biodiversity of 12 tea accessions originating from four tea main sites in Iran (Langroud, Siahkal, Kobijar and Bazkiaguorab) using multivariate analysis. Two-year-old tea plants were cultivated in a completely randomized design with five replicates in a greenhouse. One year after plant establishment, phenotypic characteristics were studied. The tea accessions showed different responses in chlorophyll and total ash contents. The highest and lowest amount of caffeine in tea accessions was found in Kobijar A7 and Langroud A2, respectively. Epicatechin was obtained in a 6.48-15.44 mg g(-1) range, and the maximum variability was found in epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), differing from 0.94 to 21.03 mg g(-1). Langroud A2 and Bazkiaguorab A11 contained the maximum EGCG and the total polyphenolic content in Bazkiaguorab was greater than other accessions. Heat map analysis showed the maximum variability of EGCG, catechin, and GA among the accessions. The main essential oil compounds were 2-pentyl furan followed by hexanal, gamma-terpinene, octane, ortho-cymene, terpinen-4-ol, alpha-copaene and E-caryophyllene. In conclusion, changes in phytochemical traits caused by genetics and origin can significantly alter the quality of tea compounds. The results of this study can be utilized as raw materials in future breeding projects to improve new cultivars with superior characteristics.

AB  - Slow hydrolysis persistently affects the anaerobic digestion of animal manure. Thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic treatments introduced into a two-stage anaerobic process treating pig manure were investigated, with a single-stage mesophilic process as a control. The results from the 100-day experiment showed the thermophilic-mesophilic system had the highest removal efficiency of volatile solids at 60.8%, 18% higher than the single-stage process. The thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic hydrolysis reactors contributed 23.5% and 21.7% solubilization of chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively. The hydrolysis efficiency achieved in the single process was 49.7%, which was lower than the hydrolysis in the two-stage processes. Approximately 60% of COD was distributed in the solid fraction in the first stage, and more than half of the particle COD continued to hydrolyze in the subsequent second stage. The mass balance of COD and volatile solids removal performance illustrated the advantages of the temperature-phased process. Comparatively, the three mesophilic reactors all had strong stability.

AB  - Evaluating the efficacy of management actions to control invasive species is crucial for maintaining funding and to provide feedback for the continual improvement of management efforts. However, it is often difficult to assess the efficacy of control methods due to limited resources for monitoring. Managers may view effort on monitoring as effort taken away from performing management actions. We developed a method to estimate invasive species abundance, evaluate management effectiveness, and evaluate population growth over time from a combination of removal activities (e.g., trapping, ground shooting) using only data collected during removal efforts (method of removal, date, location, number of animals removed, and effort). This dynamic approach allows for abundance estimation at discrete time points and the estimation of population growth between removal periods. To test this approach, we simulated over 1 million conditions, including varying the length of the study, the size of the area examined, the number of removal events, the capture rates, and the area impacted by removal efforts. Our estimates were unbiased (within 10% of truth) 81% of the time and were correlated with truth 91% of the time. This method performs well overall and, in particular, at monitoring trends in abundances over time. We applied this method to removal data from Mingo National Wildlife Refuge in Missouri from December 2015 to September 2019, where the management objective is elimination. Populations of feral swine on Mingo NWR have fluctuated over time but showed marked declines in the last 3-6 months of the time series corresponding to increased removal pressure. Our approach allows for the estimation of population growth across time (from both births and immigration) and therefore, provides a target removal rate (above that of the population growth) to ensure the population will decline. In Mingo NWR, the target monthly removal rate is 18% to cause a population decline. Our method provides advancement over traditional removal modeling approaches because it can be applied to evaluate management programs that use a broad range of removal techniques concurrently and whose management effort and spatial coverage vary across time.

AB  - Growing evidences show a direct link between diarrhea and disorders of gut microbiota in pigs. However, whether there are microbial markers associated with post-weaning diarrhea remains unknown. In the current study, we compared the microbial community, functions and metabolites between healthy weaned piglets (group H, n=7) and piglets with post-weaning diarrhea (group D, n=7), in order to find out diarrhea associated microbial markers. Each of 7 fecal samples was collected from H and D piglets (weaned at 21 d and sampled at 26 d). The metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed that the microbial composition, function and metabolic profile in D pigs was considerably reshaped, including the reduced abundance and number of Bacteroides, which significantly correlated with the diarrhea status of host. The carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis and metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and the activity of glycan and carbohydrates digestion related enzymes showed extensively down-regulated in D pigs compared with H pigs. Diarrhea significantly changed the metabolic profiles of fecal microbiota, and most of the altered metabolites were negatively or positively correlated with the change in the abundance of Bacteroides. In conclusion, the lower abundance of Bacteroides and its associated metabolic dysfunction may be regarded as microbial markers of physiological post-weaning diarrhea in piglets.

   In the current study, we present the first record of twin-spot centurion fly larvae, Sargus bipunctatus (Scopoli, 1763), feeding on a human corpse. The morphology of collected imagines and larvae of S. bipunctatus was documented, and a standard COI barcode sequence was obtained. Morphology- and DNA-based methods were used to distinguish the larvae of S. bipunctatus and its relative, Hermetia illucens (Linnaeus, 1758). The potential of S. bipunctatus for practical applications in forensic entomology is currently difficult to assess.
   The only European Stratiomyidae species known for feeding on human corpses was the black soldier fly Hermetia illucens (Linnaeus, 1758). Analysis of fauna found on a human corpse, discovered in central Poland, revealed the presence of feeding larvae of another species from this family: the twin-spot centurion fly Sargus bipunctatus (Scopoli, 1763). The investigated corpse was in a stage of advanced decomposition. The larvae were mainly observed in the adipocere formed on the back and lower limbs of the corpse, and in the mixture of litter and lumps of adipocere located under the corpse. Adult specimens and larvae were identified based on morphological characters, and final identification was confirmed using DNA barcoding. Implementing a combination of morphological and molecular methods provided a reliable way for distinguishing the larvae of S. bipunctatus and H. illucens. The potential of S. bipunctatus for practical applications in forensic entomology is currently difficult to assess. Wide and reliable use of S. bipunctatus in the practice of forensic entomology requires further studies of the bionomy of this fly.

AB  - Background and aimsThe ability of plant microbial symbionts to enhance hosts<acute accent> fitness depends on the abiotic and biotic context, including the presence of co-existing symbionts. We studied how the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) affects the performance of a host grass associated or not with fungal asexual endophytes, growing either alone or in interaction with a legume hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria. We hypothesized that the presence of legume-rhizobia symbiosis enables endophytes and AMF to promote host grass growth and nutrition, as well as host and symbionts fitness through nitrogen acquisition-mediated effects even when their primary benefits (herbivore protection and phosphorous provision) are not required.MethodsIn pots with sterile, nitrogen-limited soil either inoculated or not with AMF, we grew Lolium multiflorum grass plants associated or not with a vertically-transmitted endophyte (Epichlo & euml; occultans), either in monocultures or in mixtures with rhizobia-inoculated Trifolium repens.ResultsIn monocultures, grass C, N and P acquisition were reduced by AMF. Conversely, in mixtures with legumes, AMF increased grass growth, soil N uptake, and transfer of biologically fixed N from the legume to the grass. Endophyte and AMF both decreased grass fitness, but endophyte presence increased AMF spore density.ConclusionsAMF can increase nitrogen transfer and increase grass growth, a benefit that relies on the presence of rhizobia-associated neighboring legumes. Notably, the fitness of plants and symbionts does not always align with the benefits provided to each other. The success of each host or symbiont may depend on their ability to capitalize on the benefits.

AB  - African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) are a critically endangered and visually cryptic species that inhabits Central African rainforests. Using a 1250 sq-km grid of 50 acoustic sensors in Republic of Congo, we investigated the landscape-scale behavioural response of forest elephants to poaching events. We detected eight automatic weapon fire events over 1.5 years of recording (2017-2019). We examined detections of elephant vocalisations across grid sites within 10 km of the gunfire events in the 48 h surrounding the gunfire, and in paired 48-h control periods free of gunfire. Fewer vocalisations were detected before gunfire events than during control periods, suggesting elephants show behavioural responses to poacher presence before any shots are fired. Immediately following the gunfire events, a significant increase in elephant calls was detected, which may indicate increased communication to facilitate group cohesion and movement. Elevated call levels dropped to lower-than-baseline rates after several hours, suggestive of a sustained response. These patterns indicate forest elephants respond to both poacher presence and to gunfire events themselves. As these patterns may reflect behaviours that mediate population processes, conservation strategies should account for the potential of poaching to impact populations via indirect effects on nontarget elephants in the area.

AB  - Members of the SH3- and ankyrin repeat (SHANK) protein family are considered as master scaffolds of the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. Several missense mutations within the canonical SHANK3 isoform have been proposed as causative for the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, there is a surprising paucity of data linking missense mutation-induced changes in protein structure and dynamics to the occurrence of ASD-related synaptic phenotypes. In this proof-of-principle study, we focus on two ASD-associated point mutations, both located within the same domain of SHANK3 and demonstrate that both mutant proteins indeed show distinct changes in secondary and tertiary structure as well as higher conformational fluctuations. Local and distal structural disturbances result in altered synaptic targeting and changes of protein turnover at synaptic sites in rat primary hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Simple Summary An understanding of the way that animals respond to heat stress is key to the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for a changing climate. The response of mammals to heat exposure involves changes at every level of organization from molecular and cellular to systemic and behavioral. The concert of events involves many genes and gene products. The Na+/K+ ATPase proportional to 1 (ATP1A1), a product of the ATP1A1 gene, is important for the response to heat because it determines the activity of the Na+/K+ pump that is ubiquitous in cell membranes. It was shown recently that ATP1A1 is important in combating the oxidative stress that a cell faces and that it modulates the Src signaling pathway that is involved in the response to many stressors. Vechur cattle (dwarf Bos taurus indicus) are well known for their adaptability to the tropical heat and humidity that persists in their native state of Kerala, India. We here analyze the comparative expression profile of the ATP1A1 gene in heat-tolerant Vechur and Kasaragod (another dwarf B. t. indicus) cattle and a heat-intolerant crossbreed (B. t. taurus x B. t. indicus) and characterize the sequence of ATP1A1 mRNA in the Vechur genotype. Environmental stress and heat tolerance were measured. Expression profiling indicated that ATP1A1 was differentially expressed in the phenotypically disparate cattle breeds. A molecular evolutionary genetic analysis revealed that the divergent origin of dwarf cattle was adaptive in response to heat stress and suggests the potential use of ATP1A1 as a marker for heat tolerance. Climate change is an imminent threat to livestock production. One adaptation strategy is selection for heat tolerance. While it is established that the ATP1A1 gene and its product play an important role in the response to many stressors, there has been no attempt to characterize the sequence or to perform expression profiling of the gene in production animals. We undertook a field experiment to compare the expression profiles of ATP1A1 in heat-tolerant Vechur and Kasaragod cattle (Bos taurus indicus) with the profile of a heat-susceptible crossbreed (B. t. taurus x B. t. indicus). The cattle were exposed to heat stress while on pasture in the hot summer season. The environmental stress was quantified using the temperature humidity index (THI), while the heat tolerance of each breed was assessed using a heat tolerance coefficient (HTC). The ATP1A1 mRNA of Vechur cattle was amplified from cDNA and sequenced. The HTC varied significantly between the breeds and with time-of-day (p < 0.01). The breed-time-of-day interaction was also significant (p < 0.01). The relative expression of ATP1A1 differed between heat-tolerant and heat-susceptible breeds (p = 0.02). The expression of ATP1A1 at 08:00, 10:00 and 12:00, and the breed-time-of-day interaction, were not significant. The nucleotide sequence of Vechur ATP1A1 showed 99% homology with the B. t. taurus sequence. The protein sequence showed 98% homology with B. t. taurus cattle and with B. grunniens (yak) and 97.7% homology with Ovis aries (sheep). A molecular clock analysis revealed evidence of divergent adaptive evolution of the ATP1A1 gene favoring climate resilience in Vechur cattle. These findings further our knowledge of the relationship between the ATP1A1 gene and heat tolerance in phenotypically incongruent animals. We propose that ATP1A1 could be used in marker assisted selection (MAS) for heat tolerance.

AB  - Among insects, female oviposition preferences are critical to understanding the evolutionary dynamics between herbivores and hosts. Previous studies have shown Drosophila resource use has a strong genetic basis, although there is evidence that preferences are adaptable given isolation from ancestral hosts. Given the high degree of adaptability and behavioral plasticity of invasive species, we were interested in the mechanisms affecting host preferences of the invasive fruit fly, Drosophila suzukii, which in recent years has developed a nearly global range infesting small fruit crops. We studied the diet hierarchies of D. suzukii using a combination of laboratory and field assays designed to assess how female oviposition host choice differs given the availability of, and experience with, different fruit and non-fruit hosts. We found that host preferences did not shift over time and flies reared on two differential isolated diets up to F5 behaved and performed similarly regardless of diet lineage. Rather, female host choice appeared guided by a fixed hierarchical system of host preferences. Raspberry was more preferred to mushroom, which was more preferred to goose manure. However, if preferred resources were absent, the use of less-preferred resources was compensatory. We suggest that among niche specialists, such as D. suzukii, these hierarchies may support a bet-hedging strategy, rather than multiple-niche polymorphism, allowing for niche separation during periods of increased competition, while maintaining more diverse, ancestral feeding behaviors when preferred resources are scarce.

AB  - Ovaries are important endocrine organs in female animals that secrete various steroid hormones, which are involved in multiple physiological functions. Estrogen, one of the hormones secreted by ovaries, is essential for the overall maintenance of muscle growth and development. However, the molecular mechanisms that affect muscle growth and development in sheep following ovariectomy remain unclear. In this study, we identified 1662 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and 40 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in sheep that underwent ovariectomy compared with those that underwent sham surgery. A total of 178 DEG-DEM pairs were negatively correlated. GO and KEGG analysis showed that PPP1R13B was involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which was essential for muscle development. Using in vitro experiments, we examined the effect of PPP1R13B on myoblast proliferation and found that overexpression or inhibition of PPP1R13B increased or decreased the expression of myoblast proliferation markers, respectively. PPP1R13B was identified as a func-tional downstream target of miR-485-5p. Our results suggested that miR-485-5p promoted myoblast proliferation by regulating proliferation factors in myoblasts by targeting PPP1R13B. Notably, exogenous estradiol supple-mentation to myoblasts regulated the expression of oar-miR-485-5p and PPP1R13B and promoted myoblast proliferation. These results provided new insights into the molecular mechanism by which ovaries influence muscle growth and development in sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary The level of supplementation of low-quality forage diets before and in the early gestation period may influence the performance of different hair sheep breeds. Dorper, Katahdin, and St. Croix sheep consumed wheat straw ad libitum supplemented with 0.15% initial body weight (BW) of soybean meal or a 1:3 mixture of soybean meal and rolled corn at 1% BW for 162 days with 84 or 97 days pre-breeding. Supplement treatment by breed did not generally influence feed intake, BW, body condition and mass indexes, or reproductive performance. Although soybean meal given alone boosted straw intake, it resulted in lower total feed intake, litter size, and total litter birth weight compared with the higher level of supplementation. Body condition score and mass indexes and BW were affected by breed, but reproductive performance was not influenced. Therefore, hair sheep regardless of breed fed low-protein and high-fiber forage such as wheat straw should be supplemented at a higher level with consideration of the inclusion of a feedstuff(s) high in energy along with protein during these physiological periods. Female hair sheep, 27 Dorper (DOR), 41 Katahdin (KAT), and 39 St. Croix (STC), were used to determine influences of the nutritional plane before breeding and in early gestation on feed intake, body weight, body condition score, body mass indexes, blood constituent concentrations, and reproductive performance. There were 35 multiparous and 72 primiparous sheep, with initial ages of 5.6 +/- 0.25 years and 1.5 +/- 0.01 years, respectively (average overall initial age of 2.8 +/- 0.20 years). Wheat straw (4% crude protein; dry matter [DM] basis) was consumed ad libitum and supplemented with approximately 0.15% initial body weight (BW) of soybean meal (LS) or a 1:3 mixture of soybean meal and rolled corn at 1% BW (HS; DM). The supplementation period was 162 days, with the breeding of animals in two sets sequentially, with the pre-breeding period 84 and 97 days, and that after breeding began at 78 and 65 days, respectively. Wheat straw DM intake (1.75, 1.30, 1.57, 1.15, 1.80, and 1.38% BW; SEM = 0.112) was lower (p < 0.05), but average daily gain (-46, 42, -44, 70, -47, and 51 g for DOR-LS, DOR-HS, KAT-LS, KAT-HS, STC-LS, and STC-HS, respectively; SEM = 7.3) was greater (p < 0.05) for HS than LS treatment during the supplementation period. Additionally, changes in body condition score during the supplementation period (-0.61, 0.36, -0.53, 0.27, -0.39, and -0.18; SEM = 0.058), and changes in body mass index based on height at the withers and body length from the point of the shoulder to the pin bone (BW/[height x length], g/cm(2)) from 7 days before supplementation (day -7) to day 162 were -1.99, 0.07, -2.19, -0.55, -2.39, and 0.17 for DOR-LS, DOR-HS, KAT-LS, KAT-HS, STC-LS, and STC-HS, respectively; (SEM = 0.297) were affected by supplement treatment. All blood constituent concentrations and characteristics addressed varied with the day of sampling (-7, 14, 49, 73, and 162) as well as the interaction between the supplement treatment and the day (p < 0.05), with few effects of interactions involving breed. Birth rate (66.7, 93.5, 84.6, 95.5, 82.8, and 100.0; SEM = 9.83) and individual lamb birth weight (4.50, 4.61, 4.28, 3.98, 3.73, and 3.88 kg; SEM = 0.201) were not affected by supplement treatment (p = 0.063 and 0.787, respectively), although litter size (0.92, 1.21, 1.17, 1.86, 1.12, and 1.82; SEM = 0.221) and total litter birth weight (5.84, 5.74, 5.92, 7.52, 5.
   04, and 6.78 kg for DOR-LS, DOR-HS, KAT-LS, KAT-HS, STC-LS, and STC-HS, respectively; SEM = 0.529) were greater (p < 0.05) for HS than for LS. In conclusion, although there was some compensation in wheat straw intake for the different levels of supplementation, soybean meal given alone rather than with cereal grain adversely affected BW, BCS, BMI, and reproductive performance, the latter primarily through litter size but also via a trend for an effect on the birth rate. Hence, the supplementation of low-protein and high-fiber forage such as wheat straw should include a consideration of the inclusion of a feedstuff(s) high in energy in addition to nitrogen.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effects of mammary inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) infusions on pregnancy function during early pregnancy in goats. In Experiment 1, pregnant goats were subjected to an intramammary LPS infusion for 1 week from Days 60-66 after natural mating (n = 5), and in Experiment 2, they received intramammary infusions of either saline, LPS, or SA for 1 week from Days 45-51 after natural mating (n = 15). Blood was collected to determine the plasma cytokine, cortisol, 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin F2 alpha (PGFM), and progesterone levels. Pregnancy length was significantly longer in the LPS-treated group than that for the saline-treated group of experiment 2. Cytokine levels (IL1(i, IL-8, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha: TNF-alpha) after LPS (in both Experiments 1 and 2) and SA (in Experiment 2) infusion were significantly higher compared with those before infusion. In Experiment 2, the SA-infused group showed significantly higher TNF-alpha concentrations than those in the saline group. Cortisol levels increased in both experiment 1 and 2 after LPS infusion, but not after saline and SA treatments. Furthermore, PGFM levels increased after LPS infusion in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, LPS- and SA-infused goats showed significantly higher PGFM levels than those in the saline-infused goats. However, the progesterone levels decreased after LPS treatment in Experiment 1. Our results show that intramammary LPS infusion during the early stage of pregnancy in goats induces inflammatory cytokine and stress hormone production, which prolongs the pregnancy period.

AB  - Cow's milk allergy is a common food allergy, with the milk protein alpha(S1)-casein being a major allergen. This study aimed to investigate differences in sensitization between cow and goat alpha(S1)-CN. Cow and goat alpha(S1)-CN were labeled with fluorescent dyes and given to mice sensitized with cholera toxin adjuvant. Both proteins reached immune organs, suggesting no major difference in digestion. However, compared with goat alpha(S1)-CN, cow alpha(S1)-CN is more readily taken up by dendritic cells, inducing dendritic cell maturation. Furthermore, cow alpha(S1)-CN can more effectively induce the generation of Th2 cells, leading to a higher production of specific IgE. In a Caco-2/RBL-2H3 cell model, cow alpha(S1)-CN caused more mast cell degranulation and loss of epithelial barrier integrity than goat alpha(S1)-CN. In summary, this study found differences in immune responses between cow and goat milk alpha(S1)-CN. Cow alpha(S1)-CN elicited stronger dendritic cell and Th2 responses, leading to increased mast cell degranulation.

AB  - Hybrid cropping systems generally depend on insect pollinators to produce high quality yields. In this study, we identified the floral insect community of Australian carrot agroecosystems and evaluated how the location of plants within fields and select environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity) impacted visitor abundance to carrot flowers. We further evaluated the pollination effectiveness of select insect visitors based on the time of day the pollination event took place. Out of 26,083 carrot floral visitors observed, we identified 52 different insects (33 species and 19 morphospecies) from 26 families. Of these visitors, 86 % belonged to the families Coccinellidae (Coleoptera), Apidae (Hymenoptera), Halictidae (Hymenoptera), and Syrphidae (Diptera). Wild variegated lady beetles (Hippodamia variegata Goeze, 1777) were the most abundant floral visitor observed on hybrid parent lines, while European honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758) were the most abundant visitor of open-pollinated lines. The abundance of common bee, beetle, and fly taxa differed throughout the day (range: 05:00-17:00) based on temperature (10.5 degrees C to 39.5 degrees C) and relative humidity (19.7 %-94.7 %). Further, temporal complementary was observed in measures of pollination performance as A. mellifera and the European drone fly, Eristalis tenax (Linnaeus, 1758), deposited more pollen grains onto hybrid carrot floral stigmas compared to the native halictid bee Lasioglossum cognatum (Smith, 1853) before 12:00 (05:00-12:00), while L. cognatum deposited more pollen grains onto flowers compared to A. mellifera and E. tenax after 12:00 (12:00 and 17:00). The results of this study imply that integrated management practices to support the resource needs of wild bee and fly taxa can potentially provide increased pollination services to carrot seed crops.

AB  - Introduction: Embryonic growth and development require efficient respiratory gas exchange. Internal incubation of developing young thus presents a significant physiological challenge, because respiratory gas diffusion to embryos is impeded by the additional barrier of parental tissue between the embryo and the environment. Therefore, live-bearing species exhibit a variety of adaptations facilitating respiratory gas exchange between the parent (usually the mother) and embryos. Syngnathid fishes are the only vertebrates to exhibit male pregnancy, allowing comparative studies of the biology and evolution of internal incubation of embryos, independent of the female reproductive tract. Here, we examine the fleshy, sealed, seahorse brood pouch, and provide the first quantification of structural changes to this gestational organ across pregnancy.
   Methods: We used histological analysis and morphometrics to quantify the surface area for exchange across the brood pouch epithelium, and the structure of the vascular bed of the brood pouch.
   Results: We show dramatic remodelling of gestational tissues as pregnancy progresses, including an increase in tortuosity of the gestational epithelium, an increase in capillary density, and a decrease in diffusion distance between capillaries and the pouch lumen.
   Discussion: These changes produce an increased surface area and expansion of the vascular bed of the placenta that likely facilitates respiratory gas exchange. These changes mirror the remodelling of gestational tissue in viviparous amniotes and elasmobranchs, and provide further evidence of the convergence of adaptations to support pregnancy in live-bearing animals.

AB  - The economic efficiency of sheep breeding can be improved by enhancing sheep productivity. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) unveiled the potential impact of the MAST4 gene on prolificacy traits in Australian White sheep (AUW)). Herein, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 26 different sheep breeds worldwide (n = 1507), including diverse meat, wool, milk, or dual-purpose sheep breed types from China, Europe, and Africa, were used. Moreover, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping of the MAST4 gene polymorphisms in (n = 566) Australian white sheep (AUW) was performed. The 3 identified polymorphisms were not homogeneously distributed across the 26 examined sheep breeds. Findings revealed prevalent polymorphisms (P3-ins-29 bp and P6-del-21 bp) with varying frequencies (0.02 to 0.97) across 26 breeds, while P5-del-24 bp was presented in 24 out of 26 breeds. Interestingly, the frequency of the P3-ins-29 bp variant was markedly higher in Chinese meat or dual-purpose sheep breeds, while the other two variants also showed moderate frequencies in meat breeds. Notably, association analysis indicated that all InDels were associated with AUW sheep litter size (p < 0.05). These results suggest that these InDels within the MAST4 gene could be useful in marker-assisted selection in sheep breeding.

AB  - Camellia sinensis is one of the major crops grown in Taiwan and has been widely cultivated around the island. Tea leaves are prone to various fungal infections, and leaf spot is considered one of the major diseases in Taiwan tea fields. As part of a survey on fungal species causing leaf spots on tea leaves in Taiwan, 19 fungal strains morphologically similar to the genus Diaporthe were collected. ITS (internal transcribed spacer), tef1-alpha (translation elongation factor 1-alpha), tub2 (beta-tubulin), and cal (calmodulin) gene regions were used to construct phylogenetic trees and determine the evolutionary relationships among the collected strains. In total, six Diaporthe species, including one new species, Diaporthe hsinchuensis, were identified as linked with leaf spot of C. sinensis in Taiwan based on both phenotypic characters and phylogeny. These species were further characterized in terms of their pathogenicity, temperature, and pH requirements under laboratory conditions. Diaporthe tulliensis, D. passiflorae, and D. perseae were isolated from C. sinensis for the first time. Furthermore, pathogenicity tests revealed that, with wound inoculation, only D. hongkongensis was pathogenic on tea leaves. This investigation delivers the first assessment of Diaporthe taxa related to leaf spots on tea in Taiwan.

AB  - One of the factors affecting the in-pile performance of Zr-based alloys is the precipitation of hydrides once H concentrations exceed the terminal solubility limit. H transport and hydride precipitation/dissolution is commonly modeled in codes such as BISON, but most of the experimental data supporting these models has been collected on unirradiated materials. As such, there is considerable uncertainty as to the influence of irradiation effects. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations of displacement cascades were performed on S-hydrides to elucidate: 1) the extent of H dissolution following cascade impacts and 2) any alterations to defect production characteristics when compared to cascades in bulk Zr. The immediate amount of H dissolved in a high-energy cascade impact is notable, but a considerable fraction of the dissolved H atoms are rapidly re-absorbed into the hydride at reactor-relevant temperatures. The amount of dissolved H also decreases with increasing hydride size. When considering the expected volume fractions of hydrides, it is not expected that the irradiation-induced H dissolution rate will significantly affect the availability of H in the Zr lattice. In terms of defect production, cascades which overlap S-hydrides produced an order of magnitude more stable defects than equivalent-energy cascades in bulk Zr. Vacancy defects are predominantly contained within the hydride structure while interstitials clusters are found adjacent to the hydride surface. Interstitials are strongly repelled by the hydride structure which may drive the expulsion of cascade-generated interstitials to the hydride surface and impede athermal recombination. Thus, the interatomic potential used in this work predicted a significant alteration to the defect survival efficiency and a stark production bias in the availability of mobile defects in bulk Zr following hydrideoverlapped displacement cascades.

AB  - As chemically specialized forms of the extracellular matrix in the central nervous system, polyanionic perineuronal nets (PNs) contain diverse constituents, including chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), hyaluronic acid, and tenascins. They are detectable by various histological approaches such as colloidal iron binding and immunohistochemical staining to reveal, for instance, the CSPGs aggrecan, neurocan, phosphacan, and versican. Moreover, biotin, peroxidase, or fluorescein conjugates of the lectins Vicia villosa agglutinin and soybean agglutinin enable the visualization of PNs. At present, the N-acetylgalactosamine-binding Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) is the most widely applied marker for PNs. Therefore, this article is largely focused on methodological aspects of WFA staining. Notably, fluorescent WFA labeling allows, after its conversion into electron-dense adducts, electron microscopic analyses. Furthermore, the usefulness of WFA conjugates for the oftentimes neglected in vivo and in vitro labeling of PNs is emphasized. Subsequently, we discuss impaired WFA-staining sites after long-lasting experiments in vitro, especially in autoptic brain samples with long postmortem delay and partial enzymatic degradation, while immunolabeling of aggrecan and CSPG link proteins under such conditions has proven more robust. In some hippocampal regions from perfusion-fixed mice, more PNs are aggrecan immunoreactive than WFA positive, whereas the retrosplenial cortex displays many WFA-binding PNs devoid of visible aggrecan immunoreactivity. Additional multiple fluorescence labeling exemplarily revealed in ischemic tissue diminished staining of WFA-binding sites and aquaporin 4 and concomitantly upregulated immunolabeling of neurofilament, light chains, and collagen IV. Finally, we briefly discuss possible future staining approaches based on nanobodies to facilitate novel technologies revealing details of net morphology.

AB  - Memory consolidation is enhanced by post-encoding stress via cortisol, although the role of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) remains uncertain. This study investigated the effect of the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST) on psychological and hormonal (salivary cortisol and DHEA) responses and performance on a virtual reality object-location memory (OLM) task. The association between hormonal reactivity and OLM task performance was also investigated. Fifty-four participants aged 18-23 were randomly assigned to a stress group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 24). Participants completed an encoding trial of the OLM task and the MAST/ control procedure in an acquisition session. A retrieval session 24 h later included verbal object and visual location recognition tests, as well as an object-context binding (OCB) trial. Results showed that the stress group reported significantly higher state anxiety and negative affect after the MAST, perceived as more stressful, painful, and unpleasant. This group also exhibited a significant increase in cortisol and DHEA levels in response to the MAST. Controlling for age, participants in the stress condition made fewer errors in recognising semantically unrelated objects and tended to complete the OCB trial in a shorter time. In addition, no associations were found between cortisol or DHEA reactivity and memory performance in either the stress group or the control group. Our data indicate that post-encoding stress enhances consolidation; however, no association was found between hormonal reactivity and this process, suggesting that these endocrine responses do not directly support the observed improvement in memory consolidation.

AB  - BACKGROUND While plant glucosinolates are known to impart resistance to many insects, their role in the interactions between plants and many phloem-feeding insects such as whiteflies are poorly understood. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci complex comprises many cryptic species that differ in the ability to utilize Brassica plants. However, whether Brassica plants-specific traits such as glucosinolates determine differences of whiteflies in colonizing Brassica plants remains in question.
   RESULTS We first observed performance of two whitefly species MEAM1 and Asia II 3, which differ obviously in their ability to colonize Brassica plants, on four cultivars of three Brassica species that vary in glucosinolate profile. We found that the life history characteristics of each of the two whitefly species seems to be only marginally affected by cultivar. We next used wild-type Arabidopsis plants and mutants defective in glucosinolate biosynthesis or hydrolysis to explore the effects of glucosinolates on the whitefly. We found that fecundity and development of immature stages of neither of the two whitefly species differ significantly between wild-type and mutants.
   CONCLUSION The data suggest that glucosinolates may have little effect on the oviposition by adults and the survival and development of immature stages of MEAM1 and Asia II 3 whiteflies. The marked differences in colonizing Brassica crops between the two whitefly species are likely due to plant traits other than glucosinolates.

AB  - Sparring by male giraffes has been commonly reported since its first description in 1958 and is believed to play a role in establishing male dominance hierarchies. However, despite being often documented, quantitative investigations of sparring behaviour are currently lacking. Here, we investigate the factors affecting the frequency, duration and intensity of sparring bouts in a population of giraffes Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa living on a private fenced reserve in Limpopo, South Africa. We show that sparring bouts were most frequently observed in young adults, and between males that were more evenly matched in size. Sparring bouts between males of similar body size were also characterised by being of high intensity and of short duration. Taken together, these results support the suggestion that sparring functions principally to provide maturing males a means of testing their competitive ability without escalating to full-scale fights. Additionally, mature bulls intervened on young adults possibly to disable any winner effect achieved by the latter, with the most dominant bull being responsible for the majority of interventions. For the first time, we also show that individuals displayed strong laterality when engaged in sparring: individuals consistently preferred delivering blows from either their left or right side, and these preferences dictated the orientation of sparring bouts (whether head-to-head or head-to-tail). Lastly, we show that sparring displayed a seasonal peak which coincided with the onset of the wet season and possibly reflected the increased aggregation of males at this time. A more nuanced understanding of how social and environmental factors shape interactions among individuals, such as sparring, will improve our understanding and management of this charismatic animal.

AB  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) encompasses an array of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), including physical abnormalities and cognitive and behavioral deficits. Disruptions of cortical development have been implicated in multiple PAE studies, with deficits including decreased progenitor proliferation, disrupted neuronal differentiation, aberrant radial migration of pyramidal neurons, and decreased cortical thickness. While several mechanisms of alcohol teratogenicity have been explored, how specific cell types in the brain at different developmental time points may be differentially affected by PAE is still poorly understood. In this study, we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to investigate whether moderate PAE from neurulation through peak cortical neurogenesis induces cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the developing murine brain. Cluster analysis identified 25 neuronal cell types, including subtypes of radial glial cells (RGCs), intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), projection neurons, and interneurons. Only Wnt-expressing cortical hem RGCs showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells after PAE, with no cell types showing PAE-induced apoptosis as measured by caspase expression. Cell cycle analysis revealed only a subtype of RGCs expressing the downstream Wnt signaling transcription factor Tcf7l2 had a decreased percentage of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, suggesting decreased proliferation in this RGC subtype and further implicating disrupted Wnt signaling after PAE at this early developmental timepoint. An increased pseudotime score in IPC and projection neuron cell types indicated that PAE led to increased or premature differentiation of these cells. Biological processes affected by PAE included the upregulation of pathways related to synaptic activity and neuronal differentiation and downregulation of pathways related to chromosome structure and the cell cycle. Several cell types showed a decrease in Wnt signaling pathways, with several genes related to Wnt signaling altered by PAE in multiple cell types. As Wnt has been shown to promote proliferation and inhibit differentiation at earlier stages in development, the downregulation of Wnt signaling may have resulted in premature neuronal maturation of projection neurons and their intermediate progenitors. Overall, these findings provide further insight into the cell type-specific effects of PAE during early corticogenesis.

AB  - With continuous improvement of sow litter size, breeders are gradually paying more attention to the quality of litter traits that directly impact the production efficiency of pig companies, such as the rate of piglets born alive (RBA) and the rate of healthy births (RHB). The objectives of this study are to dissect the genetic basis of litter traits in pig and to identify valuable genes and genetic markers, especially pleiotropic, for pig breeding. Herein, 1140 Duroc pigs and 2046 reproduction records, 5 litter traits, including the number of healthy births (NHB), number of deformed fetuses (NDF), number of stillborn (NSB), RBA, and RHB, were used in this study. Subsequently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for the five litter traits in the first two parities from two Duroc populations. A total of 76 significantly related SNPs and 10 potential candidate genes (CAV1, DAB2, FGF12, FHOD3, DYNC2H1, GRHL1, TCTN3, PYROXD2, MMP8, MMP13, and PGR) were detected, including 13 pleiotropic SNPs that affected more than one litter trait. Finally, the functional enrichment analysis of functional genes that were closest to these significant SNPs indicated that most of the significant pathways were associated with hormone secretion and embryo and organ development. This study advances our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of litter traits, especially the survival rate of piglets born, and provides an opportunity to increase the quality of litter using marker-assisted selection or genomic selection in pigs.

AB  - Maternal ability plays an important role in improving the reproductive efficiency of sows. The advantage of local pigs in terms of maternal ability in China has been verified. Evaluating the maternal ability of offspring from different introduced boars and Minpig sows is highly important for determining the best hybrid mode and fully utilizing the maternal advantages of Minpig. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the posture changes, carefulness scores, sow responsiveness to trapped screams, nursing behaviours and reproductive performance of sows of three Minpig hybrid breeds (Duroc x Minpig (DM, N = 24), Landrace x Minpig (LM, N = 26) and Yorkshire x Minpig (YM, N = 26)) and determine the crossbreeding that optimizes maternal ability. The data were analysed using the general linear model and generalized estimating equations. Compared with the LM and YM sows, the DM sows presented an earlier peak and a longer total duration (P = 0.007) and average bout duration (P = 0.009) of nest-building behaviour during the 24 h prior to parturition. Furthermore, lower proportion of piglet crushing from standing to lying (P = 0.002) and total postural changes (P = 0.008) was observed in DM sows during the first 3 days. DM sows also had higher carefulness scores (day 1-day 3, P < 0.001; week 2-week 5) and responsiveness scores to the playback of piglet screams (P < 0.001) during lactation. Compared with that of DM sows, the frequency of nutritive nursing was significantly greater (P = 0.005) and the duration of nutritive nursing was lower (P < 0.001) in LM and YM sows. Compared with the DM and LM sows, the YM sows presented a shorter duration of pre-ejection (P = 0.001) and postejection massage (P < 0.001) by sucking piglets and a greater proportion of nursing terminated by sows during lactation. The number of piglets born alive (P = 0.004) and weaned (P < 0.001) and the piglet weight of litters at age 21 days (P = 0.0003) were greater for the LM and YM sows than the DM sows. These results suggest that DM sows exhibit positive prepartum nesting activities, high carefulness scores for piglets and better responses to piglet screams, which are more conducive to production management. However, YM sows have greater advantages in terms of reproductive performance. In production environments without artificially assisted piglet care, DM sows may serve as an excellent maternal line because of their favourable maternal characteristics.

AB  - In nature, plants interact with multiple insect herbivores that may arrive simultaneously or sequentially. There is extensive knowledge on how plants defend themselves against single or dual attack. However, we lack information on how plants defend against the attack of multiple herbivores that arrive sequentially. In this study, we investigated whether Brassica nigra L. plants are able to defend themselves against caterpillars of the late-arriving herbivore Plutella xylostella L., when plants had been previously exposed to sequential attack by four other herbivores (P. xylostella, Athalia rosae, Myzus persicae and Brevicoryne brassicae). We manipulated the order of arrival and the history of attack by four herbivores to investigate which patterns in sequential herbivory determine resistance against the fifth attacker. We recorded that history of sequential herbivore attack differentially affected the capability of B. nigra plants to defend themselves against caterpillars of P. xylostella. Caterpillars gained less weight on plants attacked by a sequence of four episodes of attack by P. xylostella compared to performance on plants that were not previously damaged by herbivores. The number of times the plant was attacked by herbivores of the same feeding guild, the identity of the first attacker, the identity and the guild of the last attacker as well as the order of attackers within the sequence of multiple herbivores influenced the growth of the subsequent herbivory. In conclusion, this study shows that history of sequential attack is an important factor determining plant resistance to herbivores.

AB  - Porcine sperm is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids; therefore, it is highly susceptible to oxidative damage during storage. Inhibition of oxidative stress during preservation is essential for maintaining sperm motility. Astaxanthin is a potent antioxidant used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. This study aimed to explore the effect of supplementing astaxanthin as an extender of porcine semen preservation dilutions at 17 degrees C. Various concentrations of astaxanthin were added to diluted porcine semen at 17 degrees C. We performed computer-assisted semen analysis, evaluation of plasma membrane integrity and acrosome integrity, and measurement of total antioxidant activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity and sperm motility parameters. Compared with the control group, the addition of 0.25 mu g/ml astaxanthin group significantly improved sperm motility parameters stored on the fifth day; these were increased levels of sperm SOD, GSH-PX and CAT (p < .05), increased sperm adenosine trisphosphate and lactate dehydrogenase levels and decreased sperm MDA levels (p < .05). These findings suggest that adding 0.25 mu g/ml of astaxanthin improves the quality of porcine semen stored at 17 degrees C. Our findings provide theoretical support for developing new protective agents critical for preserving pig semen at 17 degrees C.

AB  - Enhancing crop diversification is needed to ensure sustainable food and energy production in the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and maize (Zea mays L.) dominated cropping systems of the US Midwest. Relay-cropping soybean with winter camelina [camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is a means to sustainably intensify food and energy production while adding cropping system diversity. However, soybean yields in relay systems tend to he less than a full-season monocrop. We hypothesized that improved soybean selection and seeding date for relay cropping could minimize this yield gap, thus increasing agricultural land use productivity. A 2-year field study was conducted to determine the effects of soybean maturity and seeding date (SD) on winter camelina and soybean yields and land use productivity. Three soybean genotypes differing in maturity (MG) were relayed into winter camelina at rosette (SD1), bolting (SD2), and first flowering (SD3) growth stages. The soybean MGs were MG0.2, MG1.1, and MG1.7 representing early, standard, and late maturity, respectively, for the study region. The MG1.1 sown at SD2 was grown as sole crop check using conventional practices (CP). Results demonstrated that SD3 decreased camelina seed yield compared with SD1 and SD2. Soybean yield in the relay system was greatest for the MG1.7 genotype, and averaged across SD1 and SD2, was just 11.6% less than the sole crop CP check. Relaying soybean MG1.7 at SD2 produced 43% greater total (camelina +soybean) oil yield and greatly improved land use efficiency compared with CP. Appropriate soybean genotype selection can enhance winter camelina-soybean relay system productivity and land use efficiency.

AB  - The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is one of the economically most important pests on different crops worldwide. Its management programs are normally conducted based on the usage of chemical acaricides. However, considering the side effects of acaricides and rapid resistance development, releasing the predator mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae), is an alternative method for the control of T. urticae. In this study, the effects of plant probiotic bacteria ; Bacillus pumilus INR7 (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) and Bacillus velezensis Fol (Bacillales: Bacillaceae), and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) (methyl jasmonate, methyl salicylate, Indole and 3-pentanol) were investigated on the functional response of P. persimilis to T. urticae eggs laid on attached leaves of kidney bean under laboratory conditions (25 & PLUSMN; 1 & DEG;C, 65 & PLUSMN; 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16:8h L:D). Densities of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 prey in 10 replications were offered to the 1-day-old adult female individuals of P. persimilis during a 24-h period. The results of logistic regression analyses showed a type II functional response on all treatments. The Rogers model was used to estimate the instantaneous attack rate (a) and handling time (Th). The instantaneous attack rate had no significant difference among treatments. The handling time on B. velezensis (0.3540 & PLUSMN; 0.0716 h) and methyl salicylate (0.3593 & PLUSMN; 0.0842 h) was significantly lower than in other treatments. These results suggest that methyl salicylate and B. velezensis may have a positive effect on the foraging behavior of P. persimilis against T. urticae.

AB  - Simple Summary The gastrointestinal microbiome plays a significant role in diet digestion and the energy production of its host. This study investigated the influence of sex on the fecal microbiome of camels. Our findings revealed sex differences in the composition and function of fecal microbiomes. This research, to the best of our knowledge, is the first characterization of the fecal core bacteriomes of male and female dromedary camels. The variation in the intestinal microbial communities between male and female dromedary camels lies in the abundance and prevalence of taxa rather than in the presence and absence of bacterial taxa. The gastrointestinal microbiome plays a significant role in diet digestion and the energy production of its host. Several factors that affect the gastrointestinal microbiota composition were studied in camels. Yet, the impact of sex on the gastrointestinal bacteriome of camels remains unexplored to date. In this perspective, the fecal microbiome community composition from dromedary camels was determined in 10 male and 10 female samples using the 16S rRNA amplicon, in order to estimate if this was influenced by sex. The core microbiome in females contained 284 bacterial OTUs and one archaeal OUT, whereas in males, it contained 279 bacterial OTUs and one archaeal OTU. In females, Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes were significantly more abundant than in male camels, whereas Lentisphaerae and Euryarchaeota were significantly abundant in males. According to Principal Coordinate Analysis and UPGMA clustering, grouping with respect to sex was observed. The functional prediction results showed differences such as energy production and conversion, and that the cell wall/membrane/envelope were enriched in female camels. The fecal microbiome of male camels was rich in amino acid, lipid transport and metabolism.

AB  - 4-Nonylphenol (4-NP) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that impairs animal and human reproduction. However, the mechanisms underlying male reproductive dysfunction by 4-NP have not been fully understood. Herein, we demonstrated the effects of 4-NP on boar sperm functions and molecular mechanisms. Spermatozoa were treated with various concentrations of 4-NP (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mu M) during capacitation. Then, we evaluated sperm motility, capacitation status, intracellular ATP level, and cell viability. Finally, we measured the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA), tyrosine phosphorylation, and proteins related to the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways following exposure to 4-NP. Sperm motility and motion kinematics were reduced by 4-NP, whereas intracellular ATP levels were increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression levels of p-PI3K, PTEN, p-PDK1, AKT, and p -AKT exhibited a significant dose-dependent increase. Moreover, abnormal activation of PKA and tyrosine phosphorylation were observed. Specifically, the -24 kDa pPKA substrate demonstrated a significant reduction following exposure to 4-Np. In addition, the -18 kDa p-PKA substrate and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins displayed a significant dose-dependent increase after exposure to 4-NP. Our results suggest that 4-NP may induce detrimental effects on sperm functions through abnormal changes in PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation, possibly through unusual alteration of the PI3K/PDK1/AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, 4-NP must be cautiously used considering its reproductive toxicity.

AB  - Treatment of bacterial cultures with hemolymph collected from desert hairy scorpions (Hadrurus arizonensis Ewing, 1928, Hadruridae) resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of bacterial proliferation. The hemolymph proved effective in inhibiting growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species. Incubation of E. coli bacteria with hemolymph at different temperatures (20-4(degrees C) showed that the antibacterial effects increased from 20-30 degrees C, but the hemolymph was largely ineffective in killing the bacteria at 35 and 40 degrees C. Incubation of E. coli with hemolymph at 25 degrees C for different time periods revealed that the antibacterial activities were extremely rapid and resulted in killing of bacteria within 1-2 minutes of contact. Interestingly, the hemolymph exhibited no phenoloxidase enzyme activity, hemolytic activity against sheep red blood cells, or melanization activity, which is a common mechanism of immunity among many diverse arthropods. This study is the first characterization of immune function of hemolymph from any scorpion species.

AB  - Prenatal maternal stress is linked to adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes, including shortened gestation lengths, low birth weights, cardio-metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive and behavioural problems. Stress disrupts the homeostatic milieu of pregnancy by altering inflammatory and neuroendocrine mediators. These stress-induced phenotypic changes can be passed on to the offspring epigenetically. We investigated the effects of gestational chronic variable stress (CVS) in rats using restraint and social isolation stress in the parental F0 generation and its transgenerational transmission across three generations of female offspring (F1-F3). A subset of F1 rats was housed in an enriched environment (EE) to mitigate the adverse effects of CVS. We found that CVS is transmitted across generations and induces inflammatory changes in the uterus. CVS did not alter any gestational lengths or birth weights. However, inflammatory and endocrine markers changed in the uterine tissues of stressed mothers and their offspring, suggesting that stress is transgenerationally transmitted. The F2 offspring reared in EE had increased birth weights, but their uterine gene expression patterns remained comparable to those of stressed animals. Thus, ancestral CVS induced changes transgenerationally in fetal programming of uterine stress markers over three generations of offspring, and EE housing did not mitigate these effects.

AB  - Simple Summary An important element of livestock breeding is the selection that leads to the consolidation and improvement of the traits with utility value. The use of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers offers the opportunity to select the appropriate genotype linked to the phenotype, which manifests itself in significant breeding benefits. Polymorphic sites within the genes coding the somatotropic axis are directly and indirectly associated with the phenotype, particularly concerning the production properties of growth and carcass as well as reproductive function. This study analyzed the effect of selected polymorphisms in the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) gene on performance characteristics of cattle and sheep. The impact of the mutations on the development of selected traits, which are important from the economic standpoint, was evaluated. Such studies can be utilized to enhance the growth characteristics of cattle and sheep, thereby facilitating the development of more profitable and sustainable breeding methods. The Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) tyrosine kinase is an essential component of signal transduction of the class II cytokine receptors, including the growth hormone receptor. Therefore, it may play a crucial role in the signaling pathway of the somatotropic axis, which influences growth, development, and reproductive traits in ruminants. For this purpose, for three breeds of cattle (Hereford, Angus, and Limousin; a total of 781 individuals), two polymorphic sites located in exon 16 (rs210148032; p.Ile704Val, within pseudokinase (JH2)) and exon 23 (silent mutation rs211067160, within JH1 kinase domain) were analyzed. For two breeds of sheep (Pomeranian and Suffolk; 333 individuals in total), two polymorphic sites in exon 6 (rs160146162 and rs160146160; encoding the FERM domain) and one polymorphic site in exon 24 of the JAK2 gene (rs160146116; JH1 kinase domain) were genotyped. In our study, the associations examined for cattle were inconclusive. However, Hereford and Limousin cattle with genotypes AA (e16/RsaI) and AA (e23/HaeIII) tended to have the highest body weight and better daily gains (p & LE; 0.05). No clear tendency was observed in the selected reproductive traits. In the case of sheep, regardless of breed, individuals with the AA (e6/EarI), GG (e6/seq), and AA (e24/Hpy188III) genotypes had the highest body weights and daily gains in the study periods (p & LE; 0.01). The same individuals in the Pomeranian breed also had better fertility and lamb survival (p & LE; 0.01). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first association studies for all these polymorphic sites. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the JAK2 gene can serve as genetic markers for growth and selected reproductive traits in ruminants given that they are further investigated in subsequent populations and analyzed using haplotype and/or combined genotype systems.

AB  - Antimuscarinic administration and food intake cause convulsions in mice and rats after fasting for 48 h or less. Increased M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor expression in brain regions during fasting, and reversal of changes by refeeding may contribute to these seizures. Since receptor expression is regulated in response to agonist stimulation, this study investigated effects of nonselective muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine on convulsions in fasted animals. Mice deprived of food for 24 h were given oxotremorine during (0.1 mg/kg, twice daily, s.c.) or after (0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) fasting. Fasted animals were treated with saline or scopolamine (i.p.) and observed for 30 min for the convulsions after being allowed to eat ad libitum. Oxotremorine administration during fasting produced no significant effect on convulsion development. Incidence and onset of convulsions, and seizure stages were indifferent between the scopolamine and oxotremorine - scopolamine groups. However, oxotremorine (0.1 mg/kg) administration after fasting reduced incidence of convulsions. Resulting from an agonist-antagonist interaction at M1 and/or M2 muscarinic receptors, oxotremorine administered after fasting exhibited an anticonvulsant activity. Oxotremorine administration during fasting was expected to suppress seizure development via inhibition of receptor expression. Results did not confirm this expectation and suggested that muscarinic receptor expression was either not affected or not related to the convulsions. Food intake after fasting, and food deprivation have been shown to induce cholinergic hyperexcitability. Although contrary to our hypothesis, future research may investigate whether increased expression of muscarinic receptors mediate or contribute to an increase in cholinergic activity.

AB  - IntroductionPrevious studies have shown that gestational inflammation can accelerate age-associated cognitive decline (AACD) in maternal mice; enriched environments (EEs) have been reported to protect normally aging mice from AACD and improve mitochondrial function. However, it is unclear whether the nitrosative stress-related proteins tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) are involved in the accelerated aging process of gestational inflammation and whether EEs can slow this process. MethodsIn this study, CD-1 female mice on the 15th day of pregnancy were injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (50 mu g/kg; LPS group) or an equivalent amount of normal saline (CON group) from the abdominal cavity for 4 consecutive days. Twenty-one days after delivery, half of the LPS-treated mice were randomly selected for EE until the end of the behavioral experiment (LPS-E group). When the female rats were raised to 6 months and 18 months of age, the Morris water maze (MWM) was used to detect spatial learning and memory ability; RT-PCR and Western blots were used to measure the mRNA and protein levels of hippocampal TET1 and GSNOR. ResultsAs for the control group, compared with 6-month-old mice, the spatial learning and memory ability of 18-month-old mice decreased, and the hippocampal TET1 and GSNOR mRNA and protein levels were decreased. Gestational inflammation exacerbated these age-related changes, but an EE alleviated the effects. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that performance during the learning and memory periods in the MWM correlated with the levels of hippocampal TET1 and GSNOR. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that gestational inflammation accelerates age-related learning and memory impairments and that postpartum EE exposure could alleviate these changes. These effects may be related to hippocampal TET1 and GSNOR expression.

AB  - We develop a phase field model of char oxidation during atmospheric entry in the ablation zone of the Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA). The phase field model is coupled to a model of heat transport, to capture the interaction between the oxidation and temperature, and it is based on our previous model of carbon fiber oxidation. We explore the char oxidation behavior using three 2D examples. First, we simulate oxidation with an imposed temperature gradient for char structures with increasing amounts of initial porosity. The oxidation time decreases with increasing porosity and the oxidation rate fluctuates as pores are opened to oxygen transport. Next, we predict the decrease in temperature due to the endothermic oxidation reactions in thermally-insulated systems with and without transport of oxygen through the top boundary. In both cases, the temperature decreases until oxidation stops; it stops due to the decrease in temperature in the case open to oxygen transport and due to lack of oxygen in the case closed to oxygen. Finally, we explore the oxidation behavior under different heat fluxes. The oxidation reactions compensate for the heat flux until the char is fully consumed and then the temperature increases. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the interactions between the oxidation reactions and the temperature when modeling char oxidation.

AB  - Background In temperate regions many small mammals including bats hibernate during winter. During hibernation these small mammals occasionally wake up (arouse) to restore electrolyte and water balance. However, field data on water stress and concentration of bodily fluids during hibernation is scarce. Urinary creatinine concentration has long been used to calibrate urinary hormone concentration due to its close correlation with urine concentration. Therefore, by investigating urinary creatinine concentration, we can estimate bodily fluid concentration. In this study, we investigated changes in urinary creatinine from greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) hibernating in abandoned mineshafts in two regions in South Korea. Results We collected 74 urine samples from hibernating greater horseshoe bats from 2018 to 2019. We found that urinary creatinine concentration was higher in February and March and then declined in April. There were also indications of a sex difference in the pattern of change in creatinine concentration over the three months. Bats in the warmer and less humid mineshaft had higher urinary creatinine concentrations than bats in the colder and more humid mineshaft. Conclusions These results indicate that hibernating bats face water stress as urinary concentration increases during winter and that water stress may vary depending on the microenvironment. Sex differences in behaviour during hibernation may influence arousal frequency and result in sex differences in changes in urinary creatinine concentration as hibernation progresses. Although further behavioural and endocrinal investigations are needed, our study suggests that urinary creatinine concentration can be used as a proxy to estimate the hydration status of bats and the effect of sex and environmental factors on arousal patterns during hibernation.

AB  - Objective: It is to investigate the effects of (3-asarone on learning and memory, hippocampal morphology, synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density 95(PSD95) protein expression, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 2B (NR2B)- Ca2+/calmodulin 2 + /calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)- Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) / Cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) signal in hippocampus of rats with exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue. Methods: Fifty Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal group, exercise group, exercise and (3-asarone (2.5, 10, 40 mg/kg)-treated groups. The learning and memory in rats were tested by Morris water maze experiment. We measured the hippocampal morphology by Nissl staining. The levels of SYP, PSD95, NR2B, CaMKII, ERK1/2, CREB, p-NR2B, p-CaMKII, p-ERK1/2 and p-CREB expression were measured by western blot analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that (3-asarone (10, 40 mg/kg) treatment significantly decreased the latency to find the platform, increased the time spent in the target quadrant and the number of crossing the platform of rats with exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue. (3-asarone (10, 40 mg/kg) treatment increased the cell density in the hippocampus CA1 region, significantly up-regulated NR2B-CaMKII-ERK/CREB signal and improved the protein expression levels of SYP and PSD95 in hippocampus of rats with exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue. Conclusions: It suggests that (3-asarone could improve learning and memory of rats with exhaustive exercise- induced fatigue. The mechanism might be related to (3-asarone protecting the morphology of hippocampus, increasing the protein expression levels of SYP and PSD95 and up-regulating NR2B-CaMKII-ERK/CREB signal in hippocampus of rats with exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue.

AB  - Simple Summary The objectives of our study were to determine the seasonal home range size variation, and to determine the fraction of variation in home range use explained by environmental variables. We found that the core home range size of the golden snub-nosed monkey in Tangjiahe National Nature Reserve varied seasonally. The environmental variables in spring and summer explained a large part of home range use intensity, while the environmental variables in autumn and winter explained a moderate fraction and no fraction of home range use intensity, respectively. Water sources, tree density, and dominant trees of Chinese wingnut (Pterocarya stenoptera) were the important environmental factors determining home range use. Accurate descriptions of home ranges can provide important information for understanding animal ecology and behavior and contribute to the formulation of conservation strategies. We used the grid cell method and kernel density estimation (KDE) to estimate the home range size of golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) in Tangjiahe National Nature Reserve. We also used Moran's eigenvector maps analysis and variation partitioning to test the influence of environmental variables on home range use. The seasonal home range size was 15.4 km(2) in spring, 11.6 km(2) in summer, 13.7 km(2) in autumn, and 15.6 km(2) in winter, based on the grid cell method. The seasonal core area of 50% KDE was 9.86 km(2) in spring, 5.58 km(2) in summer, 7.20 km(2) in autumn, and 4.23 km(2) in winter. The environmental variables explained 63.60% of home range use intensity in spring, 72.21% in summer, 26.52% in autumn, and none in winter, and some environmental variables contributed to the spatial variation in home range use intensity. Water sources, tree density, and dominant trees of Chinese wingnut (Pterocarya stenoptera) were the important environmental factors determining home range use. These environmental factors require protection to ensure the survival of the golden snub-nosed monkey.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Pichia anomala is a simple pseudomycelium with a round cell shape, product killer factors, beta-1,3-glucanase, and phytase. P. anomala had the functions of anticorrosion, improving the nutritive value of feed, increasing the protein content, and reducing the concentration of nutritive substances. In this study, P. anomala AR(2016) is isolated and identified from solid wine koji, and its culture conditions are optimized. Heat tolerance, bile salt tolerance, and artificial gastric and intestinal juice tolerance are evaluated. In our methodology, thirty weaned pigs were randomly divided into three groups with 10 barrows in each, and fed a maize-soybean meal diet and orally administered 0.85% saline (CK), 1 mL 1 x 10(9) cfu/mL Candida utilis (C. utilis), and 1 mL 1 x 10(9) cfu/mL P. anomala once daily for 28 days (P. anomala). Our results show that P. anomala AR(2016) grew best in yeast extract peptone dextrose medium with pH 5.0 at 28 degrees C, 180 r/min and could tolerate 45 degrees C for 0.5 h, 0.2% pig bile salts, simulated gastric fluid, and 1.0% simulated intestinal fluid. Our study indicates that P. anomala AR(2016) can tolerate high acidity and high bile salts, and has high survivability in the artificial gastric intestinal juice environment. In conclusion, oral administration of P. anomala AR(2016) improves the growth performance, reduces the incidence of diarrhea, enhances intestinal barrier function, and improves microflora in weaned pigs.
   This study isolates and identifies Pichia anomala (P. anomala) AR(2016), and studies its effect on the growth and health of weaned pigs. A P. anomala strain from solid wine koji is isolated and identified using 26S rDNA analysis, and its culture conditions are optimized. Heat tolerance, bile salt tolerance, artificial gastric, and intestinal juice tolerance are evaluated. In our methodology, thirty 28 d Large White x Landrace x Rongchang weaned pigs were randomly divided into three groups with 10 barrows in each, and fed a maize-soybean meal diet and orally administered 0.85% saline (CK), 1 mL 1 x 10(9) cfu/mL Candida utilis (C. utilis), and 1 mL 1 x 10(9) cfu/mL P. anomala once daily for 28 days. A P. anomala strain was identified and named P. anomala AR(2016). P. anomala AR(2016) grew best in yeast extract peptone dextrose medium with pH 5.0 at 28 degrees C, 180 r/min and could tolerate 45 degrees C for 0.5 h, 0.2% pig bile salts, simulated gastric fluid, and 1.0% simulated intestinal fluid. Our results show that compared with the CK group, orally administered P. anomala AR(2016) increases average daily gain, the ileal villus height, the ileal mucosal concentrations of occludin and zonula occluens-1, the serum glucose and total protein concentration, total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidative capacity activity, the trypsin and lipase activity in jejunal and ileal contents, the jejunal and ileal mucosa mRNA levels of ALP, TNF-alpha, and TLR-2, and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Succinivibrionaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Prevotellaceae (p < 0.05). Compared with the CK group, oral administration of P.
   anomala AR(2016) decreased the incidence of diarrhea, aspartate aminotransferase activity, alanine amino-transferase-activity, malondialdehyde, D-lactic acid and endotoxin content in serum, the mRNA level of aminopeptidase N of ileum mucosa, and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Clostridiaceae, Campylobacteraceae, Vibrionaceae, Bacillus, and Pseudon (p < 0.05). Collectively, the study indicates that P. anomala AR(2016) can tolerate high acidity and high bile salts, and has high survivability in the artificial gastric intestinal juice environment. Oral administration of P. anomala AR(2016) improves the growth performance, reduces the incidence of diarrhea, enhances intestinal barrier function, and improves microflora in weaned pigs.

AB  - Background: Consumer demand for organic spelt wheat has increased rapidly and production has expanded into semi-arid regions, where it was not traditionally grown. Methods: Here, we report the results of a factorial field experiment designed to compare the performance of four spelt varieties grown in rain-fed and irrigated, conventional and organic production systems in a semi-arid environment. Results: Irrigation resulted in 2.5-fold higher grain yields, a reduction in grain protein, taller plants and an increase in stem lodging. While yields of all varieties were similar and low in rain-fed production, the variety Zuricher Oberlander Rotkorn (ZOR) produced the highest, Filderstolz and Oberkulmer intermediate and the variety Rubiota the lowest grain yields in irrigated systems. Organic production with chicken or sheep manure as fertilizer resulted in 15% higher yields that mineral NPK fertilizer-based conventional production protocols. Conclusions: Rain-fed spelt production results in very low yields and is therefore unlikely to be commercially viable. Results suggest that organic fertilization regimes and the variety ZOR will result in the highest yields in irrigated systems, while the two traditional spelt varieties Filderstolz and Oberkulmer will more reliably produce grain protein levels that comply with bread-making quality standards.

AB  - Climate change poses an increasing threat to livestock reproduction, with heat stress (HS) known to significantly impair ovarian function. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of HS on ovarian function and circRNA expression profiles in Hu sheep. Twelve ewes were randomly assigned to a control (Con, n = 6) or HS group (n = 6) and exposed to different temperatures for 68 days. Compared with the Con group, HS significantly increased the respiratory rate (108.33 +/- 3.72 vs. 63.58 +/- 2.42 breaths/min), pulse rate (121.17 +/- 3.98 vs. 78.08 +/- 3.31 beats/min), and rectal temperature (40.17 +/- 0.14 degrees C vs. 39.02 +/- 0.21 degrees C; p < 0.05). Concurrently, serum antioxidant levels were markedly decreased, including total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (p < 0.05). Histological analysis revealed a significant reduction in the numbers of primordial, primary, secondary, and mature follicles, alongside an increase in antral follicles (p < 0.05). TUNEL staining demonstrated enhanced granulosa cell apoptosis (p < 0.05), accompanied by the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Caspase-3 and downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, as confirmed by qPCR (p < 0.05). CircRNA sequencing identified 152 differentially expressed circRNAs (120 upregulated, 32 downregulated), and enrichment analyses indicated their involvement in apoptosis, mitophagy, and the FoxO signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that HS impairs ovarian physiology and antioxidant defense, induces follicular damage and cell apoptosis, and alters circRNA expression profiles, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HS-induced reproductive dysfunction in Hu sheep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vine nutrition affects the composition of grapes, but how it impacts the aroma of grapes is largely unknown.
   OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to investigate the effect of different fertilizers: chemical fertilizer (CF), sheep manure-based organic fertilizer (OF), 50% organic fertilizer + 50% chemical fertilizer (O + C), 25% organic fertilizer + 25% chemical fertilizer [1/2 (O + C)], and soil conditioner (SC) on the aroma accumulation of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes.
   METHODS: The treatments were applied and samples were collected in 2019 at weekly intervals from August 7 to September 22. The grapes' chemical characteristics and volatile compounds were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The chemical results showed that the treatments had a positive effect on grapes, with a strong preference for the 1/2 (O + C) treatment. Grape aroma results showed that the concentrations of grape aromas in O + C-treated samples were lower than the other treatments. The OF treated samples had comparatively high (24.8%) volatile concentrations during maturity compared to other treatments, including the control (15.9%). Throughout development, samples treated with OF (17.4%) and CF (15.7%) had higher volatile concentrations than samples treated with SC (14.4%), 1/2 (O + C) (12.8%), and O + C (12.4%). However, compared to SC-treated samples, samples treated with 1/2 (O + C) increased the accumulation of terpenes and esters. The principal component analysis (PCA) results showed that samples treated with OF were strongly correlated to carbonyls, terpenes, and esters during maturity.
   CONCLUSION: The type and ratio of fertilizer used had a significant impact on the aroma profile of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are commonly used in sweetened foods and beverages; however their role in metabolic regulation is still not clear. In this experiment, we used guinea pigs as an animal model to study the effect of NNS on body growth and intestinal health by modifying gut microbiota and hypothalamus-related proteins. RESULTS: For a 28-day feeding experiment a total of 40 guinea pigs were randomly divided into four groups, one control (CN) group and three treatments, in which three NNS were added to the diet: rebaudioside A (RA, 330 mg kg(-1)), sodium saccharin (SS, 800 mg kg(-1)), and sucralose (TGS, 167 mg kg(-1)), respectively. The TGS group exhibited significantly reduced food consumption in comparison with the CN group (P < 0.05) whereas the RA group showed increased food consumption in comparison with the CN group (P < 0.05). Notably, Taste receptor type 1 subunit 2 (T1R2) expression in the hypothalamus was significantly higher in the RA group than in the CN group (P < 0.05). The mRNA expressions of appetite-stimulated genes arouti-related neuropeptide (AGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSHB) were significantly higher than those in the CN group (P < 0.05) but mRNA expressions of appetite-suppressed genes tryptophan hydroxylase 2(THP2) were significantly lower in the TGS group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, NNS in the guinea pig diets (RA, SS, TGS) significantly increased the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae but decreased the relative abundance of Clostridia_vadin BB60 in comparison with the CN group (P < 0.05). We also found that dietary supplementation with RA also significantly altered the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. CONCLUSION: Our finding confirmed that dietary supplementation with RA and TGS affected body growth and intestinal health by modulating hypothalamic RNA profiles and ileum microbiota, suggesting that NNS should be included in guinea-pig feeding.

AB  - Fluoride exposure from natural, agricultural, and industrial sources has harmed people living in fluoride-affected areas. Fluoride accumulates in the human body after being exposed to it through the food chain. The population consisted of 371 community health volunteers who were surveyed and chosen based on personal fluoride information. Only 39 residents were chosen to be interviewed and take part in the trial, which involved drinking fluoride-containing groundwater (>1.5 part per million: ppm) and urine testing that revealed urine fluoride level (>0.7 ppm). In addition, 47 biological samples and eight commercially bottled water specimens were examined. The information was gathered in four ways: (1) a questionnaire-based survey of fluoride knowledge, (2) food consumption behavior with locally grown vegetables, fruits, poultry, and meat, and commercially bottled water produced by groundwater in fluoride-affected areas, (3) a semi-food frequency questionnaire, and (4) fluoride content measurements using an ion-selective electrode. According to the analyses, the participants ranged in age from 51 to 60 years, with approximately 60.38% of them female and born and raised in polluted areas. The majority of subjects had a low level of fluoride knowledge (65.23%). The respondents' primary source of drinking water (100.00%) was commercially bottled water; they chewed camellia sinensis 11.56% of the time (1 to 5 years) and they drank tea 9.16% of the time (during 1 to 5 years). Sus scrofa domesticus was responsible for the intake of vegetables and fruits, whereas Brassica chinensis, Jusl var para-chinensis (Bailey), and Tsen and Lee were responsible for the intake of poultry and animal flesh. They were all purchased at a local farm. The hazard quotient was greater than one, and the fluoride concentration (ppm) ranged between 75.00% (0.29-5.20), 57.14% (0.01-0.46), 88.89% (0.07-0.91), 100.00% (0.43-3.07), 100.00% (0.58-0.77), 42.86% (0.12-0.62 ppm.), 60.00% (0.11-1.44), and 33.33% (0.10-0.80) in drinking water, fruit, young and mature plants. Fluoride ingestion may pose a health concern. Under the 95th percentile condition, 74.47% consumed water with a high fluoride level, vegetables and fruits, and poultry and meats.

AB  - The key to developing laser-driven solid-state lighting lies in high-performance color converters, which must be thermally robust under the high-power density excitation of a laser. Phosphor-in-glass (PiG) films are considered as a kind of promising color converter for laser lighting, but the poor thermal dissipation of the glass matrix will cause large thermal quenching of the PiG films and hence low luminous flux of lighting sources. In this work, Al2O3 particles, acting as a heat transfer medium, are introduced into the La3Si6N11:Ce3+ (LSN:Ce3+) PiG film to form a composite color converter for realizing high-brightness laser lighting. By optimizing the ratio of glass frits to Al2O3 as well as the film thickness, the Al2O3-LSN:Ce3+ composite PiG film shows a luminance saturation threshold of 23.08 W mm(-2), which is 26.3% higher than that of the Al2O3-free LSN:Ce3+ PiG film (18.27 W mm(-2)). The luminous flux of the composite PiG film under blue laser excitation is improved by 51.4% and reaches 3120 lm, and the luminous flux of the laser-driven white light can reach up to 2886 lm. It indicates that the Al2O3-LSN:Ce3+ composite PiG film would be an interesting color converter for producing high-brightness laser-driven white light.

AB  - What an animal ingests and what it digests can be different. Thus, we examined the nutritional physiology of Lumpenus sagitta, a member of the family Stichaeidae, to better understand whether it could digest algal components like its better studied algivorous relatives. Although L. sagitta ingests considerable algal content, we found little evidence of algal digestion. This fish species has a short gut that doesn't show positive allometry with body size, low amylolytic activity that actually decreases as the fish grow, no ontogenetic changes in digestive enzyme gene expression, elevated N-acetyl-glucosaminidase activity (indicative of chitin breakdown), and an enteric microbial community that is consistent with carnivory and differs from members of its family that consume and digest algae. Hence, we are left concluding that L. sagitta is not capable of digesting the algae it consumes, and instead, are likely targeting epibionts on the algae itself, and other invertebrates consumed with the algae. Our study expands the coverage of dietary and digestive information for the family Stichaeidae, which is becoming a model for fish digestive physiology and genomics, and shows the power of moving beyond gut content analyses to better understand what an animal can actually digest and use metabolically.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism are thought to involve an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a risk factor for these disorders, with IUGR onset occurring during critical periods of neurodevelopment. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of IUGR on excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the fetal neocortex and hippocampus. Fetal brains (n = 2) were first collected from an unoperated pregnant guinea pig at mid-gestation (32 days of gestation [dg]; term similar to 67 dg) to visualize excitatory (Ctip2) and inhibitory (calretinin [CR] and somatostatin [SST]) neurons via immunohistochemistry. Chronic placental insufficiency (CPI) was then induced via radial artery ablation at 30 dg in another cohort of pregnant guinea pigs (n = 8) to generate IUGR fetuses (52 dg; n = 8); control fetuses (52 dg; n = 7) were from sham surgeries with no radial artery ablation. At 32 dg, Ctip2- and CR-immunoreactive (IR) cells had populated the cerebral cortex, whereas SST-IR cells had not, suggesting these neurons were yet to complete migration. At 52 dg, in IUGR versus control fetuses, there was a reduction in SST-IR cell density in the cerebral cortex (p = .0175) and hilus of the dentate gyrus (p = .0035) but not the striatum (p > .05). There was no difference between groups in the density of Ctip2-IR (cortex) or CR-IR (cortex, hippocampus) neurons (p > 0.05). Thus, we propose that an imbalance in inhibitory (SST-IR) and excitatory (Ctip2-IR) neurons in the IUGR fetal guinea pig brain could lead to excitatory/inhibitory dysfunction commonly seen in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.

AB  - Litter size is a crucial quantitative trait in animals, closely linked to follicular development. Circular RNA (circRNA), a type of single-stranded closed-loop endogenous RNA with stable expression, plays pivotal roles in various biological processes, yet its function in goat follicular development remains unclear. In this study, we collected large (follicle diameter > 3 mm) and small (1 mm < follicle diameter < 3 mm) follicles from black goats in the Chuanzhong region for circRNA sequencing, with the aim of elucidating the functional circRNAs that influence follicle development in goats. Differential analysis revealed that 17 circRNAs were upregulated in large follicles, and 28 circRNAs were upregulated in small follicles. Functional enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to reproduction, including cellular response to follicle-stimulating hormone stimulus, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and the Notch signaling pathway. Based on the ceRNA mechanism, 45 differentially expressed circRNAs were found to target and bind a total of 418 miRNAs, and an intercalation network including miR-324-3p (circRNA2497, circRNA5650), miR-202-5p (circRNA3333, circRNA5501), and miR-493-3p (circRNA4995, circRNA5508) was constructed. In addition, conservation analysis revealed that 2,239 circRNAs were conserved between goats and humans. Prediction of translation potential revealed that 154 circRNAs may potentially utilize both N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and internal ribosome entry site (IRES) translation mechanisms. Furthermore, the differential expression and circularization cleavage sites of five circRNAs were validated through RT-qPCR and DNA sequencing. Our study constructed a circRNA map in goat follicle development, offering a theoretical foundation for enhancing goat reproductive performance.

AB  - The stress response of pig herds is a major problem in the pig breeding industry, and exploring methods to solve pig herds stress is of great significance. Probiotics have good anti-stress effects. Therefore, this study intervened in weaned piglets and pregnant sows with a composite probiotic consisting of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and bifidobacterium longum, and found that the composite probiotic can alleviate oxidative stress in weaned piglets and pregnant sows by improving the barrier function of intestinal tissues and altering the structure of fecal microbiota in the pig group. This study investigated the efficacy of a composite probiotics composed of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and bifidobacterium longum in alleviating oxidative stress in weaned piglets and pregnant sows. Evaluations of growth, oxidative stress, inflammation, intestinal barrier, and fecal microbiota were conducted. Results showed that the composite probiotic significantly promoted average daily gain in piglets (p < 0.05). It effectively attenuated inflammatory responses (p < 0.05) and oxidative stress (p < 0.05) while enhancing intestinal barrier function in piglets (p < 0.01). Fecal microbiota analysis revealed an increase in the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as faecalibacterium, parabacteroides, clostridium, blautia, and phascolarctobacterium in piglet feces and lactobacillus, parabacteroides, fibrobacter, and phascolarctobacterium in sow feces, with a decrease in harmful bacteria such as bacteroides and desulfovibrio in sow feces upon probiotic supplementation. Correlation analysis indicated significant negative associations of blautia with inflammation and oxidative stress in piglet feces, while treponema and coprococcus showed significant positive associations. In sow feces, lactobacillus, prevotella, treponema, and CF231 exhibited significant negative associations, while turicibacter showed a significant positive association. Therefore, the composite probiotic alleviated oxidative stress in weaned piglets and pregnant sows by modulating fecal microbiota composition.

AB  - Tissue repair is often impaired in pathological states, highlighting the need for innovative wound-healing technologies. This study introduces composite hyaluronic acid gas-entrapping materials (GEMs) delivering carbon monoxide (CO) to promote wound healing in pigs. These composite materials facilitate burst release followed by sustained release of CO over 48 h. In a porcine full-thickness wound model, CO-GEMs significantly accelerated wound closure compared to the standard-of-care dressing (Tegaderm). Wound area closure with CO-GEMs was 68.6% vs 56.8% on day 14, 41.0% vs 25.1% on day 28, and 26.9% vs 11.8% on day 42, effectively reducing healing time by 14 days. Histological analysis revealed increased epithelialization and neovascularization with reduced inflammation. These findings demonstrate the potential of CO-GEMs as a topical therapeutic to enhance tissue repair in clinically relevant models, supporting further testing for wound-healing applications.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) symbiosis has been shown to improve the ability to obtain nutrients and resist adverse environmental conditions. However, there are few studies on the functions of AMF in the absorption and accumulation of boron (B). Moreover, it is still unclear whether the root colonization rates of AMF are limited by B deficiency. In this study, Camellia oleifera seedlings were planted in normal and boron-deficient substrates, and the seedlings were inoculated with Funneliformis mosseae or left uninoculated. The growth and physiological indices of C. oleifera seedlings were determined. The results of this experiment indicate that AMF inoculation increased the plant biomass, B content, B accumulation, and antioxidant enzyme activity in both normal and boron-deficient C. oleifera seedlings. Furthermore, boron deficiency resulted in a decrease in the AMF root colonization efficiency and the inhibition of C. oleifera seedlings' growth and physiological activity. These findings suggest that AMF inoculation could improve the resistance to B-deficiency stress. Additionally, the colonization efficiency of AMF was adversely affected by B deficiency; thus, AMF play a cooperative role with B in the growth and physiological functions of plants. The results provide a theoretical basis for taking measures to solve B-deficiency stress in C. oleifera and other plants' cultivation.

AB  - An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease. We identified plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) as an independent risk factor in patients with AAA by correlating plasma IGF1 with risk. Smooth muscle cell- or fibroblast-specific knockout of Igf1r, the gene encoding the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), attenuated AAA formation in two mouse models of AAA induced by angiotensin II infusion or CaCl2 treatment. IGF1R was activated in aortic aneurysm samples from human patients and mice with AAA. Systemic administration of IGF1C, a peptide fragment of IGF1, 2 weeks after disease development inhibited AAA progression in mice. Decreased AAA formation was linked to competitive inhibition of IGF1 binding to its receptor by IGF1C and modulation of downstream alpha serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Localized application of an IGF1C-loaded hydrogel was developed to reduce the side effects observed after systemic administration of IGF1C or IGF1R antagonists in the CaCl2-induced AAA mouse model. The inhibitory effect of the IGF1C-loaded hydrogel administered at disease onset on AAA formation was further evaluated in a guinea pig-to-rat xenograft model and in a sheep-to-minipig xenograft model of AAA formation. The therapeutic efficacy of IGF1C for treating AAA was tested through extravascular delivery in the sheep-to-minipig model with AAA established for 2 weeks. Percutaneous injection of the IGF1C-loaded hydrogel around the AAA resulted in improved vessel flow dynamics in the minipig aorta. These findings suggest that extravascular administration of IGF1R antagonists may have translational potential for treating AAA.

AB  - The bypass hole allows the pig moving at the velocity lower than the gas velocity in the pipeline, thereby reducing its impact on pipe accessory equipment, while also leads to the uneven pig motion. To illustrate the factors influencing pigging slippage and stoppage, this paper proposes an iterative numerical solution for bypass pigging using adaptive mesh, which adopted detailed meshes around the pig, with pig boundaries treated as discretized grids. The accuracy of proposed numerical solution is validated through the consistency analysis of pigging slippages and stoppages with experimental results. The numerical findings indicate that the uneven pig motion is characterized by an initial stoppage, followed by a repeated acceleration-deceleration process with gradually smoothed fluctuations. Initial stoppages, observed both numerically and experimentally, are attributed to pressure gathering over the pig, which can be mitigated by increasing the gas flow, reducing the friction, or lowering the bypass rate. While, sudden stoppages in abnormal pipe sections manifest either as a decelerationstop process influenced by increased friction when entering high friction section, or as a fluctuation-stop process decided by gas compressibility when entering low friction section, which highlights the necessity for precise friction to accurately assess transient pig motion using this numerical method.

AB  - Herbivorous insects use plant volatiles to locate hosts, find food, and identify oviposition sites to aid survival and reproduction. Plant volatiles not only regulate the synthesis and release of sex pheromones in insects, but also help them in the search and orientation of sources of sex pheromones. However, after prolonged exposure to plant volatiles, the changes mediating the mating behavior of diamondback moth (DBM) [Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)] are unclear. DBMs treated with allyl isothiocyanate, a volatile from cruciferous vegetables, did not show improved rates of mating with a limited effect on mating rhythm. This treatment inhibited mating behaviors in 3-day-old DBMs and decreased mating duration in 5-day-old DBMs. After prolonged exposure to allyl isothiocyanate, the total mating duration of DBM was not significantly different from that after prolonged exposure to n-hexane (control). The longest mating duration after emergence in DBM after prolonged exposure to allyl isothiocyanate was delayed by 1 day compared with exposure to n-hexane. Prolonged exposure to plant volatiles intensified the response behavior of DBM to sex pheromones. However, the amount of Z11-16: Ald, a major component of the sex pheromone blend exhibited no change in female pheromone glands. Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide gene (PBAN) was down-regulated in DBMs after prolonged exposure to plant volatiles. These findings suggest that prolonged exposure (6 h) to plant-derived volatiles have little effect on the mating behavior of DBM. This study provides practical guidance for applying phytochemicals in pest control by regulating insect behavior.

AB  - Cocaine administration has been shown to induce plastic changes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which could represent a mechanism by which cocaine facilitates the association between cocaine rewarding effects with contextual cues. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the mPFC have critical roles in cognitive function including attention and memory and are key players in plasticity processes. However, whether nAChRs in the mPFC are required for the acquisition and maintenance of cocaine-associated memories is still unknown. To assess this question, we used the conditioning place preference (CPP) model to study the effect of intra-mPFC infusion of methyllycaconitine, a selective antagonist of ?7 nAChRs, on the acquisition, consolidation and expression of cocaine-associated memory in adult rats. Our findings reveal that mPFC ?7 nAChRs activation is necessary for the acquisition and retrieval, but not consolidation, of cocaine induced CPP. Moreover, cocaineinduced sensitization during CPP conditioning sessions was abolished by methyllycaconitine infusion in the mPFC. Together, these results identify mPFC ?7 nAChRs as critical players involved in both acquiring and retrieving cocaine-associated memories. Considering that drug seeking often depends on the association between drug-paired cues and the rewarding effects of the drug, ?7 nAChRs in the mPFC could be considered as potential targets for the prevention or treatment of cocaine use disorder.

AB  - Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during sperm cryopreservation has a detrimental effect on sperm parameters. Therefore, the use of antioxidants in the sperm freezing extender can reduce ROS destructive effects. In this study, we investigated whether co-supplementation of melatonin and myo-inositol into the semen extender can improve the post-cryopreservation quality of goat spermatozoa. After the freeze-thawing process, sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane and acrosome intact morphology were improved in the combined myo-inositol and melatonin group compared to both individual and the control groups (p < .05). In addition, the mean of sperm ROS, DNA damage and lipid peroxidation were reduced in co-supplementation of myo-inositol and melatonin compared to their individual counterparts (p < .05). Therefore, the synergistic effects of myo-inositol and melatonin on the cryopreserved spermatozoa are highly likely mediated through the reduction in important factors involved in the sperm lipid peroxidation. Finally, we used the cryopreserved spermatozoa for in vitro production of embryos. Results showed that combined group of myo-inositol and melatonin improved the cleavage rate compared to both individual and control groups, although blastocyst rate was improved using both individual and combined groups. In conclusion, co-supplementation of melatonin and myo-inositol is a promising approach for the improvement of goat sperm cryopreservation.

AB  - The greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from the livestock sector is a major concern as GHG can contribute to climate change event such as global warming. The country demand for livestock is rapidly increasing, due to population and economic growth. However, in Malaysia, there is still limited studies on GHG assessment from the livestock sector and its projection based on the self-sufficient level under population growth. In this study, the GHG emissions of different livestock were estimated using the livestock population data published in the year 2010-2019, based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Malaysia's livestock sector is dominated by poultry, swine, non-dairy cattle and goat. The emission is dependent on the livestock species and population. For enteric fermentation, non-dairy cattle accounted for 73.91% of the CH4 emission. For manure management, the main contributors were swine and poultry, accounting for 61.49% and 26.24% of the CH4 emission. Poultry and non-dairy cattle contributed to 63.25% and 20.79% of the direct N2O emission from manure management. Comparatively, enteric fermentation was observed to contribute for more than 50% share of the total CO2-eq emission. The GHG projection was carried out in two scenarios based on the population projection, self-sufficient level and product consumption per capita for the year 2019, 2030 and 2040. The scenario analysis showed that increasing the animal mass by 1% without increasing the livestock population could help in elevating the sufficiency level of food product even with increasing product demand.

AB  - The interaction between jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) pathways, which affects plant stress resistance, is mainly considered to be antagonistic. Using an established theoretical model, we investigated how tea plant (Camellia sinensis) volatiles induced by exogenous elicitors of the JA and SA pathways are affected by the sequence of elicitor application, elicitor identity, and the applied concentrations. We also examined the effects of the volatiles mediated by the JA-SA synergistic interaction on the behaviors of a tea leaf-chewing herbivore (Ectropis grisescens) and its parasitic wasp (Apanteles sp.). The JA and SA pathway interactions were almost always reciprocally synergistic when the two pathways were elicited at different times, except at high JA elicitor concentrations. However, the JA pathway antagonized the SA pathway when they were elicited simultaneously. The elicitor identity affected the degree of JA-SA interaction. The volatiles induced by the JA pathway in the JA-SA reciprocal synergism treatments included up to 11 additional compounds and the total amount of volatiles was up to 7.9-fold higher. Similarly, the amount of emitted volatiles induced by the SA pathway in the reciprocal synergism treatments increased by up to 4.2-fold. Compared with the volatiles induced by either pathway, the enriched volatiles induced by the JA-SA reciprocal synergism similarly repelled E. grisescens, but attracted Apanteles sp. more strongly. Thus, non-simultaneous activation is important for optimizing the JA-SA reciprocal synergism. This reciprocal synergism enables plants to induce multifarious responses, leading to increased biotic stress resistance.

AB  - Plant resistance to herbivores is largely dependent on its ability to defend through biochemical mechanisms. Present study deciphered constitutive and Chilo partellus damage-induced levels of defensive phytochemicals in thirty maize lines, including susceptible and resistant checks. The association of these biochemicals with various indices of C. partellus was computed to comprehend the antibiosis mechanism and group the maize lines in to resistant/susceptible categories. The findings revealed significant variation in antibiosis, growth, and fitness indices of C. partellus when fed on different male and female maize lines, owing to significant differences in the quantity of nutritional (sugars and proteins), antinutritional (phenols, tannins, FRAP and total antioxidants), and enzymatic (TAL, PAL, AO, APX and CAT) components among the test maize lines. Resistant maize lines contained significantly lower quantities of nutritional components, while higher antinutritional and enzymatic components as compared to susceptible lines. Nutritional compounds were positively associated with antibiosis, fecundity and fitness indices, suggesting that these compounds favor growth and reproduction of C. partellus. Conversely, both constitutive and induced levels of antinutritional and enzymatic components were negatively associated with these indices, indicating their detrimental effect on the developmental biology of C. partellus. Additionally, these biochemicals accounted to 70.8 to 79.0% variability in various growth and fitness indices of C. partellus. The A-lines CML 565, AI 501, AI 196, C 70 and DDM 2309-O, and R-lines AI 125, AI 542 and AI 1100 were identified as best sources of resistance, and could be utilized in the breeding program to develop C. partellus resistant maize hybrids.

AB  - The brown planthopper (BPH) is a major pest in rice cultivation, significantly affecting both yield and quality; accordingly, exploring and utilizing anti-herbivory genes to enhance rice's inherent resistance to BPH can be an effective strategy for mitigating infestation. The effects of transposon insertion polymorphisms (TIPs) on rice's resistance to insect pests have not been reported. In this study, through the identification of transposon insertion sites in susceptible and resistant rice varieties, a total of six possible candidate insect resistance genes were potentially located. Among them, a segment of the LTR/Copia transposon insertion was verified in the promoter of LOC_Os04g02720, which carries a cis-acting element binding site in rice involved in the abscisic acid reaction. Quantitative analysis showed a significant difference of the gene expression between insect-resistant and insect-susceptible varieties (p < 0.05). This study provides insights into the functional analysis of transposons and population transposon polymorphisms, whereas the identification of candidate insect resistance genes offers a theoretical foundation for the development of insect-resistant rice varieties.

AB  - Main conclusionCucurbita argyrosperma domestication affected plant defence by downregulating the cucurbitacin synthesis-associated genes. However, tissue-specific suppression of defences made the cultivars less attractive to co-evolved herbivores Diabrotica balteata and Acalymma spp.Plant domestication reduces the levels of defensive compounds, increasing susceptibility to insects. In squash, the reduction of cucurbitacins has independently occurred several times during domestication. The mechanisms underlying these changes and their consequences for insect herbivores remain unknown. We investigated how Cucurbita argyrosperma domestication has affected plant chemical defence and the interactions with two herbivores, the generalist Diabrotica balteata and the specialist Acalymma spp. Cucurbitacin levels and associated genes in roots and cotyledons in three wild and four domesticated varieties were analysed. Domesticated varieties contained virtually no cucurbitacins in roots and very low amounts in cotyledons. Contrastingly, cucurbitacin synthesis-associated genes were highly expressed in the roots of wild populations. Larvae of both insects strongly preferred to feed on the roots of wild squash, negatively affecting the generalist's performance but not that of the specialist. Our findings illustrate that domestication results in tissue-specific suppression of chemical defence, making cultivars less attractive to co-evolved herbivores. In the case of squash, this may be driven by the unique role of cucurbitacins in stimulating feeding in chrysomelid beetles.

AB  - The alternative splicing and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications occurring during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infections remain poorly understood. Transcriptome and MeRIP-seq analyses were performed to identify the gene expression changes, splicing and m6A modifications in the lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs. In total, 1624 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed between PRRSVinfected and uninfected pigs. We observed significant alterations in alternative splicing (54,367 events) and m6A modifications (2265 DASEs) in numerous genes, including LMO7, SLC25A27, ZNF185, and ECM1, during PRRSV infection. LMO7 and ZNF185 exhibited alternative splicing variants and reduced mRNA expression levels following PRRSV infection. Notably, LMO7 inhibited c-JUN, SMAD3, and FAK expression, whereas ZNF185 affected the expression of FAK, CDH1, and GSK3 beta downstream. Additionally, ECM1 influenced FAK expression by targeting ITGB3 and AKT2, suggesting its involvement in extracellular matrix accumulation through the ITGB3-AKT2/FAK pathway. These changes may facilitate viral invasion and replication by modulating the expression of genes and proteins participating in crucial cellular processes associated with immunity and the extracellular matrix. We highlight the importance of these genes and their associated pathways in PRRSV infections and suggest that targeting these may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating viral infections.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a finite resource and its reuse in organic fertilisers made from biowaste and manure should therefore be encouraged. The composition of solid organic fertilisers (SOFs) depends on the type of feedstock and processing conditions, and this may affect P speciation and hence P availability. Phosphorus speciation was assessed in eighteen different SOFs produced from biowaste and digestate. Available P was determined in 10 mM CaCl2 extracts at a fixed pH of 5.5 and at a fixed total P concentration in the suspension. P was dominantly present as inorganic P (> 80% of total P). There was a strong variation in the Fe content of the SOFs and hence in the fraction of P bound to reactive Fe/Al-oxides (P-Fe). The fraction of total P soluble at pH 5.5 correlated negatively with P-Fe pointing to fixation of P by metal salts added during processing, or by soil mineral particles in case garden waste was processed. Therefore, the use of iron salts in processing plants should be avoided. In addition, the presence of P in poorly soluble precipitates lowered the fraction of easily available P. Overall, this study shows that P-t alone is not a good indicator for the agronomic efficiency of SOFs due to large differences in P speciation among SOFs.

AB  - The extent and depth of burn injury may mandate temporary use of cadaver skin (allograft) to protect the wound and allow the formation of granulation tissue while split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) are serially harvested from the same donor areas. However, allografts are not always available and have a high cost, hence the interest in identifying more economical, readily available products that serve the same function. This study evaluated intact fish skin graft (IFSG) as a temporary cover to prepare the wound bed for STSG application. Thirty-six full-thickness (FT) 5 x 5 cm burn wounds were created on the dorsum of six anesthetized Yorkshire pigs on day -1. To mimic the two-stage clinical situation, on day 0, wounds were excised down to a bleeding wound bed and a temporary cover (either IFSG or cadaver porcine skin) was applied; then, on day 7, wounds were debrided to a viable wound bed prior to the application of autologous 1.5:1 meshed STSG (mSTSG). Rechecks were performed on days 14, 21, 28, 45, and 60 with digital images, non-invasive measurements, and punch biopsies. The IFSG created a granulated wound bed receptive to the application of an mSTSG. FT burn wounds treated with an IFSG had similar outcome measures, including contraction rates, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements, hydration, and blood perfusion levels, compared to cadaver skin-treated burn wounds. Pathology scoring indicated significant differences between the allograft- and IFSG-treated wounds on day 7, with the IFSG having increased angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, and immune cells. Pathology scoring indicated no significant differences once mSTSGs were applied to wounds. The IFSG performed as well as cadaver skin as a temporary cover and was not inferior to the standard of care, suggesting the potential to transition IFSGs into clinical use for burns.

AB  - Evaluating the nitrogen (N) use efficiency of animal manure is essential to optimize its application for profitable crop production without impairing the environment. A four-year field study was conducted under corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation in a Brookston clay loam soil using the yield control approach. Treatments included inorganic fertilizer (IN), and liquid (LM), solid (SM), and composted (CM) swine manure applied at the rate equivalent to an available N of 200 kg ha(-1) and a non-fertilization control (CT). Seven N use indices were employed to evaluate N use efficiency. LM obtained comparable corn yields relative to IN. Corn yield in SM was inconsistent from one year to another, and CM had minimal agronomical value in our study. Soybeans with IN posed the highest grain yields of 3,468 and 3,761 kg ha(-1) in 2005 and 2007, respectively. In contrast to grain yield and total N uptake, the gain N removal of either corn or soybeans was comparable between the two alternative years. The distinctions between N supply dynamics of manures and their influences on yield, grain N removal, and total above-ground plant N uptake of corn were well discriminated by N use efficiency (NUE), N uptake efficiency (NUpE), N utilization efficiency (NUtE), N agronomic efficiency (NAE), and N recovery efficiency (NRE), but not by N physiological efficiency (NPE) and N harvest index (NHI). Legacy effects on soybean yield from the preceding corn were detected by NAE and NRE. Based on grain yield in conjunction with N use efficiency parameters, the IN performed the best, followed by LM. The NUE, NUpE, NUtE, NAE, and NRE parameters used to evaluate chemical fertilizer N were also applicable to evaluate manure N efficiency.

AB  - Simple Summary Colostrum is the first food consumed by infants, and it provides a source of passive immunity for newborns due to its concentration of immunoglobulins, which do not enter an embryo's bloodstream in cattle, sheep, goats, and horses. In this study, 60 bulk colostrum samples were collected from Valle del Belice ewes. The samples were analysed for their gross composition, pH, Brix refractive index, colour, fatty acid composition, and mineral content. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation patterns between the bulk tank colostrum parameters and to define, using a multivariate approach, the relationships between them. This study confirmed that the Brix refractive index is a good parameter for simply evaluating the nutritional quality of sheep colostrum on a farm. Understanding the correlations between the compositional parameters will allow for interventions to correctly feed lambs in their first days of life. Colostrum is a major source of immunity in lambs and, in general, in all newborn ruminants. It allows the transfer of antibodies from the ewe to the lamb, and it becomes the exclusive source of nutrients for a newborn. Among the most significant Pearson correlations, the positive correlation between the Brix refractive index (Brix) and protein (0.90) should be noted. Both parameters (protein percentage and Brix) were then positively correlated with the percentage of fat (0.38 and 0.41), urea (0.81 and 0.67), calcium (0.39 and 0.29), and magnesium (0.58 and 0.59), as well as the yellowness (0.78 and 0.75). Somatic cell count (SCC) and pH, parameters which are indicators of subclinical mastitis, were positively correlated (0.49), and SCC was positively correlated with sodium (0.37) and negatively correlated with potassium (-0.28). Among the macroelements in colostrum-calcium, potassium, magnesium, and sodium-the correlations were largely positive. With respect to the colour parameters, yellowness was negatively correlated with lightness (-0.41) and redness (-0.45). The factor analysis split the total of variance into three latent factors. The first factor was named "Colostrum quality of grazing sheep" because it was positively correlated primarily with SCC, pH, Poly Unsatured Fatty Acids (PUFA), and the sum of the omega-3 Fatty Acids (FAs). The second factor, named "Good quality colostrum", was positively correlated primarily with the refractive index, protein and fat percentages, urea content, phosphorus, Mono Unsatured Fatty Acids (MUFA), and yellowness. The third factor was positively correlated primarily with calcium, potassium, magnesium, and sodium, and it was therefore termed "Mineral component of colostrum". Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that the protein percentage, calcium, and magnesium were able to explain more than 85% of the Brix refractive index, which remains a good parameter for simply evaluating the nutritional quality of sheep colostrum at the level of a farm.

AB  - People who live or work in moldy buildings often complain of "brain fog " that interferes with cognitive performance. Until recently, there was no published research on the effects of controlled exposure to mold stimuli on cognitive function or an obvious mechanism of action, fueling controversy over these claims. The constellation of health problems reported by mold-exposed individuals (respiratory issues, fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits) correspond to those caused by innate immune activation following exposure to bacterial or viral stimuli. To determine if mold-induced innate immune activation might cause cognitive issues, we quantified the effects of both toxic and nontoxic mold on brain immune activation and spatial memory in the Morris water maze. We intranasally administered either 1) intact, toxic Stachybotrys chartarum spores; 2) ethanol-extracted, nontoxic Stachybotrys chartarum spores; or 3) control saline vehicle to mice. Inhalation of nontoxic spores caused significant deficits in the test of long-term memory of platform location, while not affecting short-term memory. Inhalation of toxic spores increased motivation to reach the platform. Interestingly, in both groups of mold-exposed males, numbers of interleukin-1 beta-immunoreactive cells in many areas of the hippocampus significantly correlated with latency to find the platform, path length, and swimming speed during training, but not during testing for long-term memory. These data add to our prior evidence that mold inhalation can interfere with cognitive processing in different ways depending on the task, and that brain inflammation is significantly correlated with changes in behavior.

AB  - The Japanese archipelago exhibits a notable difference in snow depth in winter, deep snow on the Sea of Japan side and low snow cover on the Pacific Ocean side. This contrasting pattern has shaped the distribution of infraspecific taxon pairs in a range of woody plants, with taxa found on the Sea of Japan side typically exhibiting a stunted shrub form with multiple decumbent stems. The phylogenetic origin of these taxon pairs is unknown, i.e., whether the two taxa diverged from the same species or if they have different origins. This study aimed to reveal the phylogenetic origin of two varieties of Torreya nucifera (Taxaceae); var. nucifera is a tree found on the Pacific Ocean side, whereas var. radicans is a shrub found on the Sea of Japan side. We examined the phylogenetic relationships of the two varieties and worldwide Torreya taxa using whole chloroplast genomes, chloroplast DNA fragments, and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS). The whole chloroplast genome phylogeny indicated that T. nucifera var. radicans was a sister taxon to Chinese T. grandis, rather than to var. nucifera. In contrast, the nuclear ITS phylogeny indicated that while several haplotypes of T. nucifera var. radicans were closely related to T. grandis, most haplotypes of T. nucifera var. radicans formed a single clade with those of var. nucifera. This implies that the homogenization of the ITS has occurred between the two taxa, while taxon-specific chloroplast DNA haplotypes were retained. These discordant phylogenies suggested that the two taxa have different phylogenetic origins, but have an intricate evolutionary history, involving inter-taxa hybridization and gene flow, possibly when their distributions were confined to sympatric refugia. Given the genetic evidence and distinct difference in growth form, we propose that T. nucifera var. radicans should be taxonomically treated as a distinct species, T. fruticosa.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce disruptions in a wide range of cognitive functions, but it is especially detrimental to spatial navigation. In open environments, rodents organize their spatial behaviors around centralized locations, termed home bases, from which they make circuitous and slow locomotor trips (progressions) into the rest of the environment. Open-field behaviors are organized even under darkened test conditions, suggesting a role for self-motion cues (vestibular, motor, etc.). The impact of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (mPAE) on the organization of spontaneous open-field behaviors under darkened conditions has not been investigated. Here we tested adult female and male rats with mPAE or saccharin control exposure in a circular open field for 30 min in a testing room that was made completely dark. While general locomotion, as measured by reductions in travel distance and increased stop duration, decreased across the test session, the organization of these behaviors, as measured by stop duration, home base establishment, home base stability, progression accuracy, and scaling of peak speeds with progression length, did not differ between mPAE and saccharin control rats. Together, the findings strongly suggest that spontaneous movement organization in relation to self-motion cues remains intact in adult mPAE rats.

AB  - Simple Summary Backfat thickness (BF) and loin muscle area (LMA) are important characteristics in pig breeding. The identification of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes closely associated with these carcass traits may be useful for pig molecular breeding. In this study, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using imputation-based whole genome sequencing data of four selected phenotypic traits (adjusted 100 kg BF and LMA, adjusted 100 kg BF estimate breeding values and LMA estimate breeding values) were conducted in a total of 1131 pigs from three pure breeds (French Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc). As a result, we highlighted CCND2 and SHANK2 genes as strong candidates affecting BF traits. The results of this study may provide additional insight into the genetic contribution of these genes to carcass meat production capabilities in pig breeding and enhancing lean meat percentages in pigs. Improvement of carcass features is an essential goal in pig genetic breeding programs. Backfat (BF) and loin muscle area (LMA) are important carcass production metrics and useful indicators of pig production performance and lean meat rate. However, the genetic architecture of BF and LMA traits remains elusive. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes associated with these traits, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using imputation-based whole genome sequencing data for four phenotypes (adjusted 100 kg BF and LMA, adjusted 100 kg BF EBV and LMA EBV) in 1131 pigs from 3 breeds (French Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc). After genotype imputation and quality control, 14,163,315 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were retained for further analysis. For the adjusted 100 kg BF trait, using the 2-LOD drop method, a QTL with a 13.4 Kb interval (2.91 to 2.93 Mb on SSC2) and containing a SHANK2 gene was defined. In addition, two QTLs with 135.40 Kb (from 66.10 to 66.23 Mb) and 3.12 Kb (from 66.886 to 66.889 Mb) intervals containing CCND2 and TSPAN11 genes, respectively, were found on SSC5. For the BF-EBV trait, two QTLs (128.77 Kb from 66.10 to 66.23 Mb on SSC5 and 42.10 Kb from 2.89 to 2.93 Mb on SSC2) were identified. Notably, CCND2 and SHANK2 were the only candidate genes in their respective QTL interval. Furthermore, we detected a 3.33 Kb (66.106 to 66.110 Mb on SSC2) haplotype block which was detected as affecting the BF_EBV trait, which only contained the CCND2 gene. Thus, we suggested CCND2 and SHANK2 as strong candidate genes for regulating the BF trait for pigs. The empirical confidence intervals of the QTLs were 1.14 Mb (165.65 to 166.79 Mb on SSC6) for adjusted 100 kg LMA and 1.49 Mb (165.26-166.74 Mb on SSC6) for LMA-EBV. These two confidence intervals contained 13 and 28 annotated genes, respectively. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of pig carcass traits. The identified molecular markers will be useful for selecting breeding lines for breeding pigs with superior carcass traits.

AB  - Simple Summary: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) promotes mammalian development and growth. The poly(dA:dT) tract usually acts as a promoter element to regulate gene transcription. In this study, it was found that the length of a poly(dA:dT) tract in the porcine IGF1 promoter can regulate gene expression in vivo. Moreover, this polymorphism is associated with porcine growth traits (days to 115 kg and average daily gain). These results suggest that the poly(dA:dT) tract is a genetic marker for porcine growth traits. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is an important regulator of body growth, development, and metabolism. The poly(dA:dT) tract affects the accessibility of transcription factor binding sites to regulate transcription. Therefore, this study assessed the effects of two poly(dA:dT) tracts on the transcriptional activity of porcine IGF1. The luciferase assay results demonstrated that the poly(dA:dT) tract 2 (-264/-255) was a positive regulatory element for IGF1 gene expression, and the activities between the different lengths of the poly(dA:dT) tract 2 were significant (p < 0.01). The transcription factor C/EBP alpha inhibited the transcription of IGF1 by binding to tract 2, and the expression levels between the lengths of tract 2 after C/EBP alpha binding were also statistically different (p < 0.01). Only the alleles 10T and 11T were found in the tract 2 in commercial pig breeds, while the 9T, 10T, and 11T alleles were found in Chinese native pig breeds. The allele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all pig breeds. The genotypes of tract 2 were significantly associated with the growth traits (days to 115 kg and average daily gain) (p < 0.05) in commercial pig breeds. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the tract 2 mutation could be applied as a candidate genetic marker for growth trait selection in pig breeding programs.

AB  - Environmental stressors to which a fetus is exposed affect a range of physiological functions in postnatal offspring. We aimed to determine the in utero effect of steroid hormones on the reproductive potential of female offspring using a porcine model. Reproductive tracts of pigs from female-biased (>65% female, n = 15), non-biased (45-54.9% female, n = 15), and male-biased litters (<35% females, n = 9) were collected at slaughter (95-115 kg). Ovaries and uterine horns were processed for H&E or immunohistochemistry. Variability of data within groups was analyzed with a Levene's test, while data were analyzed using mixed linear models in R. In the ovarian reserve, there was a significant birth weight by sex ratio interaction (P = 0.015), with low birth weight pigs from male-biased litters having higher numbers of primordial follicles with opposite trends seen in pigs from female-biased litters. Sex bias held no effect on endometrial gland development. A lower birth weight decreased the proportion of glands found in the endometrium (P = 0.045) and was more variable in both male-biased and female-biased litters (P = 0.026). The variability of primordial follicles from male-biased litters was greater than non- and female-biased litters (P = 0.014). Similarly, endometrial stromal nuclei had a greater range in male- and female-biased litters than non-biased litters (P = 0.028). A crucial finding was the greater variability in primordial follicles in the ovaries from females derived from male-biased litters and stromal cell count in the endometrium of females from male- and female-biased litters. This could be inflating the variability of reproductive success seen in females from male-biased litters.
   Females gestated in utero in extremes of sex ratios have altered ovarian reserve postnatally but not uterine capacity.

AB  - The ongoing mass extinction of animal species at an unprecedented rate is largely caused by human activities. Progressive habitat destruction and fragmentation is resulting in accelerated loss of biodiversity on a global scale. Over decades, captive breeding programs of non-domestic species were characterized by efforts to optimize species-specific husbandry, to increase studbook-based animal exchange, and to improve enclosure designs. To counter the ongoing dramatic loss of biodiversity, new approaches are warranted. Recently, new ideas, particularly the application of assisted reproduction technologies (ART), have been incorporated into classical zoo breeding programs. These technologies include semen and oocyte collection, artificial insemination, and in-vitro embryo generation. More futuristic ideas of advanced ART (aART) implement recent advances in biotechnology and stem-cell related approaches such as cloning, inner cell mass transfer (ICM), and the stem-cell-associated techniques (SCAT) for the generation of gametes and ultimately embryos of highly endangered species, such as the northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) of which only two female individuals are left. Both, ART and aART greatly depend on and benefit from the rapidly evolving cryopreservation techniques and biobanking not only of genetic, but also of viable cellular materials suitable for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). The availability of cryopreserved materials bridges gaps in time and space, thereby optimizing the available genetic variability and enhancing the chance to restore viable populations.

AB  - Simple Summary The first and second limiting amino acids in ruminants 66 are methionine and lysine, respectively, and an appropriate lysine-to-methionine ratio is necessary for amino acid balance in a low-protein diet. A Lys/Met ratio of 1:1 increased the antioxidant capacity and the activities of digestive enzymes and reduced the production of ammonia nitrogen in Tibetan sheep. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that a Lys/Met ratio of 1:1 significantly increased the Ace and Chao1 indices, and non-target metabolomics analysis revealed that cis-jasmone and Val-Asp-Arg could be involved in mediating the antioxidant capacity and increasing the activity of digestive enzyme activities in Tibetan sheep rumen. Phosphoric acid, one of the metabolic products, increased cellulase activity by regulating the abundance of Succiniclasticum through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In ruminants, supplementing appropriate amounts of amino acids improves growth, feed utilization efficiency, and productivity. This study aimed to assess the effects of different Lys/Met ratios on the ruminal microbial community and the metabolic profiling in Tibetan sheep using 16S rDNA sequencing and non-target metabolomics. Ninety-two-month-old Tibetan rams (initial weight = 15.37 +/- 0.92 kg) were divided into three groups and fed lysine/methionine (Lys/Met) of 1:1 (LP-L), 2:1 (LP-M), and 3:1 (LP-H) in low-protein diet, respectively. Results: The T-AOC, GSH-Px, and SOD were significantly higher in the LP-L group than in LP-H and LP-M groups (p < 0.05). Cellulase activity was significantly higher in the LP-L group than in the LP-H group (p < 0.05). In the fermentation parameters, acetic acid concentration was significantly higher in the LP-L group than in the LP-H group (p < 0.05). Microbial sequencing analysis showed that Ace and Chao1 indicators were significantly higher in LP-L than in LP-H and LP-M (p < 0.05). At the genus level, the abundance of Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group flora and Succiniclasticum were significantly higher in LP-L than in LP-M group (p < 0.05). Non-target metabolomics analyses revealed that the levels of phosphoric acid, pyrocatechol, hydrocinnamic acid, banzamide, l-gulono-1,4-lactone, cis-jasmone, Val-Asp-Arg, and tropinone content were higher in LP-L. However, l-citrulline and purine levels were lower in the LP-L group than in the LP-M and LP-H groups. Banzamide, cis-jasmone, and Val-Asp-Arg contents were positively correlated with the phenotypic contents, including T-AOC, SOD, and cellulase. Phosphoric acid content was positively correlated with cellulase and lipase activities. In conclusion, the Met/Lys ratio of 1:1 in low-protein diets showed superior antioxidant status and cellulase activity in the rumen by modulating the microbiota and metabolism of Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are prevalent in various environments on livestock farms, including livestock waste, soil, and groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by ARB and ARGs in livestock farms is a growing concern as it may have potentially huge risks to human health. However, the source of groundwater-borne ARB and ARGs in animal farms remains largely unknown. In this study, different types of samples including groundwater and its potential contamination sources from aboveground (pig feces, wastewater, and soil) from both working and abandoned swine feedlots in southern China were collected and subjected to metagenomic sequencing and ARB isolation. The source tracking based on metagenomic analysis revealed that 56 -95 % of ARGs in groundwater was attributable to aboveground sources. Using metagenomic assembly, we found that 45 ARGs predominantly conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines could be transferred from the aboveground sources to groundwater, mostly through plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, the full-length nucleotide sequences of sul1, tetA , and TEM -1 detected in ARB isolates exhibited the close evolutionary relationships between aboveground sources and groundwater. Some isolated strains of antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas spp. from aboveground sources and groundwater had the high similarity (average nucleotide identity > 99 %). Notably, the groundwater-borne ARGs were identified as mainly carried by bacterial pathogens, potentially posing risks to human and animal health. Overall, this study underscores the dissemination of ARGs from aboveground sources to groundwater in animal farms and associated risks.

AB  - Our previous study showed that colored net shading treatments had comparable effects on the reduction of bitter and astringent compounds such as flavonol glycosides in tea leaves, compared with black net shading treatment, whereas the effects on the biomass and phytohormones are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the phytohormone and transcriptome profiles of tea leaves under different shading treatments, using black, blue, and red nets with the same shade percentages. The bud density, fresh weight of 100 buds, and yield under blue net shading treatments were greatly elevated by 2.00-fold, 1.24-fold, and 2.48-fold, compared with black net shading treatment, while their effects on flavonoid composition were comparable with black net shading treatment. The transcriptome profiles of different shade net-treated samples were well resolved and discriminated from control. The KEGG result indicated that the pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathways, and plant hormone signal transduction were differentially regulated by different shading treatments. The co-expression analysis showed that the contents of salicylic acid and melatonin were closely correlated with certain light signal perception and signaling genes (p < 0.05), and UVR8, PHYE, CRY1, PHYB, PHOT2, and HY5 had more close interactions with phytohormone biosynthetic genes (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that different shading treatments can mediate the growth of tea plants, which could be attributed to the regulatory effect on phytohormones levels, providing an instruction for the production of summer/autumn tea and matcha.

AB  - In order to solve the problems of low efficiency and subjectivity of manual observation in the process of group-sheep-aggression detection, we propose a video streaming-based model for detecting aggressive behavior in group sheep. In the experiment, we collected videos of the sheep's daily routine and videos of the aggressive behavior of sheep in the sheep pen. Using the open-source software LabelImg, we labeled the data with bounding boxes. Firstly, the YOLOv5 detects all sheep in each frame of the video and outputs the coordinates information. Secondly, we sort the sheep's coordinates using a sheep tracking heuristic proposed in this paper. Finally, the sorted data are fed into an LSTM framework to predict the occurrence of aggression. To optimize the model's parameters, we analyze the confidence, batch size and skipping frame. The best-performing model from our experiments has 93.38% Precision and 91.86% Recall. Additionally, we compare our video streaming-based model with image-based models for detecting aggression in group sheep. In sheep aggression, the video stream detection model can solve the false detection phenomenon caused by head impact feature occlusion of aggressive sheep in the image detection model.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is a cognitive ability that allows the short-term maintenance and manipulation of information for goal-directed behavior. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) are two brain regions implicated in WM task performance. Several studies indicate that training in WM (WMT) can enhance performance in various other cognitive tasks. However, our understanding of the neurobiological changes induced by WMT is very limited. Previous work from our lab showed that WMT enhances synaptic and structural plasticity in the PFC and HPC in male mice. In this study, we investigate the effect of WMT on cognitive flexibility and synaptic properties in PFC and HPC in adult female mice. To this end, female adult mice were split into 3 groups: a) mice that remained in their home cage (na & iuml;ve), b) mice that performed the alternation task in the Tmaze (non-adaptive) and c) mice that were trained in the delayed alternation task for 9 days (adaptive). The delayed alternation task was used for WMT. In one cohort, following the delayed alternation task, all mice were tested in the attention set-shifting (AST) task to measure cognitive flexibility, followed by harvesting of the brains for Golgi-Cox staining to study dendritic spine density. Our results showed that in female mice, there were no differences in AST performance among the three groups tested, however, the latency to make a choice was reduced in the adaptive group. With regards to dendritic spine density, no significant differences were identified in PFC while increased dendritic spine density was found in HPC of the adaptive group, compared to the na & iuml;ve group. In a second cohort, acute brain slices were prepared after completion of the delayed alternation task to investigate the synaptic properties in the PFC and the HPC. Evoked field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were performed in either PFC or HPC brain slices. Our results show that tetanic-induced longterm potentiation (LTP) in the PFC was not different among the three training groups. In the HPC, theta-burst induced LTP was significantly increased in the adaptive group also compared to the non-adaptive and na & iuml;ve groups. These results reveal both similarities and differences of WMT on performance in the attention set-shifting task, dendritic spine density and LTP in females, compared to males.

AB  - Digestate recirculation is often considered an important way to improve system stability (system acidification, ammonia inhibition, hydrolysis limitations, etc.) and gas production performance. However, it is not clear how the promotion of biohythane production works in anaerobic co-digestion with digestate recirculation of rice straw (RS) and pig manure (PM). Two sets of laboratory-scale two-stage continuous stirred tank reactors were operated continuously for 95 d to investigate the performance of biohythane production in the first/second phase under mesophilic (M)/thermophilic (T) and digestate recirculation conditions. Firstly, biohythane was not produced by PM with RS under digestate recirculation. The main reasons were: 1) Digestive recirculation pro-moted the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic bacteria; and 2) limitations in hydrolysis. Secondly, digestate recirculation has positive effects on the removal rates (removal rates of TS, VS, polysaccharide, protein and TCOD increased by 30.4%, 22.3%, 9.9%, 31.4%, and 11.9%, respectively) and energy yield (up to 68.7%). Finally, there was a higher abundance of hydrogen-producing bacteria (Fervidobacterium [44.9%] and Cop-rothermobacter [18.8%]) in T2, accounting for >80% of the total, and of which the huge hydrogen production potential cannot be ignored. The results provide new ideas for alleviating the energy crisis and developing green energy in the future.

AB  - Overconsumption of high-fat and high-sugar (HFS) diet may affect the hippocampus, and consequently, memory functions. Yet, converging evidence is needed to demonstrate that the type of memory affected by HFS diet consumption is indeed hippocampus dependent. Moreover, the extent to which HFS diet can also affect executive functioning, and indirectly affect memory requires further examination. In this online study, we asked 349 young adults to report their HFS diet consumption and complete a word memory task, the Everyday Memory Ques-tionnaire, and importantly two memory tasks that have been shown to robustly engage the hippocampus, i.e., the Pattern Separation and Associative Memory Tasks. Participants also completed two executive functioning tasks, the Trail Making Task (TMT) and the Stroop Task. These measures assess attention/cognitive flexibility and the ability to inhibit cognitive interference, respectively. After controlling for confounding variables, we found that participants who reported higher level consumption of a HFS diet performed worse on the Pattern Separation Task and that higher HFS intake was significantly associated with poorer TMT task performance and longer Stroop average reaction time (RT). TMT and Stroop RT scores indicative of reduced executive function also partially mediated the relationship between HFS diet and memory performance on the pattern separation task. Taken together, our results provide converging evidence that HFS diet may impair hippocampus-dependent memory. HFS diet may also affect executive functioning and indirectly impair memory function. The findings are consistent with human subject and animal studies and call for further investigations on the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the dietary effects on cognitive processes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the metabolic status, stress and ovarian activity through progesterone profile in dairy buffalo as influenced by post-partum days, body condition score (BCS) and lactation number. A total of 45 dairy buffaloes were involved and divided into three factors based on their BCS (2.5, 3.0 and 3.5, respectively), lactation number (1, 2 and 3, respectively), and post-partum intervals (14, 28, 42 and 56, respectively). Based on findings, from day 14 to day 56 after parturition, blood glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased significantly (p < .01), while malondialdehyde (MDA) and cortisol levels decreased significantly (p < .05) on day 56 of the trial. With increased BCS levels, milk yield, blood metabolites and progesterone improved significantly (p < .05), whereas stress indicators decreased significantly (p < .01). Blood metabolites, progesterone and milk production were significantly (p < .01) higher and stress indicators (MDA and cortisol) were significantly (p < .01) lower in lactation stage. Buffaloes with a greater lactation stage and growing post-partum stage had better blood metabolite and progesterone concentrations and less stress. It was concluded that better BCS and increased lactation stage have significant impact on milk yield, stress reduction and restoration of ovarian activity in buffaloes during post-partum period.

This refinement is specifically targeted at addressing the challenges posed by the low quality of wildlife images captured by camera traps and the limitations of traditional object detection algorithms in feature extraction capability. To address these issues, we have introduced a series of improvement schemes. As a result of these enhancements, there has been a noteworthy improvement in both the accuracy of wildlife detection and the speed of model inference. This advancement offers a convenient and efficient method for the preliminary detection in the context of automated wildlife monitoring.Abstract To autonomously detect wildlife images captured by camera traps on a platform with limited resources and address challenges such as filtering out photos without optimal objects, as well as classifying and localizing species in photos with objects, we introduce a specialized wildlife object detector tailored for camera traps. This detector is developed using a dataset acquired by the Saola Working Group (SWG) through camera traps deployed in Vietnam and Laos. Utilizing the YOLOv6-N object detection algorithm as its foundation, the detector is enhanced by a tailored optimizer for improved model performance. We deliberately introduce asymmetric convolutional branches to enhance the feature characterization capability of the Backbone network. Additionally, we streamline the Neck and use CIoU loss to improve detection performance. For quantitative deployment, we refine the RepOptimizer to train a pure VGG-style network. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method empowers the model to achieve an 88.3% detection accuracy on the wildlife dataset in this paper. This accuracy is 3.1% higher than YOLOv6-N, and surpasses YOLOv7-T and YOLOv8-N by 5.5% and 2.8%, respectively. The model consistently maintains its detection performance even after quantization to the INT8 precision, achieving an inference speed of only 6.15 ms for a single image on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX device. The improvements we introduce excel in tasks related to wildlife image recognition and object localization captured by camera traps, providing practical solutions to enhance wildlife monitoring and facilitate efficient data acquisition. Our current work represents a significant stride toward a fully automated animal observation system in real-time in-field applications.

AB  - Area prostriata is the primary limbic structure for rapid response to the visual stimuli in the far peripheral visual field. Recent studies have revealed that the prostriata receives inputs not only from the visual and auditory cortices but also from many structures critical for spatial processing and navigation. To gain insight into the functions of the prostriata in spatial learning and memory the present study examines the effects of bilateral lesions of the prostriata on motor ability, exploratory interest and spatial learning and memory using the open field, elevated plus-maze and Morris water maze tests. Our results show that the spatial learning and memory abilities of the rats with bilateral prostriata lesions are significantly reduced compared to the control and sham groups. In addition, the lesion rats are found to be less interested in space exploration and more anxious while the exercise capacity of the rats is not affected based on the first two behavioral tests. These findings suggest that the prostriata plays important roles in spatial learning and memory and may be involved in anxiety as well.

AB  - Looper caterpillars including the Biston (= Buzura) suppressaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) and Hyposidra talaca (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), are recorded as major defoliating pests in tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze], are responsible for a decline in tea bush quality, a decrease in yield, and extensive foliage deterioration. The hasty and unlawful usage of chemical pesticides for looper control has adverse effects, such as the deterioration of natural soil fertility, disturbance of beneficial plant-microbe interactions, and an elevated risk of pesticide resistance. Undesired pesticide residues are frequently detected in the final tea product as pesticides have been applied to eradicate looper caterpillars in tea crop. In the current investigation, spore suspensions of two entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana (MG547581) and Metarhizium anisopliae (MG547580), have been employed in vitro to evaluate their effectiveness in controlling three distinct stages of the life cycle of looper caterpillar. The highest rates of microbial infection and pest mortality were measured in the prepupal stage of each pest during in vitro incubation studies and bioassay. Pest mortality up to 90% was recorded with a spore load of 3 x 10(7) cfu/mL at the prepupal stage, while mortality in adults was up to 70% and influenced by species variations. The lowest median lethal dose (LD50) values of M. anisopliae were recorded as 1.1 x 10(6) (prepupae), 1.9 x 10(6) (pupae) and 3.2 x 10(6) (adult) against H. talaca and against B. suppressaria both the entomopathogens showed equal LD50 values in all distinct stages like prepupae (5.3 x 10(5)), pupae (3.2 x 10(6)) and adult (7.6 x 10(4)). Further, median lethal time (LT50) values increased gradually from prepupae, and pupae to adult, both in cases of H. talaca (3.69, 3.97 and 4.40 days in 3 x 10(7) cfu/mL of M. anisopliae) and B. suppressaria (4.30, 4.72 and 5.34 days in 3 x 10(7) cfu/mL of B. bassiana) due to entomopathogenesis. As eco-friendly and nonchemical options for tea looper caterpillar management appear to be limited, the current study explores putative microbial alternatives such as B. bassiana and M. anisopliae for the sustainable management of two significant defoliating pests of tea.

AB  - The latest technologies associated with implantable physiological monitoring devices can record multiple channels of data (including: heart rates and rhythms, activity, temperature, impedance and posture), and coupled with powerful software applications, have provided novel insights into the physiology of animals in the wild. This perspective details past challenges and lessons learned from the uses and developments of implanted biologgers designed for human clinical application in our research on free-ranging American black bears (Ursus americanus). In addition, we reference other research by colleagues and collaborators who have leveraged these devices in their work, including: brown bears (Ursus arctos), grey wolves (Canis lupus), moose (Alces alces), maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). We also discuss the potentials for applications of such devices across a range of other species. To date, the devices described have been used in fifteen different wild species, with publications pending in many instances. We have focused our physiological research on the analyses of heart rates and rhythms and thus special attention will be paid to this topic. We then discuss some major expected step changes such as improvements in sensing algorithms, data storage, and the incorporation of next-generation short-range wireless telemetry. The latter provides new avenues for data transfer, and when combined with cloud-based computing, it not only provides means for big data storage but also the ability to readily leverage high-performance computing platforms using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. These advances will dramatically increase both data quantity and quality and will facilitate the development of automated recognition of extreme physiological events or key behaviours of interest in a broad array of environments, thus further aiding wildlife monitoring and management.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a widespread infectious disease that is currently a major cause of economic losses in pig production. In Hungary, a National PRRS Eradication Program has been introduced to attain a more efficient, economic, and competitive international market position. The program has been also approved by the EU, but the resulting legal obligations have imposed a burden on Hungarian producers to comply with EU competition rules. The implementation of the program has been carried out by the veterinary authorities with the consent of, continuous support from and monitoring conducted by organisations within the pig sector as well as a scientific committee. The PRRS eradication program in Hungary was based on a regional territorial principle and was compulsory for all pig holdings within the regions. In Hungary, large fattening farms operate as all-in/all-out or continuous flow systems. Large-scale breeding herds are predominantly farrow-to-finish types. Although its significance has decreased in recent decades, 20% of the Hungarian pig population is still kept on small (backyard) farms (<100 animals). All PRRSV-infected large-scale farms had to develop a unit-adapted eradication plan, including external and internal biosecurity measures, vaccinations, etc. It was crucial to render each fattening unit free of the disease, as fattening units play a significant role in spreading the virus within the country. The eradication efforts mainly implemented were depopulation-repopulation methods, but on some farms a testing and removal method has been used. As the eradication progressed over the years, the introduction of infected fattening pigs was restricted. Thanks to these measures, Hungarian large-scale fattening farms became PRRSV-free by the end of 2018. The PRRSV-free status of small-scale herds was achieved by the end of 2015 and was maintained between 2016 and 2021. By 31 December 2021, all breeding pigs in large-scale farms in Hungary were free of wild-type PRRS virus. By 31 March 2022, the total pig population of the country, including all backyard farms and fattening units, achieved PRRSV-free status. The future goal is to ensure and maintain the PRRSV-free status of Hungary via strict import regulations of live animals combined with the continuous and thorough screening of incoming and resident herds for the presence of the virus.

AB  - In polluted areas, birds can suffer from changes in diet composition and inferior food quality. It is unknown if pollution can desynchronize the phenology of birds and their prey, resulting in a mismatch between food demand and availability. For 2 years, we studied seasonal changes in the biomass of leaf-eating invertebrates and the timing of reproduction and breeding success of an insectivorous bird, the pied flycatcher, in an area heavily polluted by the Middle Ural copper smelter and in an unpolluted control area. Seasonal variations in herbivore biomass were relatively synchronous in polluted and unpolluted areas, whereas birds started breeding later in the polluted area. In the year with an earlier spring, the herbivore peak was early and short, resulting in lower food availability for birds feeding nestlings. The greater the mismatch between food demand and availability the higher was the frequency of nests containing perished nestlings and the lower the body mass of fledglings. Our data did not support the hypothesis that the detrimental effect of the trophic mismatch on birds is greater in the polluted area than in the unpolluted one. Nevertheless, delayed breeding in the pied flycatcher in polluted areas suggests a higher probability of mistimed bird reproduction in the years with a short period of food abundance. Thus, the synchrony of phenology of birds and their prey is an important pollution-related factor that should be taken into account when analyzing the effects of pollution on birds.

AB  - It has been proposed that plant-plant signalling via herbivore-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) should be stronger between closely related than unrelated plants. However, empirical tests remain limited and few studies have provided detailed assessments of induced changes in VOCs emissions across plant genotypes to explain genetic relatedness effects. In this study, we tested whether airborne signalling in response to herbivory between Solanum tuberosum (potato) plants was contingent on plant genetic relatedness, and further investigated genotypic variation in VOCs potentially underlying signalling and its contingency on relatedness. We carried out a greenhouse experiment using 15 S. tuberosum varieties placing pairs of plants in plastic cages, i.e. an emitter and a receiver, where both plants were of the same genotype or different genotype thereby testing for self -recognition, an elemental form genetic relatedness effects. Then, for half of the cages within each level of relatedness the emitter plant was damaged by Spodoptera exigua larvae whereas for the other half the emitter was not damaged. Three days later, we placed S. exigua larvae on receivers to test for emitter VOC effects on leaf consumption and larval weight gain (i.e. induced resistance). In addition, we used a second group of plants subjected to the same induction treatment with the same S. tuberosum varieties to test for herbivore-induced changes in VOC emissions and variation in VOC emissions among these plant genotypes. We found that her-bivory drove changes in VOC composition but not total emissions, and also observed quantitative and qualitative variation in constitutive and induced VOC emissions among varieties. Results from the bioassay showed that the amount of leaf area consumed and larval weight gain on receiver plants exposed to damaged emitters were significantly lower compared to mean values on receivers exposed to control emitters. However, and despite genotypic variation in induced VOCs, this signalling effect was not contingent on plant genetic relatedness. These findings provide evidence of VOCs-mediated signalling between S. tuberosum plants in response to S. exigua damage, but no evidence of self-recognition effects in signalling contingent on variation in VOC emissions among S. tuberosum varieties.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) has a significant impact on the pig industry, leading to drastic fluctuations in the supply and price of live pigs on the market, leading to substantial economic losses for farmers. As China enters the 'post-ASF' era of regular epidemic prevention and control, the behavior of farmers becomes crucial for effectively preventing and controlling major animal epidemics. To analyze the current situation and factors influencing farmers' epidemic prevention and control behaviors, survey data were empirically analyzed. The findings indicate that the overall level of biosecurity in pig farms is low. Additionally, factors such as technical training, farm size, income share, production organization, and government inspection significantly influence farmers' adoption of biosecurity measures.Abstract Effective biosecurity measures are crucial in controlling and preventing major pig diseases, ultimately ensuring farm income and social stability. This study extracted data from 205 farmer surveys in Sichuan Province, China, to construct a biosecurity index system for pig farms. The biosecurity levels of pig farms were evaluated using a projection pursuit method to identify weak areas. The Tobit model was then utilized to determine the factors that influenced the biosecurity levels. The results indicated that the overall biosecurity levels of the pig farms were low. The study found that the average biosecurity score among farms was 0.61, with a minimum score of 0.37 and a maximum score of 0.89 (on a scale of 0 to 1). These results suggest that there are significant differences in biosecurity levels among the farms. The study also found that the scores for first-level indicators related to breeding environment management, as well as second-level indicators related to personnel management and awareness of African swine fever prevention and control, were significantly lower than scores for other indicators in the farmers' biosecurity systems. This study investigated the factors influencing biosecurity on farms and found that technical training, farm size, income share, production organization, and government inspections had a significant impact on the level of biosecurity implemented. This study emphasizes the significance of biosecurity in enhancing pig farm biosecurity and its role in improving farm resilience to major animal diseases like African swine fever. It also provides valuable insights for policymakers to make informed decisions regarding related policies.

AB  - The increasing global demand for food production emphasizes the use of organic animal fertilizers, such as manure and slurry, to support sustainable agricultural practices. However, recent studies highlight concerns about antibiotic resistance determinants in animal excrements, posing a potential risk of spreading antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agricultural soil and, consequently, in food products. This study examines the dissemination of ARGs within the soil and plant-associated microbiomes in cherry radish following the application of swine and bovine slurry. In a 45-day pot experiment, slurry-amended soil, rhizospheric bacteria, and endophytic bacteria in radish roots and leaves were sampled and analyzed for 21 ARGs belonging to 7 Antibiotic Resistance Phenotypes (ARPs). The study also assessed slurry's impact on soil microbiome functional diversity, enzymatic activity, physicochemical soil parameters, and the concentration of 22 selected antimicrobials in soil and plant tissues. Tetracyclines and beta-lactams were the most frequently identified ARGs in bovine and swine slurry, aligning with similar studies worldwide. Swine slurry showed a higher prevalence of ARGs in soil and plant-associated bacteria, particularly TET genes, reflecting pig antibiotic treatments. The persistent dominance of TET genes across slurry, soil, and plant microbiomes highlights significant influence of slurry application on gene occurrence in plant bacteria. The presence of ARGs in edible plant parts underscores health risks associated with raw vegetable consumption. Time-dependent dynamics of ARG occurrence highlighted their persistent presence throughout the experiment duration, influenced by the environmental factors and antibiotic residuals. Notably, ciprofloxacin, which was the only one antimicrobial detected in fertilized soil, significantly impacted bovineamended variants. Soil salinity modifications induced by slurry application correlated with changes in ARG occurrence. Overall, the research underscores the complex relationships between agricultural practices, microbial activity, and antibiotic resistance dissemination, emphasizing the need for a more sustainable and healthconscious farming approaches.

AB  - Coral reefs in the Dominican Republic have declined rapidly due to global and local threats. Commercial extraction of parrotfish ( Scarus spp. and Sparisoma spp.) has potentially led to a rapid reduction in herbivore populations in the DR, and concomitantly a coral reef decline due to the importance of these organisms to control macroalgal growth. To tackle this problem, the Dominican environmental authorities established parrotfish bans in 2017, 2021, and 2023 for two years each. However, the need for baselines to understand the natural spatial and temporal variation of these assemblages hampers any attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of these bans. In this paper, we present the results of a monitoring program to assess spatial and temporal variability of parrotfish assemblages across various spatial scales along the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. For this, we used a nested hierarchical design encompassing two spatial scales: (1) locality (hundreds of km) as a random factor with three levels (Punta Rucia, Sos & uacute;a, and Samana) and (2) sites (hundreds of m) nested in the locality (three reef sites per locality) monitored at least three times a year ( i.e. , every four months). At each site, five 30x2 m belt transects deployed haphazardly into each reef were monitored to count parrotfish using the AGGRA protocol. Temporal trends of parrotfish assemblages were variable at the scale of sites for 2021 (Permanova, df = 8, F = 2.3573, p level = 0.001, CV = 19.51) and 2022 (Permanova, df = 4, F = 2.7869, p level = 0.001, CV = 20.97) further indicating that these assemblages are highly dynamic in space and time. Our results highlight the importance of taking spatial and temporal variability as an essential factor in designing better and more efficient bans to protect herbivorous fish in the Dominican Republic.

AB  - Bisphenols (BPs) are widely used in the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Many recent studies indicate that bisphenols (BPs) can cause adverse side effects in human, including alterations to the reproductive system, such as hindering conception, polycystic ovarian syndrome, premature puberty or reduced sperm quality. They may raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers and endometriosis. Since there have been no data in the available literature on the effect of BP analogues, BPAF and BPS on the contractile activity of the uterus, the aim of this research was to determine the effect of these two bisphenols on the porcine myometrium (n=6) collected from immature, cyclic and early pregnant animals. Strips of the myometrium were stimulated with increasing concentrations (10(-13) to 10(-1)) of BPAF or BPS, and smooth muscle contractility (tension, amplitude and frequency of contractions) was determined with equipment for measuring isometric contractions. BPAF caused a significant decrease (P<0.05 -P<0.001) in all examined parameters in all groups of animals, but the highest changes were observed in the myometrium of the immature pigs. BPS caused the highest decrease in the tension and amplitude (P<0.05 -P<0.001) of contractions in the myometrium of early pregnant animals and the frequency of contractions (P<0.05 -P<0.001) in the myometrium of immature animals. In conclusion, the results indicate that both BPAF and BPS relax the porcine myometrium, but these changes depend on the physiological status of the animals.

AB  - Defining climate suitability zones accurately can provide supporting information for locating regions for crops with a long period of return on investment such as oil-tea (C. oleifera). The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in suitability for a typical oil-tea species (Abel) under climate change conditions in China. Based on correlation analysis, annual mean temperature, mean temperature in July, annual rainfall, and annual sunshine hours were identified as the factors impacting production suitability. A modified bioclimatic method was verified using extensively collected crop occurrence data. Changes in climate suitability under two different historical periods (1961-1990, 1991-2020) and under two future climate change periods (2021-2050, 2051-2100) using 28 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios were then investigated. Results showed that: (1) The modified method well described the main climatic features of the actual production regions; 96.3% of the dominant production regions and 92.4% of the main production regions were located in the regions classified as most suitable and suitable; (2) Historical climate change has caused the northern and southern production boundaries to move northward by 130 and 70 km, respectively, and the east-central part of the study region has degraded to the suitable classification; (3) Under RCP 4.5, the regional pattern of suitability did not change much, while under RCP 8.5, the area of the most suitable region was reduced by up to 66%; (4) Suitability varied greatly between different GCMs, especially under RCP 8.5. Our results showed that historical climate change had negative impacts in some of the most suitable regions, and that future climate change will have negative impacts on more regions. To maintain future healthy development of production, significant efforts should be devoted to breeding heat and drought-resistant varieties and to improving management practices.

AB  - This work presents the development of a crystal plasticity material model that incorporates both dislocation transport within grains and dislocation transfer across grain boundaries. This model has been implemented in the open-source finite element code MOOSE. In addition, a novel geometry-based criterion is developed to determine the direction of dislocation transfer across grain boundaries. The transfer criterion incorporates the geometric features of the grain boundary, such as the grain boundary plane normal, and its misorientation, which is accounted for through the orientation of the incoming and outgoing slip systems. The model is tested with several cases, including a copper single crystal, bi-crystal, and polycrystal. The development of the transfer criterion, implementation of the model, and its application to these test cases are discussed in detail.

AB  - Background The ovary is an important reproductive organ in mammals, and its development directly affects the sexual maturity and reproductive capacity of individuals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized as regulators of reproductive physiological processes in various animals and have been shown to regulate ovarian development through typical targeting and translational repression. However, little is known about the regulatory role of miRNAs in ovarian tissue development during sexual maturity in goats. To comprehensively profile the different physiological stages of sexual maturation in goats, we performed small-RNA sequencing of ovarian tissue samples collected at four specific time points (1 day after birth (D1), 2 months old (M2), 4 months old (M4), and 6 months old (M6)). In addition, we used ELISAs to measure serum levels of reproductive hormones to study their temporal changes.Results The results showed that serum levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, oestradiol, progesterone, oxytocin, and prolactin were lower in goats at the D1 stage than at the other three developmental stages (P < 0.05). The secretion patterns of these seven hormones show a similar trend, with hormone levels reaching their peaks at 4 months of age. A total of 667 miRNAs were detected in 20 libraries, and 254 differentially expressed miRNAs and 3 groups of miRNA clusters that had unique expression patterns were identified (|log2-fold change|> 1, FDR < 0.05) in the 6 comparison groups. RT-qPCR was employed to confirm that the expression pattern of the 15 selected miRNAs was consistent with the Illumina sequencing results. Gene ontology analyses revealed significant enrichment of GO terms such as cell proliferation regulation, epithelial cell development, and amino acid transport, as well as important signaling pathways including the MAPK signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the oestrogen signaling pathway. Further miRNA-mRNA regulation network analysis revealed that 8 differentially expressed miRNAs (chi-miR-1343, chi-miR-328-3p, chi-miR-877-3p, chi-miR-296-3p, chi-miR-128-5p, chi-miR-331-3p, chi-miR-342-5p and chi-miR-34a) have important regulatory roles in ovarian cell proliferation, hormone secretion and metabolism-related biological processes.Conclusions Overall, our study investigated the changes in serum hormone and miRNA levels in the ovaries. These data provide a valuable resource for understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in ovarian tissue during the sexual maturity period in goats.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigates the structural and functional changes in the cervix of doe goats during different reproductive stages using advanced imaging techniques and biochemical markers. By analyzing the cervix at various stages of the estrous cycle and early pregnancy, the study aims to provide insights into reproductive management strategies. The results highlight the dynamic changes in cervical morphology and oxytocin receptor expression, which are crucial for reproductive success in goats. This research may contribute to improve artificial insemination techniques and overall reproductive health in veterinary practice.Abstract This study aimed to elucidate the morphophysiology and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) expression in the cervix of doe goats during various reproductive stages to enhance reproductive management strategies. A total of 40 cervical samples were categorized into follicular (n = 15), luteal (n = 10), and early pregnancy (n = 15) stages. Utilizing advanced imaging based on functional and morphological markers, the study employed computed tomography (CT) scans, histochemical staining (Masson trichrome and alcian blue), immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to assess structural changes in the cervix and in OXTR expression during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy. CT scans revealed consistent cervical folds and a significant reduction in cervical width during pregnancy, suggesting structural adaptations for gestational integrity. Histochemical analyses indicated a well-organized collagen network and presence of mucins, essential for cervical function and integrity. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting demonstrated elevated OXTR protein levels during the follicular stage, which were markedly reduced during pregnancy, indicating a role in facilitating cervical relaxation and sperm transport during estrus and maintaining cervical closure during gestation. qPCR analysis showed stable OXTR mRNA levels during follicular and luteal stages with a slight, non-significant increase during pregnancy, pointing towards posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cervical morphology and OXTR expression in doe goats undergo significant changes across reproductive stages, with elevated OXTR protein levels during the follicular phase and notable reductions in cervical width and OXTR protein levels during pregnancy, indicating structural and functional adaptations for both reproductive processes and gestational integrity.

AB  - 14-3-3 proteins are signal moderators in sensing various stresses and play essential functions in plant growth and development. Although, 14-3-3 gene families have been identified and characterized in many plant species, its evolution has not been studied systematically. In this study, the plant 14-3-3 family was comprehensively analyzed from green algae to angiosperm. Our result indicated that plant 14-3-3 originated during the early evolutionary history of green algae and expanded in terricolous plants. Twenty-six 14-3-3 genes were identified in the tea genome. RNA-seq analysis showed that tea 14-3-3 genes display different expression patterns in different organs. Moreover, the expression of most tea 14-3-3 genes displayed variable expression patterns under different abiotic and biotic stresses. In conclusion, our results elucidate the evolutionary origin of plant 14-3-3 genes, and beneficial for understanding their biological functions and improving tea agricultural traits in the future.

AB  - The genus Mazama stands out among the Neotropical deer due to their wide intra and interspecific karyotypic diversification, which is associated with an accentuated chromosomal fragility. There are reports of heterozygous Robertsonian translocation (RT) carriers in a free-range population of Mazama gouazoubira (brown brocket deer), as well as in captive animals of this and other species of the genus. To analyze possible negative impacts of heterozygous chromosome rearrangements on reproductive fitness of the carriers, we performed an analysis of sperm meiotic segregation in four brown brocket bucks, carriers of a rob(4;16), and compared the results with those of a normal buck. We established a reliable FISH and sperm-FISH protocol for the brown brocket deer using bovine (Bos taurus; diploid number, 2n = 60) whole chromosome painting (WCP) and BAC probes. Using BAC probes, we revealed the presence of a paracentric inversion (PAI) of the fused chromosome 4 in two of the four analyzed RT carriers. The mean frequency of normal/balanced sperm in the translocation carriers was significantly lower than in the normal buck (94.78% vs 98.40%). The mean value of total unbalanced spermatozoa was almost doubled in the RT/PAI carriers (6.68%) when compared to RT carriers (3.76%), but the difference was not statistically significant. This study demonstrated the efficiency of FISH with bovine WCP and BAC probes in the characterization of chromosome rearrangements and gametic segregation patterns in brown brocket deer. Our results indicate a low to moderate increase in the rates of unbalanced meiotic segregation products in brown brocket bucks heterozygous for RT and RT/PAIs. ? 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - To investigate the effects of lipid sources on growth performance and intestinal health, 72 weaned pigs were randomly allocated to three treatments. Pigs were fed with a corn-soybean meal diet containing 2% soybean oil (SO), or fish-palm-rice oil mixture (FPRO), or coconut-palm-rice oil mixture (CPRO). The trial lasted for 28 days; blood and intestinal tissue samples were collected. The results showed that the crude fat digestibility of the FPRO group was higher than that of the SO and CPRO groups (p < 0.05). The FPRO group also had higher digestibility of dry matter, ash, and gross energy than the SO group (p < 0.05); compared to the SO group, the serum interlukin-6 (IL-6) concentration was decreased. Interestingly, the FPRO and CPRO groups had higher villus height than the SO group in the jejunum and ileum, respectively (p < 0.05). Moreover, the FPRO group had higher Lactobacillus abundance than the SO group in the colon and cecum (p < 0.05). Importantly, the expression levels of tight junction protein ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin in the duodenal and ileal mucosa were higher in the FPRO group than in the SO and CPRO groups (p < 0.05). The expression levels of nutrient transporters such as the CAT-1, PepT1, FATP1, and SGLT1 were higher in the FPRO group than in the SO group (p < 0.05). The improved digestibility and intestinal epithelium functions, as well as the reduced inflammatory cytokines, in the FPRO and CPRO group suggest that a mixed lipid source such as the FPRO deserves further attention.

AB  - BACKGROUNDHerbivorous insects sustain their populations by oviposition. To reduce the damage caused by herbivores, the host plant triggers a defensive response upon detection of egg deposition. However, the specific impact of the egg deposition time of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), on the tomato plant defense remains obscure.RESULTSThis study investigated the effects of tomato plant defenses on cotton bollworm eggs and larvae at different time intervals following egg deposition. The study revealed that tomato plant defense triggered by egg deposition did not directly affect the hatchability of the eggs. Nevertheless, it attracted Trichogramma chilonis 48 h after the egg deposition. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the oviposition-induced plant volatiles (OIPVs) revealed a considerable increase in the amount of alpha-pinene released by tomato plants 48 h after egg deposition. The olfactory results from Y-tube experiments showed that alpha-pinene exhibited a substantial attraction towards T. chilonis. In addition, it was found that the defense response induced by egg deposition for 24 and 48 h significantly inhibited the growth and development of the larvae. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the egg deposition of cotton bollworm altered the metabolite composition and caused significant modifications in the metabolic pathways of tomato plants.CONCLUSIONThese findings provide novel insights into pest management by using egg-induced plant defenses to reduce egg hatching, and impede larval growth and development in herbivorous insects.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we performed DNA metabarcoding to examine prey composition and pest diversity in the diets of four insectivorous species of bats. Then, we evaluated the correlation between bat activity and insect resources and assessed dietary niche similarity and niche breadth among species and factors that influence prey consumption in bats. Additionally, we explored the functional response between these predators and their prey, understanding how bat feeding behavior adapts to the availability of different pest species. We proved that bats provide vital pest consumption services in agricultural ecosystems and their diet included arthropods from 23 orders and 200 families. Moreover, bats responded to the availability of insects. For example, a higher abundance of insects, especially Lepidoptera, and a higher insect diversity led to an increase in the duration of bat activity. In areas with more abundant insects, the number of bat passes also increased. Our results suggested that dietary niche differentiation promotes the coexistence of different bat species and increases the ability of bats to consume insect prey and agricultural pests. Our findings provide greater insights into the role of bats that prey on agricultural pests and highlight the importance of combining bat conservation with integrated pest management.Abstract Insectivorous bats are generalist predators and can flexibly respond to fluctuations in the distribution and abundance of insect prey. To better understand the effects of bats on arthropod pests, the types of pests eaten by bats and the response of bats to insect prey need to be determined. In this study, we performed DNA metabarcoding to examine prey composition and pest diversity in the diets of four insectivorous species of bats (Hipposideros armiger, Taphozous melanopogon, Aselliscus stoliczkanus, and Miniopterus fuliginosus). We evaluated the correlation between bat activity and insect resources and assessed dietary niche similarity and niche breadth among species and factors that influence prey consumption in bats. We found that the diets of these bats included arthropods from 23 orders and 200 families, dominated by Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera. The proportion of agricultural pests in the diet of each of the four species of bats exceeded 40% and comprised 713 agricultural pests, including those that caused severe economic losses. Bats responded to the availability of insects. For example, a higher abundance of insects, especially Lepidoptera, and a higher insect diversity led to an increase in the duration of bat activity. In areas with more abundant insects, the number of bat passes also increased. The dietary composition, diversity, and niches differed among species and were particularly significant between H. armiger and T. melanopogon; the dietary niche width was the greatest in A. stoliczkanus and the narrowest in H. armiger. The diet of bats was correlated with their morphological and echolocation traits. Larger bats preyed more on insects in the order Coleoptera, whereas the proportion of bats consuming insects in the order Lepidoptera increased as the body size decreased. Bats that emitted echolocation calls with a high peak frequency and duration preyed more on insects in the order Mantodea. Our results suggest that dietary niche differentiation promotes the coexistence of different bat species and increases the ability of bats to consume insect prey and agricultural pests.
   Our findings provide greater insights into the role of bats that prey on agricultural pests and highlight the importance of combining bat conservation with integrated pest management.

AB  - Introduction Impairment of learning and memory caused by sleep deprivation is a common symptom that significantly affects quality of life. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising approach to exert a positive effect on cognitive impairment. However, there is less known about the mechanism of rTMS for learning and memory induced by chronic REM sleep deprivation (CRSD). This study was to detect the effects of rTMS on spatial learning and memory deficits by CRSD and explore possible mechanism. Methods Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: wide platform (Control), sleep deprivation (SD), sleep deprivation + rTMS (TMS), and sleep deprivation + sham rTMS (Sham-TMS). Morris water maze (MWM) and open field test (OFT) assessed spatial learning and memory and anxiety of rats with pre/post-intervention. Golgi staining and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to observe structural variations of synapses in the hippocampus. The alteration in gene expression of different groups was analyzed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), and the key gene was screened and identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and subsequently verified with western blotting and immunofluorescence. Results The behavioral test showed spatial learning and memory decreased and anxiety increased in the SD group compared to the Control and TMS groups. Moreover, rTMS improved spine density, ultrastructural damage, and quantities of synapses. In accordance with RNA-Seq, 56 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing alternations in four groups and concentrated on kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). The expression of KMO increased significantly in rats of the SD group compared to the Control and TMS groups identified by qPCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Conclusion 1 Hz rTMS alleviated spatial learning and memory deficits induced by CRSD probably via down-regulating the expression of KMO and improving the structure and quantity of synapses in the hippocampus of rats.

AB  - Purpose The objective of this study is to study the secondary structure analysis of Fasciola flukes from a rare mithun host from Manipur. Fascioliasis, a neglected tropical trematodiasis, is poorly studied in India and is widely believed to be predominantly caused by F. gigantica. Through this study, we want to assess the flukes from the rare semi-wild ruminants of Northeast India. This study is important as the mithun population is semi-wild and its population is declining in Manipur.Methods Sample collected from the difficult and challenging terrain of Northeast India. The sample was collected from mithun and observed under the microscope. DNA was isolated, sequenced, and analyzed using various bioinformatics tools. The secondary structure analysis of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) region was also performed.Results The secondary structure species tree corroborated the Bayesian inference and, hence, strengthened the phylogeny reconstructed. The annotated ITS2 sequence and RNA secondary of the Manipur isolate displayed the typical four-helix or four-domain model. Helix III reveals the presence of the UGGU motif with other deviations like UGG and GGU.Conclusion This is an in-depth analysis of the secondary structure of Fasciola species. The present study has demonstrated the usefulness of ITS2 and its secondary structures for characterizing parasites. The information on fascioliasis in the mithun's population presents itself useful with regards to their conservation strategy as their populations in both Manipur and Nagaland are dwindling.

AB  - Background India is the world's leading producer of coconuts. Many biotic and abiotic constrains limit global palm yield and among the biotic factors, the coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is the major problem in India. The adult beetle attacks the unopened leaves and inflorescences, resulting in a yield loss of more than 10%. O. rhinoceros grubs and adults have different feeding habits as the adults feed on plant tissues, whereas the grubs primarily feed on rotting organic matter. Non-feeding stage, i.e. the larval stage, which is cryptic in nature and spends nearly 90-160 days in the breeding site, is amenable to any control measures so as to reduce the population of actual damaging adult stage. However, indiscriminate use of chemical insecticides has created a lot of environmental and regulatory issues, thus warranting an ecologically safe and environmental friendly alternative option. Hence, indigenous entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) strains, viz. Heterorhabditis indica (CPCRI-Hi1), Steinernema abbasi (CPCRI-Sa1), and S. carpocapsae (CPCRI-Sc1), virulence and reproductive capacity were evaluated against second instar larvae of O. rhinoceros. Results Oryctes rhinoceros larval susceptibility to EPN significantly varied with the treatment dose and period of exposure. The highest larval mortality was observed with S. carpocapsae (100%), and S. abbasi (92%) at 10 days post treatment, whereas H. indica strain induced 72% mortality. At 72 h of incubation, the LC50 values of Sc1, Sa1 and Hi1 strains were 1078, 1663 and 9780 IJs larva(-1), respectively. With different concentration of EPN tested, the production of infective juveniles (IJs) inside the cadavers for Sc1, Sa1 and Hi1 varied between 3223-10,365; 4722-96,572 and 3483-85,453 larvae(-1), respectively. Conclusion Based on the virulence, reproductive capacity, searching ability and LC50 values, it is suggested that strain Sc1 have great potential as a biocontrol agent for the Oryctes management in coconut palms under humid tropical ecosystem. Present study found the effective native strain against O. rhinoceros, and its field efficacy should be tested further to include the EPNs in the integrated pest management program in coconut.

AB  - Tea is being grown on the gentle slopes of Himachal Pradesh located in the north-western region of mighty Himalaya, since 1850s. However, degrading soil health due to rampant usage of agrochemicals, and long-run tea cultivation adversely affects the productivity potential of the region. Analyzing soil-nutrient status is of great value to meet the crop nutrient demand. The research aimed to identify the vulnerable soil properties and their assessment for soil restoration under major tea estates of the North-western Himalaya. The study examined the physico-chemical and biological properties of soils of 37 tea estates. The large variation among different sites for physical parameters signifies the textural difference between the sites under study. Meanwhile, the soil pH of tea estates varied from extremely acidic to slightly acidic reaction, with an overall pH (H2O) of 5.33 in the top soils and 5.47 in the subsoils. High OC (13.35 g kg(-1)) under overall soil depth of tea estates presumably correlated with higher concentration of available nutrients, i.e. N (r = 0.641), K (r = 0.492), and S (r = 0.623) alongside exchangeable Ca (r = 0.724) and Mg (r = 0.718). The substrate carbon availability due to higher amount of organic matter in the top soils (16.1 g kg(-1)) leads to increased biological activity (MBC and DHA) in the surface soils as compared to subsoils. The unscientific approach of fertilizer application led to huge variability in green leaf yield across different tea estates. Thus, to achieve higher yield, it should be necessary to adopt nutrient application in a judicial manner in the tea plantations.

AB  - The major reason that the fully automated generalization of residential areas has not been achieved to date is that it is difficult to acquire the knowledge that is required for automated generalization and for the calculation of spatial similarity degrees between map objects at different scales. Furthermore, little attention has been given to generalization methods with a scale reduction that is larger than two-fold. To fill this gap, this article develops a hybrid approach that combines two existing methods to generalize residential areas that range from 1:10,000 to 1:50,000. The two existing methods are Boffet's method for free space acquisition and kernel density analysis for city hotspot detection. Using both methods, the proposed approach follows a knowledge-based framework by implementing map analysis and spatial similarity measurements in a multiscale map space. First, the knowledge required for residential area generalization is obtained by analyzing multiscale residential areas and their corresponding contributions. Second, residential area generalization is divided into two subprocesses: free space acquisition and urban area outer boundary determination. Then, important parameters for the two subprocesses are obtained through map analysis and similarity measurements, reflecting the knowledge that is hidden in the cartographer's mind. Using this acquired knowledge, complete generalization steps are formed. The proposed approach is tested using multiscale datasets from Lanzhou City. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is better than the traditional methods in terms of location precision and actuality. The approach is robust, comparatively insensitive to the noise of the small buildings beyond urban areas, and easy to implement in GIS software.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper uses the data of fixed observation points in the country's rural areas, the Data Envelopment Analysis model is used to calculate the production efficiency of pig farmers, which shows the efficiency level of pig breeding in the country. Then, the Tobit model is used to analyze that epidemic prevention and control has a positive effect on production efficiency. Finally, the threshold regression model was used to analyze the results: the effect of disease control on production efficiency was different under different breeding scales. When the breeding scale was less than 6.0002, the disease control had a negative impact on the production efficiency. When the breeding scale was greater than 12.9994, the disease control had a positive impact on the production efficiency. The research results of this paper not only help farmers to correctly understand the relationship between epidemic prevention and production efficiency, guide farmers to expand their breeding scale, and actively participate in epidemic prevention and control, but also provide a reference for the government to formulate policies according to different scales to guide farmers to carry out epidemic prevention and control. Epidemic disease prevention plays a critical role in ensuring the healthy development of livestock farming, and the subjective willingness of breeders can be affected by the cost of epidemic disease prevention. To correct the misconception that farmers regard the cost of disease control as an ineffective cost, and to promote the healthy development of the pig breeding industry, our study employed the data envelopment analysis super-efficiency model and panel threshold regression model to evaluate the combination of the cost of epidemic disease prevention and swine productivity using data collected from 1998-2018 across 30 provinces in China. The following results were obtained. (1) The cost of epidemic disease prevention generated a non-linear on swine productivity when the swine farming scale was limited; (2) When the number of animals at the beginning of the year was less than 6.0002, swine productivity was impacted negatively; (3) When the number of animals at the beginning of the year ranged between 6.0002 and 12.9994, the impact was insignificant; (4) A strong correlation was observed between the expenses of epidemic disease prevention and animal productivity when the number of animals at the beginning of the year exceeded 12.9994. These results indicate that publicity should be enhanced to elucidate the combination of epidemic disease prevention and swine productivity among breeders. In addition, the government should introduce relevant policies to encourage the development of large-scale pig farming, such as subsidies for the construction of large-scale farms and insurance.

AB  - Simple Summary: The objective of this study was to investigate the regulatory effects of replacing a high-concentrate diet with a high-fiber content feed, which consists of wheat bran, rice bran, and corn bran, on the productive performance, meat quality, and fat acid composition. Our findings showed that increasing dietary fiber content significantly increased average daily feed intake (ADFI), up-regulated carbohydrate metabolism-related metabolites, proliferated abundances of fiber-degradable microbial communities, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and significantly down-regulated lipid metabolism and cofactors and vitamin metabolism. Our findings indicated that higher dietary fiber content significantly reduced dietary energy provision, effectively decreased the backfat and abdominal fat content of Yushan pigs through proliferating intestinal fiber-degradable bacteria, and up-regulating the hepatic lipolysis-related gene expression. This finding may provide an altered method for rearing domestic Chinese pigs. The objective of this study was to investigate the regulatory effects of a high-fiber content feed on the productive performance, meat quality, and fat acid composition. A total of 18 120-day-old Yushan pigs with similar initial body weight were randomly allotted into high-concentrate diet (high energy, HE) and high-fiber diet (low energy, LE) treatments for the determination of regulatory effects on productive performance, meat quality, and fatty acid content. Further, blood metabolomic, gut microbiota, and liver energy-related gene expression measurements were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that the LE treatment significantly increased ADFI while decreasing carcass weight, fat percentage, and IMF. Metabolomic results showed that the high-fiber treatment significantly down-regulated metabolites that participated in lipid metabolism such as cyclic ADP-ribose and hippuric acid, while up-regulated metabolites were mainly enriched in nitrogen metabolism such as DL-arginine and propionylcarnitine (p < 0.05). Microbial results showed relative abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are significantly proliferated in the high-fiber feeding treatments (p < 0.05). Transcriptomic results showed that genes mainly enriched into the lipid metabolism are significantly up-regulated under the high-fiber dietary treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: higher dietary fiber significantly reduced dietary energy provision, effectively decreased the backfat and abdominal fat content of Yushan pigs through proliferating intestinal fiber-degradable bacteria, and up-regulating the hepatic lipolysis-related gene expression.

AB  - Multigenerational effects on biological aspects and on the life table of Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Sipha flava (Forbes) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are not known. These studies can help further our understanding of the reasons for the conflicting results of the biological performance of aphids determined under laboratory conditions. Hence, the objective of the present work was to evaluate the biological aspects and life table of R. padi in brachiaria (Urochloa ruziziensis (R.Germ. & C.M.Evrard) Crins Poaceae) and S. flava in elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach. Poaceae) during five consecutive generations, in the laboratory. The insects were observed daily under a stereoscopic microscope, recording: number of instars, duration and survival of each instar, duration and survival of the nymphal period, longevity of the adult, biological cycle (nymph + adult) and daily and total production of nymphs. During the five successive generations, the insects were subjected to the same climatic conditions and host plants. A joint analysis of the data obtained allowed us to record that the characteristics of the original infestation (first generation) influenced the results of research carried out in the laboratory with S. flava and R. padi, with significant differences in the biological parameters and life table of the aphids. Based on biological data, it was observed that S. flava showed greater adaptation, with faster development and greater fertility in the fifth generation, and R. padi was negatively affected, showing lower longevity, nymphal survival and fecundity in the second, fourth and fifth generations. Thus, the standardization of the generation used and the use of multigeneration studies are important tools for biological studies of these aphid species and the application of these studies to forage improvement programs.

AB  - Mammalian spermatozoa acquire their fertilizing ability in the epididymis, which is important for sperm maturation and capacitation. Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) is a prohormone-processing enzyme and sorting receptor that functions intracellularly. Recently, CPE was identified to exist in the seminal plasma. However, little is known about the effects of CPE on reproductive function. This study focused on the effects of CPE on sperm function and fertilization. Herein, CPE was identified to be localized in the boar sperm, testis, epididymis, accessory gonad and seminal plasma, with high expression found in the bulbourethral glands and cauda epididymis. Furthermore, compared with high motility spermatozoa, a decrease in CPE abundance was observed in low motile spermatozoa by Western blot analysis. The use of specific antibody to inhibit the CPE in spermatozoa led to a decrease in sperm motility, followed by an expected decrease in acrosome exocytosis and tyrosine phosphorylation in the capacitation process. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) influx, which resulted in a significant decrease in the cleavage rate during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Based on these observations, we suggest that CPE might affect porcine sperm Ca2+ influx to participate in the regulation of sperm function during capacitation. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Understanding niche partitioning of closely related sympatric species is a fundamental goal in ecology. Acoustic communication space can be considered a resource, and the acoustic niche hypothesis posits that competition between species may lead to partitioning of communication space. Here, we compare the calling behavior of two sympatric Bornean hornbill species-the rhinoceros hornbill (Buceros rhinoceros) and the helmeted hornbill (Rhinoplax vigil)-to test for evidence of acoustic niche partitioning. Both hornbill species emit calls heard over many kilometers and have similar habitat preferences which is predicted to result in interspecific competition. We collected acoustic data on sympatric populations of both hornbill species using 10 autonomous recording units in Danum Valley Conservation Area, Sabah, Malaysia. We found that there was substantial spectral overlap between the calls of the two species, indicating the potential for competition for acoustic space. To test for evidence of acoustic niche partitioning, we investigated spatial and temporal patterns of calling in each species. Both hornbills were strictly diurnal and called throughout the day, and we were equally likely to detect both species at each of our recorders. We did not find evidence of temporal acoustic avoidance at a relatively coarse timescale when we divided our dataset into 1 h bins, but we did find evidence of temporal acoustic avoidance at a finer timescale when we used null models to compare the observed duration of overlapping calls to the expected amount of overlap due to chance.Abstract in Malay is available with online material.

AB  - Adipose tissue dysfunction is one of the features of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) with dysregulated adipogenesis, altered functional pathways and increased inflammation. It is increasingly clear that there are also male correlates of the hormonal and metabolic features of PCOS. We hypothesised that the effects of adipose tissue dysfunction are not sex-specific but rather fat depot-specific and independent of obesity. We used a clinically realistic ovine model of PCOS where pregnant sheep are injected with 100 mg of testosterone propionate twice weekly from day 62 to day 102 of gestation. We studied control and prenatally androgenised (PA) female and male offspring during adolescence and weight-matched control and PA female sheep during adulthood. We examined subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and in adult female sheep bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT). Adipogenesis related gene expression in SAT was similar in adolescent female and male controls and the reduction in adipogenesis related gene expression by PA in female adipose tissue was not observed in males. Differences in expression of genes associated with adipose tissue function in adolescence in SAT driven by PA were found in both sexes. In adulthood, the changes seen in adolescent females were absent or reversed but there was an increase in inflammatory markers that was weight independent. In addition, BMAT showed increased inflammatory markers. Adipose dysfunction evolves with time and is focussed on SAT rather than VAT and is generally sex-specific although there are also effects of prenatal androgenisation on male SAT. In female adults, the inflammation seen in SAT is also present in BMAT and the development of blood cells in an inflammatory environment may have systemic implications.

AB  - During the oolong tea withering process, abiotic stresses induce significant changes in the content of various flavor substances and jasmonic acid (JA). However, the changes in chromatin accessibility during withering and their potential impact remain poorly understood. By integrating ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, metabolite, and hormone assays, we characterized the withering treatment-induced changes in chromatin accessibility, gene expression levels, important metabolite contents, and JA and JA-ILE contents. Additionally, we analyzed the effects of chromatin accessibility alterations on gene expression changes, content changes of important flavor substances, and JA hyperaccumulation. Our analysis identified a total of 3451 open- and 13 426 close-differentially accessible chromatin regions (DACRs) under withering treatment. Our findings indicate that close-DACRs-mediated down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) resulted in the reduced accumulation of multiple catechins during withering, whereas open-DACRs-mediated up-regulated DEGs contributed to the increased accumulation of important terpenoids, JA, JA-ILE and short-chain C5/C6 volatiles. We further highlighted important DACRs-mediated DEGs associated with the synthesis of catechins, terpenoids, JA and JA and short-chain C5/C6 volatiles and confirmed the broad effect of close-DACRs on catechin synthesis involving almost all enzymes in the pathway during withering. Importantly, we identified a novel MYB transcription factor (CsMYB83) regulating catechin synthesis and verified the binding of CsMYB83 in the promoter-DACRs regions of key catechin synthesis genes using DAP-seq. Overall, our results not only revealed a landscape of chromatin alters-mediated transcription, flavor substance and hormone changes under oolong tea withering, but also provided target genes for flavor improvement breeding in tea plant.
   This study highlights the important effect of altered chromatin accessibility-mediated transcriptional changes under oolong tea withering on the content alterations of flavor substances and jasmonic acid, and identifies a novel regulator (CsMYB83) that affects catechin synthesis.image

AB  - Simple Summary Diarrhea is common in weaned piglets. Feed supplementation with Zn is one strategy for preventing such disturbances. A total ban on the use of therapeutic doses of Zn will be introduced from June, 2022 in the European Union; hence, the evaluation of different lower doses and forms of this element is very important and challenging. This paper shows the effects of using different forms of Zn preparations (i.e., zinc sulfate, zinc oxide, and zinc oxide nanoparticles) on weaner rearing results and Zn balance. The obtained results indicate that low levels of zinc oxide nanoparticles can express a similar antidiarrheal action as high therapeutic doses of zinc oxide. In this way, the Zn dose concentration in feed supplements for pigs can be decreased. The application of nanoparticles can lead to measurable benefits, including a higher growth rate and better feed use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zinc (Zn) supplementation in different commercial forms on the growth performance, health status, and Zn balance of weaners in field conditions. The animals were fed pre-starter (from the 28th to 47th day of life) and starter (from the 48th to 74th day of life) mixtures differing in Zn form and concentration. Group I was given ZnSO4 at 150 mg kg(-1); Group II received pre-starter zinc oxide (ZnO) at 3000 mg kg(-1) and starter at 150 mg kg(-1); and Group III was given 150 mg kg(-1) of zinc oxide nanoparticles (nZnO). We found that the average daily gain in Group I was significantly lower, compared to Groups II and III. A commonly accepted level of Zn (150 mg kg(-1)) as nZnO can be recommended, instead of therapeutic doses of Zn preparations with the same efficiency. Moreover, a lower level of Zn in the diet can prevent the excessive accumulation of this element in waste and, thus, reduce environmental damage.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in skeletal muscle development. In this study, we identified putative miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the longissimus dorsi muscle between fetus (75 days of pregnancy) and lamb (1 day of age). We detected 1208 miRNAs, 313 of which were differentially expressed. In particular, we found that miR-145-5p was differentially and highly expressed in lamb skeletal muscle. In addition, our results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-145-5p inhibited the differentiation and apoptosis of goat primary myoblasts (GPMs), whereas knockdown of miR-145-5p had the opposite effect. The coding domain sequence (CDS) of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 13 (USP13) was predicted and validated as a target of miR-145-5p. We also demonstrated that the influence as a key regulator of GPMs differentiation is primarily mediated by targeting and inhibiting USP13. Taken together, these results revealed a novel pathway in skeletal muscle development in which miR-145-5p targets CDS region of USP13 to regulate differentiation and apoptosis of GPMs.

AB  - Current agricultural practices in regards to storage of manure come with a significant GHG contribution, due, to a big extent, to CH4 emissions. For example, in Denmark, the agricultural sector is responsible for about 11.1 metric tons of CO2 equivalents; only about 0.2 metric tons come directly from CO2, while 6.0 tons come from CH4. The present study aims at evaluating and comparing two methods based on their effect on suppressing CH4 emissions during storage as well as on preserving and enhancing CH4 yield in a subsequent anaerobic digestion step: the commonly applied acidification with H2SO4 as acidifying agent and thermal treatment at the mild temperatures of 70 and 90 degrees C (pasteurization). Although both treatments effectively suppressed CH4 emissions during storage, they exhibited a significant difference in preserving and/or enhancing the CH4 potential of manure. Specifically, thermal treatment resulted in 16-35% enhancement of CH4 potential, while acidification resulted in decreasing the CH4 yield by 6-23% compared to non-treated manure. Further investigation showed that storage itself positively affected the CH4 potential of treated manure in a subsequent anaerobic digestion step; this was attributed to microbial activity other than biomethanation during storage. In overall and based on the results obtained regarding suppression of CH4 emissions during storage as well as CH4 potential enhancement, pasteurization at the temperatures tested is a promising alternative to the broadly applied acidification of manure.

AB  - Cardiac myocytes rely on transverse (t)-tubules to facilitate a rapid rise in calcium throughout the cell. However, despite their importance in triggering synchronous Ca2+ release, t-tubules are highly labile structures. They develop postnatally, increase in density during exercise training and are lost in diseases such as heart failure (HF). In the majority of settings, an absence of t-tubules decreases function. Here we show that despite reduced t -tubule density due to immature t-tubules, the newborn atrium is highly specialised to maintain Ca2+ release. To compensate for fewer t-tubules triggering a central rise in Ca2+, Ca2+ release at sites on the cell surface is enhanced in the newborn, exceeding that at all Ca2+ release sites in the adult. Using electron and super resolution microscopy to investigate myocyte ultrastructure, we found that newborn atrial cells had enlarged surface sarcoplasmic reticulum and larger, more closely spaced surface and central ryanodine receptor clusters. We suggest that these adaptations mediate enhanced Ca2+ release at the sarcolemma and aid propagation to compensate for reduced t-tubule density in the neonatal atrium.

AB  - Premise In many flowering plants, flowers contain more ovules than fruits have seeds. What determines which ovules become seeds? When photosynthates are limited, as may happen when plants lose leaf area to herbivory, fewer fertilized ovules become seeds. Methods Greenhouse-grown ramets of distinct individuals of a perennial herbaceous legume were manually defoliated to various levels determined in the field, then self- or cross-pollinated. For each seed produced, we recorded its position in the fruit and its mass. From a subset of seeds from different treatments and positions in the fruits, we grew seedlings and measured their dry mass. Results Ovules were aborted more frequently in fruits from flowers that were self-pollinated and from those on plants with higher levels of defoliation. Ovules in the basal portion of the fruits were more likely to be aborted than those at the stigmatic end; this pattern was most pronounced for fruits after self-pollination with high levels of defoliation. Total number of seeds produced and seed mass per pod were greatest in cross-pollinated fruits after no or low levels of defoliation. Mean individual seed mass was greater for fruits with fewer seeds, indicating a trade-off between seed number and seed mass. Seedling dry mass (a measure of vigor) was greatest for seeds in the middle positions of fruit produced by cross-pollination after severe herbivory; no positional differences were seen for seeds from self-pollinated fruits. Conclusions Observed locations of seed abortion may have been selected not only by defoliation, but in part by propensity for dispersal, while positional differences in seedling vigor may be related to seed size and differential maternal allocation based on pollination treatment and leaf area lost.

AB  - While biomass holds significance as a resource, its abundance in South Korea is limited. Therefore, in this study analyzed the chemical characteristics of agricultural by-products produced and evaluated their fuel potentiality. To achieve this objective, multivariate analysis was utilized to create biomass clusters with diverse feature. All investigated biomass types showed heating values of at least 12.6 MJ/kg, adhering to South Korea's Bio-solid recovered fuel (SRF) standard, once the moisture content was reduced to 20 % or less. However, the biomasses only met the heating value of Level 3 of the European standard for SRF, which is at least 15 MJ/kg. Groups were formed based on a multivariate analysis using four variables: the high heating value, and carbon, nitrogen, and ash contents. The groups were centered around wood chips and hog fuel, with a cluster of lignocellulosic biomass materials surrounding them. The clusters formed around four groups. When the biomasses in each group were mixed, the combustion characteristics were compared to the ignition, maximum, and burn-out temperatures. Utilizing biomass grouping, by-products from agriculture and livestock in South Korea can be effectively employed as energy sources.

AB  - Plants need to balance investments in growth and defense throughout their life to increase their fitness. To optimize fitness, levels of defense against herbivores in perennial plants may vary according to plant age and season. However, secondary plant metabolites often have a detrimental effect on generalist herbivores, while many specialists have developed resistance to them. Therefore, varying levels of defensive secondary metabolites depending on plant age and season may have different effects on the performance of specialist and generalist herbivores colonizing the same host plants. In this study, we analyzed concentrations of defensive secondary metabolites (aristolochic acids) and the nutritional value (C/N ratios) of 1(st)-, 2(nd)- and 3(rd)-year Aristolochia contorta in July (the middle of growing season) and September (the end of growing season). We further assessed their effects on the performances of the specialist herbivore Sericinus montela (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) and the generalist herbivore Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Leaves of 1(st)-year A. contorta contained significantly higher concentrations of aristolochic acids than those of older plants, with concentrations tending to decrease over the first-year season. Therefore, when first year leaves were fed in July, all larvae of S. exigua died and S. montela showed the lowest growth rate compared to older leaves fed in July. However, the nutritional quality of A. contorta leaves was lower in September than July irrespective of plant age, which was reflected in lower larval performance of both herbivores in September. These results suggest that A. contorta invests in the chemical defenses of leaves especially at a young age, while the low nutritional value of leaves seems to limit the performance of leaf-chewing herbivores at the end of the season, regardless of plant age.

AB  - Simple Summary:This study was conducted to explore the antibacterial ability of sheep beta-defensin 2 (SBD-2) against E. coli F17 infection in ovine intestinal epithelial cells (OIECs). Our data revealed that E. coli F17 induces SBD-2 expression in OIECs in vitro, which appears to be mediated through the activation of the signaling pathways NF-kappa B and MAPK. Our results provide a novel insight for the functionality of SBD-2, which could be useful for developing anti-infective drugs and/or breeding for E. coli diarrhea disease-resistant sheep.
   Escherichia coli (E. coli) F17 is a member of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which can cause massive diarrhea and high mortality in newborn lambs. beta-defensin is mainly produced by the epithelial tissue of the gastrointestinal tract in response to microbial infection. However, the molecular mechanism of sheep beta-defensin 2 (SBD-2) against E. coli F17 remains unclear. This study aims to reveal the antibacterial ability of SBD-2 against E. coli F17 infection in sheep. Firstly, we established the culture system of ovine intestinal epithelial cells (OIECs) in vitro, treated with different concentrations of E. coli F17 for an indicated time. Secondly, we performed RNA interference and overexpression to investigate the effect of SBD-2 expression on E. coli F17 adhesion to OIECs. Finally, inhibitors of NF-kappa B and MAPK pathways were pre-treated to explore the possible relationship involving in E. coli F17 infection regulating SBD-2 expression. The results showed that E. coli F17 markedly (p < 0.01) upregulated the expression levels of SBD-2 mRNA and protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Overexpression of SBD-2 contributed to enhancing E. coli F17 resistance in OIECs, while silencing SBD-2 dramatically improved the adhesion of E. coli F17 to OIECs (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Furthermore, E. coli F17 stimulated SBD-2 expression was obviously decreased by pre-treatment with NF-kappa B inhibitor PDTC, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 and ERK1/2 MAPK inhibitor PD98095 (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Interestingly, adhesion of E. coli F17 to OIECs were highly enhanced by pre-treated with PDTC, SB202190 and PD98095. Our data suggested that SBD-2 could inhibit E. coli F17 infection in OIECs, possibly through NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways. Our results provide useful theoretical basis on developing anti-infective drug and breeding for E. coli diarrhea disease-resistant sheep.

AB  - The alien leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) is damaging horse chestnuts in European countries. Since native natural enemies cannot control the moth, integrated control strategies must be implemented. In north-eastern Italy, from 1997 to 2020, sampling was performed on 55 sites to record the presence of and estimate the leaf damage caused by C. ohridella and the fungus Guignardia aesculi. The level of leaf removal from the ground in autumn was estimated, and information on altitude (199-1294 m a.s.l.), average annual temperature (4.4-11.9 degrees C) and rainfall (954-1394 mm), and the occurrence of trunk injection with abamectin was collected. Damage caused by the leaf miner and the fungus declined with decreasing temperatures, with negligible damage at sites with average annual temperatures below 7 degrees C (above 1000 m a.s.l. in the study area). Since, in the study sites, complete leaf removal provided comparable efficacy to trunk injections with abamectin, we suggest adopting this environmentally friendly practice to maintain C. ohridella below damaging levels. Interspecific competition occurred between C. ohridella and G. aesculi because leaf damage from one competitor decreased as damage from the other increased.

AB  - Larvae of black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens (L.1758) (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), are increasingly being used as animal feed ingredients. Larvae are usually produced by placing eggs, obtained from adult rearing on growing substrates but can also be obtained by exposing substrates to naturally occurring BSF females. In the latter system, the substrate needs not only to be nutritious for the larvae but also attractive to the females for oviposition. The `preference-performance principle' suggests that female insects prefer to oviposit in substrates that maximise offspring fitness. In this study conducted in Ghana, six organic substrates known to be suitable for BSF production were evaluated for their suitability as oviposition attractants and larval development: pito mash (waste from a locally brewed sorghum drink), millet porridge mash, pig manure, chicken manure, fruit waste, and waste from roots and tubers. These were first exposed outdoors to measure the quantity of eggs laid on them by naturally occurring BSF females. In a second experiment, the quality of the substrates as larval rearing media was tested by placing a standard amount of young larvae to measure the individual and total weights of prepupae obtained, their number, and their development time. The nutritional profiles of both the prepupae and the substrates were determined. The substrate used significantly influenced the quantity of eggs laid and the development of the resulting prepupae, but the substrates most favourable for larval development were not the most favoured by gravid BSF for oviposition. In the oviposition tests, millet porridge mash was the most attractive substrate, whereas only a few eggs were recovered from the other substrates. All substrates allowed the successful development of larvae but pig manure was more productive than the others.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEL)-induced apoptosis in different cells is mediated by various molecular mechanisms, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Selenium, an inorganic micronutrient, has several cytoprotective properties, but its potential protective action against ZEL-induced apoptosis in trophoblast cells and the precise mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of sodium selenite, a predominant chemical form of selenium, on cell viability, apoptosis, and progesterone (P-4) production in ZEL-treated goat trophoblast cell line and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. ZEL treatment repressed cell viability and promoted apoptosis, which was accompanied by an enhancement of the activity of caspase 3, a key executioner of apoptosis. ZEL treatment was involved in the upregulation of malonaldehyde (MDA) levels and was implicated in the reduction of the protein expression of selenoprotein S (SELS), thereby triggering protein expression of ER stress biomarkers (glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)). However, sodium selenite attenuates these adverse effects, including increases in apoptotic rate, caspase 3 activity, MDA, GRP78, and CHOP expression and decreases in SELS expression in cells treated with ZEL or Thapsigargin (Tg, an ER stress agonist). Simultaneously, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, an ER stress antagonist) treatment significantly alleviated the ZEL-induced deleterious effects on cells in response to ZEL, similarly to sodium selenite. In addition, sodium selenite supplementation effectively rescued the ZEL-induced decrease in P-4 production in ZEL-treated cells. In summary, these findings suggest that ZEL triggers apoptosis in goat trophoblast cells by downregulating SELS expression and activating the ER stress signaling pathway and that sodium selenite protects against these detrimental effects. This study provides novel insights into the benefits of using selenium against ZEL-induced apoptosis and cellular damage.

OPDA is derived from plastid-localized alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LeA; 18:3) via the octadecanoid pathway, and is further exported from plastids to the cytosol for JA biosynthesis. However, the mechanism of OPDA transport from plastids has yet to be elucidated. In the current study, a plastid inner envelope-localized protein, designated 12-oxo-Phtyodienoic Acid Transporter 1 (OPDAT1), was identified and shown to potentially be involved in OPDA export from plastids, in Populus trichocarpa. Torr. OPDAT1 is expressed predominantly in young leaves of P. trichocarpa. Functional expression of OPDAT1 in yeast cells revealed that OPDAT1 is involved in OPDA transport. Loss-of-function of OPDAT1 in poplar resulted in increased accumulation of OPDA in the extracted plastids and a reduction in JA concentration, whereas an OPDAT1-overexpressing line showed a reverse tendency in OPDA accumulation and JA biosynthesis. OPDAT1 transcripts were rapidly induced by mechanical wounding of leaves, and an opdat1 mutant transgenic plant displayed increased susceptibility to spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) infestation. Collectively, these data suggest that OPDAT1 is an inner envelope transporter for OPDA, and this has potential implications for JA biosynthesis in poplar under environmental stresses.

AB  - Background and Aims Extant plant groups with a long fossil history are key elements in understanding vascular plant evolution. Horsetails (Equisetum, Equisetaceae) have a nearly continuous fossil record dating back to the Carboniferous, but their phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns are still poorly understood. We use here the most extensive phylogenetic analysis to date as a framework to evaluate their age, biogeography and genome size evolution.
   Methods DNA sequences of four plastid loci were used to estimate divergence times and investigate the biogeographic history of all extant species of Equisetum. Flow cytometry was used to study genome size evolution against the framework of phylogenetic relationships in Equisetum.
   Key Results On a well-supported phylogenetic tree including all extant Equisetum species, a molecular clock calibrated with multiple fossils places the node at which the outgroup and Equisetum diverged at 343 Mya (Early Carboniferous), with the first major split among extant species occurring 170 Mya (Middle Jurassic). These dates are older than those reported in some other recent molecular clock studies but are largely in agreement with a timeline established by fossil appearance in the geological record. Representatives of evergreen subgenus Hippochaete have much larger genome sizes than those of deciduous subgenus Equisetum, despite their shared conserved chromosome number. Subgenus Paramochaete has an intermediate genome size and maintains the same number of chromosomes.
   Conclusions The first divergences among extant members of the genus coincided with the break-up of Pangaea and the resulting more humid, warmer climate. Subsequent tectonic activity most likely involved vicariance events that led to species divergences combined with some more recent, long-distance dispersal events. We hypothesize that differences in genome size between subgenera may be related to the number of sperm flagellae.

AB  - Many herbivorous insects not only cope with plant toxins but also sequester them as a defense against predators and parasitoids. Sequestration is a product of the evolutionary arms race between plants and herbivorous insects and has been hypothesized to incur physiological costs due to specific adaptations required. Contradictory ev-idence about these costs exists for insects sequestering only one class of toxin, but very little is known about the physiological implications for species sequestering structurally different classes of compounds. Spilostethus sax-atilis is a milkweed bug belonging to the cardenolide-sequestering heteropteran subfamily Lygaeinae (Hetero-ptera: Lygaeidae) that has shifted to the colchicine-containing plant Colchicum autumnale, a resource of chemically unrelated alkaloids. Using feeding-assays on artificial diet and chemical analysis, we assessed whether S. saxatilis is still able to sequester cardenolides apart from colchicine and related metabolites (col-chicoids), and tested the effect of (1) either a natural cardenolide concentration (using ouabain as a model compound) or a natural colchicine concentration, (2) an increased concentration of both toxins, and (3) seeds of either Asclepias syriaca (cardenolides) or C. autumnale (colchicoids) on a set of life-history traits. For comparison, we assessed the same life-history traits in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus exposed to cardenolides only. Although cardenolides and colchicoids have different physiological targets (Na+/K+-ATPase vs tubulin) and thus require different resistance traits, chronic exposure and sequestration of both isolated toxins caused no physi-ological costs such as reduced growth, increased mortality, lower fertility, or shorter adult life span in S. saxatilis. Indeed, an increased performance was observed in O. fasciatus and an according trend was found in S. saxatilis when feeding on isolated ouabain and isolated colchicine, respectively. Positive effects were even more pro-nounced when insects were provided with natural toxic seeds (i.e. C. autumnale for S. saxatilis and A. syriaca for O. fasciatus), especially in O. fasciatus. Our findings suggest, that S. saxatilis can sequester two chemically un-related classes of plant compounds at a cost-free level, and that colchicoids may even play a beneficial role in terms of fertility.

AB  - The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process whereby epithelial cells are transformed into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. The transcription factor, X-box binding protein 1 splicing variant (XBP1s) is a key regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERS); but the function of XBP1s in the endometritis-induced EMT process remains unclear. Here we found that uterine tissues from goats with endometritis exhibited an EMT phenotype, with a significant decrease in the epithelial cell polarity marker E-cadherin and a significant increase in the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. We also found that sustained LPS treatment induced EMT in goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs), along with ERS and XBP1s overexpression. XBP1s KO significantly inhibited LPS-induced EMT and migration in gEECs, while XBP1s overexpression showed the opposite result. CUT & Tag experiments performed on XBP1s revealed that MAP3K2 was a downstream target gene for XBP1s regulation. We also found that expression of MAP3K2 was positively correlated with XBP1s expression in uterine tissues of goats with endometritis and in gEECs. Assays for dual luciferase reporter and molecular docking indicated that XBP1s protein regulated the transcription of MAP3K2 by modulating promoter activity. The knockdown of MAP3K2 expression significantly inhibited the migration and EMT of gEECs. XBP1s and MAP3K2 significantly promoted phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, activating the MAPK/ERK pathway. Treatment with the MAPK/ERK inhibitor, PD98059, reversed the effects of XBP1s and MAP3K2 overexpression on LPS-induced EMT. The MAPK/ERK activator, DHC, reversed the effects of XBP1s KO and MAP3K2 KD on EMT.

AB  - Mouse studies have reported anti-stress effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SNK12 (SNK). Specifically, oral SNK administration increased mRNA levels of hippocampal neurotrophic factor and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor in mice with sub-chronic mild stress-induced social defeat; moreover, it improved depressive behavior. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of SNK ingestion against stress in healthy adults. We used the Uchida-Kraepelin test for the stress load, with a low-dose (50 mg/day), high-dose (150 mg/day), and placebo groups (dextrin). The primary outcome was the psychological evaluation as measured by the Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS2) using total mood disturbance (TMD) scores. The secondary outcomes were the score of each POMS2 item, salivary cortisol as a stress marker, and autonomic balance with the low frequency (LF)/ high frequency (HF) ratio. Compared with the placebo group, the SNK ingestion group showed significantly lower TMD scores. Additionally, compared with the placebo group, the high-dose group showed significantly lower scores for Tension-Anxiety and Confusion-Bewilderment, while the low-dose group showed significantly lower Anger-Hostility scores, salivary cortisol levels, and LF/HF scores. Our findings suggest that SNK ingestion could relieve stress (negative feelings, anxiety, tension, embarrassment, confusion, anger, and hostility) resulting from the temporary load caused by work and study.

AB  - Research has shown that leached plant toxins negatively impact the growth and development of larval amphibians. However, tadpoles may encounter these same toxins in food material, and differential exposure routes and distribution of toxic chemicals can yield variable downstream effects on animals. To date, most research understanding the interactions between dietary plant toxins and herbivores has been conducted in terrestrial systems. Despite the abundance of plant toxins in food and water sources, the effects of dietary plant toxins on larval amphibians have not been studied, and tannins could negatively affect these species. Here, green frog tadpoles (Lithobates clamitans) were fed diets with or without 2% tannic acid to test how their growth, development, behavior, and gut microbiome respond to dietary tannins. At the end of the trial, we conducted a behavioral assay to measure tadpole activity and boldness and inventoried the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing. Dietary tannins significantly decreased body mass by 66% and length by 28%, without influencing tadpole developmental stage. We found significant differences in exploratory behavior and boldness during the first minute of our behavioral assay, demonstrating that tannins have the potential to influence behavior during novel or stressful events. Finally, tannins significantly sculpted the gut microbiome, with an increase in the measurement of Shannon entropy. We observed 7 microbial phyla and 153 microbial genera that exhibited significantly differential abundances differences between control and tannic acid-fed tadpoles. Collectively, our results demonstrate that dietary tannins have the potential to alter amphibian growth, behavior, and microbiome.

Four iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous concentrates containing 3, 6, 9 and 12% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae-fermented citrus pulp were formulated and provided for 12 weeks. Chemical composition of fermented citrus pulp appeared as an excellent source of protein as no significant difference was observed on dry matter intake, digestibility of nutrients, SCP, ruminal pH and ammonia nitrogen. It is concluded that SCP could be used in the concentrate diet of ruminant up to 12%. Furthermore, the SCP has the potential of an alternative protein source in animal diet formulation. A study was carried out to evaluate the effect of single cell protein (SCP) supplement as a protein source on nutrient intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and in situ digestion kinetics in four Nili Ravi buffalo bulls. Four iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous concentrates containing 3, 6, 9 and 12% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae-fermented citrus pulp were formulated. All animals were fed a ration with a concentrate/forage ratio of 50:50. Diets were provided ad libitum twice a day as a total mixed ration in a 4 x 4 Latin Square Design. Each experimental period lasted 3 weeks while the overall study 12 weeks. The first 2 weeks of each experimental period were used as adaptation period while the third week as collection period. Chemical composition of fermented citrus pulp appeared as an excellent source of protein. No significant difference was observed on dry matter intake, digestibility of nutrients and SCP among all the treatments. Moreover, no significant effect was observed on ruminal pH and ammonia nitrogen at different times. Rate of disappearance and lag time of in situ dry matter digestion kinetics remained nonsignificant regardless of SCP percentage. Based on results of similar nutrients intake, nutrient digestibility, and ruminal parameters it is concluded that SCP could be used in the concentrate diet of ruminant up to 12%. Furthermore, the SCP has the potential of an alternative protein source in animal diet formulation.

AB  - Extended-release (ER) local anesthetics are often incorporated in multi-modal analgesia or as an alternative when the effect of systemic analgesics may confound research. In this study, we compared the analgesic efficacy of 2 ER bupivacaine anesthetics with different ER mechanisms, a slow-release bupivacaine-meloxicam polymer (BMP) and a sucrose acetate isobutyrate bupivacaine (SABER-B) system. We used a full-thickness unilateral skin incision porcine model to evaluate the efficacy of these 2 ER bupivacaine analgesics. Eighteen male swine were randomized into 3 groups: control (saline; n = 6), bupivacaine:meloxicam (10 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg; n = 6), and SABER-B (10 mg/kg; n = 6). After surgery, pigs were assessed for changes in body weight, salivary cortisol level, and response to von Frey testing at 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 h. Body weight and salivary cortisol levels were not significantly different between groups. Based on the von Frey testing, the pigs that received analgesics showed a significantly higher withdrawal threshold of nociceptive stimulus than those that received saline at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after the surgery. At 48 h after surgery, the SABER-B group had a significantly higher withdrawal threshold than the saline group. The withdrawal threshold was not significantly different from the baseline measurement on intact skin at 3 and 6 h after surgery in the BMP group or 1 and 3 h for the SABERB group. The analgesic effects of BMP were greatest at 3 and 6 h after surgery and that of SABER-B as 1 and 3 h SABER-B provided an earlier onset of analgesia and longer analgesia duration than did BMP.

AB  - Although generalist insect herbivores can migrate and rapidly adapt to a broad range of host plants, they can face significant difficulties when accidentally migrating to novel and marginally suitable hosts. What happens, both in performance and gene expression regulation, if these marginally suitable hosts must be used for multiple generations before migration to a suitable host can take place, largely remains unknown. In this study, we established multigenerational colonies of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a generalist phloem-feeding species, adapted to a marginally suitable host (habanero pepper) or an optimal host (cotton). We used reciprocal host tests to estimate the differences in performance of the populations on both hosts under optimal (30 degrees C) and mild-stressful (24 degrees C) temperature conditions, and documented the associated transcriptomic changes. The habanero pepper-adapted population greatly improved its performance on habanero pepper but did not reach its performance level on cotton, the original host. It also showed reduced performance on cotton, relative to the nonadapted population, and an antagonistic effect of the lower-temperature stressor. The transcriptomic data revealed that most of the expression changes, associated with long-term adaptation to habanero pepper, can be categorized as "evolved" with no initial plastic response. Three molecular functions dominated: enhanced formation of cuticle structural constituents, enhanced activity of oxidation-reduction processes involved in neutralization of phytotoxins and reduced production of proteins from the cathepsin B family. Taken together, these findings indicate that generalist insects can adapt to novel host plants by modifying the expression of a relatively small set of specific molecular functions.

AB  - Trace elements like copper and zinc are supplemented in swine feeds to suppress bacteria and/or promote growth. Due to low absorption rates, trace elements are highly concentrated in swine feces, posing a risk to soil and human health if applied to agricultural fields. In the present study, the concentrations of six trace elements (Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Pb, and Cr) in pig feed and feces were evaluated by sample analysis and data from the literature. The feed-to-feces and feces-to-compost enrichment factors of the trace elements were determined to back-calculate safe concentrations in feed needed to meet permissible trace element concentrations in organic fertilizers. The Cu and Zn concentrations in feeds were the highest, being statistically significantly higher in starter pig feeds than in grower-finisher feeds. Copper exceeded feed limits mainly in the feeds of finisher pigs and sows, while exceedance for Zn occurred in almost all feed samples. Concentrations above the limits were also observed for Pb and Cr impurities in mineral feed supplements. The highest Cu and Zn concentrations in feces were observed for starter pigs. Moreover, significant enrichment of trace elements from feeds to feces was found, with enrichment factors calculated as: 4.68-6.11 for Cu, 3.43-4.60 for Zn, 2.30-3.12 for As, 2.89-4.63 for Cd, 2.45-5.00 for Pb, and 3.32-5.00 for Cr. On this basis, the recommended calculated limits for Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Pb, and Cr in feeds for different ages of pigs were 41-53, 130-175, 2-3, 0.3-0.5, 5-10, and 15-23 mg/kg, respectively. Priority index calculations and the calculated recommended limits indicated that Cu in starter pig feeds and Cd in starter and breeding pig feeds should be prioritized for reduction to enable feces compost to be utilized safely in agricultural land amendment.

AB  - The rosy apple aphid is a major pest of apple orchards, it is also potentially ant tended. Attract&Reward strategy is a promising pest management method, combining semiochemicals as attractant and companion plants as food sources for natural enemies. However, this method is difficult to implement owing to complex multi-tropic interactions (including mutualist interactions) at play in agroecosystems. Using sentinel plants (apple seedlings bearing rosy apple aphid) we investigated individual and combined effect(s) of Attract&Reward components on aphid biocontrol in early and late spring in apple orchards. The attract component was implemented by adding apple seedlings treated with a plant defense stimulator (inducing plant semiochemicals attractive for natural enemies). The reward component was implemented by adding potted plants producing extrafloral nectar. Moreover, the impact of ant tending on aphids (in exchange of honeydew) was evaluated using exclusion device. We demonstrated that the Attract&Reward strategy enabled increasing aphid biocontrol (vs. control) but only when ants were excluded, and only in early spring. The exclusion device successfully excluded ants in early and late spring but not Araneae and Syrphidae. Araneae and Syrphidae were not affected by the individual Attract&Reward components or their combination. The combination of Attract&Reward components is an effective strategy but only when ants are excluded. This is among the few studies showing experimentally that presence of ants conditions the efficiency of biocontrol strategies, including those based on Attract&Reward concept. A better understanding of trophic and mutualistic interactions is required to design effective conservation biocontrol strategies.

AB  - The Asian elephant has been listed as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List since 1986. In Peninsular Malaysia, the elephant population continues to decline, threatened by habitat degradation. Distinguishing their potential habitats is important in mitigating the impacts of forest fragmentation. This study aimed to predict the potential habitats of elephants in the fragmented forest landscape of Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve and to identify its characteristics. Habitat suitability was evaluated using several environmental variables--elevation, slope, land use, lithology, distance to river and distance from urban areas. The results showed that the distribution of suitable habitats mainly occurred in the eastern region of the study area. Elephant habitat prediction, using maximum entropy modelling, indicated that their most suitable habitat was located in a forested area that was greatly influenced by altitude and river proximity, while urban and agricultural areas cause forest fragmentation and restricted suitability. The prediction of wildlife habitats using maximum entropy modelling is a favourable and effective tool for improving the management and conservation planning of wildlife in the region.

AB  - Simple Summary Increasing fibrous feed digestibility while reducing methane (CH4) emission through manipulating rumen fermentation patterns to improve animal performance is the most critical challenge in the animal nutrition field. Nanotechnology has revolutionized the commercial application of nano-sized minerals in medicine, engineering, information, environmental technology, pigments, food, electronics appliances, biological and pharmaceutical applications, and many more. Therefore, animal nutrition scientists also resorted to using minerals and clays such as zeolite with different forms in feeding animals and evaluate this additive in animal performance. The natural zeolite clay is known for its high cation exchange capacity and adsorption characteristics that can modify ruminal fluid viscosity and binding capacity with ammonia (NH3-N). After evaluating the addition of zeolite in vivo and in vitro, results indicated that zeolite (natural and nano forms) maintained rumen pH, increased protozoa numbers, and improved propionate production. Medium supplementation level of the natural form of zeolite at 20 g/kg dry matter (DM) was the most efficient dose in reducing CH4 production, while the zeolite nano-form supplemented at 0.4 g/kg DM was the most effective dose in improving the organic matter (OM) degradability and reducing the NH3-N concentration compared to the control. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro and in vivo dietary supplementation with different levels of natural or nano-zeolite forms on rumen fermentation patterns and nutrient digestibility. In the in vitro experiment, a basal diet (50% concentrate: 50% forage) was incubated without additives (control) and with natural zeolite (10, 20, 30 g/kg DM) or nano-zeolite (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0 g/kg DM) for 24 h to assess their effect on ruminal fermentation, feed degradability, and gas and methane production using a semi-automatic system of in vitro gas production (GP). The most effective doses obtained from the in vitro experiment were evaluated in vivo using 30 Barki goats (26 +/- 0.9 SE kg body weight). Goats were allocated into three dietary treatments (n = 10/treatment) as follows: control (basal diet without any supplementations), natural zeolite (20 g/kg DM diet), and nano-zeolite (0.40 g/kg DM diet). The in vitro results revealed that only the nano-zeolite supplementation form quadratically (p = 0.004) increased GP, and the level of 0.5 g/kg DM had the highest GP value compared to the control. Both zeolite forms affected the CH4 production, linear, and quadratic reductions (p < 0.05) in CH4 (mL/g DM), consistent with linear increases in truly degraded organic matter (TDOM) (p = 0.09), and propionate molar proportions (p = 0.007) were observed by nano zeolite treatment, while the natural form of zeolite resulted in a linear CH4 reduction consistent with a linear decrease (p = 0.004) in NH3-N, linear increases in TDOM (p = 0.09), and propionate molar proportions (p = 0.004). Results of the in vivo experiment demonstrated that the nutrient digestibility was similar among all treatments. Nano zeolite enhanced (p < 0.05) the total short-chain fatty acids and butyrate concentrations, while both zeolite forms decreased (p < 0.001) NH3-N compared to the control. These results suggested that both zeolite supplementation forms favorably modified the rumen fermentation in different patterns.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in optimizing the protocols intended to sperm cryopreservation in domestic animals. These protocols include initial cooling, freezing, and thawing. While different attempts have been devised to improve sperm cryopreservation, the efficiency of this reproductive biotechnology is still far from being optimal. Furthermore, while much attention in improving cooling/freezing, less emphasis has been made in how thawing can be ameliorated. Despite this, the conditions through which, upon thawing, sperm return to physiological temperatures are much relevant, given that these cells must travel throughout the female genital tract until they reach the utero-tubal junction. Moreover, the composition of the media used for artificial insemination (AI) may also affect sperm survival, which is again something that one should bear because of the long journey that sperm must make. Furthermore, sperm quality and functionality decrease dramatically during post-thawing incubation time. Added to that, the deposition of the thawed sperm suspension devoid of seminal plasma in some species during an AI is accompanied by a leukocyte migration to the uterine lumen and with it the activation of immune mechanisms. Because few reviews have focused on the evidence gathered after sperm thawing, the present one aims to compile and discuss the available information concerning ruminants, pigs and horses.

AB  - Background The radiation of mammals at the extinction of the dinosaurs produced a plethora of new forms-as diverse as bats, dolphins, and elephants-in only 10-20 million years. Behind the scenes, adaptation to new niches is accompanied by extensive innovation in large families of genes that allow animals to contact the environment, including chemosensors, xenobiotic enzymes, and immune and barrier proteins. Genes in these "outward-looking" families are allelically diverse among humans and exhibit tissue-specific and sometimes stochastic expression. Results Here, we show that these tandem arrays of outward-looking genes occupy AT-biased isochores and comprise the "tissue-specific" gene class that lack CpG islands in their promoters. Models of mammalian genome evolution have not incorporated the sharply different functions and transcriptional patterns of genes in AT- versus GC-biased regions. To examine the relationship between gene family expansion, sequence content, and allelic diversity, we use population genetic data and comparative analysis. First, we find that AT bias can emerge during evolutionary expansion of gene families in cis. Second, human genes in AT-biased isochores or with GC-poor promoters experience relatively low rates of de novo point mutation today but are enriched for non-synonymous variants. Finally, we find that isochores containing gene clusters exhibit low rates of recombination. Conclusions Our analyses suggest that tolerance of non-synonymous variation and low recombination are two forces that have produced the depletion of GC bases in outward-facing gene arrays. In turn, high AT content exerts a profound effect on their chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation.

KW  - Reproductive system
KW  - Antioxidant potential
AB  - Mycotoxins are natural contaminants of food and feed occurring worldwide. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) are the most frequent fusariotoxins and induce immune and intestinal toxicity in humans and animals. Recently, an association between mycotoxins exposure and impaired fertility has been suggested. However, the effects of these mycotoxins on the reproductive system are not well established. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of FB1 and DON, in combination or alone, on the ovarian morphology and oxidative responses using porcine explants. Seventy-two explants were obtained from six pigs and submitted to the following treatments: control (MEM medium), DON (10 mu M), FB1 (100 mu M FB1), and DON + FB1 (10 mu M + 100 mu M). Histological and immunohistochemical assays were performed to evaluate ovarian changes, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Oxidative stress response was evaluated through lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity response assays. The exposure to mycotoxins induced significant histological changes in the ovaries, which were characterized by a decrease in viable follicles and increase in degenerated follicles. A significant decrease in granulosa cell proliferation was observed in explants exposed to all mycotoxins. In addition the multi-contaminated treatment was responsible for an increase in the cell apoptosis index of growing follicles. On the other hand, the FB1 and multi-contaminated treatments induced a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation accompanied by an increase in antioxidant responses. Altogether, our results indicate a reproductive toxicity induced by fusariotoxins. Moreover, mycotoxins, alone or in combination, modulate oxidative stress response, interfering with the production of free radicals and affecting the reproductive capacity of pigs.

AB  - BackgroundAbout one-third of patients with estrogen receptor alpha (ER & alpha;)-positive breast cancer have tumors which are progesterone receptor (PR) negative. PR is an important prognostic factor in breast cancer. Patients with ER & alpha;-positive/PR-negative tumors have shorter disease-free and overall survival than patients with ER & alpha;-positive/PR-positive tumors. New evidence has shown that progesterone (P4) has an anti-proliferative effect in ER & alpha;-positive breast cancer cells. However, the role of PR in breast cancer is only poorly understood.MethodsWe disrupted the PR gene (PGR) in ER & alpha;-positive/PR-positive T-47D cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This resulted in cell pools we termed PR-low as P4 mediated effects were inhibited or blocked compared to control T-47D cells. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of PR-low and control T-47D cells in the absence of hormone and upon treatment with P4 alone or P4 together with estradiol (E2). Differentially expressed (DE) genes between experimental groups were characterized based on RNA-seq and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses.ResultsThe overall gene expression pattern was very similar between untreated PR-low and untreated control T-47D cells. More than 6000 genes were DE in control T-47D cells upon stimulation with P4 or P4 plus E2. When PR-low pools were subjected to the same hormonal treatment, up- or downregulation was either blocked/absent or consistently lower. We identified more than 3000 genes that were DE between hormone-treated PR-low and control T-47D cells. GO analysis revealed seven significantly enriched biological processes affected by PR and associated with G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways which have been described to support growth, invasiveness, and metastasis in breast cancer cells.ConclusionsThe present study provides new insights into the complex role of PR in ER & alpha;-positive/PR-positive breast cancer cells. Many of the genes affected by PR are part of central biological processes of tumorigenesis.

AB  - Simple Summary Our goal was to determine whether adding vegetable biocholine (VB) to pigs' diets would minimize the negative effects caused by daily aflatoxin (B1 + B2) intake. The consumption of feed contaminated by aflatoxin reduced feed consumption and weight gain in piglets. Intake of aflatoxin in the diet also can cause subclinical intestinal and hepatic oxidative stress. VB supplementation in piglet diets had no positive effects on performance. VB showed hepaprotective potential in the face of a challenge with aflatoxin.Abstract (1) Background: This study's objective was to determine whether adding vegetable biocholine (VB) to pigs' diets would minimize the negative effects caused by daily aflatoxin (B1 + B2) intake. (2) Methods: We used seventy-two whole male pigs weaned at an average of 26 days and divided them into four groups with six replicates each (2 x 2 factorial). The treatments were identified as Afla0VB0 (negative control, without aflatoxin and without VB); Afla500VB0 (positive control, 500 mu g/kg of aflatoxins; Afla0VB800 (800 mg/kg of VB); and Afla500VB800 (500 mu g/kg of aflatoxin +800 mg/kg of VB). (3) Results: In the first 20 days of the experiment, only the pigs from Afla500VB0 had less weight gain and less feed consumption, different from the 30th to 40th day, when all treatments had lower performance than the negative control. In the liver, higher levels of oxygen-reactive species and lipid peroxidation were observed in Afla500VB0, associated with greater activity of the enzymes alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In the jejunum, oxidative stress was associated with nitrous stress in Afla500VB0. An increase in splenic glutathione S-transferase activity in the Afla500VB800 animals was observed. (4) Conclusions: Consuming a diet contaminated with 500 mu g/kg of aflatoxin influences the health and performance in the nursing phase in a silent way; however, it generates high economic losses for producers. When VB was added to the pigs' diet in the face of an aflatoxin challenge, it showed hepatoprotective potential.

AB  - Understanding breeding patterns of mammals can be critical to understanding how they may be affected by disturbances such as wildfire, and to formulating conservation programs. I describe the breeding pattern of the parma wallaby (Notomacropus parma), a nationally-listed vulnerable species, on the New England Tableland in northern New South Wales. Remote cameras that operated continuously over a 17-month period produced frequent detections of parma wallabies at 17 sites. Camera images produced evidence of breeding in the form of females with obvious swollen pouches and young-at-foot. This evidence suggested that 45 separate breeding events were documented. Published records of offspring development were used to estimate birth months. Births occurred in every month except August. On a seasonal basis, few (11%) occurred in winter and most occurred in spring (38%). Females produced 1-4 young per site, equating to 1.9 per year per site. This frequency of offspring production aligns with what has been described in captivity, suggesting that breeding was not impaired 3-4 years after a wildfire. This study has further confirmed the potential to use camera trapping to describe aspects of the breeding pattern in a cryptic marsupial.

AB  - Alperujo (AL), the main byproduct of olive oil production, holds promise for circular economy applications, particularly as a soil amendment. However, composting AL faces challenges, including small-scale facilities and lengthy processes often exceeding four months, increasing costs and limiting capacity. This study evaluated thirteen treatments to accelerate and enhance composting, using AL at seventy percent wet weight mixed with olive leaf as a bulking agent along with various activators and accelerators, including manures, biochar, ash, olive pomace, wood vinegar, and four commercial products with microorganisms. The composting mixture comprised 30 kg wet weight of materials. Temperature, moisture, pH, total organic matter, total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, C/N ratio, phytotoxicity, and germination were monitored. Composting duration ranged from twenty-seven to eighty-four days, with chicken manure and ash mixtures achieving the shortest times, between twenty and twenty-seven days. Initial pH and its daily increase were key factors in optimizing composting efficiency, correlating with shorter durations (r between -0.65 and -0.70). The highest-quality composts were obtained with cow, goat, and chicken manure, all surpassing two percent total nitrogen and exhibiting C/N ratios ranging from 14.6 to 26.1. Mean sunflower and pea biomass production and nitrogen use efficiency were between 1.43 to 1.87 times and 1.96 to 4.12 times higher, respectively, for compost enriched with microorganisms, demonstrating their effectiveness in supporting plant development. Composts, except those with ashes, met regulatory limits for heavy metals and polyphenols, confirming their safety and suitability as organic fertilizers. Optimized AL composting mixtures can produce high-quality, eco-friendly amendments, shorten composting times, and improve plant growth.

AB  - In pigs, meat quality and production are two important traits affecting the pig industry and human health. Compared to lean-type pigs, fat-type pigs contain higher intramuscular fat (IMF) contents, better taste and nutritional value. To uncover genetic factors controlling differences related to IMF in pig muscle, we performed RNA-seq analysis on the transcriptomes of the Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of Laiwu pigs (LW, fat-type pigs) and commercial Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire pigs (DLY, lean-type pigs) at 150 d to compare the expression profiles of mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA. A total of 225 mRNAs, 12 miRNAs and 57 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed at the criteria of |log(2)(foldchange)| > 1 and q < 0.05. The mRNA expression of LDHB was significantly higher in the LD muscle of LW compared to DLY pigs with log(2)(foldchange) being 9.66. Using protein interaction prediction method, we identified more interactions of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) associated with upregulated mRNAs, whereas versican (VCAN) and proenkephalin (PENK) were associated with downregulated mRNAs in LW pigs. Integrated analysis on differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and miRNAs in the LD muscle between LW and DLY pigs revealed two network modules: between five upregulated mRNA genes (GALNT15, FKBP5, PPARGC1A, LOC110258214 and LOC110258215) and six downregulated miRNA genes (ssc-let-7a, ssc-miR190-3p, ssc-miR356-5p, ssc-miR573-5p, ssc-miR204-5p and ssc-miR-10383), and between three downregulated DE mRNA genes (IFRD1, LOC110258600 and LOC102158401) and six upregulated DE miRNA genes (ssc-miR1379-3p, ssc-miR1379-5p, ssc-miR397-5p, ssc-miR1358-5p, ssc-miR299-5p and ssc-miR1156-5p) in LW pigs. Based on the mRNA and ncRNA binding site targeting database, we constructed a regulatory network with miRNA as the center and mRNA and lncRNA as the target genes, including GALNT15/ssc-let-7a/LOC100523888, IFRD1/ssc-miR1379-5p/CD99, etc., forming a ceRNA network in the LD muscles that are differentially expressed between LW and DLY pigs. Collectively, these data may provide resources for further investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying differences in meat traits between lean- and fat-type pigs.

AB  - While single-cell technologies have greatly advanced our comprehension of human brain cell types and functions, studies including large numbers of donors and multiple brain regions are needed to extend our understanding of brain cell heterogeneity. Integrating atlas-level single-cell data presents a chance to reveal rare cell types and cellular heterogeneity across brain regions. Here we present the Brain Cell Atlas, a comprehensive reference atlas of brain cells, by assembling single-cell data from 70 human and 103 mouse studies of the brain throughout major developmental stages across brain regions, covering over 26.3 million cells or nuclei from both healthy and diseased tissues. Using machine-learning based algorithms, the Brain Cell Atlas provides a consensus cell type annotation, and it showcases the identification of putative neural progenitor cells and a cell subpopulation of PCDH9high microglia in the human brain.

AB  - Modification of surface structure for the promotion of food safety and health protection is a technology of interest among many industries. With this study, we aimed specifically to develop a tenable solution for the fabrication of self-cleaning biomimetic surface structures for agricultural applications such as post-harvest packing materials and greenhouse cover screens. Phytopathogenic fungi such as Botrytis cinerea are a major concern for agricultural systems. These molds are spread by airborne conidia that contaminate surfaces and infect plants and fresh produce, causing significant losses. The research examined the adhesive role of microstructures of natural and synthetic surfaces and assessed the feasibility of structured biomimetic surfaces to easily wash off fungal conidia. Soft lithography was used to create polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replications of Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Colocasia esculenta (elephant ear) leaves. Conidia of B. cinerea were applied to natural surfaces for a washing procedure and the ratios between applied and remaining conidia were compared using microscopy imaging. The obtained results confirmed the hypothesis that the dust-repellent C. esculenta leaves have a higher conidia-repellency compared to tomato leaves which are known for their high sensitivities to phytopathogenic molds. This study found that microstructure replication does not mimic conidia repellency found in nature and that conidia repellency is affected by a mix of parameters, including microstructure and hydrophobicity. To examine the effect of hydrophobicity, the study included measurements and analyses of apparent contact angles of natural and synthetic surfaces including activated (hydrophilic) surfaces. No correlation was found between the surface apparent contact angle and conidia repellency ability, demonstrating variation in washing capability correlated to microstructure and hydrophobicity. It was also found that a microscale sub-surface (tomato trichromes) had a high conidia-repelling capability, demonstrating an important role of non-superhydrophobic microstructures.

AB  - The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros) is one of the most destructive insect pests of coconut and oil palms in tropical Asia and the Pacific islands. Members of a new variant, known as CRB-G (clade I), have recently spread into the Pacific islands, causing significant damage. Biopesticides containing Metarhizium spp. are the strongest candidates for inundative biological control against the emerging CRB threat. Selection of the most virulent and robust isolate may determine the impact of this control option on the pest. In this work, CRB specimens with natural fungal infection were collected in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Solomon Islands (SI). Putative entomopathogenic fungi were isolated and identified. These new isolates and some previously obtained from other Pacific countries were molecularly identified, characterized, and tested for virulence against CRB larval populations in PNG and SI in laboratory bioassays. Of the new isolates collected, four obtained from SI were identified as Metarhizium majus (conidia length similar to 11-15 mu m), and four from PNG were identified as Metarhizium pingshaense (conidia length similar to 4-6 mu m). The most virulent isolate was M. majus AgR-F717, which caused 100 % mortality in 20-23 days against a CRB variant from the CRB-S grouping (clade II) in laboratory bioassays carried out in PNG. Isolates of M. pingshaense did not show pathogenicity against CRB larvae. M. majus AgR-F717 was also the most virulent in laboratory bioassays using the mixed SI population (from both CRB-S and CRB-G groupings) and was selected for further evaluation using artificial breeding sites. Under field conditions, this isolate demonstrated its ability to infect CRB, dispersal up to 100 m from treated artificial breeding sites, and persistence in soil for at least four months. The new isolate AgR-F717 of M. majus has demonstrated potential as an augmentative biological control agent for CRB in PNG and SI.

AB  - At LFB USA, Inc., transgenic goats are utilized for the production of recombinant human protein thera-peutics in their milk through the rPROTM Technology platform. This retrospective analysis and report describes the results of induced parturition and its use as a management tool in this large herd of dairy goats. Over a three-year period, 342 does received pronuclear microinjected (MI) embryos transferred into the oviductal lumen via midline laparotomy (day 1). To initiate the induction process, does were given intramuscular injections (IM) of 10 mg each of prostaglandin (Lutalyse (R)) and dexamethasone to induce parturition on days 144-148 of pregnancy. Mean and Standard Deviation (+/- SD) time to partu-rition was 36.7 (+/- 6.5) hours. Does were given these injections at 4pm on Sundays with an expected kidding time of late Monday into Tuesday morning. Of the 342 does, 333 or 97% had kidded by 3pm the following Tuesday, and 313 or 91% kidded in the 18 h between 9pm Monday and 3pm on Tuesday or between 29 and 47 h post induction. By the end of Tuesday, most kids had received colostrum and were transferred to the nursery. The incidences of kid mortality and retained placenta were 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively, clearly achieving a priority at this commercial operation for generating a high percentage of live kids (97.5%) of marked value being produced. The use of induced parturition allowed this large dairy operation to designate two 9-h time blocks in which to concentrate parturition times within the herd. This facilitated strategic scheduling to optimize availability of staff, in order to assist with parturition, separate kids from the dam at birth, and ensure adequate and prompt feeding of colostrum. Predicting the time of kidding in this way can serve as an effective management tool, especially to help reduce kid mortality and prevent disease spread by restricting suckling of colostrum.

AB  - Oil tea (Camellia oleifera Abel.), an important edible oil tree found in the acidic soil of south China, is tolerant to aluminum (Al); however, the mechanism via which it detoxifies Al remains unclear. The present study investigated the accumulation and distribution of Al and the changes in antioxidant components in C. oleifera leaves at different stages of growth. The analysis revealed that the content of Al in young, mature, and old leaves was 1.53, 7.49, and 12.04 g kg(-1), respectively. In the leaves, Al was mainly accumulated in the cell wall, which accounted for 66.03%, 79.94%, and 86.51% of the total Al accumulation in young, mature, and old leaves, respectively. In the leaf cell wall, the Al content in hemicellulose increased from 54.22% to 81.72% with leaf age. The proportion of Al in the upper epidermis, lower epidermis, palisade, and spongy parenchyma cell walls increased with leaf age. The activity of antioxidant enzymes increased and showed a synergistic effect on Al stress with leaf age. The peroxidase activity was the highest in mature leaves, 2.3 times that in young leaves. Meanwhile, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities and total phenol content were the highest in young leaves. Correlation analysis showed that antioxidant system composed of catalase, superoxide dismutase and total phenol (CAT, SOD, and TP) was negatively correlated with the Al content in C. oleifera leaves. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content was positively correlated with Al content in C. oleifera leaves, indicating that the MDA in the leaves helped resist Al stress in C. oleifera. Thus, our findings suggest that the increase in antioxidant properties and modification of the cell wall contributed to Al detoxification in the Al hyperaccumulator C. oleifera.

AB  - Terpenes are important mediators of plant chemical response to environmental cues. Here, we describe the genome-wide identification and biochemical characterization of TPS-a members in Medicago truncatula, a model legume crop. Genome mining identified thirty-nine full-length terpene synthases with a significant number predicted to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Biochemical characterization of the TPS-a subfamily associated with sesquiterpene biosynthesis revealed such compounds, that exhibit substantial biological activity in other plants. Gene expression analysis using qPCR and the Medicago gene atlas illustrated distinct tissue and time-based variation in expression in leaves and roots. Together our work establishes the gene-to-metabolite relationships for sesquiterpene synthases in M. truncatula. Understanding the biosynthetic capacity is a foundational step to defining the ecological roles of this important family of compounds.

AB  - Simple Summary In Spain, goat farms are mainly oriented to milk production, although kid meat contributes to their sustainability, particularly in autochthonous breeds such as Payoya. Usually, kids are fed artificial milk until slaughter, allowing the use of goat milk for the commercialization of cheese, but several studies indicate that feeding kids natural milk improve the quality of their meat. The aim of the present study was to find traceability markers to discriminate between kids that are fed natural milk (with different goat management systems) and those fed a milk replacer. For this purpose, we proposed the quantification of retinol and alpha-tocopherol contents in plasma and fat, the amount of kidney fat, lipid oxidation, and some fat color parameters as potential markers. The results showed that plasma retinol concentrations were higher in kids fed feeding systems with synthetic vitamins. The plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations were higher in kids fed grass-based feeding systems (which contain the natural forms of these vitamins). A dilution effect was shown for the retinol concentration in fat. Collectively, the analyzed variables allowed a discriminant analysis to correctly classify kids according to their feeding system and could ensure traceability to consumers. The effects of Payoya kid feeding systems on the fat-soluble vitamin (retinol/alpha-tocopherol) contents, fat content, fat color, and the oxidation index were evaluated to determine their potential for use as feeding system traceability tools. Four groups of Payoya kids (55 animals in total) fed milk exclusively were studied: a group fed a milk replacer (MR) and three groups fed natural milk from dams reared with different management systems (mountain grazing (MG), cultivated meadow (CM) and total mixed ration (TMR)). Kids were slaughtered around one month of age and 8 kg of live weight. Kids from the MG and CM groups presented lower retinol (5.56 and 3.72 mu g/mL) and higher alpha-tocopherol plasma (11.43 and 8.85 mu g/mL) concentrations than those from the TMR and MR groups (14.98 and 22.47 mu g/mL of retinol; 2.49 and 0.52 mu g/mL of alpha-tocopherol, respectively) (p < 0.001). With respect to fat, kids with a higher intramuscular fat percentage (CM and TMR groups) had lower retinol contents (16.52 and 15.99 mu g/mL, respectively) than kids from the MG and MR groups (26.81 and 22.63 mu g/mL, respectively) (p < 0.001). A dilution effect of vitamins on fat was shown: the higher the amount of fat, the lower the vitamin concentrations, the higher the lipid oxidation index (MDA), and the lower the SUM (absolute value of the integral of the translated spectra between 450 and 510 nm). A discriminant analysis that included all studied variables showed that 94.4% of the kids were classified correctly according to their feeding system and could allow traceability to the consumer.

The drug also shows neuroprotective activity on the hippocampus. In this study, the impact of LC on learning processes was assessed. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats (n = 40) were used. Lacosamide was administered p.o. as a single (25 mg/kg or 75 mg/kg) or repeated doses (75 mg/kg). The effect of the drug was assessed in the Morris water maze (spatial memory) and the passive avoidance (PA) (emotional memory). Results: Lacosamide administered at a single dose or repeatedly did not impair spatial memory in Morris water maze. Higher swimming speed was observed in rats after administration of acute doses of LC. In PA, the disturbance of emotional memory was observed only after the single high dose of LC. Conclusion: Lacosamide does not impair memory and learning processes. The emotional memory impairment observed after the acute high dose appears to be temporary and did not occur after repeated administration. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the physiological and meat quality differences between Non-Ambulatory, Non-Injured (NANI), and without apparent abnormalities (non-NANI) pigs in a commercial slaughterhouse setting, focusing on the impact of stress and health conditions on the overall well-being and meat quality of the animals. A total of 241 surgically castrated crossbred male pigs from Southern Brazil were analyzed, with 131 non-NANI pigs and 110 NANI pigs. Infrared orbital temperature, rectal temperature, hematological parameters, and meat quality measurements were collected. Statistical analysis included ANOVA tests and principal component analysis (PCA). NANI pigs exhibited significantly higher infrared orbital temperatures and rectal temperature (p < 0.01). Hematological analysis revealed higher levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells in NANI pigs (p < 0.05). White blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly elevated in NANI pigs (p < 0.01), indicating potential infections or inflammatory responses. Meat quality parameters showed that NANI pigs had lower pH values, higher luminosity, and increased drip loss (p < 0.01), reflecting poorer water retention and potential muscle glycogen depletion. The study highlights the physiological and meat quality differences between NANI and non-NANI pigs, emphasizing the impact of stress, health conditions, and handling procedures on the animals. Blood biomarkers proved valuable in assessing physiological stress, immune response, and potential health issues in pigs, correlating with meat quality abnormalities. Utilizing these biomarkers as predictive tools can enhance animal welfare practices and contribute to improving meat quality in the swine industry.

AB  - The visual perception of birds is an incredibly exciting subject of research. Birds have significantly higher visual acuity than most other animals, which helps them stay safe in flight and detect their prey. Understanding how the eyes send information to the brain for additional processing is crucial. The brain has sections (nuclei) that accept input from the retina. The key areas where information is processed are the hyperpallium apicale (HA), hippocampus (HP), optic tectum (TeO), nucleus rotundus (RoT), and the geniculatus lateralis ventralis (Glv); among these, the RoT is one of the most investigated nuclei for vision. This study looked at how the visual centers of non-photoperiodic songbirds (Spotted Munia) adapt in different life history stages by looking at NPY expression. We immunohistochemically quantified NPY expression in four different seasons, including pre-breeding (June), breeding (September), post-breeding (December), and regressed (March) in the brain of Spotted Munia. We evaluated changes in the expression levels of the peptide throughout the year, by determining the expression at four different periods throughout the year. Peptide expression levels were projected to fluctuate within photoperiod-induced seasons. It was discovered that the parts of the brain related to vision (RoT, HA, and HP) have a higher number of immunoreactive cells during their mating season, i.e., during the summer. The appearance of NPY, a non-photic marker, in brain areas linked with light perception, was fascinating. Indirectly, NPY aids avian reproduction in a variety of ways. These findings demonstrate the importance of these nuclei in the process of reproduction, as well as the involvement of NPY in the visual brain areas of Spotted Munia.

AB  - Ethanol can directly or indirectly lead to cognitive and mental disorders. The long-term intake of alcohol can directly affect the distribution of gut microbiota. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is a natural bacterium isolated from healthy human intestines that has the function of preventing cytokine-induced cell apoptosis and protecting cell barriers. However, the regulatory effect of LGG on cognitive and mental disorders caused by chronic ethanol exposure (CEE) is still unclear. In this study, we established a CEE mouse model through free alcohol consumption and added LGG or antibiotics in the later stages of the model. Sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that CEE resulted in a decrease in the abundance and diversity of mouse gut microbial communities accompanied by alterations in the relative abundance of multiple enterobacterial genera. The use of LGG and antibiotics alleviated the depression-like behaviour and cognitive impairment of CEE-induced mice, reduced expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the ileum, serum and brain and increased the expression of synaptophysin (SYN), postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Together, LGG can alleviate depression-like behaviour caused by CEE in mice while also improving cognitive and memory functions through reducing peripheral and nervous system inflammation factors and balancing gut microbiota.

AB  - Glandular trichomes are epidermal structures that produce, store and release a variety of chemical compounds. Their high morphological diversity allows their taxonomic use at various levels. Therefore, their description and standardization of terminology become challenging. Cannabaceae is a well known family of Urticalean Rosids because of the presence of cannabinoid-secreting trichomes in Cannabis sativa. Other Urticalean Rosid families (Moraceae, Ulmaceae and Urticaceae) are neglected in this regard. Thus, the morphology and distribution of glandular trichomes were studied in Cannabaceae and Ulmaceae species and compared with published data for Moraceae and Urticaceae. Surface and anatomical analyses were performed on vegetative and floral organs. Urticalean Rosids show at least 15 types of glandular trichomes, 12 of them capitate and three filiform. In particular, Trema micrantha, a Cannabaceae species, has six different types. A trichome with biseriate stalk and pluricellular head, found in Trema micrantha and Pteroceltis tatarinowii, was not previously reported. Glandular trichomes are widely distributed in the plant body, which may be related to protection against herbivory. The greatest difficulty was the large quantity of terms and the lack of morphological details of the glandular trichomes in previous studies. A standardization of the terminology of glandular trichomes was therefore proposed.

AB  - According to the two-hit hypothesis of psychoneuropathology formation, infectious diseases and other pathological conditions occurring during the critical periods of early ontogenesis disrupt normal brain development and increase its susceptibility to stress experienced in adolescence and adulthood. It is believed that these disorders are associated with changes in the functional activity of the glutamatergic system in the hippocampus. Here, we studied expression of NMDA (GluN1, GluN2a, GluN2b) and AMPA (GluA1, GluA2) glutamate receptor subunits, as well as glutamate transporter EAAT2, in the ventral and dorsal regions of the hippocampus of rats injected with LPS during the third postnatal week and then subjected to predator stress (contact with a python) in adulthood. The tests were performed 25 days after the stress. It was found that stress altered protein expression in the ventral, but not in the dorsal hippocampus. Non-stressed LPS-treated rats displayed lower levels of the GluN2b protein in the ventral hippocampus vs. control animals. Stress significantly increased the content of GluN2b in the LPS-treated rats, but not in the control animals. Stress also affected differently the exploratory behavior of LPS-injected and control rats. Compared to the non-stressed animals, stressed control rats demonstrated a higher locomotor activity during the 1st min of the open field test, while the stressed LPS-injected rats displayed lower locomotor activity than the non-stressed rats. In addition, LPS-treated stressed and non-stressed rats spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and demonstrated reduced blood levels of corticosterone. To summarize the results of our study, exposure to bacterial LPS in the early postnatal ontogenesis affects the pattern of stress-induced changes in the behavior and hippocampal expression of genes coding for ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits after psychogenic trauma suffered in adulthood.

AB  - Consistent behavioural patterns defined as personality, are exhibited within individuals over time and across situations. Personality has been associated with the health, welfare and robustness of farm animals. This study aimed to identify the personality profiles of ewes reared under intensive farming and explore links with specific productive and physiological characteristics. To achieve this, 40 adult female sheep (Ovis aries) were studied. The experiment lasted for six months divided into three equal periods (A, B, and C). During period A, the animals were reared in two groups based on their breed. In period B the animals were equally mixed in two groups while in period C the animals returned to their initial state, as in period A. Ewes' behaviour was recorded during the total experimental period. Based on the social behaviours that remained stable during the examined periods, three personality profiles were recognized (Dynamic, Receptive and Social). Ewes with high scores on the Dynamic profile received affiliative behaviours by more members of the group (p = 0.044) and ewes with low scores spent more time foraging (p = 0.021) and had lower body weight (p = 0.014). In addition, within the receptive profile, ewes with medium scores had the lowest blood cortisol as a response to handling (p = 0.020). Ewes with high scores in the Social profile exchanged affiliative behaviours with more individuals (p <0.001) and performed less frequent vocalizations (p = 0.047). Finally, ewes with low scores in the social profile produced more milk (p = 0.046). Farm animal personality could be very useful in animal husbandry. Personality dimensions could be directly linked to productive and physiological characteristics as well as social dynamics and thus they can form useful indices for welfare status in animal husbandry. Therefore, understanding personality traits, can assist in improving farming practices or focusing on animals with lower welfare status for better management.

AB  - Breeding of agricultural crops adapted to climate change and resistant to diseases and pests is hindered by a limited gene pool because of domestication and thousands of years of human selection. One way to increase genetic variation is chromosome-mediated gene transfer from wild relatives by cross hybridization. In the case of wheat (Triticum aestivum), the species of genus Aegilops are a particularly attractive source of new genes and alleles. However, during the evolution of the Aegilops and Triticum genera, diversification of the D-genome lineage resulted in the formation of diploid C, M, and U genomes of Aegilops. The extent of structural genome alterations, which accompanied their evolution and speciation, and the shortage of molecular tools to detect Aegilops chromatin hamper gene transfer into wheat. To investigate the chromosome structure and help develop molecular markers with a known physical position that could improve the efficiency of the selection of desired introgressions, we developed single-gene fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) maps for M- and U-genome progenitors, Aegilops comosa and Aegilops umbellulata, respectively. Forty-three ortholog genes were located on 47 loci in Ae. comosa and on 52 loci in Ae. umbellulata using wheat cDNA probes. The results obtained showed that M-genome chromosomes preserved collinearity with those of wheat, excluding 2 and 6M containing an intrachromosomal rearrangement and paracentric inversion of 6ML, respectively. While Ae. umbellulata chromosomes 1, 3, and 5U maintained collinearity with wheat, structural reorganizations in 2, 4, 6, and 7U suggested a similarity with the C genome of Aegilops markgrafii. To develop molecular markers with exact physical positions on chromosomes of Aegilops, the single-gene FISH data were validated in silico using DNA sequence assemblies from flow-sorted M- and U-genome chromosomes. The sequence similarity search of cDNA sequences confirmed 44 out of the 47 single-gene loci in Ae. comosa and 40 of the 52 map positions in Ae. umbellulata. Polymorphic regions, thus, identified enabled the development of molecular markers, which were PCR validated using wheat-Aegilops disomic chromosome addition lines. The single-gene FISH-based approach allowed the development of PCR markers specific for cytogenetically mapped positions on Aegilops chromosomes, substituting as yet unavailable segregating map. The new knowledge and resources will support the efforts for the introgression of Aegilops genes into wheat and their cloning.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) is an estrogen-like mycotoxin and is considered a secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium fungi, which are widely found in the surrounding environment. ZEA has been found to cause reproductive dysfunction in female and male animals, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, this study examined cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, autophagy protein expression, and some inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1(3 and IL-8 of goat endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) induced by different concentrations (0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 mu M) of ZEA. The apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry. Western Blot and ELISA assay were used to identify the ER stress signaling pathway and some inflammatory cytokines. Our results revealed that ZEA induced cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis at low and middle concentrations, while at high concentrations of ZEA, cell apoptosis was induced in ESCs. Additionally, ZEA induced the ER stress protein markers such as ATF6, IRE1 alpha, EIF2 alpha, and ATF4. LC3 as a marker of autophagy was up-regulated at all concentrations of ZEA. Moreover, IL-1(3 and IL-8 showed down-regulation at a low concentration of ZEA, but middle and high concentrations showed up-regulation. In the present study, Knockdown ERN1 can inhibit autophagy and the main markers of ER stress. These results suggest that the IRE1 pathway can reduce apoptosis protein markers, down activate IRE1, and unfolded protein response branches such as ATF6 and LC3 in ESCs. Additionally, IL-1(3 and IL-8 achieve up-regulation under knockdown IRE1, which can block ER stress markers.

AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to validate the involvement of the PAR2-PKC-TRPA1 pathway in cough hypersensitivity (CHS) development. Methods: Guinea pigs were divided into a blank control, a citric acid-induced enhanced cough model, and drug intervention groups. The effects of the drugs on capsaicin-induced cough responsiveness in a cough model were observed. The effects of individual and combined treatments (including PAR2 agonists, TRPA1 agonists, PAR2 antagonists, TRPA1 antagonists, PKC agonists, and PKC antagonists) on PAR2, phospho-PKC (pPKC), and TRPA1 expression in bronchial tissues and the vagus ganglion (jugular and nodose) in the cough model and control groups were assessed. Additionally, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted to evaluate the effects of the drugs on vagus ganglion neuron electrophysiological activity. Results: (1) Both PAR2 antagonists and TRPA1 antagonists significantly reduced cough frequency in guinea pigs with a cough, and the PAR2 antagonist inhibited coughing induced by the TRPA1 agonist. (2) Western blotting and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) indicated that PAR2, pPKC alpha, PKC alpha, and TRPA1 expression in bronchial and vagus ganglion tissues was elevated in the cough model compared with the control, with TRPA1 expression being regulated by PAR2 and PKC being involved in this regulatory process. (3) Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that TRPA1 agonists induced an inward current in nodose ganglion neurons, which was further amplified by PAR2 agonists; this amplification effect was blocked by PKC antagonist. Additionally, PAR2 antagonists inhibited the inward current induced by TRPA1 agonists. (4) At various concentrations, including the optimal antitussive concentration, PAR2 antagonists did not significantly affect pulse amplitude, arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, body temperature, or respiratory rate in guinea pigs. Conclusion: PAR2 regulates TRPA1 through PKC in cough syndrome (CHS) pathogenesis, making targeting PAR2 a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for CHS.

AB  - Evolution of insect resistance is the primary threat to the long-term efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgene technologies. Plants have a deeply conserved defence response to pests: Jasmonic acid (JA) hormone signalling mediated by transcriptional repressors called JASMONATE-ZIM-DOMAIN/JAZ. JAZs normally limit expression of plant defence pathways, promoting assimilate partitioning towards growth and reproduction, by their carboxyl terminal Jas motif that antagonises MYeloCytomatosis (MYC) master transcription factor activities. Deletion, alternative splicing/intron retention, or disruption of the Jas motif results in JA insensitivity and increased resistance to pathogens including arthropod herbivores, for example by production of secondary metabolites and new leaves with higher trichome density. JA -mediated trichome initiation and elongation also impact cotton fibre production. Since its release in 2017, the third -generation stacked commercial Bt insecticidal Vip3A protein traits are increasingly under severe pressure for evolution of Helicoverpa zea (bollworm) resistance. Regional differences in efficacy of Bollgard (R) 3 and WideStrike (R) 3 against lepidopteran pests and increasing pesticide use are emerging issues. Future transgenic field control failures from bollworm infestations and incursions of Helicoverpa armigera from Central America are likely in the U.S. Cotton Belt. In this systematic primer on the problem, we take a conceptual approach to consider JAZ genes as means to leverage 'internal' host-derived herbivore resistance in cotton. We consider the genetic redundancy and pleiotropic nature of JAZ master regulators on tissue-specific growth, development, crosstalk with hormonal and small RNA pathways as nodes in networks, and limitations of JAZ efficacy due to fitness costs/growth trade-offs versus prospects for enhancing resistance networks to orchestrate transgressive segregation (generation of extreme phenotypes in breeding progeny not seen in parental lines).

AB  - The Colombian agroindustry has high diversity and availability of residual biomass year after year. These wastes are susceptible to being recovered through biological processes to reducing production costs of some raw materials and the pollutant load to the environment. This study identified the value-added by-products during the use of pig manure (PM), coffee mucilage (CM), and cocoa (CoM) through a dark fermentation process in a battery of batch reactors (200 ml bottles). The organic load (2, 5, and 8 gCOD/l), the C/N ratio (25, 35, and 45), and the ratio of the CM: CoM (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3) were evaluated. The highest hydrogen production yield of 271.3 ml H-2/gCOD was associated with the experimental conditions of mixture 2 (2 gCOD/l, 35 C/N ratio, and CM: CoM 1: 3). Acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate fermentations were associated with the metabolic pathways of the process and participated in the soluble COD with 29, 12, 46, and 13%, respectively. It was identified that the acetate-butyrate pathway was the main metabolic pathway, and the acetate/butyrate ratio was in the range of 1:1-5.9:1. The microbial population found in the co-digestion processes worked on was dominated by the genera Clostridium, Bacillus, and Tisierella. The complex substrates used in this co-digestion process can produce value-added by-products and energy in a range of theoretical stoichiometry. Graphic

AB  - The paper used technical parameters to investigate optimized solutions to protect the ecological environment and improve the microclimate adaptability among the traditional villages in Beijing. Shuiyu Village was used as a case study to analyze the coupling relationship between landscape patterns and the microclimate of traditional villages, with a focus on the ecological relationship between residents and the microclimate. This study also developed a climate index system, which includes computer numerical simulation and microclimate comprehensive analysis methods. The distinct types of landscape patterns were studied using the system. In addition, this paper studied the adaptive design mechanism in-depth, the form parameters of comfort evaluation controllability, and map expression technology of morphological parameters. The findings of this study include the optimized value of the environment based on landscape pattern and the map through the Rhino modeling platform. An interactive platform was developed, and a parametric-assisted optimization design process for traditional villages in the northern part of China was proposed. Moreover, this study concluded optimized strategies and technical guidelines for future planning of the rural areas in northern China with a goal to protect traditional villages and transform them into smart villages with microclimate adaptability.

AB  - To cope with an increased external osmolarity, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) through the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which governs adaptive responses to osmostress. In the HOG pathway, two apparently redundant upstream branches, termed SLN1 and SHO1, activate cognate MAP3Ks (MAPKK kinase) Ssk2/22 and Ste11, respectively. These MAP3Ks, when activated, phosphorylate and thus activate the Pbs2 MAP2K (MAPK kinase), which in turn phosphorylates and activates Hog1. Previous studies have shown that protein tyrosine phospha-tases and the serine/threonine protein phosphatases type 2C negatively regulate the HOG pathway to prevent its excessive and inappropriate activation, which is detrimental to cell growth. The tyrosine phosphatases Ptp2 and Ptp3 dephos-phorylate Hog1 at Tyr-176, whereas the protein phosphatase type 2Cs Ptc1 and Ptc2 dephosphorylate Hog1 at Thr-174. In contrast, the identities of phosphatases that dephosphorylate Pbs2 remained less clear. Here, we examined the phosphor-ylation status of Pbs2 at the activating phosphorylation sites Ser-514 and Thr-518 (S514 and T518) in various mutants, both in the unstimulated and osmostressed conditions. Thus, we found that Ptc1-Ptc4 collectively regulate Pbs2 nega-tively, but each Ptc acts differently to the two phosphoryla-tion sites in Pbs2. T518 is predominantly dephosphorylated by Ptc1, while S514 can be dephosphorylated by any of Ptc1-4 to an appreciable extent. We also show that Pbs2 dephosphorylation by Ptc1 requires the adaptor protein Nbp2 that recruits Ptc1 to Pbs2, thus highlighting the complex processes involved in regulating adaptive responses to osmostress.

AB  - Substituting mineral fertilizer with manure or a combination of organic amendments plus beneficial soil microorganisms (bio-manure) in agriculture is a standard practice to mitigate N2O and NO emissions while enhancing crop performance and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Here, we conducted a greenhouse trial for three consecutive vegetable growth seasons for Spinach, Coriander herb, and Baby bok choy to reveal the response of N2O and NO emissions, NUE, and vegetable quality index (VQI) to fertilization strategies. Strategies included solely chemical nitrogen fertilizer (CN), 20 (M1N4) and 50% (M1N1) substitution with manure, 20 (BM1N4) and 50% (BM1N1) substitution with bio-manure, and no fertilization as a control and were organized in a completely randomized design (n = 3). Manure decreased N2O emissions by 24-45% and bio-manure by 44-53% compared to CN. Manure reduced NO emissions by 28-41% and bio-manure by 55-63%. Bio-manure increased NUE by 0.04-31% and yields by 0.05-61% while improving VQI, attributed to yield growth and reduced vegetable NO3 contents. Improvement of root growth was the main factor that explained the rise of NUE; NUE declined with the increase of N2O emissions, showing the loss of vegetable performance under conditions when denitrification processes prevailed. Under the BM1N1, the highest VQI and the lowest yield-scaled N-oxide emissions were observed, suggesting that substitution with bio-manure can improve vegetable quality and mitigate N-oxide emissions. These findings indicate that substituting 50% of mineral fertilizer with bio-manure can effectively improve NUE and VQI and mitigate N-oxides in intensive vegetable production.

AB  - Infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) leads to chronic infectious pneumonia in pigs, resulting in significant distress and economic losses in the global pig industry. The pathogen secretes various proteins, including toxins, adhesins, and virulence-related enzymes, which facilitate adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion processes between bacteria and the host. However, the effector proteins of M. hyopneumoniae are predominantly uncharacterized. In this study, we demonstrate that the nuclease Mhp597 functions as a potential effector protein of M. hyopneumoniae, and we elucidate its mechanism of action in facilitating immune evasion. Our findings indicate that Mhp597 exhibits high expression efficiency in host cells and significantly inhibits IFN-alpha and IFN-beta protein expression. Using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we established that Mhp597 interacts with porcine alveolar macrophage vimentin (Vim) via specific amino acid residues (Arg 232, Lys 256, Phe 263, and Lys 317). Further analysis revealed that Mhp597 inhibited the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3 via Vim, thereby suppressing type I interferon (IFN-I) production and promoting the proliferation of M. hyopneumoniae within host cells. In conclusion, this study provides the first detailed account of the molecular mechanism by which Mhp597 negatively regulates the TBK1-IRF3-IFN-I signaling pathway through Vim, thus facilitating immune evasion and proliferation of M. hyopneumoniae within host cells. These findings enhance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of M. hyopneumoniae and suggest potential molecular targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Herbivorous arthropods, such as mites and insects, host a variety of microorganisms that significantly influence their ecology and evolution. While insect viruses have been extensively studied, our understanding of the diversity and composition of mite viromes and the interactions with mite hosts remains limited. The Asian spider mite, Tetranychus truncatus Ehara (Acari: Tetranychidae), a major agricultural pest, has not yet been reported to harbor any viruses. Here, using publicly available RNA-Seq data, we identified and characterized three picornalike viruses associated with T. truncatus : Tetranychus truncatus-associated iflavirus 1 (TtAIV-1), Tetranychus truncatus-associated picorna-like virus 1 (TtAV-1), and Tetranychus truncatus-associated picorna-like virus 2 (TtAV-2). TtAIV-1 has a typical Iflaviridae genome structure with a single ORF, representing the first iflavirus associated with the Tetranychus genus. TtAV-1 and TtAV-2 exhibit bicistronic arrangements similar to dicistroviruses and other picorna-like viruses, with complex secondary structures in their non-coding regions. Phylogenetic analysis places TtAIV-1 within Iflaviridae , possibly as a new species, while TtAV-1 and TtAV-2 form distinct clades within unclassified picorna-like viruses, suggesting new families within Picornavirales . We analyzed in silico the presence and abundance of these viruses in T. truncatus across four bioproject SRAs, mostly finding them co-associated, with viral reads reaching up to 30% of total reads. Their presence and abundance varied by mite treatment and origin, with no significant impact from Wolbachia infection or abamectin exposure, although TtAV-2 was absent in abamectin-treated mites. Temperature influenced virus abundance, and variations were observed among Chinese mite populations based on geography and host plant association. Our findings offer insights into picorna-like virus diversity and dynamics in T. truncatus , revealing potential roles in mite biology and suggesting applications for mite population control, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity and food security.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) supplementation can rescue poor oocyte quality and overcome embryonic arrest. Here, we investigated a series of sexually mature pigs generated through autologous and heterologous mtDNA supplementation. Brain, liver and heart tissues underwent metabolite profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gene expression analysis through RNA-seq. They were then assessed for mRNA-metabolite interactions. The comparison between overall mtDNA supplemented and control pigs revealed that mtDNA supplementation reduced the lipids stearic acid and elaidic acid in heart tissue. However, heterologous mtDNA supplemented-derived pigs exhibited lower levels of abundance of metabolites when compared with autologous-derived pigs. In the brain, these included mannose, mannose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. In the liver, maltose and cellobiose, and in the heart, glycine and glutamate were affected. mRNA-metabolite pathway analysis revealed a correlation between malate and CS, ACLY, IDH2 and PKLR in the liver and glutamate and PSAT1, PHGDH, CDO1 and ANPEP in the heart. Our outcomes demonstrate that mtDNA supplementation, especially heterologous supplementation, alters the metabolite and transcriptome profiles of brain, liver, and heart tissues. This is likely due to the extensive resetting of the balance between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in the preimplantation embryo, which induces a series of downstream effects.

AB  - Background Early weaning and intensive farming practices predispose piglets to the development of infectious and often lethal diseases, against which antibiotics are used. Besides contributing to the build-up of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics are known to modulate the gut microbial composition. As an alternative to antibiotic treatment, studies have previously investigated the potential of probiotics for the prevention of postweaning diarrhea. In order to describe the post-weaning gut microbiota, and to study the effects of two probiotics formulations and of intramuscular antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiota, we sampled and processed over 800 faecal time-series samples from 126 piglets and 42 sows. Results Here we report on the largest shotgun metagenomic dataset of the pig gut lumen microbiome to date, consisting of >8 Tbp of shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. The animal trial, the workflow from sample collection to sample processing, and the preparation of libraries for sequencing, are described in detail. We provide a preliminary analysis of the dataset, centered on a taxonomic profiling of the samples, and a 16S-based beta diversity analysis of the mothers and the piglets in the first 5 weeks after weaning. Conclusions This study was conducted to generate a publicly available databank of the faecal metagenome of weaner piglets aged between 3 and 9 weeks old, treated with different probiotic formulations and intramuscular antibiotic treatment. Besides investigating the effects of the probiotic and intramuscular antibiotic treatment, the dataset can be explored to assess a wide range of ecological questions with regards to antimicrobial resistance, host-associated microbial and phage communities, and their dynamics during the aging of the host.

AB  - Commercially manufactured or generated through environmental degradation, microplastics (MPs) and nano plastics (NPs) considerably contribute to environmental pollution. There is a knowledge gap in how exposure to MPs/NPs changes cellular function and affects animal and human health. Here, we demonstrate that after oral uptake, fluorescent polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles pass through the mouse digestive system, accumulate and aggregate in different organs, and induce functional changes in cells and organs. Using cochlear explant as a novel in vitro system, we confirmed the consequences of PS-MP/NP interaction with inner ear cells by detecting aggregates and hetero-aggregates of PS particles in hair cells. The testes of treated males accumulated MPs/NPs in the interstitial compartment surrounding the seminiferous tubules, which was associated with a statistically significant decrease in testosterone levels. Male mice showed increased secretion of interleukins (IL-12p35 and IL-23) by splenocytes while cyto-and genotoxicity tests indicated impaired cell viability and increased DNA damage in spleen tissue. Males also showed a broad range of anxiogenic responses to PS nanoparticles while hippocampal samples from treated females showed an increased expression of Bax and Nlrp3 genes, indicating a pro-apoptotic/proinflammatory effect of PS treatment. Taken together, induced PS effects are also gender dependent, and therefore, strongly motivate future research to mitigate the deleterious effects of nanosized plastic particles.

AB  - Humic-like substances extracted from organic waste materials are widely used as plant biostimulants in sustainable agriculture. This study was aimed to extract two types of humic-like fractions from tea waste and study their chemical characteristics and investigate their biostimulant effects on the early growth of tea nursery plants under different application methods and fertilizer rates. Humic-like fractions were extracted from tea waste using alkaline hydrolysis. One fraction has purified humic acid named as humic-like acid (HLA) while the other has impurified humic and fulvic acids called as humic-like substances (HLS). Both fractions were applied as foliar and soil application along with full (100%) and half (50%) rates of fertilizer. The results revealed that HLA had higher total organic carbon and elemental composition, while HLS showed higher humic yield, C/N ratio, total acidity and E4/E6 ratio. The results of the plant study indicated that foliar application HLS with full rate of fertilizer significantly improved the dry weight of various plant parts (Leaf, stem and root), growth parameters, and nutrient uptake compared to untreated plants. Foliar application of HLS and HLA along with 100% fertilizer increased the total plant biomass by 36.9% and 22.6% respectively over control. Furthermore, both fractions increased the concentrations of leaf N and P and the uptake of N, P and K. Our findings revealed that foliar application of HLS along with 100% fertilizer could be used to produce vigorous tea nursery plants most suitable for successful transplanting in the field.

AB  - Activation of an immune response (IR) upon exposure to pathogens is crucial to ensure adequate organismal performance and is directly linked to survival. Fitness benefits of the response may be associated with costs in terms of increased energy expenditure and may compete for resources and compromise such fitness benefits. Trade-offs between immune function and other traits relevant for fitness are well documented, however, it remains unknown if such trade-offs are energetically mediated. We manipulated the flight activity of 70 zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata to investigate the energy reallocation to the immune system in rested and exercised birds. Four experimental groups exhibiting different flight intensity were used: trained, untrained and birds that either stopped or started flight training after the immune challenge. If costs associated with the IR and flight activity compete for energy, we predicted the extent of inhibition of IR would be dependent on energy allocated to physical activity. Daytime resting metabolic rate was measured before and after the immune challenge, induced using sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Strength of the response was measured as the concentration of anti-SRBC antibodies six days post-challenge. We found no evidence for the predicted inhibition of the immune function between trained and untrained birds, as there was no difference in resting metabolic rate between experimental groups. However, resting metabolic rate following the challenge was negatively correlated with the IR. Surprisingly, individuals with relatively low resting metabolic rates following immune challenge were able to up-regulate their IR, indicating a trade-off in the use of the energy resource independent of flight activity levels. Our results suggest that energy allocation to mount the IR may represent a constraint that is possibly linked to the circadian pattern of the energy budget but appears to be independent of energetic challenges brought on by different levels of flight activity.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) affects a substantial number of aged individuals. Although advanced age has been regarded as the only independent risk factor for cognitive decline following anesthesia and surgery, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), an epigenetic regulator of memory plays an important role in age-dependent disease. In this study, we investigated the role of HDAC3 in POCD using a laparotomy mouse model. The results showed that the level of HDAC3 in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) was elevated in aged mice compared with young mice. The surgery impaired the spatial-temporal memory in aged mice, as indicated in the object location memory (OLM) and temporal order memory (TOM) tests. Model mice also exhibited increased expression of HDAC3 protein and decreased levels of dendritic spine density and synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the DH. Selectively blocking HDAC3 in the DH of aged mice reversed spatial-temporal memory impairment induced by surgery and restored dendritic spine density and synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the DH. Overexpression of HDAC3 by adeno-associated virus in the DH of young mice mimicked the behavioral deficits induced by anesthesia and surgery. Our results indicated that HDAC3 negatively regulates spatial-temporal memory in aged mice after anesthesia and surgery. Targeting HDAC3 might represent a potential therapy to avoid POCD.

AB  - Yunong Black (YN) pigs and Yunong Black x Landrace (YL) hybrid pigs exhibit significant differences in meat quality characteristics. Studies have suggested that extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) may play a regulatory role in muscle development. In order to study the differences in eccDNA between two groups with different meat quality traits and their potential biological significance, this study used the Circle-seq method to detect eccDNA in the longest dorsal muscle (LDM) of Yunong Black pigs (YN) (n = 3) and Yunong Black x Landrace hybrid pigs (YL) (n = 3). EccDNA-related differentially expressed genes (eccDEGs) were then analyzed in combination with RNA-seq to explore the mechanisms by which eccDNA affects meat quality. The results showed that 1325 and 1304 differentially expressed eccDNAs were identified in the YN and YL groups, varying in size and distributed across multiple genomic functional regions. These eccDNAs were also annotated according to several protein-coding genes. Combined analysis with RNA-seq results revealed 19 and 27 eccDEGs in the YN and YL groups. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis enriched many lipid-related pathways, such as chemokine signals and ADP metabolic processes. By constructing a regulatory network, several potential regulatory networks that might be related to pork quality, for example, ecc_sus_8665/ssc-miR-212/ADAMTS16, were identified. In summary, we identified several potential eccDNAs that may regulate pig muscle, offering insights into the regulation of pig muscle traits for breeding.

AB  - High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has been shown to be effective for cognitive intervention. However, whether HF-rTMS with extremely low intensity could influence cognitive functions is still under investigation. The present study systematically investigated the effects of continuous 40 Hz and 10 Hz rTMS on cognition in young adult mice at extremely low intensity (10 mT and 1 mT) for 11 days (30 min/day). Cognitive functions were assessed using diverse behavioral tasks, including the open field, Y-maze, and Barnes maze paradigms. We found that 40 Hz rTMS significantly impaired exploratory behavior and spatial memory in both 10 mT and 1 mT conditions. In addition, 40 Hz rTMS induced remarkably different effects on exploratory behavior between 10 mT and 1mT, compared to 10 Hz stimulation. Our results indicate that extremely low intensity rTMS can significantly alter cognitive performance depending on intensity and fre-quency, shedding light on the understanding of the mechanism of rTMS effects.

AB  - Low temperature stress limits the geographical distribution of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) and the yield and quality of tea. CsICE1 is a crucial regulator of tea plant's cold signaling pathway; however, the regulatory mechanism of CsICE1 is still unclear. In this study, we found that the N-terminus of CsICE1 contains a transcriptional activation domain and a region of protein interaction. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments confirmed that CsWRKY4 and CsOCP3 interacted with CsICE1 in the nucleus. Like CsICE1, CsWRKY4 and CsOCP3 were localized in the nucleus, and CsOCP3 was also targeted to the chloroplast. The expression of CsWRKY4 and CsOCP3 was downregulated under cold stress, unlike that of CsICEL Under biotic stresses and salicylic acid treatment, the expression of all three genes was increased, whereas jasmonic acid treatment resulted in decreased expression of all three genes. Dual-luciferase transient assays revealed that CsICE1 promoted the expression of CsCBF1 and CsCBF3, whereas CsWRKY4 and CsOCP3 inhibited the expression of CsCBF1 and CsCBF3 and attenuated their induction by CsICE1. Taken together, these results suggest that CsWRKY4 and CsOCP3 interact with CsICE1 and regulate CsCBF1/3, thus mediating the stress response in tea plant. Furthermore, these results highlight that CsICE1 is not only a key component in the low temperature signal response pathway, but it may also serve as a point of confluence for cold and other signaling pathways.

AB  - Not all agricultural practices are sustainable; however, non-thermal plasma treatment of seeds may be an eco-friendly alternative to improve macroscopic plant growth parameters. Despite the numerous successful results of plasma-seed treatments reported in the literature, there is a large gap in our understanding of how non-thermal plasma treatments affect seeds, especially due to the plethora of physical, chemical, and biological variables. This study uses RNA sequencing to characterize the changes in gene transcription in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seeds 6 days after exposure to surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment. Here, we provide an overview of all pathways that are differentially expressed where few genes are upregulated and many genes are downregulated. Our results reveal that plasma treatment time is a parameter that can activate different pathways in plant defense. An 80 s treatment upregulates the glucosinolate pathway, a defense response to insects and herbivores to deter feeding, whereas a shorter treatment of 60 s upregulates the phenylpropanoid pathway, which reinforces the cell wall with lignin and produces antimicrobial compounds, a defense response to bacterial or fungal plant pathogens. It seems that plasma elicits a wounding response from the seed in addition to redox changes. This suggests that plasma treatment can be potentially applied in agriculture to protect plants against abiotic and biotic stresses without discharging residues into the environment.

AB  - The leaves of many trees emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that protect them from various threats, including herbivory, pathogens, and heat stress. In a previous study, we analyzed the optimal seasonal schedule for producing isoprene, a highly volatile BVOC, in leaves to mitigate heat damage and maximize net carbon gain. In this paper, we investigate the seasonal production schedule of BVOCs stored in leaves, such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which decay slowly. When the leaves are bitten, these chemicals are emitted and help to prevent further herbivory. The optimal seasonal schedule, analyzed using Pontryagin's maximum principle, includes a period of singular control. Producing BVOCs for defense is advantageous if their decay rate is slow and the photosynthetic rate is fast. The amount of BVOCs produced increases with slower decay rate and faster photosynthetic rate. But it does not increase monotonically with the magnitude of the threat. BVOCs are produced earlier than the peak period of the threat for which the chemicals are intended. Based on the results of the model, we discuss the reported variations in BVOC production among different chemical species and tree species, as well as the seasonal patterns of gene expression in different pathways for BVOC production.

AB  - Simple Summary The Australian alpaca industry is known for fibre production. Despite the growth of alpaca numbers since their introduction in the 1980s, little is known about their distribution or on-farm management practices in Australia. This study used an online survey to gain insight into the current demographics, animal management practices and key knowledge gaps. Of the 88 respondents, the majority were located in the high-rainfall areas of the east coast of Australia, which could be due to consistent year-round pasture availability and market access opportunities. Of the two alpaca breeds, the Huacaya accounted for 93% of the animal numbers reported in this survey. Twelve key pasture species were identified, with Kikuyu the most common, followed by Subterranean Clover and Phalaris, likely due to the high concentration of respondents in suitable high-rainfall environments. Pasture species were not identified by 25% of respondents. The off-label use of veterinary chemicals for disease and parasite control resulted in a variation in dosage rates and administration frequency, raising concerns for effective management. These results highlight important knowledge gaps in nutritional and health management practices that require further research and practical industry recommendations to improve alpaca health and productivity.Abstract The Australian alpaca industry has continued to grow since the introduction of alpacas in the 1980s. Little is known about the geographical distribution of alpacas or on-farm management practices. This study aimed to address this and identify key producer knowledge through an online survey. The survey consisted of 25 questions grouped into 3 areas: demographics, farm production and alpaca nutrition. The highest concentration of alpaca producers was along the east coast of Australia, primarily in high-rainfall zones, which could be attributed to more consistent year-round pasture availability and market access opportunities. The Huacaya breed accounted for 93% of the animal numbers reported in this survey. Respondents identified 12 key pasture species being grazed, with Kikuyu being the most common, followed by Subterranean Clover and Phalaris, likely due to the majority of respondents being located in suitable high-rainfall environments. Pasture species were not identified by 25% of respondents. There are no registered anthelmintics or vaccinations for alpacas, resulting in a variation in dosage rates and administration frequency, raising concerns for effective disease and parasite management. This survey has identified key knowledge gaps in alpaca management practices in Australia that will be further investigated to provide industry recommendations to improve alpaca production.

AB  - Polystyrene microplastics (MPs) are persistent environmental pollutants commonly encountered in daily human life. Numerous studies have demonstrated their ability to induce liver damage, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid accumulation. However, limited information exists regarding preventive measures against this issue. In our study, we investigated the potential preventive role of selenium nanoparticles (YC-3SeNPs) derived from Yak -derived Bacillus cereus, a novel nanobiomaterial known for its antioxidant properties and lipid metabolism regulation. Using transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified key genes and metabolites associated with oxidative stress and lipid metabolism imbalance induced by MPs. Upregulated genes (Scd1, Fasn, Irs2, and Lpin) and elevated levels of arachidonic and palmitic acid accumulation were observed in MP -exposed mice, but not in those exposed to SeNPs. Further experiments confirmed that SeNPs significantly attenuated liver lipid accumulation and degeneration caused by MPs. Histological results and pathway screening validated our findings, revealing that MPs suppressed the Ppar alpha pathway and Nrf2 pathway, whereas SeNPs activated both pathways. These findings suggest that MPs may contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), while SeNPs hold promise as a future nanobio-product for its prevention.

AB  - Background Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disorders (ID), are highly debilitating childhood psychiatric conditions. Genetic factors are recognized as playing a major role in NDD, with a multitude of genes and genomic regions implicated. While the functional validation of NDD-associated genes has predominantly been carried out using mouse models, the significant differences in brain structure and gene function between mice and humans have limited the effectiveness of mouse models in exploring the underlying mechanisms of NDD. Therefore, it is important to establish alternative animal models that are more evolutionarily aligned with humans. Results In this study, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transplantation technologies to successfully generate a knockout miniature pig model of the MIR137 gene, which encodes the neuropsychiatric disorder-associated microRNA miR-137. The homozygous knockout of MIR137 (MIR137(-/-)) effectively suppressed the expression of mature miR-137 and led to the birth of stillborn or short-lived piglets. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in genes associated with neurodevelopment and synaptic signaling in the brains of MIR137(-/-) miniature pig, mirroring findings from human ASD transcriptomic data. In comparison to miR-137-deficient mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuron models, the miniature pig model exhibited more consistent changes in critical neuronal genes relevant to humans following the loss of miR-137. Furthermore, a comparative analysis identified differentially expressed genes associated with ASD and ID risk genes in both miniature pig and hiPSC-derived neurons. Notably, human-specific miR-137 targets, such as CAMK2A, known to be linked to cognitive impairments and NDD, exhibited dysregulation in MIR137(-/-) miniature pigs. These findings suggest that the loss of miR-137 in miniature pigs affects genes crucial for neurodevelopment, potentially contributing to the development of NDD. Conclusions Our study highlights the impact of miR-137 loss on critical genes involved in neurodevelopment and related disorders in MIR137(-/-) miniature pigs. It establishes the miniature pig model as a valuable tool for investigating neurodevelopmental disorders, providing valuable insights for potential applications in human research.

AB  - Increasingly, geographic approaches to assessing the risk of tick-borne diseases are being used to inform public health decision-making and surveillance efforts. The distributions of key tick species of medical importance are often modeled as a function of environmental factors, using niche modeling approaches to capture habitat suitability. However, this is often disconnected from the potential distribution of key host species, which may play an important role in the actual transmission cycle and risk potential in expanding tick-borne disease risk. Using species distribution modeling, we explore the potential geographic range of Oryzomys palustris, the marsh rice rat, which has been implicated as a potential reservoir host of Rickettsia parkeri, a pathogen transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick (Amblyomma maculatum) in the southeastern United States. Due to recent taxonomic reclassification of O. palustris subspecies, we reclassified geolocated collections records into the newer clade definitions. We modeled the distribution of the two updated clades in the region, establishing for the first time, range maps and distributions of these two clades. The predicted distribution of both clades indicates a largely Gulf and southeastern coastal distribution. Estimated suitable habitat for O. palustris extends into the southern portion of the Mid-Atlantic region, with a discontinuous, limited area of suitability in coastal California. Broader distribution predictions suggest potential incursions along the Mississippi River. We found considerable overlap of predicted O. palustris ranges with the distribution of A. maculatum, indicating the potential need for extended surveillance efforts in those overlapping areas and attention to the role of hosts in transmission cycles.

AB  - Bisphenol AF (BPAF), a kind of the ideal substitutes of Bisphenol A (BPA), has frequently been detected in environmental media and biological samples. Numerous studies have focused on the reproductive toxicity, cardiotoxicity and endocrine disrupting toxicity of BPAF. However, little evidence is available on neurodevelopmental toxicity of BPAF. Here, our study is to evaluate the effect of perinatal BPAF exposure (0, 0.34, 3.4 and 34 mg/kg body weight/day, correspond to Ctrl, low-, medium- and high-dose groups) on the cognitive function of adult mouse offspring. This study firstly found that perinatal BPAF exposure caused cognitive impairments of mouse offspring, in which male offspring was more sensitive than female offspring in low- and medium-dose BPAF groups. Furthermore, the dendritic arborization and complexity of hippocampal CA1 and DG neurons in male offspring were impaired in all BPAF groups, and these effects were only found in highdose BPAF group for female offspring. The damage of BPAF to dendritic spines, and the structural basis of learning and memory, was found in male offspring but not in females. Correspondingly, perinatal BPAF exposure significantly downregulated the expressions of hippocampal PSD-95 and Synapsin-1 proteins, and male offspring was more vulnerable than female offspring. Meanwhile, we explored the alteration of hippocampal estrogen receptors (ERs) to explain the sex specific impairment of cognitive function in low- and medium-dose BPAF groups. The results showed that perinatal BPAF exposure significantly decreased the expression of ER alpha in male offspring in a dose-dependent manner, but not in female offspring. In addition, we found that perinatal BPAF exposure can disordered the balance of oxidation and antioxidation in hippocampus of male offspring. In summary, perinatal low-dose bisphenol AF exposure impairs synaptic plasticity and cognitive function of adult offspring in a sex -dependent manner. The present results provide a pierce of potential mechanism of BPAF-caused neurodevelopmental toxicity.

AB  - The Rhynie Chert (Lower Devonian, Scotland) hosts a remarkably well-preserved early terrestrial ecosystem. Organisms including plants, fungi, arthropods, and bacteria were rapidly silicified due to inundation by silica-rich hot spring fluids. Exceptional molecular preservation has been noted by many authors, including some of the oldest evidence of lignin in the fossil record. The evolution of lignin was a critical factor in the diversification of land plants, providing structural support and defense against herbivores and microbes. However, the timing of the evolution of lignin decay processes remains unclear. Studies placing this event near the end of the Carboniferous are contradicted by evidence for fungal pathogenesis in Devonian plant fossils, including from the Rhynie Chert. We conducted organic geochemical analyses on a Rhynie Chert sample, including hydropyrolysis (HyPy) of kerogen and high-resolution mass spectrometric mapping of a thin section, to elucidate the relationship between lignin and the potential fungal marker perylene. HyPy of kerogen showed an increase in relative abundance of perylene supporting its entrapment within the silicate matrix of the chert. Lignin monomers were isolated through an alkaline oxidation process, showing a distribution dominated by H-type monomers. G- and S-type monomers were also detected, preserved by rapid silicification. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including perylene, a known marker for lignin-degrading fungi, were also concentrated in the kerogen and found to be localized within silicified plant fragments. Our results strongly link perylene in the Rhynie Chert to the activity of phytopathogenic fungi, demonstrating the importance of fungal degradation processes as far back as the Early Devonian.

AB  - Hormonal contraceptives prevent ovulation with subsequent reduction in endogenous levels of estradiol, progesterone and its neuroactive metabolite allopregnanolone. These neurosteroids modulate several brain functions, including neuronal plasticity, cognition and memory. We hypothesized that hormonal contraceptives might affect synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, as a consequence of suppressed endogenous hormones levels. Female rats were orally treated with a combination of ethinyl estradiol (EE, 0.020 mg) and levonorgestrel (LNG, 0.060 mg) once daily for four weeks. Decreased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and altered histone H3 post-translational modifications (PTMs) were observed 14 days after discontinuation from chronic EE-LNG treatment. These effects were not accompanied by alterations in long-term plasticity at glutamatergic synapses, recognition memory in the novel object and novel place location tests, or spatial learning, memory, and behavioral flexibility in the Morris water maze test. Thus, decreased BDNF content does not affect synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance; rather it might be relevant for the occurrence of certain psychiatric symptoms, reported by some women using hormonal contraceptives. These results provide the first evidence of hippocampal epigenetic changes induced by hormonal contraceptives and complement previous studies on the neurobiological actions of hormonal contraceptives; the finding that effects of chronic EE-LNG treatment on BDNF content and histone PTMs are observed 14 days after drug discontinuation warrants further investigation to better understand the implications of such long-term consequences for women's health.

AB  - The study constructed and compared the broad-scale meiotic recombination maps using populations from four different breeds of Western and Chinese pigs to investigate similarities and differences. At the broad scale, we found that the recombination patterns among different pig breeds are similar, with variations in recombination intensity and locations. Particularly, the differences in recombination patterns between Western and Chinese pigs are more significant compared to within-group variations. Furthermore, this study utilized 16 million SNP variants from unrelated individuals for the first time to construct a fine-scale historical recombination map. At the fine scale, we identified potential recombination hotspots and coldspots and verified the known features of these recombination hotspots and coldspots. Subsequently, by analyzing the overlap between recombination hotspots and regions of TSSs and H3K4me3 peaks, we found that recombination hotspots in pigs are distanced from gene TSSs and potential active promoters. Therefore, we propose for the first time evidence suggesting that recombination hotspots in pigs are regulated by PRDM9, providing a meaningful contribution to enhancing the efficiency of genomic selection breeding and further understanding the molecular mechanism of recombination in pigs.
   Meiotic recombination is a prevalent process in eukaryotic sexual reproduction organisms that plays key roles in genetic diversity, breed selection, and species evolution. However, the recombination events differ across breeds and even within breeds. In this study, we initially computed large-scale population recombination rates of both sexes using approximately 52 K SNP genotypes in a total of 3279 pigs from four different Chinese and Western breeds. We then constructed a high-resolution historical recombination map using approximately 16 million SNPs from a sample of unrelated individuals. Comparative analysis of porcine recombination events from different breeds and at different resolutions revealed the following observations: Firstly, the 1Mb-scale pig recombination maps of the same sex are moderately conserved among different breeds, with the similarity of recombination events between Western pigs and Chinese indigenous pigs being lower than within their respective groups. Secondly, we identified 3861 recombination hotspots in the genome and observed medium- to high-level correlation between historical recombination rates (0.542 similar to 0.683) and estimates of meiotic recombination rates. Third, we observed that recombination hotspots are significantly far from the transcription start sites of pig genes, and the silico-predicted PRDM9 zinc finger domain DNA recognition motif is significantly enriched in the regions of recombination hotspots compared to recombination coldspots, highlighting the potential role of PRDM9 in regulating recombination hotspots in pigs. Our study analyzed the variation patterns of the pig recombination map at broad and fine scales, providing a valuable reference for genomic selection breeding and laying a crucial foundation for further understanding the molecular mechanisms of pig genome recombination.

AB  - The detection of kidding in production animals is of the utmost importance, given the frequency of problems associated with the process, and the fact that timely human help can be a safeguard for the well-being of the mother and kid. The continuous human monitoring of the process is expensive, given the uncertainty of when it will occur, so the establishment of an autonomous mechanism that does so would allow calling the human responsible who could intervene at the opportune moment. The present dataset consists of data from the sensorization of 16 pregnant and two non-pregnant Charnequeira goats, during a period of four weeks, the kidding period. The data include measurements from neck to floor height, measured by ultrasound and accelerometry data measured by an accelerometer existing at the monitoring collar. Data was continuously sampled throughout the experiment every 10 s. The goats were monitored both in the goat shelter (day and night) and during the grazing period in the pasture. The births of the animals were also registered, both in terms of the time at which they took place, but also with details regarding how they took place and the number of offspring, and notes were also added.

AB  - Cattleyak is a typically male sterile species. The meiosis process is blocked and the scarcity of spermatogenic stems cells are both contributing factors to the inability of male cattleyak to produce sperm. While Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is the first discovered growth factor known to promote the proliferation and self-renewal of spermatogenic stem cells, its relationship to the spermatogenesis arrest of cattleyak remains unclear. In this report, we studied the differential expression of GDNF in the testis of yak and cattleyak, and discussed the optimal concentration of GDNF in the culture medium of undifferentiated spermatogonia (UDSPG) of cattleyak in vitro and the effect of GDNF on the proliferation of cattleyak UDSPG. The results indicated that GDNF expression in the testicular tissue of cattleyak was inferior to that of yak. Moreover, the optimum value for the UDSPG in vitro culture was determined to be 20-30 ng/mL for cattleyak. In vitro, the proliferation activity of UDSPG was observed to increase with additional GDNF due to the up-regulation of proliferation-related genes and the down-regulation of differentiation-related genes. We hereby report that the scarcity of cattleyak UDSPG is due to insufficient expression of GDNF, and that the addition of GDNF in vitro can promote the proliferation of cattleyak UDSPG by regulating the expression of genes related to proliferation and differentiation. This work provides a new insight to solve the issue of spermatogenic arrest in cattleyak.

AB  - Simple Summary Abattoir lung lesion scoring is a common practice to assess the impact of respiratory diseases in pig production, but whether the information obtained could be used to optimize antimicrobial stewardship programs has rarely been investigated. In this study, lung and pleural scores collected at slaughter from Italian heavy pigs were compared with on-farm antimicrobial use during the six months prior to slaughtering. Lung scores were positively associated with the past use of antimicrobials considered critical for human medicine, suggesting that batches with worse scores may have been unsuccessfully treated with first-choice antimicrobials. This result emphasizes the role of abattoirs as strategic observatories for pig respiratory diseases, which may also be helpful for antimicrobial stewardship. The information obtained could provide useful feedback aiding the identification of gaps in biosecurity or inadequate vaccination plans, thus helping to reduce on-farm antimicrobial use.Abstract Respiratory diseases significantly affect intensive pig finishing farms, causing production losses and increased antimicrobial use (AMU). Lesion scoring at slaughter has been recognized as a beneficial practice to evaluate herd management. The integrated analysis of abattoir lesion scores and AMU data could improve decision-making by providing feedback to veterinarians and farmers on the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments, thus rationalizing their use. This study compared lung and pleural lesion scores collected at Italian pig slaughterhouses with on-farm AMU, estimated through a treatment index per 100 days (TI100). Overall, 24,752 pig carcasses, belonging to 236 batches from 113 finishing farms, were inspected. Bronchopneumonia and chronic pleuritis were detected in 55% and 48% of the examined pigs, respectively. Antimicrobials were administered in 97% of the farms during the six months prior to slaughter (median TI100 = 5.2), notwithstanding compliance with the mandatory withdrawal period. EMA category B (critical) antimicrobials were administered in 15.2% of cases (median TI100 = 0.06). The lung score was not associated with the total AMU, but significant, positive associations were found with the past use of critical antimicrobials (p = 0.041) and macrolides (p = 0.044). This result highlights the potential of abattoir lung lesion monitoring to rationalize antimicrobial stewardship efforts, contributing to AMU reduction.

AB  - Fusarium wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini, is a devastating disease in flax. Genetic resistance can counteract this disease and limit its spread. To map major genes for Fusarium wilt resistance, a recombinant inbred line population of more than 700 individuals derived from a cross between resistant cultivar 'Bison' and susceptible cultivar 'Novelty' was phenotyped in Fusarium wilt nurseries at two sites for two and three years, respectively. The population was genotyped with 4487 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Twenty-four QTLs were identified with IciMapping, 18 quantitative trait nucleotides with 3VmrMLM and 108 linkage disequilibrium blocks with RTM-GWAS. All models identified a major QTL on chromosome 1 that explained 20-48% of the genetic variance for Fusarium wilt resistance. The locus was estimated to span similar to 867 Kb but included a similar to 400 Kb unresolved region. Whole-genome sequencing of 'CDC Bethune', 'Bison' and 'Novelty' produced similar to 450 Kb continuous sequences of the locus. Annotation revealed 110 genes, of which six were considered candidate genes. Fine-mapping with 12 SNPs and 15 Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers narrowed down the interval to similar to 69 Kb, which comprised the candidate genes Lus10025882 and Lus10025891. The latter, a G-type S-lectin receptor-like kinase (SRLK) is the most likely resistance gene because it is the only polymorphic one. In addition, Fusarium wilt resistance genes previously isolated in tomato and Arabidopsis belonged to the SRLK class. The robust KASP markers can be used in marker-assisted breeding to select for this major Fusarium wilt resistance locus.

AB  - Nowadays, the adoption of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) techniques is undergoing an impressive increase. In light of this, one of the most promising strategies is the novel use of non-physiological materials and naturally derived compounds for advanced sperm preparation methods. Here, sperm cells were exposed during capacitation to MoS2/Catechin nanoflakes and catechin (CT), a flavonoid with antioxidant properties, at concentrations of 10, 1, 0.1 ppm. The results showed no significant differences in terms of sperm membrane modifications or biochemical pathways among the groups, allowing the hypothesis that MoS2/CT nanoflakes do not induce any negative effect on the parameters evaluated related to sperm capacitation. Moreover, the addition of CT alone at a specific concentration (0.1 ppm) increased the spermatozoa fertilizing ability in an IVF assay by increasing the number of fertilized oocytes with respect to the control group. Our findings open interesting new perspectives regarding the use of catechins and new materials obtained using natural or bio compounds, which could be used to implement the current strategies for sperm capacitation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of clinical and subclinical pregnancy toxemia (PT) forms on the dynamics of blood metabolites, composing the protein, enzymatic and mineral profiles of dairy goats during the transitional period. 111 multiparous dairy goats were used in this research. The animals were raised under an intensive system. Experimental groups (n=3) were created using the beta HB blood concentrations as a cut-off point. The G1 or control group (n = 40), G2 or subclinical PT group (n = 39) were established when least one of the experimental assessment times presented beta HB values between 0.8 mmol/L and 1.6 mmol/L; whereas G3 or clinical PT group (n = 32), which at any of the experimental assessment times of beta HB values were higher than 1.6 mmol / L when verified and also presented clinical signs of PT. The animals were evaluated on the 30th , 20th and 10th day ante-partum (dap), at parturition and on the 10th, 20th and 30th day postpartum (dpp). Total proteins (TP), albumin, globulin, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Gamma glutamiltransferase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK), amylase, phosphorus, chloride and calcium, sodium and potassium ions were measured. The analysis of variance (F Test) was performed in order to investigate the effects and interactions between group and assessment times. Clinical and/or subclinical disease during the transitional period resulted in an increase of phosphorus and potassium concentrations (P<0.05), while a decrease in total protein, albumin, globulin, and ionized calcium values was observed (P<0.05). No statistical effect of PT on urea, creatinine, AST, GGT, CK, amylase and sodium was observed (P>0.05). Except the ionized calcium and phosphorus, the levels of all the metabolites were influenced (P<0.05) by late pregnancy, parturition and lactation. The occurrence of the subclinical form was higher than the clinical form during the transitional period. Among the all variables studied, mineral profile were those that suffered alteration resulting from PT, highlighting the ionized calcium. Attention is drawn to the magnitude of the impact of disease on these components interfering in animal health.

AB  - In brief Although sheep have been widely used as a large animal model for human ovarian biology, unlike women, they display a marked seasonality of breeding activity, the underlying mechanisms and extent of ovarian changes of which remain largely undefined. This study reveals the active remodeling of the ovarian extracellular matrix across the reproductive season, which could be an additional driver responsible for the observed variations in ovarian morphometry and follicle dynamics. Ovarian function requires dynamic tissue remodeling provided by its extracellular matrix (ECM). In seasonal breeders, ovaries undergo an additional circannual cycle of recrudescence and regression. While increasing evidence suggests that the ECM impacts normal ovarian cyclicity and function, how its components are remodeled across reproductive seasonality has not been explored in large mammals. Using immunohistological and in vitro experiments, we investigated the influence of reproductive seasonality on ovarian morphometry, ECM properties and follicle developmental potential in vitro. Ovarian weight and volume were reduced during anestrus (P < 0.001). Neither follicular density nor the proportion of preantral follicles and earlier stages of development were impacted by the season, but the percentage of antral follicles increased during anestrus (P = 0.028), while corpora lutea were only present in ovaries collected during the breeding season. Concomitantly, ovarian ECM composition was significantly remodeled, with stromal collagen and fibronectin significantly increased (P < 0.01) and laminin decreased (P = 0.032) during anestrus compared to the breeding season. This correlated with thicker collagen fibers both in the stroma and in the tunica albuginea during anestrus. In vitro, preantral follicles isolated from their native environment exhibited a season-dependent pattern of follicular integrity, survival, antrum formation and growth. These results suggest the establishment of a stiffer ovarian microenvironment during anestrus, which, together with endocrine changes, regulates follicle growth, demise and the ovulatory response.

AB  - Interactions between belowground and aboveground heterotrophic communities with no direct physical contact can be connected by the plant as a mediator. Plants respond to the attack of herbivores by producing a suite of defensive compounds that can affect the choice and performance of other herbivores. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of one herbivore's activity on the acceptability of that plant to another species of herbivore. Two herbivores were tested; root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (RKN), a belowground plantparasitic nematode, and the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (TSSM), an aboveground folivore. We conducted herbivore preference and performance tests on Lima bean (LB) (Phaseolus lunatus cv. Henderson) as an optimal host for TSSM, and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Rutgers) which is a sub-optimal host for TSSM but optimal host for RKN. We used two-choice glass olfactometers to measure the response of RKN to plants that were exposed to TSSM versus a clean LB plant. RKN infected the clean plants at a significantly greater rate than the TSSM exposed plants. TSSM preference was measured, using leaf discs and two-choice olfactometers containing a RKN infected plant versus a clean plant at different days post-inoculation (DPI) of the RKN. TSSM preferred the clean plants to those with 25-day old RKN infections on LB, but preferred RKN infected tomato plants at 1 DPI. We also tested the effect of the inoculation (1 DPI) of the entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) Steinernema carpocapsae on tomato plants and TSSM preferred the EPN inoculated plants. We carried out a non-choice performance test for TSSM on both LB and tomato on plants inoculated with RKN versus clean plants and observed no effect of RKN exposure on TSSM performance. This research shows that plants can mediate interactions between below and aboveground herbivores that share the same plant.

AB  - Ractopamine (RAC) is a beta-adrenoceptor agonist that is used to promote lean and increased food conversion efficiency in livestock. This compound has been considered to be causing behavioral and physiological alterations in livestock like pig. Few studies have addressed the potential non-target effect of RAC in aquatic animals. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential physiological response after acute RAC exposure in zebrafish by evaluating multiple endpoints like locomotor activity, oxygen consumption, and cardiovascular performance. Zebrafish larvae were subjected to waterborne RAC exposure at 0.1, 1, 2, 4, or 8 ppm for 24 h, and the corresponding cardiovascular, respiratory, and locomotion activities were monitored and quantified. In addition, we also performed in silico molecular docking for RAC with 10 zebrafish endogenous beta-adrenergic receptors to elucidate the potential acting mechanism of RAC. Results show RAC administration can significantly boost locomotor activity, cardiac performance, oxygen consumption, and blood flow rate, but without affecting the cardiac rhythm regularity in zebrafish embryos. Based on structure-based flexible molecular docking, RAC display similar binding affinity to all ten subtypes of endogenous beta-adrenergic receptors, from adra1aa to adra2db, which are equivalent to the human one. This result suggests RAC might act as high potency and broad spectrum beta-adrenergic receptors agonist on boosting the locomotor activity, cardiac performance, and oxygen consumption in zebrafish. To validate our results, we co-incubated a well-known beta-blocker of propranolol (PROP) with RAC. PROP exposure tends to minimize the locomotor hyperactivity, high oxygen consumption, and cardiac rate in zebrafish larvae. In silico structure-based molecular simulation and binding affinity tests show PROP has an overall lower binding affinity than RAC. Taken together, our studies provide solid in vivo evidence to support that RAC plays crucial roles on modulating cardiovascular, respiratory, and locomotory physiology in zebrafish for the first time. In addition, the versatile functions of RAC as beta-agonist possibly mediated via receptor competition with PROP as beta-antagonist.

AB  - Plants respond to biotic and abiotic changes through their phenotypic plasticity. These variations can be expressed in traits related to leaf morphology, plant growth, and defoliation. We evaluated the influence of plant age and leaf age on leaf traits and its relation with defoliation in three forage plant species, Tithonia diversifolia, Morus alba, and Moringa oleifera. Interspecifically, M. oleifera showed thicker leaves, higher dry weight, leaf asymmetry, and leaf area; M. alba showed harder leaves and higher specific leaf area. Intraspecifically, in the M. oleifera leaf area, dry weight, thickness, and hardness of leaves increased only in 30 day-old-plant. While in M. alba intermediate leaves had higher leaf area; and, 90 day-old-plant had higher thickness and hardness. Leaf area and dry weight were higher in 60 and 30 day-old-plants, respectively. In T. diversifolia intermediate leaves showed higher dry weight and leaf thickness, 30 day-old-plant had higher leaf area and leaf dry weight; and, 90 day-old-plant had higher leaf thickness. In addition, we found negative relationships between young leaves with leaf thickness, leaf hardness, and leaf dry weight. Defoliation showed positive relationships with SLA and leaf hardness, and negative ones with leaf thickness, leaf dry weight, leaf asymmetry, and leaf area. We underline, the importance of carrying out research that contributes to the understanding of the interrelationships between leaf structure, its function, and its relationships of morphological traits of plant resistance and tolerance in tropical forage plant species of high economic and ecological importance.

AB  - Hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) derived from pig bone has been synthesized to meet the increasing demand of carbon-based anode electrode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Pig bone with unique structure and high content of inorganic minerals (Ca-3(PO4)(2), CaCO3) acting as self-template was selected as precursor for the preparation of porous carbon and no more additive agents were needed. When tested as anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the as-obtained porous carbon exhibited excellent initial reversible capacity (1308 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), superior cycling performance (640 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) after 500 cycles), and desired rate capability (304 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)). The outstanding electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the abundant existence of micropores, the specific microstructure, and doped with N and P elements.& nbsp;

AB  - Although the Pamir Plateau in southern Xinjiang was likely a key route in the extensive transcontinental network of cultural exchange across Eurasia, little isotopic research has been conducted in this region. Here we present isotopic results of bioapatite (delta C-13, delta O-18) from humans and animals (n = 38) from the Ji'erzankale site (c. 400-600 years cal BCE) located in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. These results are combined with previously published collagen isotopic data from the same individuals to explore the possibility and extent of millet consumption in this area. The delta C-13 values of the sheep (-10.8 +/- 0.7%o, n = 13) and humans (-13.7 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand , n = 24) were found to be higher than those of the wild hare (-14.9 parts per thousand , n = 1). The humans consumed a predominately C3 diet, but the bioapatite-collagen delta C-13 spacing indicates that there was a minor input of C4 plants in the diet, likely millet. The inhabitants of the Ji'erzankale site were semi-nomadic pastoralists that likely supplemented their diet with the small scale consumption of millet. It is likely that the Pamir Plateau was a key area in the spread of millet agriculture between the East and the West during the 1st millennium BCE.

AB  - Representatives of the genus Sarcocystis are unicellular parasites having a two-host life cycle and infecting mammals, birds, and reptiles. Until now, Sarcocystis spp. have been mainly investigated in definitive and intermediate hosts. Only a few studies have been conducted on the detection of Sarcocystis parasites in water samples. The aim of this research was to examine whether the prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. parasitizing farm animals varies in different types of water bodies. Water samples (n = 150) were collected from the entire territory of Lithuania, dividing water bodies into five groups (lakes, rivers, ponds/canals, swamps, and the inshore zone of the territorial Baltic Sea area). One-liter samples were filtered and subsequently analyzed using nested PCR. At least one of the analyzed Sarcocystis spp. (S. arieticanis, S. bertrami, S. bovifelis, S. capracanis, S. cruzi, S. hirsuta, S. miescheriana, and S. tenella) was determined in all examined samples from water bodies. No significant difference in Sarcocystis spp. prevalence between different types of water sources was detected. Our research proved that selecting appropriate primers is important for the accurate identification of parasites in samples collected from water bodies.

AB  - Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Previous studies have shown that myelin degradation during MS and EAE resulted in reduced expression of some of the proteins, e.g., the MBP (myelin basic protein), and increased expression of genes such as iNOS (Inducible nitric oxide synthase) and NOGO-A in the affected patients. In the present study, EAE was induced by immunizing Wistar rats (n=12) with homogenized spinal cord of guinea pig and Freund's complete adjuvant. Curcumin is an active ingredient in turmeric with anti-inflammatory properties, which has been studied in this article. In this study, the effect of curcumin administration on the change of the expression of MBP, NOGO-A, and iNOS genes was evaluated using the RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) technique. The obtained results indicated it could be concluded that curcumin was able to improve EAE by increasing the amount of MBP gene expression and reducing the intensity of NOGO-A expression.

AB  - Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) from human and animal fat have emerged as therapeutic alternatives for damaged tissues. Pre-conditioning of ASCs with hypoxia results in their functional enhancement, which might facilitate the process of healing. However, there is still a critical need for large-scale preclinical studies to reinforce the translation of these findings into clinical practice for humans and in veterinary medicine. Here, we adapted a full-thickness excisional skin wound mouse model to evaluate and compare the effect of pig adipose -derived stem cells (pASCs) cultured under normoxia (pASCs-Nor) or hypoxia (pASCs-Hyp) on the healing pro-cess. We show that pASCs-Hyp accelerated re-epithelialization, increased hyaluronic acid (HA) content, and decreased scar elevation index (SEI) during the late stage of healing (day 21). Transplantation of pASCs-Hyp also promoted expression of angiogenic marker VegfA and decreased levels of pro-scarring Tgf beta 1. Mice tolerated xenotransplantation of the pASCs with no impact on macrophage (CD68-positive cell) content. However, wounds treated with pASCs-Hyp exhibited decreased elasticity at the early stage of healing and increased expression of Wnt signaling members including Wnt10a, Wnt11, and beta-catenin, which are associated with scar -forming wound repair. In conclusion, pASCs treatment may provide a critical step toward the evaluation of pASCs as therapeutically relevant cells in the context of wound healing.

AB  - Buffalo spermatozoa are vulnerable to cryo-injuries due to inherent deficiency of endogenous antioxidants, high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content in plasma membrane and low cholesterol/ phospholipid (C/P) ratio. Humanin is a potent cytoprotective agent that protects the cells against oxidative stress and apoptosis. The present study was designed to establish the presence of Humanin in buffalo and effect of Humanin supplementation on freezability of buffalo spermatozoa. Indirect immunofluorescence test revealed presence of Humanin in ejaculated and epididymal spermatozoa, and, elongated spermatids and interstitial space in the testicular tissue section. Humanin levels in seminal plasma were significantly and positively correlated with sperm concentration and individual progressive motility (IPM) in good (n = 22; IPM >70%) and poor (n = 10; IPM <50%) quality ejaculates. For supplementation studies, a total of 24 ejaculates (IPM similar to 70%) were collected and each ejaculate was then divided into four aliquots. First aliquot was diluted with egg yolk-tris-glycerol (EYTG) extender without Humanin and served as control group (Group I). Rest three aliquots were diluted with extender containing 2 (Group II), 5 (Group III) and 10 mM Humanin (Group IV), respectively. Semen was cryopreserved using standard protocol and evaluated at pre-freeze for lipid peroxidation (LPO) and post-thaw stages for spermatozoa kinematics, LPO, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), capacitation, apoptotic status and DNA integrity. The treatment group that showed best results (5 mM) was compared with control group for in vitro fertility assessment by homologous zona binding assay. The LPO levels were lower (p < 0.05) in 5 and 10 mM Humanin supplemented group. The MMP and DNA integrity were higher (p < 0.05) in 5 mM group than other groups. F-pattern was higher (p < 0.05) and B-pattern was lower (p < 0.05) in 5 and 10 mM Humanin supplemented groups. Lower apoptotic and higher viable spermatozoa (p < 0.05) were observed in 5 mM Humanin group. The mean number of spermatozoa bound to zona pellucida was higher (p < 0.05) in 5 mM Humanin treated group than the control group. The study established the presence of Humanin in buffalo spermatozoa and seminal plasma for very first time and concluded that Humanin supplementation at 5 mM concentration improves the freezability and in vitro fertility of buffalo spermatozoa.

AB  - Simple Summary The perceptions and practices of sheep farmers with regards to their knowledge of sheep health management on their farms can have a significant impact on the overall health, welfare, and production of their animals and on the economics of their farming enterprise. District veterinary services play an important role in providing technical services and support to the farmers. Survey studies were conducted to understand and compare the practices and perceptions of sheep famers and district veterinarians (DVs) in NSW, Australia, to sheep health and its management. The findings illustrated differences between the farmer and DV perception of sheep health and diseases of greatest concern and provided valuable insights into their different observations and practices. For example, sheep producers were most concerned with parasites whereas for DVs sheep husbandry advice was most concerning. However, both groups ranked nutrition advice as the second most concerning area related to sheep health. Of particular interest were the differences in the communication methods that they prefer which, if more closely aligned, may enable more effective communication. The findings of these studies provide some guidance and recommendations for improving the management of the health, welfare, and overall economic value of sheep farming in NSW.Abstract The study objectives were to understand the practices and perceptions of sheep farmers and district veterinarians (DVs) towards sheep health management and, the impact of disease at the farm level in addition to the availability, accessibility, and use of veterinary services. Data were collected using question-based surveys, distributed online and in-person to sheep farmers (45 respondents) and DVs (25 respondents). Most farmers were male, >= 51 years old, who placed a high priority on the health and welfare of their sheep. For disease prevention most farmers vaccinated their sheep (91%) and 86.7% had a farm biosecurity plan, although its components and their application varied, e.g., the isolation of new or sick sheep. Fencing costs were most frequently identified (70.5% respondents) as a financial concern for sheep farmers. Their most common sources of information about disease control and prevention were DVs (66.7%), private veterinarians (60.0%), the internet (42.9%), rural suppliers (35.7%), and farmers/neighbours (28.6%). Fifty-eight percent of farmers reported a long distance from veterinarian services. Farmers preferred to receive information via email (77.8%), whereas 56% of DVs preferred to share information via phone call. This discrepancy presents an opportunity to align these mechanisms more closely for effective dissemination of information and increased producer engagement.

AB  - Ribosome biogenesis is an energy-intense multistep process where even minimal defects can cause severe phenotypes up to cell death. Ribosome assembly is facilitated by biogenesis factors such as ribosome assembly factors. These proteins facilitate the interaction of ribosomal proteins with rRNA and correct rRNA folding. One of these maturation factors is RimP which is required for efficient 16S rRNA processing and 30S ribosomal subunit assembly. Here, we describe the binding mode of Staphylococcus aureus RimP to the small ribosomal subunit and present a 4.2A degrees resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of the 30S-RimP complex. Together with the solution structure of RimP solved by NMR spectroscopy and RimP-uS12 complex analysis by EPR, DEER, and SAXS approaches, we show the specificity of RimP binding to the 30S subunit from S. aureus. We believe the results presented in this work will contribute to the understanding of the RimP role in the ribosome assembly mechanism

AB  - Main conclusion The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway provides cytosolic NADPH yet reduces carbon and energy use efficiency. Repressing this pathway and introducing cytosolic NADPH-dependent malate dehydrogenase may increase crop yields by approximate to 5%. Detailed knowledge about plant energy metabolism may aid crop improvements. Using published estimates of flux through central carbon metabolism, we phenotype energy metabolism in illuminated Camelina sativa leaves (grown at 22 degrees C, 500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and report several findings. First, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) transfers 3.3% of the NADPH consumed in the Calvin-Benson cycle to the cytosol. NADPH supply proceeds at about 10% of the rate of net carbon assimilation. However, concomitantly respired CO2 accounts for 4.8% of total rubisco activity. Hence, 4.8% of the flux through the Calvin-Benson cycle and photorespiration is spent on supplying cytosolic NADPH, a significant investment. Associated energy requirements exceed the energy output of the OPPP. Thus, autotrophic carbon metabolism is not simply optimised for flux into carbon sinks but sacrifices carbon and energy use efficiency to support cytosolic energy metabolism. To reduce these costs, we suggest bioengineering plants with a repressed cytosolic OPPP, and an inserted cytosolic NADPH-dependent malate dehydrogenase tuned to compensate for the loss in OPPP activity (if required). Second, sucrose cycling is a minor investment in overall leaf energy metabolism but a significant investment in cytosolic energy metabolism. Third, leaf energy balancing strictly requires oxidative phosphorylation, cofactor export from chloroplasts, and peroxisomal NADH import. Fourth, mitochondria are energetically self-sufficient. Fifth, carbon metabolism has an ATP/NADPH demand ratio of 1.52 which is met if <= 21.7% of whole electron flux is cyclic. Sixth, electron transport has a photon use efficiency of >= 62%. Last, we discuss interactions between the OPPP and the cytosolic oxidation-reduction cycle in supplying leaf cytosolic NADPH.

AB  - Weighing pigs with scales takes a lot of time and makes pigs stressful easily. It can be avoided by measuring weight based on the depth images. We design a series of preprocessing algorithms including instance segmentation, distance independence, noise reduction, rotation correction. These algorithms are used to eliminate the influence of the surrounding environment and other factors. In order to predict the weight precisely, we build a regression network based on BotNet. Dual branch of 3 x 3 convolution and MHSA replaces single 3 x 3 convolution of the fourth block in ResNet. At the end of the network, we use multiple fully connection layers in parallel, then concat them to predict weight. After training on 122736 images, MAE of our network is 6.366 on 5326 test images.

AB  - Eimeria christenseni is considered among the most pathogenic Eimeria species in goats. The aim of this study was to isolate an E. christenseni strain and to assess its infectivity, pathogenicity, and ability to develop a protective immune response. After previous collection of E. christenseni-positive faeces, purification of oocysts, and amplification in donor animals, an experimental infection was carried out. A total of 19 kids were divided into three groups: primary-infected and challenged, challenge control, and uninfected control. Infections were performed orally with 2 x 105 sporulated oocysts per animal. Oocyst shedding, clinical signs, and production parameters, in addition to haematological and histopathological features, were monitored. The results showed that the Gran Canaria (GC) E. christenseni strain had similar morphological and biological characteristics to those previously described, but no significant clinical signs were observed despite the high oocyst counts here recorded. The novel strain isolated would therefore be of low pathogenicity but still able to develop significant immunoprotective responses upon challenge infections. Its biological similarities to highly pathogenic species such as Eimeria ninakohlyakimovae and Eimeria arloingi might enable comparative studies aimed at developing alternative strategies for drug treatments, including Eimeria species (strain)-specific vaccination strategies for the efficient control of goat coccidiosis.

AB  - Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is one of the primary methods for production of genetically engineered sheep, which allows for gene editing or transgene introduction in somatic cells. The use of SCNT eliminates the risk of genetic mosaicism in embryos and animals that is commonly observed after zygote micromanipulations. This retrospective analysis of SCNT in sheep performed at Utah State University, spanning from 2016 to 2021, examined parameters that may impact pregnancy and full-term development, including donor oocytes (donor age), donor cell lines, SCNT parameters (time of oocyte activation following SCNT, number of transferred embryos, in vitro maturation and culture conditions), and recipients (surgical number and ovulatory status), as well as factors that may correlate with large offspring syndrome or abnormal offspring syndrome (LOS/AOS) in the fetuses and lambs. Our findings indicated that compared to prepubertal oocytes, the SCNT embryos produced from adult sheep oocytes had comparable in vitro maturation rates, pregnancy and full-term development rates, as well as SCNT efficiency. In addition, earlier activation time of SCNT embryos (e.g. 24-26 h post maturation) was correlated to the early pregnancy loss rate, full-term rate, and SCNT efficiency. Compared to our standard serum-containing medium, commercial serum-free culture medium showed a positive correlation with the full- term development of sheep SCNT embryos. Transferring 15-30 embryos per recipient resulted in consistently good pregnancy rates. Surgical numbers and ovulatory status (having at least one follicle between 6 and 12 mm in size or a corpus hemorrhagicum (CH)) of recipients did not affect pregnancy and full-term development rates. In summary, this retrospective analysis identified parameters for improving pregnancy and full-term development of SCNT embryos in sheep.

AB  - Context. Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a major threat to Asian elephants as humans and elephants are forced to share common resources. In Sri Lanka, human-dominated landscapes adjacent to protected areas promote high rates of HEC, especially in the form of crop-foraging by elephants. Crop-foraging can be dangerous to both elephants and humans involved in the conflict. Gunfire is a common way for human communities to deter crop-foraging elephants, and gunshot wounds are commonly described in this elephant population on necropsy.
   Aims. Wesought to quantify and describe unique scar patterns among Asian elephants in a protected area, Wasgamuwa National Park, attributed to HEC.
   Methods. We identified 38 adult female and 64 adult male elephants and recorded the age class and body condition of each with established standards. Using photographs, we counted the number, position, and relative size of all scars on each animal.
   Key results. Male elephants had significantly more scars than did females, and for males, the number of scars increased progressively with age. Additionally, male elephants with higher body conditions had more scars. Finally, males tended to have more scars towards the head, especially at older ages.
   Conclusions. Differences in total scar counts between the sexes in this population imply that male elephants in this area more frequently engage in HEC than do females, following observations previously described in the literature. Furthermore, the fact that male elephants acquired progressively more scars as they aged, and that fatter elephants had more scars, indicates that previous exposure to HEC may not have been a deterrent for future events among these males, and potentially, crops served as valuable food sources for these animals. Finally, the changing body locations of these scars with age in males possibly shows plastic behavioural responses during crop-foraging or lower tolerance by farmers towards habitual crop foragers.

AB  - Outside of the laboratory, animals behave in spaces where they can transition between open areas and coverage as they interact with others. Replicating these conditions in the laboratory can be difficult to control and record. This has led to a dominance of relatively simple, static behavioral paradigms that reduce the ethological relevance of behaviors and may alter the engagement of cognitive processes such as planning and decision -making. Therefore, we developed a method for controllable, repeatable interactions with others in a reconfigurable space. Mice navigate a large honeycomb lattice of adjustable obstacles as they interact with an autonomous robot coupled to their actions. We illustrate the system using the robot as a pseudopredator, delivering airpuffs to the mice. The combination of obstacles and a mobile threat elicits a diverse set of behaviors, such as increased path diversity, peeking, and baiting, providing a method to explore ethologically relevant behaviors in the laboratory.

AB  - The yellow seahorse, Hippocampus kuda Bleeker, an ornamental and pharmaceutical fish, is being artificially cultivated due to the insufficient commercial supply of wild resources. However, the artificial breeding is difficult due to the limited biological knowledge. To improve the breeding technology of H. kuda, we compared the feeding behaviour of wild-caught group (GW) and captive-reared group (GC). The feeding behaviour of the wild and cultured H. kuda included six steps: searching, locking, alerting, catching, swallowing, and withdrawing. However, differences existed in their behavioural parameters. The GC of H. kuda had a longer reaction time, lower feeding rate, smaller food intake of live food and a shorter feeding distance than the GW. Furthermore, compared with those single state, H. kuda in groups have a shorter reaction time and higher feeding rate of single food, but a slower reaction to batch food. Most of the changes had no effect on the artificial breeding of seahorse. However, there are two points need to be adjusted in feeding management. Firstly, the seahorses will likely lack the behaviour of looking up for food, and only look down at the bottom. They may eat spoiled residual food and develop gastroenteritis diseases and death. Secondly, appropriate stocking density of seahorse and feeding fre-quency can maintain a feeding competition, which can reduce residual food and improve food utilisation.

AB  - A versatile use of a sulfur self-doped biochar derived from Camellia japonica (camellia) flowers is demonstrated as a multifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting and a supercapacitor. The native sulfur content in the camellia flower facilitates in situ self-doping of sulfur, which highly activates the camellia-driven biochar (SA-Came) as a multifunctional catalyst with the enhanced electron-transfer ability and long-term durability. For water splitting, an SA-Came-based electrode is highly stable and shows reaction activities in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, with overpotentials of 154 and 362 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. For supercapacitors, SA-Came achieves a specific capacitance of 125.42 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) and high cyclic stability in a three-electrode system in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. It demonstrated a high energy density of 34.54 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1600 W kg(-1) as a symmetric hybrid supercapacitor device with a wide working potential range of 0-1.6 V.

AB  - Simple Summary Milk production is the most economically crucial dairy sheep trait and constitutes the major genetic enhancement purpose via selective breeding. Also, mastitis is one of the most frequently encountered diseases, having a significant impact on animal welfare, milk yield, and quality. The aim of this study was to identify genomic region(s) associated with the milk production traits and somatic cell score (SCS) in Valle del Belice sheep using single-step genome-wide association (ssGWA) and genotyping data from medium density SNP panels. We identified several genomic regions (OAR1, OAR2, OAR3, OAR4, OAR6, OAR9, and OAR25) and candidate genes implicated in milk production traits and SCS. Our findings offer new insights into the genetic basis of milk production traits and SCS in dairy sheep. The objective of this study was to uncover genomic regions explaining a substantial proportion of the genetic variance in milk production traits and somatic cell score in a Valle del Belice dairy sheep. Weighted single-step genome-wide association studies (WssGWAS) were conducted for milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), fat percentage (FAT%), protein yield (PY), protein percentage (PROT%), and somatic cell score (SCS). In addition, our aim was also to identify candidate genes within genomic regions that explained the highest proportions of genetic variance. Overall, the full pedigree consists of 5534 animals, of which 1813 ewes had milk data (15,008 records), and 481 ewes were genotyped with a 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. The effects of markers and the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) of the animals were obtained by five iterations of WssGBLUP. We considered the top 10 genomic regions in terms of their explained genomic variants as candidate window regions for each trait. The results showed that top ranked genomic windows (1 Mb windows) explained 3.49, 4.04, 5.37, 4.09, 3.80, and 5.24% of the genetic variances for MY, FY, FAT%, PY, PROT%, and total SCS, respectively. Among the candidate genes found, some known associations were confirmed, while several novel candidate genes were also revealed, including PPARGC1A, LYPLA1, LEP, and MYH9 for MY; CACNA1C, PTPN1, ROBO2, CHRM3, and ERCC6 for FY and FAT%; PCSK5 and ANGPT1 for PY and PROT%; and IL26, IFNG, PEX26, NEGR1, LAP3, and MED28 for SCS. These findings increase our understanding of the genetic architecture of six examined traits and provide guidance for subsequent genetic improvement through genome selection.

AB  - The jasmonic acid (JA) pathway is central for plant defence against herbivores, and genes related to this pathway have received increased attention. Here, we evaluated the functions of the allene oxide cyclase (AOC)-encoding gene GmAOC3 and the caleosin-encoding gene GmCLO1, which may affect JA synthesis in soybean, and explored the anti-insect mechanisms of these two genes. The overexpression of GmAOC3 increased soybean resistance to the common cutworm (CCW). The strongest resistance to CCW was observed in the GmAOC3-overexpressing line GmAOC3-OE-1. Whole-genome resequencing and expression analysis revealed that in this line, GmCLO1 silencing was caused by insertion of the GmAOC3 gene into the GmCLO1 sequence. GmCLO1 expression responded to CCW induction. Compared with the controls, the knockdown or knockout of GmCLO1 increased soybean resistance to CCW. Conversely, the overexpression of GmCLO1 decreased CCW resistance. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that the gmclo1-knockout line shared 653 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 87 differentially abundant metabolites with the GmAOC3-OE line. Among these common DEGs, anti-insect genes related to JA, such as the 9-lipoxygenase gene Glyma.13G347800, the vegetative storage protein gene Glyma.08G200100, and the trypsin inhibitor gene Glyma.06G219900, showed upregulated expressions in both lines. Additionally, JA and JA-isoleucine contents were notably elevated in the GmAOC3-OE-1 line but decreased in the GmCLO1-overexpressing line. Measurements of yield-related traits revealed that GmAOC3 overexpression and/or GmCLO1 knockout did not affect soybean yield. In conclusion, we identified two new target genes for insect-resistant soybean breeding and contributed to an in-depth understanding of the JA-mediated insect resistance mechanisms in soybeans.

AB  - Renal ischemia in the peri-transplant period causes a number of changes that adversely affect the initiation of normal vital functions in grafts after transplantation. To minimise the extent of ischemic damage, organs are stored in preservation fluid. The components of the fluid are supposed to ensure stabilisation of the cell cytoskeleton, protect against oxygen free radicals, reduce cell swelling, and ensure endothelial cell integrity. The aim of this study was to analyse the protective effect of Cu2+, as a component of Biolasol preservative fluid, in the prevention of nephron damage occurring during the graft storage period. Analyses of the effectiveness of copper in the presence of prolactin added to Biolasol fluid were also carried out. Forty isolated pig slaughter kidneys were used in the study, avoiding the use of laboratory animals. The kidneys were stored using simple hypothermia. After 2 h and 48 h of graft storage, selected biochemical indicators of renal function were determined in the collected perfusates. The addition of Cu2+ at a dose of 1 mu g/L to the composition of Biolasol fluid was found to affect the generation of ischemic damage in the isolated pig kidney. The intensity of the occurrence of these processes is exacerbated by the presence of prolactin at a dose of 0.1 mu g/L.

AB  - Dairy products play a crucial role in human nutrition as they provide essential nutrients. However, the presence of diverse microorganisms in these products can pose challenges to food safety and quality. Here, we provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of a diverse collection of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and staphylococci isolated from raw sheep's milk. Whole-genome sequencing, phenotypic characterization, and bioinformatics were employed to gain insight into the genetic composition and functional attributes of these bacteria. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of various genetic elements. Important toxin-related genes in staphylococci that contribute to their pathogenic potential were identified and confirmed using phenotypic assays, while adherence-related genes, which are essential for attachment to host tissues, surfaces in the dairy environment, and the creation of biofilms, were also present. Interestingly, the Staphylococcus aureus isolates belonged to sequence type 5, which largely consists of methicillin-susceptible isolates that have been involved in severe nosocomial infections. Although genes encoding methicillin resistance were not identified, multiple resistance genes (RGs) conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, and fluroquinolones were found. In contrast, LAB had few inherently present RGs and no virulence genes, suggesting their likely safe status as food additives in dairy products. LAB were also richer in bacteriocins and carbohydrate-active enzymes, indicating their potential to suppress pathogens and effectively utilize carbohydrate substrates, respectively. Additionally, mobile genetic elements, present in both LAB and staphylococci, may facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of genetic traits, including RGs, virulence genes, and metabolic factors, with implications for food quality and public health. The molecular and phenotypic characterization presented herein contributes to the effort to mitigate risks and infections (e.g., mastitis) and enhance the safety and quality of milk and products thereof.

AB  - Taeniids, consisting of two genera Echinococcus and Taenia , are obligatory tapeworms of mammals, and their pathogenicity was due to infection with larval stages. Hydatid (the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus) and coenurus (the larval stage of Taenia multiceps) cysts are prevalent in domestic, wild ruminants, livestock, swine, and dogs, and accidentally they could also be found in humans. They lead to different clinical manifestations that cause economic loss in livestock and human morbidity. In Saudi Arabia, few studies were performed on hydatid and coenurus cyst genetic variations. The main goal of the present study was to identify E. granulosus and T. multiceps cyst isolates collected from slaughtered Harri sheep in Saudi Arabia by partial sequencing with PCR amplification of the cytochrome C oxidase 1 (COX1) gene. Molecular and phylogenetic evaluation based on COX1 sequences indicated that cyst isolates belong to E. granulosus and T. multiceps , respectively, successfully submitted in NCBI Genbank. Molecular characterization showed a low nucleotide diversity with two submitted isolates of coenurus with related isolates of Genbank. Conversely, E. granulosus isolates showed higher nucleotide diversity. The reported data could serve as a foundation for future molecular epidemiological and biological studies.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) demonstrate episodic memory deficits, which may be hippocampal-dependent and may be attenuated in lithium responders. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CA3 pyramidal cell-like neurons show significant hyperexcitability in lithium-responsive BD patients, while lithium nonresponders show marked variance in hyperexcitability. We hypothesize that this variable excitability will impair episodic memory recall, as assessed by cued retrieval (pattern completion) within a computational model of the hippocampal CA3. Methods: We simulated pattern completion tasks using a computational model of the CA3 with different degrees of pyramidal cell excitability variance. Since pyramidal cell excitability variance naturally leads to a mix of hyperexcitability and hypoexcitability, we also examined what fraction (hyper- vs. hypoexcitable) was predominantly responsible for pattern completion errors in our model. Results: Pyramidal cell excitability variance impaired pattern completion (linear model beta = -2.00, SE = 0.03, p < 0.001). The effect was invariant to all other parameter settings in the model. Excitability variance, specifically hyperexcitability, increased the number of spuriously active neurons, increasing false alarm rates and producing pattern completion deficits. Excessive inhibition also induces pattern completion deficits by limiting the number of correctly active neurons during pattern retrieval. Conclusions: Excitability variance in CA3 pyramidal cell-like neurons observed in lithium nonresponders may predict pattern completion deficits in these patients. These cognitive deficits may not be fully corrected by medications that minimize excitability. Future studies should test our predictions by examining behavioral correlates of pattern completion in lithium-responsive and -nonresponsive BD patients.

AB  - Insect herbivory has attracted enormous attention from researchers due to its effects on plant fitness. However, there remain questions such as what are the most important leaf traits that determine consumption levels, whether there are latitudinal gradients in herbivore pressure, or whether there are differences in susceptibility between hybrids and their parental species. In this work, we address all these issues in two species of Mediterranean Quercus (Quercus faginea subsp. faginea Lam. and Quercus pyrenaica Wild.) and their hybrids. Over 2 years, we analyzed leaf emergence and 11 leaf traits (biomechanical, chemical and morphological), as well as the levels of herbivory by insects in leaves of the three genetic groups in different locations distributed along a climatic gradient. The hybrids showed intermediate values between both species in leaf emergence, chemical traits and structural reinforcement. By contrast, they were more similar to Q. faginea in leaf size and shape. Despite their intermediate leaf traits, hybrids always showed lower losses by consumption than both parental species, which suggests that they possess inherent higher resistance to herbivores, which cannot be explained by their dissimilarities in leaf traits. Within each genetic group, differences in leaf size were the most important determinant of differences in herbivory losses, which increased with leaf size. In turn, leaf size increased significantly with the increase in mean annual temperatures across the climatic gradient, in parallel with herbivory losses. In conclusion, contrary to our expectations, hybrids maintained lower levels of herbivory than their parent species. Given the potential negative effect of leaf herbivory on carbon fixation, this advantage of the hybrids would imply a threat to the persistence of both pure species. More research is needed to elucidate possible alternative mechanisms that allow for maintaining species integrity in the absence of reproductive barriers.

AB  - Spatially firing "place cells" within the hippocampal CA1 region form internal maps of the environment necessary for navigation and memory. In rodents, these neurons have been almost exclusively studied in small environments (<4 m(2)). It remains unclear how place cells encode a very large open 2D environment that is commensurate with the natural environments experienced by rodents and other mammals. Such an ethologically realistic environment would require a complex spatial representation, capable of simultaneously representing space at multiple overlapping fine-to-coarse informational scales. Here, we show that in a "megaspace" (18.6 m(2)), the majority of dorsal CA1 place cells exhibited multiple place subfields of different sizes, akin to those observed along the septo-temporal axis. Furthermore, the total area covered by the subfields of each cell was not correlated with the number of subfields, and increased with the scale of the environment. The multiple different-sized subfields exhibited by place cells in the megaspace suggest that the ensemble population of subfields form a multi-scale representation of space within the dorsal hippocampus. Our findings point to a new dorsal hippocampus ensemble coding scheme that simultaneously supports navigational processes at both fine- and coarse-grained resolutions.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the level of contamination, health risks, hydro-chemical processes, and sources of contaminants in the groundwater of the Nizampur basin, northwestern Pakistan. Forty-eight (n = 48) ground-water samples from predefined locations were collected and analyzed using the standard procedure for a total of 13 parameters. Statistical techniques in the compositional data analysis perspective were used for the identification of sources. The results showed that TDS, Turbidity, SO4, and NO3 concentrations surpassed the limits in 44, 29, 25, and 48% of samples, respectively. The nitrate pollution index indicated that 48% of the samples were contaminated with nitrates, while the composite index PIG showed that only 22% of the samples indicated low pollution. A close association between the land use/land cover of the study area and NO3 contamination was observed. In general, the groundwater of the region could be categorized as fresh-very hard water (87.5%), the major hydro-chemical facies were, Ca-Mg-HCO3, followed by mixed Ca-Mg-Cl and Ca-Cl facies. The Van Wirdum diagram showed that groundwater was mainly influenced by rock weathering and profound human impact. Similarly, it was assessed using chloro-alkaline indices that reverse ion exchange is a governing hydro-chemical process. NO3 concentrations in the area have the potential to cause non-cancer ailments in 75% and 47% of the samples in children and adults respectively. Based on the assessments made using the compositional data analysis it was inferred that NO3, SO4, Cl, and Turbidity originated from human sources, while the rest of the parameters have natural/geogenic sources.

AB  - An increasing number of GPS telemetry studies have helped to gain important insights into predator-prey relationships in recent years. However, considerable time and effort is needed to evaluate whether GPS location clusters (GLCs) reflect predation events. To reduce field effort, predictive models are being developed to calculate predator kill intervals, but few studies have attempted to do this for a specific species of prey. Between 2013 and 2018, we studied predation by 13 GPS-collared Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) on Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) in the northwestern Swiss Alps. Our objectives were to predict the total number of killed chamois, including potential kills in unchecked GLCs, and to evaluate if model predictions were sufficiently accurate. We built a set of generalized linear models (GLM) predicting the occurrence of GLCs containing lynx-killed chamois (1) versus GLCs containing other prey types or no prey (0) and compared their predictive performance by means of k-fold cross-validation. We found that model performance was very similar for all candidate models, with the full model yielding the best cross-validation result (accuracy = 0.83, sensitivity = 0.43, specificity = 0.94). Female lynx killed on average one chamois every 11.9 days (10.6-13.0 days, 95% CI); male lynx killed one chamois every 7.2 days (6.7-7.6 days, 95% CI). Our model showed high specificity for detecting non-chamois GLCs, but sensitivity for detection of GLCs with actual chamois kills was low. We conclude that the sensitivity of the models should be further improved, but the results can be sufficient for practical application. Predictive modelling approaches do not replace extensive fieldwork but require large sets of field data, high individual variability and thorough knowledge of a predator's ecology and prey community. Our approach may provide useful results for binary classifications in rather simple predator-prey systems, but extrapolations from one study system to another might be difficult.

AB  - Simple Summary During the peri-parturient period, the development of the fetus and the production of the colostrum and milk lead to increased requirements of energy and minerals, which, in turn, predispose ruminants to the risk of metabolic diseases, such as hypocalcemia. Feed additives could provoke or prevent hypocalcemia. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of sugar beet pulp administration during the dry period, alone or together with anionic salts, on the serum concentrations of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium, during the peri-parturient period of Chios dairy sheep. The results revealed a benefi cial effect of sugar beet pulp and anionic salts administration during the dry period in preventing peri-parturient hypocalcemia. Sugar beet pulp is a popular by-product of sugar extraction; however, it can potentially cause depletion of Ca availability due to its oxalic content. The experiment examined the effect of sugar beet pulp and anionic salts administration during the dry period on the serum concentration of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium of dairy sheep. Eighty-seven sheep were divided into three groups (A, B, and C) according to their body condition score (BCS) and age at 40 days before the expected lambing. All groups received alfalfa hay, mixed grass straw, and a concentrate supplement. The concentrate fed to groups B and C contained sugar beet pulp. The nutritional value fed to all three groups was similar, except for Dietary Cation Anion Difference (DCAD). Animals of group A had a DCAD of +198 mEq/kg, animals of group B of +188 mEq/kg, and animals of group C were fed 20 gr/d ammonium chloride to achieve a negative DCAD (-52 mEq/kg). All groups were fed the same ration after lambing. Blood samples were collected 30 d, 20 d, 17 d, 14 d, 10 d, 7 d, and 4 d before lambing (a.p.), 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 7 d, 10 d, and 15 d after lambing (p.p) for calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium, and 30 d a.p., 7 d, and 15 d p.p. for beta hydroxybutyrate acid (BHBA) concentrations. Urine samples were also collected 20 d, 10 d, 4 d a.p., and 7 d p.p for the evaluation of pH levels. Ca levels of the control group decreased earlier and were lower at 4 d a.p. compared to those of group B and C. Additionally, the control group showed lower p values compared to group C at 20 d and 17 d a.p. P levels recovered earlier post parturition in young (age 1-1.5 years old) compared to older ewes. Group C had lower urine pH values throughout the pre-parturient period, reflecting the acidifying effect of the administered ammonium chloride, without any side effect on macromineral blood concentration. Feeding sugar beet pulp and systemic acidifying before parturition is considered safe and might even be beneficial in preventing hypocalcemia.

AB  - Fear extinction allows for adaptive control of learned fear responses but often fails, resulting in a renewal or spontaneous recovery of the extinguished fear, i.e., forgetting of the extinction memory readily occurs. Using an activity-dependent neuronal labeling strategy, we demonstrate that engram neurons for fear extinction memory are dynamically positioned in the medial prefrontal cortex mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (vHPC), which constitute an engram construct in the term of directional engram synaptic connectivity from the BLA or vHPC to mPFC, but not that in the opposite direction, for retrieval of extinction memory. Fear renewal or spontaneous recovery switches the extinction engram construct from an accessible to inaccessible state, whereas additional extinction learning or optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation restores the directional engram connectivity and prevents the return of fear. Thus, the plasticity of engram construct underlies forgetting of extinction memory.

   Since 20th century, the use of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) supplement has been increased in animals feed due to its promising effects and potential to brighten the livestock industry in future. The feed cost of blood plasma is very expensive and, due to its high cost, it has been used mainly in piglet diets. In this regard, we implemented 3% blood plasma with 3% yeast supplementation to piglets mainly from 0-7 days, and gradually reduced the concentration of blood plasma with yeast supplement to 1.5:1.5% from 8-21 days and observed how it affects the overall performance of pigs on the remaining days 22-42 fed only basal diet. As expected, piglets fed blood plasma with yeast supplement over 0-21 days has a great impact on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal microbial, and gas emission at the end of the experiment. Thus, we suggest that blood plasma with yeast could be an excellent alternative in the livestock industry.
   This experiment was performed to examine the hypothesis that blood plasma (BP) with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) supplement in the diet of weaning pigs could provoke the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal microbial, and reduce harmful gas excretion. A total of one hundred and eighty healthy piglets were taken and assigned (complete random blocks) to three dietary treatments as: Phase 1: Treatment (TRT) 1-6% BP; TRT 2-3% BP + 3% yeast; TRT 3-6% yeast. Phase 2: TRT 1-3%; BP., TRT 2-1.5% BP + 1.5% yeast; TRT 3- 3% yeast. Phase 3: TRT 1- Control (CON) (Basal diet); TRT 2- CON; TRT 3- CON for six- weeks. Each treatment had twelve replicates and five (three gilts and two barrows) pigs per pen. Dietary inclusion of BP with yeast supplementation significantly increased the body weight of piglets during phase 2 (p = 0.003) and phase 3 (p = 0.032). In addition, TRT2 group piglets had a significant improvement in average daily gain at the end of each phase and overall (p = 0.047, 0.025, 0.018 and 0.012, respectively). At phase 3, TRT2 group piglets showed a significant improvement on nutrient digestibility of dry matter (p = 0.012) and nitrogen (p = 0.040). The fecal microbiota of TRT2 group piglets showed a tendency to increase the number of Lactobacillus counts at phase 1 (p = 0.07) and phase 2 (p = 0.06) as well as, a significant improvement at phase 3 (p = 0.021). In addition, TRT2 group piglets had trend to decrease NH3 (p = 0.074) and H2S (p = 0.069) during phase 2, and significantly reduced NH3 (p = 0.038) and H2S (p = 0.046) at phase 3. However, the fecal score of piglets remains unaffected during the entire trial. At the end of phase 1 piglets' IgG (p = 0.008) was significantly increased with the inclusion of BP with yeast supplementation. Based on the positive effects on body weight, average daily gain, nutrient digestibility, Lactobacillus count, and reduced gas emission, we suggest that dietary supplement with BP and yeast in the diet of weaned piglet could serve as an excellent alternative to antibiotics growth promoters.

AB  - The insect visitors to the flowers of Ampelopsis glandulosa (Vitaceae) were surveyed in western Japan. This plant species has cymose inflorescences with many greenish open flowers that contain copious nectar. Diverse insect species visit the flowers and the number of wasps was greater than that of bees. The most frequent visitor at all study sites was the scoliid wasp Scolia oculata. Solitary halictine and andrenid bees were also relatively frequent visitors at some sites. Because a large amount of yellow pollen from A. glandulosa was attached to the bodies of both wasps and bees, they were considered to be effective pollinators. Although honey-bees and vespid wasps were also frequent visitors at many sites, a negligible amount of yellow pollen was found to be attached to the bodies of a majority of these; therefore, they were not considered to be effective pollinators. Vespid wasps are predators of herbivorous insects and observations revealed that they are nectar thieves of A. glandulosa. Because diverse insects were attracted to A. glandulosa flowers, these flowers appear to be generalists, however, only short-tongued scoliid wasps, halictine bees, and andrenid bees appeared to be effective pollinators. These results therefore suggest that A. glandulosa is functionally specialized for short-tongued hymenopteran pollinators. This study adds to a growing body of work on specialized wasp pollination, a system hitherto mostly known from South Africa.

AB  - The advancement in the field of remote sensing (RS) has offered a vast number of RS images with higher resolution. Nowadays, remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) has become a challenging task for researchers due to the complicated contents and specific characteristics of RS images. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) methods create powerful tools for mining large RS image databases. Content-based RSIR aims to acquire the images with similar visual content based on a query given from a large-scale RS image library. Most of the previous works used pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to form a scene illustration for the classification of RS scenes. In this work, an effective RSIR using hybrid VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group Network) CNN with red deer algorithm (RDA) is presented for the appropriate retrieval of RS images based on the query image. The proposed hybrid VGGNet CNN model integrates dimensionality reduction (DR), feature extraction (FE), loss function optimization, matching process and relevance feedback (RF) mechanism. The technique used to reduce the dimensionality is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Next, feature extraction is processed using the combination of hybrid VGGNet CNN model, attention module and convolutional feature encoding module. The loss function is optimized using RDA, and the matching process is done by recursive density estimation (RDE). Finally, based on the feedback obtained from the user, the RF mechanism discards the images that are non-relevant and only relevant images are retrieved. The tool used for implementation is PYTHON platform. Hence, the extensive tests on University of California Merced (UCM) and Wuhan University Remote Sensing images with 19 class (WHU-RS19) databases reveal that the proposed model performs better than several state-of-the-art techniques.

AB  - Despite the existence of over half a million species of plant-eating insects, our planet remains predominantly green. In fact, susceptibility to herbivory is the exception, as plants are resistant to most insect species. This phenomenon is known as non-host resistance (NHR), where every individual of a plant species is resistant to all variants of a pest or pathogen. While NHR represents the most common and durable outcome of the plant immune system, several aspects of this type of plant defence remain elusive, particularly in plant-insect interactions. In this review, we clarify the concept of NHR in plant-insect interactions. We emphasize that NHR is a phenomenon arising as a consequence of effective plant defences providing invulnerability to most insect herbivores. This underscores that NHR is one of the main ecological features delimiting the range of plant-insect interactions on Earth. We further highlight the traits and molecular components of the plant immune system known to participate in NHR against insects. Finally, we discuss how NHR can be leveraged as a tool to develop pest-resilient crops. Given the significant threat insects pose to global food security, research in plant NHR represents a crucial focal point with immense potential for ensuring food security worldwide.
   Non-host resistance is the most common, durable, and efficient outcome of plant defences against biotic stresses. This review highlights its role in plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that a single infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the uterus induces mammary gland inflammation. However, repeated LPS infusions return the mammary glands to their basal state of inflammation. To confirm that this is a state of tolerance to LPS, we examined whether tolerance induced by repeated intrauterine LPS infusions limits mammary gland inflammation following subsequent intramammary LPS infusions. In the first experiment, three goats were treated with repeated intrauterine infusions of LPS dissolved in black ink for 5 consecutive days. Blood and milk samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h and smeared on glass slides to confirm the translocation of LPS from the uterus to the mammary gland. Black particles were detected in the blood and milk samples more than 2 h after the first infusion and in the connective tissue of the mammary gland after day 5. In the second experiment, goats were divided into two groups: an intrauterine infusion group (IU; n = 7) and a control group (CON; n = 6). The IU group received an intrauterine infusion of 100 mu g of LPS in saline for 5 days. Subsequently, LPS was infused into the mammary glands of both groups to examine the effect of intrauterine treatment on the mammary inflammatory response after intramammary LPS infusion. Blood and milk samples were collected at 6, 12, and 24 h, and then daily until 7 d after the intramammary LPS challenge. Interestingly, a significant increase in the milk somatic cell count (SCC), IL-8, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha concentrations were observed in the CON group compared to the IU group. This suggests that pretreatment with repeated intrauterine infusions of LPS suppresses the inflammatory responses to subsequent intramammary LPS challenges.

AB  - This work aimed to examine the effects of sex on meat and fat quality traits from thirty Portuguese Alentejano (AL) pigs reared in outdoor conditions. These pigs were divided into three groups and fed ad libitum. From similar to 40 to 130 kg LW, castrated (C group) and intact animals (I and IExp) consumed commercial diets. Until slaughter (similar to 160 kg), C and I pigs remained on commercial diets, and IExp changed to a more sustainable experimental diet with locally produced pulses and byproducts. Samples were collected from the Longissimus lumborum (LL), Psoas major (PM), and dorsal subcutaneous fat (DSF). At similar to 160 kg, the PM muscle of intact pigs presented lower intramuscular fat content than that of C pigs, while total collagen was higher. Additionally, PM myoglobin was lower and lightness (L*) was higher in intact pigs. Regarding DSF, moisture and total protein contents were higher and total lipids were lower in intact than in castrated pigs, while color parameters were not significantly different. Finally, antioxidant capacity measured in the LL muscle showed an overall lower value in intact pigs. However, lipid oxidation values were not significantly different between the experimental groups and only increased with storage time. Outdoor-reared intact AL pigs produced leaner and less saturated pork and fat compared to castrated ones. Despite the lower antioxidant activity observed in the LL muscles of intact pigs, the lipid oxidative stability of cooked meat was not different among the experimental groups.

AB  - The main biochemical traits were estimated in poplar leaves under biotic attack (aphids and spongy moth infestation). Changes in the abundance of bioactive compounds in genetically uniform individuals of European aspen (Populus tremula), such as proline, polyphenolic compounds, chlorophylls a and b, and volatile compounds, were determined between leaves damaged by sucking insects (aphid-Chaitophorus nassonowi) and chewing insects (spongy moth-Lymantria dispar) compared to uninfected leaves. Among the nine analyzed phenolic compounds, only catechin and procyanidin showed significant differences between the control leaves and leaves affected by spongy moths or aphids. GC-TOF-MS volatile metabolome analysis showed the clear separation of the control versus aphids-infested and moth-infested leaves. In total, the compounds that proved to have the highest explanatory power for aphid-infested leaves were 3-hexenal and 5-methyl-2-furanone, and for moth-infested leaves, trans-alpha-farnesene and 4-cyanocyclohexane. The aphid-infested leaves contained around half the amount of chlorophylls and twice the amount of proline compared to uninfected leaves, and these results evidenced that aphids influence plant physiology more than chewing insects.

AB  - The frequencies of 6 different facultative pathogenic bacteria of the ESKAPE group (priority list WHO) and a total of 14 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) with different priorities for human medicine were quantified in wastewaters of poultry and pig slaughterhouses using molecular biological approaches. Raw sewage from poultry and pig slaughterhouses was found to be contaminated not only with facultative pathogenic bacteria but also with various categories of clinically relevant ARGs, including ARGs against the reserve antibiotics group. The concentration of the different gene targets decreased after on-site conventional biological or advanced oxidative wastewater treatments, but was not eliminated. Hence, the antimicrobial BlueLight (aBL) in combination with a porphyrin photo-sensitizer was studied with ESKAPE bacteria and real slaughterhouse wastewaters. The applied broad LED-based blue light (420-480 nm) resulted in groups of sensitive, intermediate, and non-sensitive ESKAPE bacteria. The killing effect of aBL was increased in the non-sensitive bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecium due to the addition of porphyrins in concentrations of 10-6 M. Diluted slaughterhouse raw wastewater was treated with broad spectrum aBL and in combination with porphyrin. Here, the presence of the photo-sensitizer enhanced the aBL biocidal impact.

AB  - Microglia and astrocytes are essential in sustaining physiological networks in the central nervous system, with their ability to remodel the extracellular matrix, being pivotal for synapse plasticity. Recent findings have challenged the traditional view of homogenous glial populations in the brain, uncovering morphological, functional, and molecular heterogeneity among glial cells. This diversity has significant implications for both physiological and pathological brain states. In the present study, we mechanically induced a Schaffer collateral lesion (SCL) in mouse entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures to investigate glial behavior, i.e., microglia and astrocytes, under metalloproteinases (MMPs) modulation in the lesioned area, CA3, and the denervated region, CA1. We observed distinct response patterns in the microglia and astrocytes 3 days after the lesion. Notably, GFAP-expressing astrocytes showed no immediate changes post-SCL. Microglia responses varied depending on their anatomical location, underscoring the complexity of the hippocampal neuroglial network post-injury. The MMPs inhibitor GM6001 did not affect microglial reactions in CA3, while increasing the number of Iba1-expressing cells in CA1, leading to a withdrawal of their primary branches. These findings highlight the importance of understanding glial regionalization following neural injury and MMPs modulation and pave the way for further research into glia-targeted therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Camelina sativa, a member of the Brassicaceae, is a low-cost, renewable oilseed crop that produces seeds up to 40% oil by weight with high potential for use in food, feed, and biofuel applications. Camelina seeds contain high levels of the fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3), linoleic acid (C18:2), oleic acid (C18:1), and gondoic acid (C20:1), which have high nutritional and industrial value. The impact of climate change, especially increased frequency and amplitude of heat waves, poses a serious threat to crop productivity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of elevated temperatures post-anthesis on the developing seeds of C. sativa and performed physiological, morphological, and chemical characterizations at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-anthesis (DPA), as well as at maturity. While the seed oil accumulation peaked at 21 DPA under control conditions, reaching 406mg/g dry weight, under heat stress it was only 186mg/g. Physiologically, transpiration rate (E) and internal CO2 concentration (Ci) increased between 2 to 9 days post-stress imposition and overall net photosynthesis was impaired. Seed yield, seed weight, and oil content reduced by 84.5%, 38.5% and 54.1% respectively. We demonstrate that post-anthesis heat stress causes severe yield losses and developmental plasticity in fatty acid accumulation in oilseeds.

AB  - Chicken feathers are hazardous to the environment because of their poor digestibility and potential as a source of environmental contaminants. However, this waste contains valuable plant nutrients that can be recovered and used to improve soil fertility and agricultural productivity. The objectives of this study were to evaluate how effective vermicomposting is at recovering nutrients and changes in enzymatic activity during vermicomposting of hydrolysed chicken feather residues (HCFR). The study included four treatments with three replications at different HCFR and pelletized wheat straw (PWS) mixing proportions: (T1) 25% HCFR+75% PWS with earthworms, (T2) 25% HCFR+75% PWS without earthworms, (T3) 50% HCFR+50% PWS with earthworms, and (T4) 50% HCFR+50% PWS (w/w) without earthworms. Eisenia andrei was used in the experiment for 120 days. Earthworm treatments recovered more available plant nutrients than non-earthworm treatments by 14% ${\rm N}-{\rm NO}_3<^>-$N-NO3- (T1); 50% K (T3); 47% Mg (T3); 75% P (T3); 55% B (T3); 34% Cu (T3); 40% Fe (T1); 46% Mn (T3); 11% Zn (T1). However, ${\rm N}-{\rm NH}_4<^> +$N-NH4+ was significantly reduced by -80% (T1). Acid phosphatase, arylsulphatase, alanine aminopeptidase, and leucine aminopeptidase were more active in the treatments with earthworms and positively correlated with P and C: N ratio. Alanine aminopeptidase (3752 mu mol AMCA.g(-1).h(-1)) and leucine aminopeptidase (4252 mu mol AMCL.g(-1).h(-1)) had higher activities in T3 on day 60 of vermicomposting. As a result, the earthworm treatment recovers more plant nutrients than the non-earthworm treatments, and it can be recommended as a better vermicomposting approach for nutrient recovery from HCFR.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Feed grain, including corn and soybean meal, prices, which are the company's primary raw materials, have fluctuated and escalated in recent years. Defatted rice bran, an abundant and underutilized agricultural coproduct of the paddy rice, can be used as a replacement. Additionally, nitrogen emitted as ammonia from swine manure has a negative effect on ambient air quality. This study evaluated the effects of defatted rice bran inclusion level in low-protein diets on growth performance and nutrient digestibility of different body weight pigs. Results showed that there is no difference for average daily gain for three weight stages, it meant that defatted rice bran could be used as a replacement for corns and soybean meal. Nutrient digestibility has significant difference. The study supported some theoretical foundation for the application of defatted rice bran.
   This study was conducted to determine the effects of low-protein diet prepared with different levels of defatted rice bran (DFRB) and weight stages on growth performance and nutrient digestibility of growing-finishing pigs. The animal experiment included three stages. A total of 240 growing pigs with an initial body weight of 28.06 +/- 8.56 kg for stage 1 were allocated to five diets including one control group and four DFRB diets supplemented with 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% DFRB, respectively. The 192 crossbred pigs with initial body weights of 55.03 +/- 7.31 kg and 74.55 +/- 9.10 kg were selected for stage 2 and stage 3, respectively. Pigs were allocated to four diets including one control group and three DFRB diets supplemented with 10%, 15% and 20% DFRB, respectively. The results showed that with the increase in DFEB intake, the gain: feed was linearly increased (p < 0.05), and the average daily feed intake tended to linearly decrease (p = 0.06) in stage 1. Except for the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of acid detergent fiber (ADF) in stage 3, levels of DFRB had significant effects on the ATTD of gross energy (GE), dry matter (DM), ash, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and ADF in three weight stages. In stage 1, with the increase in levels of DFRB, the ATTD of NDF and hemicellulose were firstly increased and then decreased (p < 0.01). In stage 2, with the increasing levels of DFRB, the ATTD of DM, ash and cellulose were firstly increased and then decreased (p < 0.01). In stage 3, the ATTD of GE, DM, ash, NDF and hemicellulose decreased linearly with the increase in levels of DFRB (p < 0.01). Collectively, DFRB could be used as a replacement for corns and soybean meal, and weight stage is important to consider when adjusting the additive proportion.

AB  - Research Highlight: Christian, M., Oosthuizen, W. C., Bester, M. N., & de Bruyn, P. N. (2024). Robustly estimating the demographic contribution of immigration: Simulation, sensitivity analysis and seals. Journal of Animal Ecology. . Immigration can have profound consequences for local population dynamics and demography, but collecting data to accurately quantifying it is challenging. The recent rise of integrated population models (IPMs) offers an alternative by making it possible to estimate immigration without the need for explicit data, and to quantify its contribution to population dynamics through transient Life Table Response Experiments (tLTREs). Simulation studies have, however, highlighted that this approach can be prone to bias and overestimation. In their new study, Christian et al. address one of the root causes of this issue by improving the estimation of time variation in vital rates and immigration using Gaussian processes in lieu of traditionally used temporal random effects. They demonstrate that IPM-tLTRE frameworks with Gaussian processes produce more accurate and less biased estimates of immigration and its contribution to population dynamics and illustrate the applicability of this approach using a long-term data set on elephant seals (Mirounga leonida). Results are validated with a simulation study and suggest that immigration of breeding females has been central for population recovery of elephant seals despite the species' high female site fidelity. Christian et al. thus present new insights into population regulation of long-lived marine mammals and highlight the potential for using Gaussian process priors in IPMs. They also illustrate a suite of 'best practices' for state-of-the-art IPM-tLTRE analyses and provide an inspirational example for the kind of ecological modelling workflow that can be invaluable not just as a starting point for fellow ecologists picking up or improving their own IPM-tLTRE analyses, but also for teaching and in contexts where model estimates are used for informing management and conservation decision-making.
   I draw attention to recent work by Christian et al., which showcases ways how to improve robustness of inference about immigration in integrated population models using both Gaussian processes and solid workflows for thorough model assessment.image

AB  - Xylem sap is the major transport route for nutrients from roots to shoots. In the present study, we investigated how variations in nitrogen (N) nutrition affected the metabolome and proteome of xylem sap and the growth of the xylem endophyte Brennaria salicis, and we also report transcriptional re-wiring of leaf defenses in poplar (Populus 3 canescens). We supplied poplars with high, intermediate or low concentrations of ammonium or nitrate. We identified 288 unique proteins in xylem sap. Approximately 85% of the xylem sap proteins were shared among ammonium- and nitrate-supplied plants. The number of proteins increased with increasing N supply but the major functional categories (catabolic processes, cell wallrelated enzymes, defense) were unaffected. Ammonium nutrition caused higher abundances of amino acids and carbohydrates, whereas nitrate caused higher malate levels in xylem sap. Pipecolic acid and N-hydroxypipecolic acid increased, whereas salicylic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine decreased, with increasing N nutrition. Untargeted metabolome analyses revealed 2179 features in xylem sap, of which 863 were differentially affected by N treatments. We identified 124 metabolites, mainly from specialized metabolism of the groups of salicinoids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics, flavonoids, and benzoates. Their abundances increased with decreasing N, except coumarins. Brennaria salicis growth was reduced in nutrient-supplemented xylem sap of low- and high- NO3- -fed plants compared to that of NH4+- fed plants. The drastic changes in xylem sap composition caused massive changes in the transcriptional landscape of leaves and recruited defenses related to systemic acquired and induced systemic resistance. Our study uncovers unexpected complexity and variability of xylem composition with consequences for plant defenses.

AB  - Meat production traits in pigs are critical economic characteristics, primarily influenced by the formation and development of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle development is regulated by a complex transcriptional network, which partly relies on chromatin accessibility for initiation. Ningxiang pigs, a renowned Chinese indigenous breed, are highly valued for their tender meat. However, studies focusing on skeletal muscle development in Ningxiang pigs, particularly from the perspective of chromatin accessibility, have not yet been reported. Based on this, the present study selected several key time points in the skeletal muscle development of Ningxiang pigs to perform Transposase-Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). This was carried out to identify key open chromatin regions and genes during different growth stages, which could influence skeletal muscle development in Ningxiang pigs. We collected longissimus dorsi muscle samples at postnatal days 14 (D14), 28 (D28), 85 (D85), 165 (D165), and 250 (D250). For each age, three individuals were collected for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. After initial differential analysis among different ages, we identified 6412 differentially accessible chromatin peaks and 1464 differentially expressed genes. To clarify the key candidate transcription factors affecting the development of skeletal muscle in Ningxiang pigs, motif analysis of differential peaks revealed potential cis-regulatory elements with binding sites for transcription factors, including Fosl2 and JunB. Correlation analysis identified 56 overlapping genes and a significant positive correlation (r = 0.73, p = 1 x 10-14) between gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Key candidate genes such as HOXA10, closely related to skeletal muscle development, were specifically examined. These results enhance our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of porcine skeletal muscle development, providing a robust foundation for future molecular studies.

AB  - Neuroinflammation, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders are associated with excessive accumulation of neutral lipids in lipid droplets (LDs) in microglia. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may cause neuroinflammation and is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons contain smaller, more abundant LDs than their neighboring microglia. The density of LDs varied between pyramidal cells in adjacent subregions, with CA3 neurons containing more LDs than CA1 neurons. Within the CA3 region, a gradual increase in the LD content along the pyramidal layer from the hilus toward CA2 was observed. Interestingly, the high neuronal LD content correlated with less ramified microglial morphotypes. Using the db/db model of T2DM, we demonstrated that diabetes increased the number of LDs per microglial cell without affecting the neuronal LD density. High-intensity interval exercise induced smaller changes in the number of LDs in microglia but was not sufficient to counteract the diabetes-induced changes in LD accumulation. The changes observed in response to T2DM may contribute to the cerebral effects of T2DM and provide a mechanistic link between T2DM and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Triterpenes are pivotal components of plant defence, offering a sustainable alternative to synthetic pesticides in insect pest management. They serve as critical components of both direct and indirect defence strategies, impacting various facets of herbivore behaviour and development. These structurally diverse metabolites not only deter herbivores directly but also modulate ecological interactions, potentially contributing to plant immunity. Despite their ecological and evolutionary significance, a comprehensive understanding of triterpene utility in plant defence, specifically towards herbivorous insects remains patchy. This review explores the evolutionary arms race between plants and insect herbivores, focusing on how pests evolved counter strategies against triterpene-based defences and the implications for long-term resistance management. However, their effective deployment requires a comprehensive framework that integrates evolutionary biology, ecological dynamics, and biotechnological interventions. Advancements in genome editing, metabolic engineering, and RNA interference (RNAi) provide promising avenues to optimize triterpene production in crops while targeting insect defence pathways. By integrating molecular, ecological, and biotechnological insights, this review proposes a conceptual framework to harness triterpenes for sustainable agriculture, reducing pesticide dependency while maintaining ecological balance. Addressing key knowledge gaps through interdisciplinary research will be critical for translating these discoveries into scalable agricultural solutions, ensuring crop resilience and long-term food security.
   Triterpenes, key players in the evolutionary arms race between plants and herbivores, are pivotal to plant immunity due to their structural diversity and regulatory complexity. They offer innovative strategies for crop improvement.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of different levels of corn distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS) on the growth performance of meat ducks. To this end, a total of 450 Shuanggui-tou meat ducks with comparable body weights were treated with increasing concentration of DDGS. Compared to mock-treated group, the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed to meat ratio (F:G) were measured. It was revealed that the addition of DDGS up to 24% in the diet remained ineffective for ADFI, ADG and F:G. However, there a tendency of decrease in ADG was observed when 32% DDGS was added in the feed. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the increase of DDGS in feed did not negatively affect the growth performance and subsequently can decrease the cost per unit weight gain. Therefore, the DDGS presents an alternative protein resource to meet ever-increasing demands of feed ingredients in poultry production sectors.
   With the continuous growth of livestock and poultry sectors, the shortage of feed ingredients (especially protein feed resources) is becoming a serious concern around the globe including China. To resolve this worldwide problem, development and utilization of unconventional and alternative protein resources have been considered (Xie et al., 2016). One of such alternatives is distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) which is a by-product of dry-grind ethanol production from various cereal grains including corn, sorghum, wheat and rye (Xu et al., 2010; Liu and Han, 2011; Villela et al., 2017). Corn DDGS is one of the most abundant by-products in ethanol processing

AB  - Multi-omics were applied to compare the risks and benefits of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) and ferrous bisglycinate (FebisGly) in pigs in the current study. The FebisGly group showed reduced triglyceride (TG) and triglyceride/total cholesterol (TG/CHOL) values in the serum and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased glutathione (GSH) levels in the duodenum. Transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes in the duodenum were enriched in oxidative phosphorylation, AMPK, and FOXO signaling pathways between FeSO4 and FebisGly groups. AMPK phosphorylation and FOXO3 protein expressions were significantly increased in the FebisGly group. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed significantly reduced alpha diversity in the FeSO4 group and increased Firmicutes, reduced Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria abundances in the FebisGly group. Targeted metabolome revealed notably increased lithocholic acid (LCA), glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in the FebisGly group. RDA analysis indicated that Fusobacteria was positively correlated with TG and TG/high-density lipoprotein in the FeSO4 group while Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 were positively correlated with UDCA and GLCA in the FebisGly group. According to the current study, FebisGly improves serum lipid metabolism, modulates intestinal antioxidant capacity via the AMPK/FOXO pathway, and reconstitutes gut microbiota and bile acid profiles in pigs.

AB  - Given the multiple possible mechanisms for interspecific chemical interaction between adjacent heterospecific plants, phytochemical profiles, which include phytochemical defense compounds, of crop species could potentially be enhanced or altered by intercropping with phytochemically diverse neighbors. We assessed the influence of intercropping between phytochemically diverse plants on plant biomass and aerial volatile organic compound (VOC) emission profiles by intercropping sweetclover (Melilotus alba) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) with silflower (Silphium integrifolium) in AMF-inoculated soil. We also assessed the impact of intercropping on induced VOC profiles by conducting an in-situ, no-choice bioassay with fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). Of eight compound classes we identified across the three plant species, prenol lipids (terpenoids) were upregulated in silflower plants when monocropped with wheat and when herbivory was introduced. Carboxylic acids and organooxygen compounds were reduced in sweetclover when intercropped with silflower, but increased under herbivory. Uninfested wheat plants emitted more organooxygen compounds and fatty acyls than infested plants when intercropped with silflower, but not when monocropped. Wheat and sweetclover biomass increased when intercropped with silflower, but silflower biomass was unaffected by intercropping. This study showed that VOC emissions of plants from three diverse taxa are altered by both intercropping and herbivory in ways that may impact their resistance to insect herbivory. Further research into the role of intercropping on volatile profile emissions, and possible pest resistance in agroecological systems, could help farmers to design intercropping systems that optimize natural plant herbivory defenses, thus improving agricultural sustainability.

AB  - To reveal the mechanisms underlying how light affects flavonoid metabolism and the potential role of flavonoids in protecting against photooxidative stress in tea leaves, tea plants adapted to low-light conditions were exposed to full sunlight over 48 h. There was an increase in the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as greater accumulation of reactive oxygen species, lutein, tocopherols, ascorbate and malondialdehyde, suggestive of a time-dependent response to photooxidative stress in tea leaves. Analysis of the time dependency of each element of the antioxidant system indicated that carotenoids and tocopherols exhibited the fastest response to light stress (within 3 h), followed by SOD, CAT and catechin, which peaked at 24 h. Meanwhile, flavonols, vitamin C and glutathione showed the slowest response. Subsequent identification of the main phytochemicals involved in protecting against oxidative stress using untargeted metabolomics revealed a fast and initial accumulation of nonesterified catechins that preceded the increase in flavonol glycosides and catechin esters. Gene expression analysis suggested that the light-induced accumulation of flavonoids was highly associated with the gene encoding flavonol synthase. Ultraviolet B (UV-B) irradiation further validated the time-dependent and collaborative effects of flavonoids in photoprotection in tea plants. Intriguingly, the dynamics of the metabolic response are highly distinct from those reported for Arabidopsis, suggesting that the response to light stress is not conserved across plants. This study additionally provides new insights into the functional role of flavonoids in preventing photooxidative stress and may contribute to further improving tea quality through the control of light intensity.

AB  - Understanding protein structure requires studying its dynamics, which is critical to elucidating its functional role. Biophysical techniques have revolutionized this field over time, providing remarkable insights into structure-function relationships. Among these, Site-Directed Spin Labelling (SDSL) combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) is a powerful method delivering structural data at the residue level, irrespective of protein size or environment. Traditional nitroxide labels targeting cysteine residues face limitations when these residues are essential for protein structure or function. To address this, alternatives have been proposed as the use of non-canonical amino acids (ncaa) coupled with specific nitroxide labels. This study introduces 14N-HO-5223, a novel nitroxide label specific to the pAzPhe ncaa, along with its 15N-derivative. These labels were grafted at two sites of the model protein, the diflavin cytochrome P450 reductase. For comparative purpose, two already reported labels were also used. Continuous wave (cw) EPR spectroscopy confirmed the HO-5223 label as an effective reporter of protein dynamics. Additionally, Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) measurements provided distance distributions between the semi-quinone FMNH & sdot; state of the CPR and all nitroxide labels. These results expand the toolkit of the ncaa-nitroxide pairs, enabling EPR-based structural studies of proteins where cysteine modification is impractical, further advancing our ability to decode protein dynamics and function.

AB  - Plastics are widely used as packaging and engineering materials in feed processing, which leads to the potential contamination of plasticizers and microplastics (MPs) in animal feeds. In this study, the concentrations of two typical MPs, i.e., polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polycarbonate (PC), and seven phthalates (PAEs) as well as their corresponding monoester metabolites (mPAEs) in 45 pig feed samples in China were analyzed by mass spectrometers. Among PAEs, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were detected in all samples, and DEHP showed the highest concentrations of 8.26-2464 mu g/kg, which accounted for 65.6% of the total detected PAEs. PET MPs (<MDL-302 mu g/kg) were detected in 97.8% of samples. Meanwhile, mPAEs were also detected in feed samples with high detection rates but of much lower concentrations. A significantly positive correlation was observed between DEHP and PET MPs. This indicates that the sources of DEHP and MPs in feeds are homologous, mainly from processing and packaging. Besides, the significantly positive correlations between DBP/DEHP and mBP/mEHP indicated the degradation of PAEs to mPAEs during feed production and transportation. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of PAEs and PET MPs were 2.40-70.3 and 0.800-7.79 mu g/kg-bw-day, respectively. The results of this study provided new insight into the first evidence of the co-occurrence and risk of MPs, PAE, and mPAEs in pig feed.

AB  - Negative social interactions are harmful for animal health and welfare. It is increasingly important to employ a continuous and effective monitoring system for detecting and tracking individual animals in large-scale farms. Such a system can provide timely alarms for farmers to intervene when damaging behavior occurs. Deep learning combined with camera-based monitoring is currently arising in agriculture. In this work, deep neural networks are employed to assist individual pig detection and tracking, which enables further analyzing behavior at the individual pig level. First, three state-of-the-art deep learning-based Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods are investigated, namely Joint Detection and Embedding (JDE), FairMOT, and YOLOv5s with DeepSORT. All models facilitate automated and continuous individual detection and tracking. Second, weighted-association algorithms are proposed for each MOT method, in order to optimize the object re-identification (re-ID), and improve the individual animal-tracking performance, especially for reducing the number of identity switches. The proposed weighted-association methods are evaluated on a large manually annotated pig dataset, and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. FairMOT with the proposed weighted association achieves the highest IDF1, the least number of identity switches, and the fastest execution rate. YOLOv5s with DeepSORT results in the highest MOTA and MOTP tracking metrics. These methods show high accuracy and robustness for individual pig tracking, and are promising candidates for continuous multi-object tracking for real use in commercial farms.

AB  - Recent discoveries pointed out the importance of the mutual correlation between timing of environmental stress and plant fitness. However, the internal reshaping of plant growth under daily stress sensing, and their metabolic coordination remain to be investigated. Thus, we studied the connection between time of day, growth and defence to understand how plant fitness is affected by diurnal stress inputs.We examined if simulated herbivory (leaf wounding) in the morning, at midday or the evening differentially influence plant defence state vs growth in three crop species of Brassica: broccoli (Brassica oleraceae), turnip greens (B. rapa) and rapeseed (B. napus).The data revealed that plant's tolerance of wounding stress is diurnally regulated in Brassica crops. Trade-offs between biomass and investment in glucosinolates (GSL) and phenolics were affected by timing of leaf stress. Negative correlations between biomass and induction of defence compounds were found for plants treeated in the morning and evening. However, the correlations were positive for midday treatment. Interestingly, we revealed a new connection between plant growth and changes in aliphatic GSLs and flavonoids in response to wounding.These data suggest that metabolic stress-dependent circadian oscillations in leaf defences could be one mechanism conferring a competitive advantage to plants to anticipate daily environmental variations by synchronizing them with growth. Moreover, this work provides first insights into how secondary metabolites are linked to growth response in a timing-related manner.

AB  - Estrogen is an important hormone that plays a role in regulating follicle development and oocyte maturation. Transzonal projections (TZPs) act as communication bridges between follicle somatic cells and oocytes, and their dynamic changes are critical for oocyte development and maturation. However, the roles and mechanisms of estrogen in regulating TZPs during follicular development are not yet understood. We found that the proportion of oocytes spontaneously resuming meiosis increases as the follicle grows, which is accompanied by rising estrogen levels in follicles and decreasing TZPs in cumulus-oocyte complex. To further explore the effect of elevated estrogen levels on TZP assembly, additional estrogen was added to the culture system. The increased estrogen level significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of TZP assembly-related genes. Subsequent research revealed that TZP regulation by estrogen was mediated by the membrane receptor GPER and downstream ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In summary, our study suggests that estrogen may regulate goat oocyte meiosis arrest by decreasing TZP numbers via estrogen-mediated GPER activation during follicle development.

AB  - Objective Our aim was to analyse the chromogranin A-derived peptides vasostatin and catestatin in serum from wild boar (Sus scrofa) captured in a corral trap. Acute capture-related stress quickly leads to a release of adrenalin and noradrenalin, but these hormones have a short half-life in blood and are difficult to measure. Chromogranin A (CgA), a glycoprotein which is co-released with noradrenalin and adrenalin, is relatively stable in circulation and the CgA-derived peptides catestatin and vasostatin have been measured in domestic species, but not yet in wildlife. Results Vasostatin and catestatin could be measured and the median (range) serum concentrations were 0.91 (0.54-2.86) and 0.65 (0.35-2.62) nmol/L, respectively. We conclude that the CgA-derived peptides vasostatin and catestatin can be measured in wild boar serum and may thus be useful as biomarkers of psychophysical stress.

AB  - Simple Summary The introduction of males to anovulatory females previously separated from males (or even without separation) can induce estrous activity within a few days; this is termed the "male effect". It is a common reproductive management practice on the extensive and semi-extensive goat farms of the Mediterranean area. High testosterone concentrations at the moment of the induction of the "male effect" are usually considered essential to obtain a high reproductive response from female goats. By controlling the secretion of GnRH, it is possible to control the gonadotropins and testosterone secretion. GnRH agonists have been used to control testosterone concentration in different species. Two experiments were carried out to determine if the contact during the seasonal anestrous of the males with the females modifies the testosterone concentrations and if the use of a GnRH agonist on the bucks to avoid variation in testosterone concentrations when the male effect is induced causes variation in the reproductive response of the does. Two experiments were carried out. Firstly, 54 anestrous females were placed in contact with photostimulated males (Photo; n = 27) or with no photostimulated males (Natural; n = 27). Moreover, a group of bucks treated with artificial photoperiod and a group of bucks subjected to natural photoperiod without contact with females was used (Photo Isolated and Natural Isolated, respectively). In the Natural groups, the testosterone concentrations were similar except for three days after the introduction of the bucks to the does (19.72 +/- 4.11 vs. 2.05 +/- 0.25 ng/mL for Natural and Natural isolated bucks, respectively, p < 0.05). However, no differences were observed in the Photo groups during the entire experiment. The percentage of females showing estrous was higher in the group of females in contact with photostimulated bucks (96 vs. 74%, respectively, p < 0.05). In the second experiment, a GnRH agonist, deslorelin, was used to regulate the testosterone concentrations of the bucks. Seventy anestrous females were divided into five groups depending on the treatment received by the bucks to which they were exposed: photostimulated bucks (Photo group, n = 14); photostimulated bucks but treated with the agonist at the onset of the photoperiod treatment (Photo-Ago Long group, n = 13); photostimulated bucks but treated with the agonist at the end of the photoperiod treatment (Photo-Ago Short group, n = 15); bucks receiving no photostimulation but treated with the agonist at the end of the photoperiod treatment period (Natural-Ago Short group, n = 13) and bucks receiving no photostimulation nor agonist (Natural group, n = 15). The agonist treatment increased testosterone concentrations after the injection, which remained high for the entire experiment (p < 0.05). Six days after the introduction of the bucks to the does, the testosterone concentrations increased only in the Natural group reaching similar concentrations to the other groups (12.17 +/- 6.55, 16.69 +/- 4.53, 8.70 +/- 0.61, 11.03 +/- 1.45 and 14.42 +/- 3.64 ng/mL for Photo, Photo-Ago Long, Photo-Ago Short, Natural-Ago Short and Natural bucks, respectively, p > 0.05). No differences in reproductive parameters were observed (p > 0.05). These results demonstrate that, at Mediterranean latitudes, anestrous females can stimulate the testosterone concentrations of bucks after a period of isolation. The high testosterone concentrations are not a prerequisite for an adequate response to the male effect.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the transgenerationaleffects oftributyltin exposure on rat neurodevelopment in male offspring andthe potential mechanisms. Neonatal female rats were exposed to theenvironmental level of tributyltin and then mated with nonexposedmales after sexual maturity to produce the F1 generation. The F1 generation(with primordial germ cell exposure) was mated with nonexposed malesto produce nonexposed offspring (the F2 and F3 generations). Neurodevelopmentalindicators and behavior were observed for the F1, F2, and F3 generationsduring postnatal days 1-25 and 35-56, respectively.We found premature eye-opening and delayed visual positioning in newbornF1 rats and anxiety and cognitive deficits in prepubertal F1 malerats. These neurodevelopmental impacts were also observed in F2 andF3 males. Additionally, F1-F3 males exhibited increased serotoninand dopamine levels and a loose arrangement of neurons in the hippocampus.We also observed a reduction in the expression of genes involved inintercellular adhesion and increased DNA methylation of the Dsc3 promoter in F1-F3 males. We concluded that tributyltinexposure led to transgenerational effects on neurodevelopment viaepigenetic reprogramming in male offspring. These findings provideinsights into the risks of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspringfrom parents exposed to tributyltin.
   Tributyltinexposure in rats increased the risk of neurodevelopmentaldisorders in male offspring over at least three generations.

AB  - Simple Summary The investigation of insect attachment ability in relation to plant mechanical barriers can shed light on the different steps driving host plant selection in phytophagous insects and help to better understand the complex antagonistic coevolution between insects and plants. In this context, we investigated the attachment ability of the oligophagous melon ladybird beetle Chnootriba elaterii at different developmental stages (adult, larva, eggs) to leaves of several Cucurbitaceae species (watermelon, melon, cucumber, zucchini, pumpkin, squirting cucumber, calabash and loofah) characterized by the presence of glandular and non-glandular trichomes with different characteristics (density, length). We used different techniques (scanning electron microscopy, traction force experiments and centrifugal force tests) to characterize the plant leaf surface and insect attachment devices and measure insect attachment ability to the leaf of the different plant species. Data regarding morphological leaf traits of Cucurbitaceae associated with their resistance against phytophagous insects, combined with data regarding the chemical cues involved in the host plant selection, can help to develop environmentally friendly pest control methods. This study investigates the attachment ability of the oligophagous melon ladybird beetle Chnootriba elaterii to leaves of several Cucurbitaceae species. Using cryo-SEM, we described adult and larva tarsal attachment devices and leaf surface structures (glandular and non-glandular trichomes) in Citrullus lanatus, Cucumis melo, Cucumis sativus, Cucurbita moschata, Cucurbita pepo, Ecballium elaterium, Lagenaria siceraria and Luffa aegyptiaca. Using traction force experiments and centrifugal force tests, we measured the friction force exerted by females and larvae on plant leaves. We observed that Cucurbitaceae glandular trichomes do not affect insect attachment ability at both developmental stages, suggesting some adaptation of C. elaterii to its host plants, while non-glandular trichomes, when they are dense, short and flexible, heavily reduce the attachment ability of both insect stages. When trichomes are dense but stiff, only the larval force is reduced, probably because the larva has a single claw, in contrast to the adult having paired bifid dentate claws. The data on the mechanical interaction of C. elaterii at different developmental stages with different Cucurbitaceae species, combined with data on the chemical cues involved in the host plant selection, can help to unravel the complex factors driving the coevolution between an oligophagous insect and its host plant species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fibers with varying physicochemical properties have different fermentation characteristics, which may differently impact host health. The present study aimed to determine the fermentation characteristics including gas production kinetics, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and microbial composition of different fibrous ingredients using in vitro fermentation by fecal microbiota. RESULTS: Sugar beet pule (SBP), wheat bran (WB), dried corn distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), rice bran (RB) and alfalfa meal (AM) were selected to fermentation in vitro for 36 h. The results showed that SBP had the greatest gas production. SBP had the highest in vitro dry matter fermentability (IVDMF) and production of acetate, propionate and total SCFAs, followed by WB, which were all greater than DDGS, AM and RB. The alpha-diversity was higher in the DDGS, AM and RB groups than in the WB and SBP groups. Differences in microbial community composition were observed among groups. The relative abundance of Treponema was highest in WB group. RB group showed lower Prevotella abundance than other groups but had higher Succinivibrio abundance. Interestingly, the Lactobacillus reached the highest abundances in the DDGS group. Correlation analysis indicated that the relative abundance of Treponema and Prevotella was positively associated with the gas production, IVDMF and SCFAs, whereas norank_f_Muribaculaceae, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Lysinibacillus and Succinivibrio were the opposite. CONCLUSION: Collectively, WB and SBP were fermented rapidly by fecal microbiota compared to DDGS, AM and RB. Different fiber sources have different fiber compositions and fermentation properties that affect the microbial compositins and SCFAs production. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - An underlying assumption of optimal foraging models is that animals are behaviorally, morphologically, and physiologically adapted to maximize their net energy intake. Here we explored whether this concept applies to web-building spiders in a multi-trophic context. If a spider were to build her web next to herbivore-fed-on plants that signal the herbivores' enemies for help by emitting herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), that spider may maximize web captures in the short term. However, she would also risk predation by generalist predators that "listen" to signaling plants to find both herbivore and spider prey, likely resulting in lower overall reproductive fitness for the spider. We tested the hypothesis that HIPVs trigger avoidance responses by web-building spiders. We selected seven common HIPVs and one HIPV elicitor, and in two-choice olfactometer bioassays tested their effect on four synanthropic spider species (false black widow, Steatoda grossa; common cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides; hobo spider, Eratigena agrestis; western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus). The 8-component HIPV/HIPV elicitor blend had a weak deterrent effect on S. grossa, but the effect did not extend to P. phalangioides, E. agrestis, and L. hesperus. Our findings imply that there was insufficient selection pressure for these spiders to recognize HIPVs in a multi-trophic context, where spiders themselves could become prey if generalist predators or spider-hunting parasitoid wasps were to respond to signaling plants.

AB  - Encapsulation is a strategy that has been used to facilitate the delivery and increase the stability of proteins and viruses. Here, we investigate the encapsulation of viruses via complex coacervation, which is a liquid-liquid phase separation resulting from the complexation of oppositely charged polymers. In particular, we utilized polypeptide-based coacervates and explored the effects of peptide chemistry, chain length, charge patterning, and hydrophobicity to better understand the effects of the coacervating polypeptides on virus incorporation. Our study utilized two nonenveloped viruses, porcine parvovirus (PPV) and human rhinovirus (HRV). PPV has a higher charge density than HRV, and they both appear to be relatively hydrophobic. These viruses were compared to characterize how the charge, hydrophobicity, and patterning of chemistry on the surface of the virus capsid affects encapsulation. Consistent with the electrostatic nature of complex coacervation, our results suggest that electrostatic effects associated with the net charge of both the virus and polypeptide dominated the potential for incorporating the virus into a coacervate, with clustering of charges also playing a significant role. Additionally, the hydrophobicity of a virus appears to determine the degree to which increasing the hydrophobicity of the coacervating peptides can enhance virus uptake. Nonintuitive trends in uptake were observed with regard to both charge patterning and polypeptide chain length, with these parameters having a significant effect on the range of coacervate compositions over which virus incorporation was observed. These results provide insights into biophysical mechanisms, where sequence effects can control the uptake of proteins or viruses into biological condensates and provide insights for use in formulation strategies.

AB  - In this study, aims were to evaluate orexin A (OXA) effects on mRNA abundance of important enzymes involved in prostaglandin production, such as cyclooxygenase 2 (PTGS2), microsomal PGE(2) synthase-1 (PTGES), PGF(2 alpha) synthase (PGFS) and carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) and F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) culture medium concentrations for endometrial and myometrial explants. Tissues were collected from gilts during specific phases of the estrogenic cycle or early gestational period. There were greater concentrations of PGE2 with OXA treatments of endometrial tissues collected on days 12-13 and 27-28, as well as PGF(2 alpha) on days 10-11 of the gestational period. The PGF(2 alpha) concentrations were less in tissues collected on days 27-28 of the gestational period. The OXA treatments resulted in lesser concentrations of PGE(2) from myometrial tissues collected on days 10-11 and greater PGF(2 alpha) on days 10-11 of the gestational period and 10-11 of the estrogenic cycle. Effects of OXA may occur due to actions at PTGS2, PTGES, PGFS and CBR1 genes because mRNA abundances for proteins encoded by these genes were affected by OXA. Results indicate there is an OXA effect on mRNA abundances and prostaglandin culture medium concentrations of uterine tissue collected at different stages of the gestational period or estrogenic cycle using different doses of OXA. It, therefore, is concluded OXA may affect de novo synthesis and secretion of PGE2 and PGF(2 alpha) in the uterus of pigs.

AB  - When the book Wild mammals of Myanmar (Tun Yin 1993) was published, a total of 252 mammal species were reported. Since that publication, numerous new species have been described, taxonomic revisions published, and additional distribution records produced that have expanded Myanmar's mammals considerably. Therefore, we aimed to provide an updated checklist of the mammals of Myanmar, which includes the scientific and common names, global and Myanmar distributions, remarks on taxonomy, and conservation information including the IUCN Red List status and legal protection status under The Conservation of Biodiversity and Protected Areas Law 2018 of Myanmar. Our new checklist includes 365 (33 marine and 332 terrestrial) mammal species belonging to 13 orders and 49 families. We also confirmed that Myanmar is home to at least nine endemic mammal species. Our results highlight the areas that require further exploration to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Myanmar's diverse fauna.

AB  - Both oocyte secretory factors (OSFs) and estrogen are essential for the development and function of mammalian ovarian follicles, playing synergistic role in regulating oocyte growth. OSFs can significantly affect the biological processes regulated by estrogen in cumulus cells (CCs). It is a scientific question worth investigating whether oocyte secretory factors can influence the expression of estrogen receptors in CCs. In our study, we observed a significant increase in the mRNA and protein expressions of estrogen receptor beta (Esr2/ER beta) and G-proteincoupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in cumulus cells of goat cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) cultured in vitro for 6 h. Furthermore, the addition of 10 ng/mL growth-differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and 5 ng/mL bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) to the culture medium of goat COCs resulted in a significant increase in the expressions of ER beta and GPER in cumulus cells. To explore the mechanism further, we performed micromanipulation to remove oocyte contents and co-cultured the oocytectomized complexes (OOXs) with denuded oocytes (DOs) or GDF9/BMP15. The expressions of ER beta and GPER in the co-culture groups were significantly higher than those in the OOXs group, but there was no difference compared to the COCs group. Mechanistically, we found that SB431542 (inhibitor of GDF9 bioactivity), but not LDN193189 (inhibitor of BMP15 bioactivity), abolished the upregulation of ER beta and GPER in cumulus cells and the activation of Smad2/3 signaling. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the oocyte secretory factor GDF9 promotes the activation of Smad2/3 signaling in cumulus cells during goat COCs culture in vitro, and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 induces the expression of estrogen receptors ER beta and GPER in cumulus cells.

AB  - Simple Summary</p>
   Soybean meal is the principal component of the diets for fattener pigs; however, there is a constant need for alternative, inexpensive, preferably non-GMO (genetic modified organisms) protein sources in swine nutrition. Corn dried distillers' grains with solubles (cDDGS), by-products of ethanol and bioethanol production, are one such alternative. Due to their chemical composition, they cannot completely replace soybean meal; however, even relatively small additions of cDDGS may decrease the cost of feeding and increase profitability of pig production. In this study, the pigs were fed two different diets: control (cereal-soybean meal-based) or cDDGS (with soybean meal partially replaced with cDGGS). The growth performance as well as carcass and meat quality traits of fatteners fed cDGGS-containing diets did not differ from those of their respective controls. However, the addition of even 15% of cDDGS did result in lower production costs and increased the profitability of pig fattening.</p>
   The present study set out to determine the effects of incorporating cDDGS into starter, grower, and finisher diets (containing 5%, 10%, and 15% of cDDGS, respectively) on growth performance, carcass and meat quality, and cost effectiveness of pig fattening. Sixty-four pigs (mean body weight of 15.0 & PLUSMN; 2.1 kg) were divided into two groups (n = 32) and fed a control diet (cereal-soybean meal-based) or cDGGS-containing diets (with soybean meal partially replaced with cDDGS). Live weights of pigs as well as weight gains/daily weight gains across all fattening phases did not differ between the two groups of fattener pigs studied (p > 0.05). Addition of cDDGS decreased feed intake per pig during the grower (p < 0.05) and finisher (p < 0.01) phases, and, as a result, throughout the entire fattening period (254 vs. 245 kg for control and cDDGS groups, respectively; p < 0.01). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) for the entire fattening period was significantly less for cDDGS-fed fatteners (2.77) than for controls (2.91; p < 0.05). Carcass weights, fat thickness, and meatiness did not vary between the two groups of animals (p > 0.05). Loin depth was greater in the cDDGS group by ~5 mm (p < 0.05). Slaughter value was higher for the cDDGS group (76.1% vs. 77.0%, p < 0.05). The total cost of fattening and total cost of 1 kg of body weight decreased in cDDGS compared with the control subset of fatteners by ~7% and 8% during the grower and finisher phases, respectively (p < 0.01). The simplified direct surplus per pig was approximately 63% higher for the cDDGS group. Our results indicate that even moderate inclusion of cDDGS to concentrate mixtures (or a partial replacement of soybean meal with cDDGS) may improve FCR without any substantial changes in meat and back fat characteristics as well as significantly decrease the cost of feeding and increase the profitability of pig production.</p>

AB  - Climate change is driving an alarming increase in the frequency and intensity of abiotic and biotic stress factors, negatively impacting plant development and agricultural productivity. To survive, plants respond by inducing changes in below and aboveground metabolism with concomitant alterations in defensive secondary metabolites. While plant responses to the isolated stresses of flooding and insect herbivory have been extensively studied, much less is known about their response in combination. Wild relatives of cultivated plants with robust stress tolerance traits provide an excellent system for comparing how diverse plant species respond to combinatorial stress, and provide insight into potential germplasms for stress-tolerant hybrids. In this study, we compared the below and aboveground changes in the secondary metabolites of maize (Zea mays) and a flood-tolerant wild relative Nicaraguan teosinte (Zea nicaraguensis) in response to flooding, insect herbivory, and their combination. Root tissue was analyzed for changes in belowground metabolism. Leaf total phenolic content and headspace volatile organic compound emission were analyzed for changes in aboveground secondary metabolism. Results revealed significant differences in the root metabolome profiles of teosinte and maize. Notably, the accumulation of the flavonoids apigenin, naringenin, and luteolin during flooding and herbivory differentiated teosinte from maize. Aboveground, terpenes, including trans-alpha-bergamotene and (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene, shaped compositional differences in their volatile profiles between flooding, herbivory, and their combination. Taken together, these results suggest teosinte may be more tolerant than maize due to dynamic metabolic changes during flooding and herbivory that help relieve stress and influence plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary: Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum (Mcc) is an important pathogen associated with diseases in goats, hindering the development of the livestock industry. We previously isolated the HN-B strain of Mcc from goats on Hainan Island, China. The genomic and biological characteristics of this strain were investigated. In this study, we infected mice and RAW264.7 cells with Mcc HN-B to explore its pathogenic mechanism in the host. Differentially expressed genes related to immune terms and pathways were identified using bioinformatic analyses. The expression of two inflammatory proteins, S100A8 and S100A9, was up-regulated in mouse lungs post Mcc HN-B infection. This study preliminarily elucidates the pathogenesis of Mcc in mice and paves the way for further research in goats. Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum (Mcc), a member of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster, has a negative impact on the goat-breeding industry. However, little is known about the pathogenic mechanism of Mcc. This study infected mice using a previously isolated strain, Mcc HN-B. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analyses, RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed on mouse lung tissues. The results showed that 235 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggested that the DEGs were mainly associated with immune response, defensive response to bacteria, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and T cell receptor signaling pathway. RT-qPCR verified the expression of Ccl5, Cd4, Cd28, Il2rb, Lck, Lat, Ptgs2, S100a8, S100a9, and Il-33. The up-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 at the protein level was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, RT-qPCR assays on Mcc HN-B-infected RAW264.7 cells also showed that the expression of S100a8 and S100a9 was elevated. S100A8 and S100A9 not only have diagnostic value in Mcc infection but also hold great significance in clarifying the pathogenic mechanism of Mcc. This study preliminarily elucidates the mechanism of Mcc HN-B-induced lung injury and provides a theoretical basis for further research on Mcc-host interactions.

AB  - The utilization of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting has gained prominence as the primary source of illumination in recent years. Phosphors in glass (PiG) have become the most suitable fluorescent materials for LED lighting due to their low sintering temperature and simple preparation process. Most of the light sources used in daily life are Ce3+-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG:Ce3+) yellow phosphor, which cause the correlated color temperature (CCT) to be above 6000 K due to the lack of red emission, resulting in serious blue light pollution. Red phosphor is expensive at present, and the effect of introducing red component into glass is weak. In this experiment, we introduced Nd3+ into the glass of the 60P(2)O(5)-10B(2)O(3)-10ZnO-20SnO system, and then sintered the glass with YAG:Ce3+ phosphor to prepare PiG of Nd3+ glass mixed YAG:Ce (PiG:Nd3+). Under the excitation of 450 nm blue light, the correlated color temperature (CCT) of PiG:6 wt%Nd3+ decreased by 144 K and the color rendering index (CRI) increased by 4.9 compared with PiG:0 wt%Nd3+.

AB  - Nitrogen-rich materials such as poultry litter (PL) contributes to substantial N and C loss in the form of ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) during composting. Biochar can act as a sorbent of ammonia (NH3) and CO2 emission released during co-composting. Thus, co-composting poultry litter with rice husk biochar as a bulking agent is a good technique to mitigate NH3 volatilization and CO2 emission. A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of composting the mixtures of poultry litter with rice husk biochar at different ratios on NH3 and CO2 emissions. Four mixtures of poultry litter and rice husk biochar at different rate were composted at 0:1, 0.5:1, 1.3:1 and 2.3:1 ratio of rice husk biochar (RHB): poultry litter (PL) on a dry weight basis to achieve a suitable C/ N ratio of 15, 20, 25, and 30, respectively. The results show that composting poultry litter with rice husk biochar can accelerate the breakdown of organic matter, thereby shortening the thermophilic phase compared to com-posting using poultry litter alone. There was a significant reduction in the cumulative NH3 emissions, which accounted for 78.38%, 94.60%, and 97.30%, for each C/N ratio of 20, 25, and 30. The total nitrogen (TN) retained relative was 75.96%, 85.61%, 90.24%, and 87.89% for each C/N ratio of 15, 20, 25, and 30 at the completion of composting. Total carbon dioxide lost was 5.64%, 6.62%, 8.91%, and 14.54%, for each C/N ratio of 15, 20, 21, and 30. In addition, the total carbon (TC) retained were 66.60%, 72.56%, 77.39%, and 85.29% for 15, 20, 25, and 30 C/N ratios and shows significant difference as compared with the initial reading of TC of the compost mixtures. In conclusion, mixing and composting rice husk biochar in poultry litter with C/N ratio of 25 helps in reducing the NH3 volatilization and CO2 emissions, while reducing the overall operational costs of waste disposal by shortening the composting time alongside nitrogen conservation and carbon sequestration. In formulating the compost mixture with rice husk biochar, the contribution of C and N from the biochar can be neglected in the determination of C/N ratio to predict the rate of mineralization in the compost because biochar has characteristic of being quite inert and recalcitrant in nature.

AB  - Chemerin is an adipokine which is the product of the RARRES2 gene expressed mainly in adipose tissue. This hormone exerts biological effects via three metabotropic receptors: chemokine like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1), and C-C chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2). Chemerin exerts pleiotropic effects and participates in the regulation of many processes, such as blood pressure control, immune system regulation, inflammation, and angiogenesis. There is a growing body of evidence to indicate that chemerin is involved in the regulation of reproductive system functions. However, little is known about the regulation of chemerin system (chemerin and its receptors) expression. The authors hypothesized that steroid hormones affect the expression of the chemerin system in the uterus of do -mestic pigs. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of steroids, oestradiol (E2), and progesterone (P4), on the gene (qPCR) and protein (Western blot) expression of chemerin receptors, RARRES2 gene expression as well as chemerin secretion (ELISA) by endometrial slices during early pregnancy (days 10 to 11,12 to 13,15 to 16, and 27 to 28) and the mid-luteal phase of the oestrous cycle (days 10 to 11). Both steroid hormones modulated the expression of chemerin receptor genes and proteins, as well as the abundance of RARRES2 mRNA transcripts. The study also demonstrated that E2 increased chemerin protein secretion by endometrial cells during the maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 12 to 13) and decreased its release during embryo implantation (days 15 to 16). P4 had no sig-nificant effect on chemerin levels during the studied periods of gestation and the oestrous cycle. These observations suggest that the effects of E2 and P4 on the chemerin system are dependent on the period of gestation or the oestrous cycle. Our results support the hypothesis that the hormonal environment could modulate the expression of the chemerin system in the endometrium.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Sahel/Savannah belt harbors diverse populations with different demographic histories and different subsistence patterns. However, populations from this large African region are notably under-represented in genomic research. To investigate the population structure and adaptation history of populations from the Sahel/Savannah space, we generated dense genome-wide genotype data of 327 individuals-comprising 14 ethnolinguistic groups, including 10 previously unsampled populations. Our results highlight fine-scale population structure and complex patterns of admixture, particularly in Fulani groups and Arabic-speaking populations. Among all studied Sahelian populations, only the Rashaayda Arabic-speaking population from eastern Sudan shows a lack of gene flow from African groups, which is consistent with the short history of this population in the African continent. They are recent migrants from Saudi Arabia with evidence of strong genetic isolation during the last few generations and a strong demographic bottleneck. This population also presents a strong selection signal in a genomic region around the CNR1 gene associated with substance dependence and chronic stress. In Western Sahelian populations, signatures of selection were detected in several other genetic regions, including pathways associated with lactase persistence, immune response, and malaria resistance. Taken together, these findings refine our current knowledge of genetic diversity, population structure, migration, admixture and adaptation of human populations in the Sahel/Savannah belt and contribute to our understanding of human history and health.

AB  - Microbial nitrogen and sulfur metabolism release foul gases (NH3 and H2S) during manure composting, which causes environmental pollution and element loss. The synergistic reduction of NH3 and H2S emissions is of great significance. However, it is yet unclear whether NH3 and H2S generation are relevant and co-regulable during composting. Therefore, this study supplemented available nitrate (N) and nitrate + cysteine lyase inhibitor (NI) to explore their effects on foul gases emission. Compared to CK composting, H2S cumulative release reduced by 55.05 % and 62.27 % during N and NI composting, respectively, and NH3 cumulative release reduced by 61.86 % and 59.55 %. Additionally, the fitted curves results suggested that nitrate supplementation enhanced the correlations between microbial nitrate reduction, sulfate reduction and oxidation. Therefore, this study revealed that there was an intrinsic relationship between NH3 and H2S generation during composting, and the regulation of microbial structure and metabolism contributed to the co-reduction of foul gases.

AB  - Background/Objectives: The backfat thickness of pigs is closely related to dorsal subcutaneous fat deposition and meat quality, and appropriate reduction in backfat thickness is important for improving pork quality. The present study investigated the effect of acorn diet on the backfat thickness and lipase activity of Yuxi black pigs and to gain further insight into the molecular mechanism of the acorn diet on the dorsal subcutaneous fat deposition of Yuxi black pigs by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Methods: Thirty-six Yuxi black pigs with an initial body weight of 99.60 +/- 2.32 kg (three replicates per group and six pigs per replicate) were randomly divided into two groups (CON group was fed a basic diet and AEG group was fed 30% acorn diets). Pigs were individually fed twice daily and had access to water ad libitum throughout the experiment. The test period was 4 months. Results: Results showed that backfat thickness and ACC, MDH, and LPL lipase activities were significantly reduced in the AEG group than in the CON group (p < 0.05). In addition, RNA-seq identified 826 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 505 up-regulated and 321 down-regulated. The DEGs were significantly enriched in the lipid metabolism process and lipid catabolic process, fatty acid (FA) catabolic process, and FA beta-oxidation according to GO enrichment analysis. LEP, CHPT1, UCP3, ACOX1, SCD5, and ACAA1 were screened as key differential genes regulating dorsal subcutaneous fat deposition. Conclusions: The above results indicated that feeding the 30% acorn diet could regulate the expression of genes involved in fat deposition and reduce lipase activity, thereby decreasing the backfat thickness, inhibiting the deposition of dorsal subcutaneous fat, and improving the pork quality. The findings of this experiment established a basis for subsequent research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of acorn diets on fat deposition in Yuxi black pigs and provided the scientific evidence to promote the exploitation and industrialization of acorns.

AB  - China's African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks, which started in 2018, severely damaged the country's pig and sow herds and created serious pork supply shortages. This resulted in high domestic market prices and record amounts of imports in both 2019 and 2020, but also severely impacted its domestic consumers. It casts doubts on whether China's long-standing self-sufficiency strategy, including its recently communicated 95% self-sufficiency target, can be sustained. Recent data, however, suggest that China is experiencing a rapid recovery in pig production, leading to depressed domestic market prices. This study characterizes the recovery process and analyzes the underlying drivers, such as active responses to the ASF outbreaks, a multiple-prong government initiative towards supporting the pig producers, de facto relaxations of newly introduced environmental regulations, large increases in domestic investment, and a reorganization of the pig sector, featuring more scale operations. However, the rapid recovery has also resulted in decreasing prices, economic losses of producers, and dampened export opportunities for China's trade partners. This paper, therefore, also analyzes these unintended consequences and explores supply-side measures that may enable the long-run viability of the self-sufficiency goal in the presence of high dependency on imported feed. Through a model-based numerical simulation analysis, we find that supply-side measures, such as yield improvement, can substantially reduce reliance on import feed but can only increase domestic pork production marginally, while technical efficiency improvement in pork production has the largest potential in boosting domestic pork production.

AB  - Bisphenol AF (BPAF), a BPA-substitute, has been widely used in industrial compounds throughout the world. Several studies have shown that BPAF has endocrine interference and reproductive toxicity. However, the toxic effects of BPAF on pregnancy and placenta of goats are still unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to reveal the toxic effect of BPAF by using an in vitro culture model of caprine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and further attempted to alleviate the toxicity by curcumin pretreatment. The results showed that BPAF induces significant effects on EECs, including decreased cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential (o & psi;m), elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting cell apoptosis through upregulating the expression of Bax, Cytochrome c, and downregulating the expression of Bcl-2. Meanwhile, BPAF induced dysregulation of oxidative stress by increasing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) but decreasing the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD). However, curcumin pretreatment could significantly attenuate BPAF-induced toxic effects in EECs. Further study revealed that BPAF treatment could activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression, but curcumin pretreatment significantly inhibited the activation of MAPK signal pathway and Nrf2 expression induced by BPAF. Overall, this study indicated that curcumin could prevent BPAF-induced EECs cytotoxicity, which provides a potential therapeutic strategy for female infertility associated with BPAF exposure.

AB  - Simple Summary Butter consumption has grown in recent years in Europe, and for some time now, a wide range of butters have been available on the market with a marked variability, due either to the species of origin or the manufacturing process. Applying the same analytical techniques to all, we assessed the quality of commercial butters available on the market in southern Spain. Differences were detected in nutritional value and technological parameters, many of which were linked to sensory quality. This information could be useful for the industry to learn more about the quality of each type of butter and to better promote the product.Abstract Butter is an important product for the dairy industry due to its particular sensory attributes and nutritional value, while the variability of the composition of the fatty acids in the milk can alter the nutritional and physical properties of butter and its acceptance by consumers. Butter is highly appreciated for its distinctive flavor and aroma; however, one of its main drawbacks lies in the difficulty in spreading it at low temperatures. Several types of butter that are present in the market were used in this study. We assessed the variability in the composition of the samples regarding their texture, color properties, and volatile organic compound profiles. We analyzed samples commercially produced from sheep's milk (SB), goat's milk (GB), and cow's milk (CB); samples from the latter species with (CSB) and without salt (CB); and the low-fat (CLB) version. All the physicochemical composition parameters were significantly affected by the effect of the type of butter, although only 29 out of the 45 fatty acids examined were identified in the butter samples analyzed. The textural properties of the butters were influenced by both their solid fat content and the fatty acid profile. In addition, the origin of the milk not only affected the texture parameters but also the color of the butters and the compounds associated with traits such as odor and flavor. Through the multivariate data analysis of butter fatty acids and volatile compound percentages, we observed a clear differentiation of the samples based on the species of origin.

AB  - PremiseQuantifying how closely related plant species differ in susceptibility to insect herbivory is important for understanding the variation in evolutionary pressures on plant functional traits. However, empirically measuring in situ variation in herbivory spanning the geographic range of a plant-insect complex is logistically difficult. Recently, new methods have been developed using herbarium specimens to investigate patterns in plant-insect symbioses across large geographic scales. Such investigations provide insights into how accelerated anthropogenic changes may impact plant-insect interactions that are of ecological or agricultural importance. MethodsHere, we analyze 274 pressed herbarium samples to investigate variation in herbivory damage in 13 different species of the economically important plant genus Cucurbita (Cucurbitaceae). This collection is composed of specimens of wild, undomesticated Cucurbita that were collected from across their native range, and Cucurbita cultivars collected from both within their native range and from locations where they have been introduced for agriculture in temperate North America. ResultsHerbivory is common on individuals of all Cucurbita species collected throughout their geographic ranges. However, estimates of herbivory varied considerably among individuals, with mesophytic species accruing more insect damage than xerophytic species, and wild specimens having more herbivory than specimens collected from human-managed habitats. ConclusionsOur study suggests that long-term evolutionary changes in habitat from xeric to mesic climates and wild to human-managed habitats may mediate the levels of herbivory pressure from coevolved herbivores. Future investigations into the potential factors that contribute to herbivory may inform the management of domesticated crop plants and their insect herbivores.

AB  - In today's world, eco-friendly solutions are crucial for efficient power delivery and assessing their corresponding economic and environmental benefits is essential. As innovators, it is also imperative to continually improve on existing techniques to solve a problem. Evaluating the existing literature in this area of study, gaps of improving the optimization techniques by reducing the amount of infeasible configurations the reconfiguration procedure encounters was established, additionally, the need to utilize distributed generations that significantly reduce carbon footprint in the environment was also ascertained. Hence, this paper presents an effective integration method for the simultaneous reconfiguration of Radial Distribution Networks (RDNs) and Photovoltaic (PV) DGs allocation, considering the tripodal issues of cost, operational efficiency, and environmental sustainability. A modification of the adaptive mountain gazelle optimizer (AMGO) enhanced with graph theory is deployed for the optimization procedures. The crucial feature of the proposed approach is the reduction of unfeasible configurations throughout the optimization procedure toward satisfying the network's radiality constraints, achieving consistent convergence and reduced computation time. The technical benefits are active power loss minimization, voltage stability, and voltage profile improvement. The economic benefits are analyzed by estimating the purchased power, the associated cost of power losses, and the cost of DGs and switches over a planning period of 20 years. The consequent environmental benefits are analyzed in detail, highlighting the significant reduction in pollutant emissions. The proposed model was tested on the IEEE 33- and 69-bus RDN, considering several scenarios, including synchronous network reconfiguration and DG installations. From the results procured, the simultaneous network reconfiguration and DG allocation provided better outcomes, yielding minimum active power loss of 35.36 kW, minimum voltage of 0.9541 p.u., voltage stability index of 1.9936 p.u., total planning cost of $3.456 million, and emission of 1.744 million lb/hr, respectively, for the 33-bus systems. The corresponding value for the 69-bus system is 32.57 kW, 0.9832 p.u., 2.3847 p.u., $ 2.524 million, and 2.53 million lb/ hr, respectively. The proposed model was compared with other reported techniques for performance validation, and its efficacy and superior performance was established.

AB  - The effects of early supplementation with oat beta-glucan during the suckling period on piglet gut microbiota composition, concentrations of short-chain fatty acids, and gut physiological markers were assessed. Fifty piglets from five litters, balanced for sex and birth weight, were divided within litters into two treatment groups: beta-glucan and control. Piglets in the beta-glucan group received the supplement three times/week from day 7 of age until weaning. Rectal swab samples were collected from 10 piglets per treatment group (balanced across litters) from week 1 to week 4, and plasma samples were collected at 1, 3, and 4 weeks of age. Additional samples of intestinal tissues and jugular and portal vein plasma were collected from 10 animals at weaning (one per treatment group and litter). The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in plasma and the microbiota composition in rectal swabs were mainly influenced by piglet age, rather than the supplement. There were significant differences in microbiota composition between litters and several correlations between concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in plasma and specific microbial taxa in rectal swabs. Overall, beta-glucan supplementation did not have any clear impact on the gut environment in suckling piglets, whereas a clear age-related pattern emerged.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 1 mu mol/L zearalenone (ZEN) and 1 mu mol/L enter-olactone (ENL), alone or in combination, on the survival and morphology of in vitro cultured ovarian preantral follicles. Ovaries from 10 sheep were collected at a local abattoir and fragmented, and the ovarian pieces were submitted to in vitro culture for 3 days in the presence or absence of the test compounds. The morphology of primordial and primary follicles was impaired by ZEN, whereas that of cultured secondary follicles was improved by ENL. However, the combination of ENL with ZEN impaired the quality of primary and secondary follicles. Both ZEN and ENL induced apoptosis, but only ZEN was responsible for oocyte autophagy. None of these xenoestrogens affected endoplasmic reticulum stress as observed by the unaltered expression of ERP29. Differently from ZEN, ENL increased the expression of the efflux transporter ABCG2. In conclusion, although ENL can counteract the negative effects of ZEN on primordial and primary follicles, this positive effect is not similar to that observed in ovarian tissue cultures in the presence of ENL alone.

AB  - Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer substitution (NSS) with different types of organic material is a cleaner agricultural practice for reducing the application of synthetic N input in farmlands while also relieving the environmental issues caused by the discharge of organic wastes. However, the effects of the NSS practice on crop yields, being the primary objective of agricultural activity, is still uncertain in China. This study conducted a meta-analysis to assess the impacts of the NSS practices with different types of organic materials on crop yields. Results showed that the average crop yield was increased by 3.4%, with significant differences under NSS, thereby demonstrating that this practice contributed to improving crop yields, especially of rice and maize. According to published reports, the NSS practices involving chicken manure, pig manure, and crop straw increased crop yields by 4.79, 7.68, and 3.28%, respectively, with significant differences, thus demonstrating the superior effects needed for replacing synthetic N fertilizer. Moreover, substitution ratios (SR) between 0% and 60% could be suggested when using the NSS practice, with the high SR recommended when the original soil fertility was adequate for crops. Considering the long-term effects of applied organic materials, improving the grain yield with the NSS practice should be expected in the long-term. By effectively applying the NSS, this study attempted to scientifically decide on the type of organic materials and the appropriate SR based on the conditions of the soil and the crop. The results provide research information for the development of clean agricultural production and food security in China.

AB  - The boxwood moth, Cydalima perspectalis Walker (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), as invasive specialist species in Iran has caused considerable damage in endemic forest stands of Buxus hyrcana Pojark since 2016. Host plant species can alter herbivore-plant interactions through the quantitative and qualitative changes of hemocytes even within a specialist herbivore. To determine the hemocyte variations on different host plants across larval development, the third and sixth instar larvae of C. perspectalis fed on B. hyrcana (native boxwood) and B. microphylla Sieb. and Zucc. (introduced nonnative boxwood) were compared. Total (THC) and differential (DHC) hemocyte count were determined using light, phase-contrast, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Based on results, six types of hemocytes were recognized in hemolymph including prohemocytes (PRs), plasmatocytes (PLs), granulocytes (GRs), oenocytoides (OEs) and spherulocytes (SPs) as well as unknown elongated quadrangular cells (elongocytes [ELs], the term has been first employed here) with obvious and distinguishable nuclei which were observed by the SEM and TEM microscopy. The ELs were rectangular or trapezoidal in shape, and the largest cells in hemolymph-their length varied from 14.00 to 15.73 mu m. Our results showed that the total number of hemocytes (THC) significantly increased across larval development. Moreover, host plant species significantly affected total hemocyte count where the THC of sixth instar larvae on B. microphylla (2561.00 +/- 10.60 cell/mm3) was significantly higher than on B. hyrcana (2440.00 +/- 51.50 cell/mm3). The differential hemocyte count (DHC) profile study showed that GRs along with PLs were the most abundant cells in the hemolymph irrespective of larval instar and host plant species. Furthermore, the GRs% and ELs% increased throughout the larval development on both host plants, while a significant reduction of PLs% was recorded from third instar to sixth instar during the larval stage on two Buxus species. Apart from larval instar, host plant species had a significant effect on DHC of C. perspectalis. Despite higher total hemocyte number when fed on B. microphylla, the PLs% and ELs% were significantly higher in sixth-instar larvae fed on B. hyrcana compared with B. microphylla. Oppositely, the percentage of GRs was 17% less in larvae reared on B. hyrcana than on B. microphylla. As hemocyte types are responsible for different immune functions, these findings on instar- and host plant-dependent variation in their relative abundance would be critical to understand the immune response of this specialist herbivore.

AB  - Salvia (Lamiaceae), one of the largest plant genera, was not monophyletic as originally circumscribed. To recognize Salvia as a monophyletic genus, five small genera have been placed within Salvia s.l. including the monotypic genus Zhumeria. Little is known about the floral biology of Salvia majdae (syn. Z. majdae), an aromatic medicinal shrub species endemic to dry montane areas in the Hormozgan Province in southern Iran. Floral and ecological features of the species are provided as a basis for more detailed discussion about its taxonomic treatment and conservation. S. majdae produces flowers in the axils of the uppermost leaves as racemes. Unlike most Salvia species, flowers are weakly monosymmetric and lack the typical upper lip that usually hides the pollen-sacs. Each flower has four protruding stamens, the abaxial pair is always fertile, and the adaxial one is mostly sterile. Anthers are bithecate and immobile, the connective is slightly widened but not separating the thecae from each other as in most Salvia species. A staminal lever mechanism is lacking and, contrary to most Salvia flowers, pollen is ventrally transferred. Floral longevity is about three days. Flowers are protandrous on the first day and present both pollen and receptive stigmas on the second day. Controlled pollination experiments confirm self-compatibility of the species. Butterflies, bees and flies visited flowers and were likely attracted by scent and the conspicuous, dark violet color of the flowers. Medium-sized bees (Anthophora spp.) are probably the main pollinators, but pollen transfer by bee flies and occasionally by butterflies cannot be excluded. A moderate pollen/ovule ratio (~2600:1), high pollen viability (~90%), relatively high fruit set (75%), and moderate seed set (51%) indicate that the species successfully reproduces sexually. Herbivores strongly contributed to reduced seed set as they destroyed parts of the reproductive organs. The presence of only few seedlings and young plants in the field suggests that environmental pressures are acting on the species demography. To protect the species, we recommend harvest reduction by local people, propagating the plant in nurseries for medicinal purposes, and restocking their natural habitat with young plants. Flower morphology of S. majdae differs considerably from those of its closest Salvia relatives. The species represents a number of plesiomorphic characters which may either represent the ancestral stage or a reversal evolved from a more derived Salvia flower. We discuss these alternatives pointing to the problems linked with the present taxonomic treatment of Salvia s.l.

AB  - Simple Summary One may think that the number of pigs that can fit on a truck is a simple scientific question. It is not. It is vitally important that scientists can describe their work simply and concisely to the public, especially when that work is providing the basis for regulation in the public interest. Successful regulation of human behavior requires the regulated to agree with the rule. Commercial livestock transporters have an interest in loading a livestock compartment to the maximum to minimize costs. Livestock production academics, veterinarians, and animal welfare activists have been working for decades to determine the level of livestock crowding in transport containers that would be an appropriate threshold for regulatory enforcement. To date, there is no real consensus on this issue across species or animal size within a species. The EU countries agreed to a maximum floor pressure for market pigs of around 110 kg body weight to be 235 kgm-2 in 2005, while North American regulators have no legal standard. Current practice in North America allows for significant crowding of pigs in excess of the EU standard. Using the pig as an example, this paper examines the practical barriers that have for decades prevented emergence of a consensus on the "Is this truck full?" question.Abstract This paper focuses on the problem of numeracy when writing regulations, specifically how to describe a threshold for crowding of pigs during transport, considering transported pigs range in body mass from 5 to 500 kg. When scientific findings provide the basis for regulation in the public interest, those findings must be communicated in a consistent way to regulators and policymaking bodies. Numeracy is the ability to understand, reason with, and apply appropriate numerical concepts to real-world questions. Scientific understanding is almost always based on rational understanding of numerical information, numeracy. The threshold of administrative offenses is often a numerical description. Commercial livestock transporters have an interest in loading livestock compartments to the maximum to achieve the largest payload allowed by axle weight laws, as is the case in all bulk commodity transport. Maximizing payload minimizes costs and environmental hazards of fuel exhaust and can benefit the public with lower pork prices, but has a serious animal welfare risk. Livestock production academics, veterinarians, and animal welfare activists have been working for decades to determine the level of livestock crowding in transport containers that would be appropriate for regulatory enforcement. The scientific discourse has been plagued by a lack of numerical standardization when describing results of trials and forming recommendations. Exceeding specific numerical thresholds is the core to implementing enforcement actions. This paper examines the communication and other barriers that have prevented emergence of a consensus on this question and provides a direction toward resolution. Further confirmation of effects of crowding livestock in transit is needed. This paper suggests that articulating an enforceable standard in pig transport is possible. In inspection for compliance, discovering the LP50 (lethal pressure-50) for slaughter-weight pigs is an initial global benchmark goal. The LP50 is the loading floor pressure in a commercial transport compartment, under field conditions, that would result in the death of at least one pig in the group 50% of the time.

AB  - Udder traits, influencing udder health and function, are positively correlated with lactation performance. Among them, breast texture influences heritability and impacts on the milk yield of cattle; however, there is a lack of systematic research on its underlying mechanism in dairy goats in particular. Here, we showed the structure of firm udders with developed connective tissue and smaller acini per lobule during lactation and confirmed that there were lower serum levels of estradiol (E-2) and progesterone (PROG), and higher mammary expression of estrogen nuclear receptor (ER) a and progesterone receptor (PR), in dairy goats with firm udders. The results of transcriptome sequencing of the mammary gland revealed that the downstream pathway of PR, the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) ligand (RANKL) signal, participated in the formation of firm mammary glands. During the culture of goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs), high RANKL level additions promote the Inhibitor kappaB (I?B)/p65/Cyclin D1 expression related to cell proliferation and decrease the phosphorylated signal transduction and transcription activator 5 (Stat5) expression related to milk-protein synthesis of GMECs, which is consistent with electron microscope results showing that there are fewer lactoprotein particles in the acinar cavity of a firm mammary. Furthermore, co-culturing with adipocyte-like cells for 7 d is beneficial for the acinar structure formation of GMECs, while there is a slightly negative effect of high RANKL level on it. In conclusion, the results of this study revealed the structure of firm udders structure and confirmed the serum hormone levels and their receptor expression in the mammary glands of dairy goats with firm udders. The underlying mechanism leading to firm udders and a decrease in milk yield were explored preliminarily, which provided an important foundation for the prevention and amelioration of firm udders and improving udder health and milk yield.

AB  - Many reports show that non-human animals have the ability to select foods based on their micronutrient composition. However, it is unclear whether humans also have this ability, and researchers have lacked appropriate methods to investigate this question. In response to this challenge, we developed an approach that derives evidence from patterns of choices across a range of food images. In two studies (Study 1, N = 45; Study 2, N = 83) adults selected one of two pairs of fruits and vegetables in a series of trials (N = 210). Consistent with variety seeking, they preferred 'varied' over 'monotonous' pairs (same-food pairs were less attractive). However, and even after controlling for explicit nutritional knowledge (Study 2) and food energy density (Study 1 and 2), we observed a significant tendency to select pairings that offered: i) greater total micronutrient intake and ii) greater 'micronutrient complementarity' (MC), i.e., a broader range of micronutrients. In a separate analysis, a similar pattern was observed in two-component meals (e.g., steak and fries) drawn from a large national nutrition survey in the UK (1086 records). Specifically, the MC of these meals was greater than would be predicted by chance (p < .0001) and when a meal provided an excess of micronutrients (>100% daily recommended amount) then this occurred less often than by chance (p < .0001), i.e., 'micronutrient redundancy' was avoided. Together, this work provides new evidence that micronutrient composition influences food choice (a form of 'nutritional wisdom') and it raises questions about whether nutritional requirements are otherwise met through dietary 'variety seeking'. In turn, it also exposes the potential for a complexity in human dietary decision making that has not been recognised previously.

AB  - Pig farming is recognized as an activity with great polluting potential. The aim was to investigate possible environmental risks of effluents from the stabilization pond (SP) and the raw effluent (RE) from the biodigestion process of swine residues, in different concentrations in the models Lactuca sativa and Allium cepa. Seeds were germinated in different dilutions, 100% (C1), 50% (C2), 25% (C3), 12.5% (C4), 6.25% (C5), 3.12% (C6), 0.78% (C7), and 0.39% (C8). Distilled water was used as the negative control (CN) and trifluralin (0.84 g/L-1) as the positive control. Germination (GR), root growth (RG), cell cycle, and oxidative stress (OS) were analyzed. To assess OS, the activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the quantification of glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were analyzed. Data were submitted to ANOVA (one way), followed by the Kruskal-Wallis mean test (P <= 0.05). Chemical analysis showed high values of Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn. Dilutions (C1, C2, C3 RE) and (C1 and C2 SP) inhibited GR and RG of L. sativa and A. cepa than other concentrations. The mitotic index showed a reduction in C5 (RE), C6, and C7 (SP) of L. sativa and C3 and C4 (SP) of A. cepa in relation to CN and higher frequencies of chromosomal alterations. Regarding the OS, only the concentrations of SP treatment showed statistical difference in relation to the NC: in L. sativa model, GSH at (C5 and C8) concentrations and LPO (C7); in A. cepa model, SOD (C3 and C4), GST (C4, C5 and C6), GSH (C5 and C8), and CAT (C3 and C7). The alterations in metabolism are possibly related to the metals, such as zinc and copper, observed in high amounts in the raw waste. The results allowed us to conclude that the raw and stabilization pond effluents offer environmental risks, requiring caution and monitoring in the use of these effluents.

AB  - Recent advances in higher-level invertebrate phylogeny have leveraged shared features of genomic architecture to resolve contentious nodes across the tree of life. Yet, the interordinal relationships within Chelicerata have remained recalcitrant given competing topologies in recent molecular analyses. As such, relationships between topologically unstable orders remain supported primarily by morphological cladistic analyses. Solifugae, one such unstable chelicerate order, has long been thought to be the sister group of Pseudoscorpiones, forming the clade Haplocnemata, on the basis of eight putative morphological synapomorphies. The discovery, however, of a shared whole genome duplication placing Pseudoscorpiones in Arachnopulmonata provides the opportunity for a simple litmus test evaluating the validity of Haplocnemata. Here, we present the first developmental transcriptome of a solifuge (Titanopuga salinarum) and survey copy numbers of the homeobox genes for evidence of systemic duplication. We find that over 70% of the identified homeobox genes in T. salinarum are retained in a single copy, while representatives of the arachnopulmonates retain orthologs of those genes as two or more copies. Our results refute the placement of Solifugae in Haplocnemata. Subsequent reevaluation of putative interordinal morphological synapomorphies among chelicerates reveals a high incidence of homoplasy, reversals, and inaccurate coding within Haplocnemata and other small clades, as well as Arachnida more broadly, suggesting existing morphological character matrices are insufficient to resolve chelicerate phylogeny.
   Developmental transcriptomic data support an unduplicated genome in a solifuge, disfavoring the traditional grouping of pseudoscorpions and camel spiders as Haplocnemata.image

AB  - Parasitic infections have the potential to impact the hosts' body condition, elevate physiological responses, and ultimately lead to increased mortality. Host-parasite interactions are tied to the ecological and life-history traits of the hosts. While montane birds are susceptible to avian blood parasites, few studies have simultaneously assessed how inter- and intra-specific traits of hosts influence their probability of parasite infection. In this study, we screened for avian blood parasites across 214 individuals from 51 species at two sites, including a lowland farmland at 700 m and a highland forest at 2,500 m, in the Gaoligong Mountains in southwestern China. Overall blood parasite prevalence was 53.74%, with divergent species-specific prevalence ranging from 6.25% to 66.67%. We also measured traits indicative of body condition and physiological responses of each sampled individual. Using Bayesian phylogenetic logistic models, we assessed whether parasite infection probability is associated with ecological and life history traits of host species. Larger bird species were more likely to be infected than smaller bird species, and omnivore species showed lower susceptibility than those with other diets such as insectivores and herbivores. In contrast, foraging strata, nest type, and participation in mixed-species flocks of host species did not affect infection probability. We then used a reduced sample of eight species with more than five individuals, to assess the associations between intra-specific infection probability and host body condition, represented by fat and muscle reserves, and acute stress responses measured through breath rate. While infected individuals were likely to have more fat reserves than non-infected individuals, we did not find any association between infection probability and muscle reserve and body mass, nor with breath rate. Our results revealed that at the species level, specific traits (body mass and diet) of host species predict infection probability and implied a potential link at the individual level between enhanced body condition and increased resilience to parasite infection.

AB  - Elephant trunk-inspired anisotropic wrinkling structures were formed on a sandwich-like conductive film through a controlled shrinking method.The wrinkled conductive network could withstand up to 200% tensile strain and exhibits a strain-enhanced electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness when stretching parallel to the electric field polarization direction.
   Nowadays, the increasing electromagnetic waves generated by wearable devices are becoming an emerging issue for human health, so stretchable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are highly demanded. Elephant trunks are capable of grabbing fragile vegetation and tearing trees thanks not only to their muscles but also to their folded skins. Inspired by the wrinkled skin of the elephant trunks, herein, we propose a winkled conductive film based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for multifunctional EMI applications. The conductive film has a sandwich structure, which was prepared by coating SWCNTs on both sides of the stretched elastic latex cylindrical substrate. The shrinking-induced winkled conductive network could withstand up to 200% tensile strain. Typically, when the stretching direction is parallel to the polarization direction of the electric field, the total EMI shielding effectiveness could surprisingly increase from 38.4 to 52.7 dB at 200% tensile strain. It is mainly contributed by the increased connection of the SWCNTs. In addition, the film also has good Joule heating performance at several voltages, capable of releasing pains in injured joints. This unique property makes it possible for strain-adjustable multifunctional EMI shielding and wearable thermotherapy applications.

AB  - Plants are often subjected to various stressors, such as changes in gravity, heavy rainfall, pathogens, wind, herbivory, and human activities, which can result in wounding. This study investigates the effect of various mechanical wounding methods and growth regulators on the survival and vegetative growth of Polygonatum cirrhifolium (Wall.) Royle over two years (2021-2022). In the first year (2021), we evaluated the effect of different wounding techniques, including cut, scrapes, punctures, and abrasions on rhizome to understand their impact on growth and survival. Non-wounded rhizomes (NWR) served as controls. Among different wounding methods, apical section from the whole rhizome (cut) showed superior growth performance (shoot length, increase in rhizome length and survival), when used for propagation. Hence, this was selected as a suitable method of propagation for further experiments. In the second year (2022), apical rhizome sections were treated with different auxins (IAA, IBA, NAA, and Rootex PD.01) and organic fertilizers derived from Quercus, Cedrus and Salix species. Notably, treatment with Rootex PD.01 (a commercial formulation of indole-3-butyric acid at 1000 mg kg-1) by powder application method and soil mixed with organic fertilizer (prepared from Salix alba) in ratio of 2:1, induced the maximum survival and vegetative growth of P. cirrhifolium. This study provides valuable insights into previously underexplored strategies, highlighting the effects of mechanical wounding and growth regulators on enhancing the vegetative propagation of P. cirrhifolium through rhizomes. The propagation method developed through this research can be applied for the mass multiplication and conservation of this endangered species.

AB  - Small and isolated populations face several intrinsic risks, such as genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and reduced gene flow. Thus, patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation have become an important focus of conservation genetics research. The golden snub-nosed monkey Rhinopithecus roxellana, an endangered species endemic to China, has experienced rapid reduction in population size and severe population fragmentation over the past few decades. We measured the patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation using both neutral microsatellites and adaptive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in 2 R. roxellana populations (DPY and GNG) distributed on the northern and southern slopes of the Qinling Mountains, respectively. Eight MHC-linked haplotypes formed by 5 DQA1 alleles, 5 DQB1 alleles, 5 DRB1 alleles, and 4 DRB2 alleles were detected in the 2 populations. The larger GNG population showed higher genetic variation for both MHC and microsatellites than the smaller DPY population, suggesting an effect of genetic drift on genetic variation. Genetic differentiation index (FST) outlier analyses, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), and inferred population genetic structure showed lower genetic differentiation in the MHC variations than microsatellites, suggesting that pathogen-mediated balancing selection, rather than local adaptation, homogenized the MHC genes of both populations. This study indicates that both balancing selection and genetic drift may shape genetic variation and differentiation in small and fragmented populations.

AB  - Gelatin from deer has garnered attention as a high-value health-promoting resource given its history of usage as a traditional Chinese medicine and recent studies demonstrating its biological activities. Mass spectrometry-based methods have increasingly been employed for species identification in collagen-based materials, effectively addressing challenges in quality control and authenticity verification. This study aims to identify characteristic marker peptides in gelatins from sika deer (Cervus nippon) to support their effective use as a health-promoting resource. Gelatin samples were enzymatically digested, and the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole Q-Exactive-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap MS). Marker peptide candidates were selected based on their high detection intensity and a literature review. Among the 28 selected marker peptide candidates, four peptides (P11, R2, R3, and R4) were defined as characteristic of sika deer gelatin. Comparative analyses with gelatins derived from donkey hide, bovine, porcine, and fish samples further confirmed the specificity of these peptides. These findings establish a robust analytical method for verifying the authenticity of sika deer gelatin, contributing to its safe and effective use as a health-promoting resource.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of different proportions of dead spermatozoa on the quality of liquid boar semen during a thermo-resistance test (TRT). After 3 days of storage (17 degrees C), 54 conventional artificial insemination semen doses (similar to 23 x 10(6) sperm/ml in similar to 88 ml of BTS) were split into three 15 ml-treatments (25%, 50%, and 75% dead sperm cells) by mixing two subsamples containing 75% (I) and 0% (II) of live cells. Spermatozoa were evaluated after TRT at 30 (on-test) and 300 min (off-test) incubation at 38 degrees C. At the on-test, treatments of 25%, 50%, and 75% dead sperm cells showed medians for total sperm motility of 77.6%, 50.2%, and 25.6%, respectively. Considering the absolute variation of sperm motility during TRT, doses with 25% dead sperm lost more percentage points (pp) (-9.4 pp) compared to doses containing 50% (-8.2 pp) and 75% dead sperm (-4.5 pp). The lowest loss was observed for doses with 75% dead sperm (p < .01). However, data showed that treatments lost similar proportion of motile cells over the TRT: 25% dead sperm = -11.9%, 50% dead sperm = -16.0%, and 75% dead sperm = -17.5% (p = .31). Regarding the flow cytometry parameters (plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity of cells with intact plasma membrane, high degree of lipid disorder, and apoptotic cells), the absolute variations did not surpass values of -1.8, 3.4, -5.4, and 4.7 pp, respectively. Furthermore, the relative variation suggested that dead sperm did not substantially change their values over the TRT. In conclusion, dead sperm cells did not influence the quality of contemporary live cells during the period and in conditions of a TRT.

AB  - The genus Camellia contains three types of domesticates that meet various needs of ancient humans: the ornamental C. japonica, the edible oil-producing C. oleifera, and the beverage-purposed tea plant C. sinensis. The genomic drivers of the functional diversification of Camellia domesticates remain unknown. Here, we present the genomic variations of 625 Camellia accessions based on a new genome assembly of C. sinensis var. assamica ('YK10'), which consists of 15 pseudo-chromosomes with a total length of 3.35 Gb and a contig N50 of 816,948 bp. These accessions were mainly distributed in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. We profiled the population and subpopulation structure in tea tree Camellia to find new evidence for the parallel domestication of C. sinensis var. assamica (CSA) and C. sinensis var. sinensis (CSS). We also identified candidate genes associated with traits differentiating CSA, CSS, oilseed Camellia, and ornamental Camellia cultivars. Our results provide a unique global view of the genetic diversification of Camellia domesticates and provide valuable resources for ongoing functional and molecular breeding research.

AB  - Parkinson disease protein 7 (PARK7) is a multifunctional protein known to be involved in the regulation of sperm motility, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress response in mammalian sperm. While ROS generation is needed to activate the downstream signaling pathways required for sperm to undergo capacitation, oxidative stress has detrimental effects for sperm cells and a precise balance between ROS levels and antioxidant activity is needed. Considering the putative antioxidant role of PARK7, the present work sought to determine whether this protein is related to the sperm ability to withstand in vitro capacitation. To this end, and using the pig as a model, semen samples were incubated in capacitation medium for 300 min; the acrosomal exocytosis was triggered by the addition of progesterone after 240 min of incubation. At each relevant time point (0, 120, 240, 250, and 300 min), sperm motility, acrosome and plasma membrane integrity, membrane lipid disorder, mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular calcium and ROS were evaluated. In addition, localization and protein levels of PARK7 were also assessed through immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Based on the relative content of PARK7, two groups of samples were set. As early as 120 min of incubation, sperm samples with larger PARK7 content showed higher percentages of viable and acrosome-intact sperm, lipid disorder and superoxide levels, and lower intracellular calcium levels when compared to sperm samples with lower PARK7. These data suggest that PARK7 could play a role in preventing sperm from undergoing premature capacitation, maintaining sperm viability and providing a better ability to keep ROS homeostasis, which is needed to elicit sperm capacitation. Further studies are required to elucidate the antioxidant properties of PARK7 during in vitro capacitation and acrosomal exocytosis of mammalian sperm, and the relationship between PARK7 and sperm motility.

AB  - The histological evaluation of skin changes during Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection requires an exact approach with an accurate definition of individual changes and their parameters, including a classification score facilitating comparison among experiments. To propose methods and procedures for the evaluation of histological changes in skin infected by S. aureus strains in experimental pig models. Four pigs were included in the experiment. In the dorsal region of each pig, 10 wounds per pig (5 x 5 cm, 2 cm spacing) were created. Wounds in the individual pigs were inoculated with three different strains of methicillin- (oxacillin) and amoxicillin-resistant S. aureus at concentrations of 2 x 10(9)-5 x 10(9) CFU/ml. One pig was not inoculated and served as control. Subsequently, samples were collected from each wound on Days 3, 7, 10, ad 14 after inoculation processed by frozen section technique and the samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Classification scores of selected parameters were determined and an average classification index was established at the end of the experiment. Histologically, granulomatous arrangement and superficial re-epithelialization were observed in the wounds of all animals. Compared to control, S. aureus infection documents slow healing of skin wounds with impaired epidermal formation (0.88 infected vs 1.45 control), re-epithelialization (1.25 vs 2.08), edema in the dermis (1.50 vs 2.67), inflammation in the dermis (0.50 vs 1.69), fibrosis in the dermis (4 vs 2.56), fibrosis in the hypodermis (4 vs 3.17) and, finally, necrosis in the dermis (1 vs 2.2). The results in the scores for scabs (1.25 vs 1.42), dermis (2.63 vs 2.67), and, finally, necrosis in the hypodermis (0.25 vs 0.75) did not differ among groups. The proposed methodological approach allowed quantification of histological changes and we recommend employing this scoring system in other studies evaluating the healing of skin wounds.

AB  - Simple Summary The PRRS eradication program in Hungary, carried out from 2014 to 2022, focused on replacing entire herds and using high-performance breeds to improve pig farming. This approach reduced the sow population by over 26% while keeping nearly the same number of pigs for slaughter. As a result, there were significant reductions in harmful emissions, such as ammonia and greenhouse gases, and a decrease in feed and water usage. The results show that tailored strategies and advanced breeding can make pig farming more efficient and environmentally friendly. This highlights the importance of collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and industry to create sustainable livestock practices.Abstract The Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) eradication program in Hungary, implemented between 2014 and 2022, utilized complete herd replacement and the introduction of high-performance breeds to enhance production efficiency and environmental sustainability in the swine sector. As a result, the sow population was reduced by 26.2% while maintaining nearly the same number of slaughter pigs. This led to significant reductions in ammonia emissions (-145,857 kg), slurry production (-153,879 m3), nitrogen emissions (-1,409,951 kg), and overall greenhouse gas emissions (91,768,362 kg CO2eq). Additionally, the feed and water consumption were substantially decreased by 53,237,805 kg and 292,978,094 L, respectively, further lowering the sector's environmental footprint. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of customized eradication strategies and advanced breeding practices in reducing the environmental impact of animal husbandry. These findings underscore the necessity for ongoing collaboration among scientists, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to develop and implement sustainable livestock production methods. The Hungarian experience provides valuable insights into how targeted interventions can simultaneously improve production outcomes and reduce the environmental burden in the swine industry.

AB  - Follicle maturation is a complex biological process governed by numerous factors, and researchers have observed follicle development by studying the proliferation and apoptosis of follicular granulosa cells (GCs). However, the regulatory mechanisms of GCs proliferation and death during follicle development are largely unknown. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs, mRNAs, and microRNAs, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and small RNA-seq were performed on large (>10 mm) and small follicles (<3 mm) of Leizhou black goat during estrus. We discovered two microRNAs, miR-450-5p and miR-202-5p, which can target GCs in goats and may be involved in follicle maturation, and the effects of miR-450-5p and miR-202-5p on ovarian granulosa cell lines were investigated (KGN). Using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and flow cytometry, miR-202-5p overexpression could suppress the proliferation and induce apoptosis of GCs, whereas miR-450-5p overexpression induced the opposite effects. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-450-5p could directly target the BMF gene (a BCL2 modifying factor), and miR-202-5p targeted the BCL2 gene. A considerable rise in phosphorylated Akt (p-AKT) protein was observed following the downregulation of BMF by miR-450-5p mimics. After BMF gene RNAi therapy, a notable elevation in p-AKT was detected. Mimics of miR-202-5p inhibited BCL2 protein expression, significantly decreasing p-AMPK protein expression. These results imply that during the follicular development in black goats, the miR-450-5p-BMF axis favored GC proliferation on a wide scale, while the miR-202-5p-BCL2 axis triggered GC apoptosis.

AB  - Defects in the activity of the proteasome or its regulators are linked to several pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that proteasome heterogeneity and its selective partners vary across brain regions and have a significant impact on proteasomal catalytic activities. Using neuronal cell cultures and brain tissues obtained from mice, we compared proteasomal activities from two distinct brain regions affected in neurodegenerative diseases, the striatum and the hippocampus. The results indicated that proteasome activities and their responses to proteasome inhibitors are determined by their subcellular localizations and their brain regions. Using an iodixanol gradient fractionation method, proteasome complexes were isolated, followed by proteomic analysis for proteasomal interaction partners. Proteomic results revealed brain region-specific non-proteasomal partners, including gamma-enolase (ENO2). ENO2 showed more association to proteasome complexes purified from the striatum than to those from the hippocampus. These results highlight a potential key role for non-proteasomal partners of proteasomes regarding the diverse activities of the proteasome complex recorded in several brain regions.

AB  - Olive oil production generates by-products, such as olive cake (OC), which can be used in animal feed, reducing the environmental impact. This study assessed the effects of OC in pig diets on intestinal morphometry and blood parameters. Twenty-four B & iacute;saro pigs were randomly assigned to three treatments: OC0 (control), OC15 (15% dehydrated OC), and OC25 (25% dehydrated OC) for 93 days. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), and fiber (NDF) was evaluated through total feces collection. No significant differences in average daily gain (ADG) or feed conversion ratio (FCR) were found (p > 0.05). However, average daily feed intake (ADFI) increased from 2.84 kg (control) to 3.46 kg (OC15) and 3.64 kg (OC25). OC inclusion increased the ADFI of CF (90.8 g to 171.5 g and 169.2 g) and NDF (586.8 g to 896.6 g and 1115.4 g). The ATTD of all parameters decreased with 25% OC. The digestible intake of DM, OM, and CP was unaffected, but CF intake was higher in OC-fed groups (p = 0.005). Histomorphometric analysis revealed no significant differences in villi size. Lymphocyte counts were higher in OC25 (p < 0.05). This study suggests that up to 15% OC inclusion is feasible without compromising the pigs' performance.

AB  - Effects of cyflumetofen and clofentezine were evaluated on Tetranychus urticae Koch, under laboratory conditions. LC50 values of cyflumetofen and clofentezine against eggs were 0.8 mu g a.i./mL and 0.42 mu g a.i./mL, respectively. Sublethal effects of these compounds on the life table parameters of T. urticae were evaluated by exposing mites to LC50 and LC25 concentrations. The developmental time of male and female T. urticae were significantly affected by both acaricides. Moreover, exposure to LC25 and LC50 concentrations of cyflumetofen or clofentezine significantly reduced net reproductive rate (R-0), finite rate of increase (lambda), and intrinsic rate of increase (r). The LC25 and LC50 treatments showed strong effects on both survivorship, fecundity, and intrinsic rate of increase. Our findings indicated that lethal and sublethal exposure to cyflumetofen or clofentezine result in significant alteration of life-history characteristics of T. urticae. Our findings suggest that these acaricides are promising candidates for use in management programs of this major pest

AB  - Simple Summary Nucleotides represent a group of bioactive compounds essential for the development of the gastrointestinal tract and immune function. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effect of oral administration of nucleotides before and after weaning on growth performance, health, development of the intestinal immunity and microbiome of piglet. A nucleotide-based product (NU) was orally given four times before weaning and once after to one group of piglets, while a second group was used as a control (CO). The NU pigs did not grow more than the control until 12 days post-weaning but had increased hemoglobin and hematocrit values. At weaning, feces of NU piglets had a microbial profile more typical of growing pigs, while those of CO were more representative of suckling pigs. The upregulation of genes in the blood of control pigs at weaning was indicative of more activation towards an inflammatory response, while genes of erythropoiesis were more active in NU pigs post-weaning. NU supplementation stimulated genes for proliferative activity in the intestinal immune system, a sign of possible anticipated maturation. NU supplementation did not influence the growth performance of piglets but may have expressed a positive effect on pig microbiota anticipating its maturation at weaning, with possible immunostimulant activity on the intestinal immune system. Nucleotides are essential for the development of the gastrointestinal tract and immune function, but their intake with milk by piglets could be insufficient. The effect of nucleotides on growth and health was tested on 98 piglets divided into two groups: NU, orally administrated with 4 mL of a nucleotide-based product (SwineMOD) at 10, 15, 18, 21, 27 days, or not (CO). Blood and feces were sampled at weaning (26 d, T1), and at 38 d (T2). Per each group and time-point, eight piglets were slaughtered and jejunal Peyer's patches (JPPs) were collected. NU increased hemoglobin content and hematocrit, but not growth. At weaning, the NU fecal microbiota was characterized by the abundance of Campylobacteraceae, more typical of the growing phase, compared to CO, with a greater abundance of Streptococcaceae. For the blood transcriptome, an initial greater inflammatory activation was seen in CO, while at T2, NU enriched gene sets related to erythropoiesis. The activation of gene groups ranging from epigenetic response to transcriptional regulation evidenced an intense proliferative activity in NU JPPs. NU supplementation did not influence the growth performance of piglets but could have expressed a positive effect on pig microbiota anticipating its maturation at weaning. This immunostimulant activity in the JPPs could moderate the inflammation in the immediate pre-weaning.

AB  - Eukaryotes utilize distinct mitogen/messenger-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways to evoke appropriate responses when confronted with different stimuli. In yeast, hyperosmotic stress activates MAPK Hog1, whereas mating pheromones activate MAPK Fus3 (and MAPK Kss1). Because these pathways share several upstream components, including the small guanosine-5'-triphosphate phosphohydrolase (GTPase) cell-division-cycle-42 (Cdc42), mechanisms must exist to prevent inadvertent cross-pathway activation. Hog1 activity is required to prevent crosstalk to Fus3 and Kss1. To identify other factors required to maintain signaling fidelity during hypertonic stress, we devised an unbiased genetic selection for mutants unable to prevent such crosstalk even when active Hog1 is present. We repeatedly isolated truncated alleles of RGA1, a Cdc42-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP), each lacking its C-terminal catalytic domain, that permit activation of the mating MAPKs under hyperosmotic conditions despite Hog1 being present. We show that Rga1 down-regulates Cdc42 within the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, but not the mating pathway. Because induction of mating pathway output via crosstalk from the HOG pathway takes significantly longer than induction of HOG pathway output, our findings suggest that, under normal conditions, Rga1 contributes to signal insulation by limiting availability of the GTP-bound Cdc42 pool generated by hypertonic stress. Thus, Rga1 action contributes to squelching crosstalk by imposing a type of "kinetic proofreading ". Although Rga1 is a Hog1 substrate in vitro, we eliminated the possibility that its direct Hog1-mediated phosphorylation is necessary for its function in vivo. Instead, we found first that, like its paralog Rga2, Rga1 is subject to inhibitory phosphorylation by the S. cerevisiae cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (Cdk1) ortholog Cdc28 and that hyperosmotic shock stimulates its dephosphorylation and thus Rga1 activation. Second, we found that Hog1 promotes Rga1 activation by blocking its Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation, thereby allowing its phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. These findings shed light on why Hog1 activity is required to prevent crosstalk from the HOG pathway to the mating pheromone response pathway.

AB  - Marine planktonic predator-prey interactions occur in microscale seascapes, where diffusing chemicals may act either as chemotactic cues that enhance or arrest predation, or as elemental resources that are complementary to prey ingestion. The phytoplankton osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and its degradation products dimethylsulfide (DMS) and acrylate are pervasive compounds with high chemotactic potential, but there is a longstanding controversy over whether they act as grazing enhancers or deterrents. Here, we investigated the chemotactic responses of three herbivorous dinoflagellates to point-sourced, microscale gradients of dissolved DMSP, DMS, and acrylate. We found no evidence for acrylate being a chemotactic repellent and observed a weak attractor role of DMS. DMSP behaved as a strong chemoattractor whose potential for grazing facilitation through effects on swimming patterns and aggregation depends on the grazer's feeding mode and ability to incorporate DMSP. Our study reveals that predation models will fail to predict grazing impacts unless they incorporate chemotaxis-driven searching and finding of prey.

AB  - Despite being an extralimital species in the region, South African giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa, Schreber 1784) are continuously being introduced into the Albany Thicket Biome of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. This study aimed to determine the diurnal activity budgets of two extralimital giraffe populations in the Western Cape of South Africa. Diurnal activity budgets are important to provide baseline information on the adaptability of species in newly introduced areas and for more detailed ecological studies such as those relating to habitat suitability, animal-plant interactions and interactions with other resident animals.

AB  - Sustainable production of milk is favorable in dairy sheep industry, which necessitates year-round reproduction of rams and ewes even during non-breeding season. Hence, protocols facilitating reproduction of rams and ewes during non-breeding season are of importance for this purpose. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of melatonin implantation in rams and administration of 400 IU eCG (E400) versus 300 IU eCG (E300) in ewes on reproductive performance of Lacaune sheep breed during non-breeding season. Rams were allocated to two groups including untreated (control, CON; n = 36) and melatonin-treated (MEL; n = 37). A subset of rams from CON (n = 7) and MEL (n = 7) groups were used for assessment of scrotal circumference, kinematic and functional characteristics of sperm, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of semen and circulating testosterone on Days 0 (the beginning of study) and 60 (60 days after melatonin implantation). Further, the study had a 2 x 2 factorial design with four experimental groups including 1) ewes treated with E300 and introduced to CON rams (E300CON; n = 17 rams and 172 ewes), 2) ewes treated with E300 and introduced to MEL rams (E300MEL; n = 18 rams and 177 ewes), 3) ewes treated with E400 and introduced to CON rams (E400CON; n = 19 rams and 192 ewes), and ewes treated with E400 and introduced to MEL rams (E400MEL; n = 19 rams and 190 ewes). Melatonin implantation improved scrotal circumference, concentration, progressive motility, velocity, mitochondrial membrane potential and viability of sperm, TAC of semen, concentration of testosterone and fertility of rams (P < 0.05). Besides, E400 compared with E300 enhanced synchronization of estrus and fertility in ewes (P < 0.05). In conclusion, melatonin implantation promoted reproductive performance in Lacaune rams, and increase in dose of eCG improved reproductive performance in Lacaune ewes.

AB  - Aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) is the most widely used vaccine adjuvant, but its known adverse effects prompt the finding of other, safer alternative adjuvants. This study compares in sheep the global performance and safety of vaccine prototypes against bluetongue virus (BTV) formulated with AlOOH, biomimetic apatite nanoparticles (ApNPs), and microcrystalline tyrosine (MCT). Five groups of 6 sheep were included in the study: control, BTV serotype 4 alone, and BTV-4 combined either with AlOOH, ApNPs, or MCT. Adjuvants were fully characterized. Group specific antibodies against BTV-4 were observed in all treatment groups, including BTV-4 alone. After booster inoculation, ApNPs or MCT groups responded immediately, and it was delayed for BTV-4 and AlOOH groups. Comparable neutralizing antibody responses were observed in all treatment groups but were earlier for BTV-4, ApNPs, and MCT groups when compared with the AlOOH group. No significant systemic alterations were observed during the study. The AlOOH group developed more pronounced local reactions that persisted throughout the 133-day study and were evident as post-mortem granulomas. ApNPs and MCT are biocompatible, safer, and viable alternative adjuvants for sheep vaccines. BTV alone might also be suitable for this purpose. This work is the first demonstrating the suitability of biocompatible alternative adjuvants in sheep vaccines.

AB  - Conventional distance sampling approaches rely on the design assumption (i.e. uniform distribution of individuals in relation to transects) to ensure unbiased inference to the population of interest. However, randomized design recommendations are not always followed or may be impractical to implement for some survey types, particularly in cases where transects must be placed perpendicular to the habitat gradient. Full-likelihood spatial distance sampling models provide a potential solution to violations of the design assumption by jointly modelling the detection and occurrence processes using spatially indexed habitat covariates. Through simulation and an applied example based on a survey for Dall's sheep in Alaska, USA, we used a full-likelihood distance sampling approach to investigate the potential for bias in cases where transects placed perpendicular to the habitat gradient (e.g. elevational contours) are non-randomly sampled. We also assessed the utility of spatial approaches in cases where transects are placed along linear features, such as roads or ridgelines, where habitat may be unrepresentative of the overall study area. Our results showed that the full-likelihood approach was generally unbiased, even in extreme scenarios where habitat was inversely related to distance from the transect. For the Dall's sheep example, our results showed that more efficient designs with reduced sampling effort in low-quality habitats are a practical solution for reducing logistical costs when the data are analysed in a spatial modelling framework. Together, our findings confirm and extend existing work suggesting that spatial distance sampling can be a useful solution when non-random designs are employed. Given the high cost of survey implementation in many cases, the development of valid alternatives to design-based inference will aid in the amount of information available for a variety of species. The results of our work will be useful for practitioners in assessing alternative designs relative to particular survey applications.

AB  - Polyamines (PAs) along with their conjugated forms, are important mediators of plant defense mechanisms against both biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavin-containing polyamine oxidases (PAOs) regulate PA levels through terminal oxidation. To date, the role of PAOs in plant-herbivore interaction remains poorly understood. We discovered that infestation by the brown planthopper (BPH) disrupts PA homeostasis within the leaf sheaths of rice plants, which co-occurs with the upregulation of OsPAO6, a tissue-specific inducible, apoplast-localized enzyme that regulates the terminal catabolism of spermidine (Spd) and spermine. Functional analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited plants revealed that pao6 mutants accumulated significantly higher levels of Spd and phenylpropanoid-conjugated Spd in response to BPH infestation compared to wild-type controls. In addition, BPH feeding on pao6 mutants led to increased honeydew excretion and plant damage by female adults, consistent with in vitro experiments in which Spd enhanced BPH feeding. Furthermore, OsPAO6 transcription is regulated by jasmonate (JA) signaling, and it is dependent on MYC2, which directly binds to the G-box-like motif in the OsPAO6 promoter. Our findings reveal an important role of OsPAO6 in regulating polyamine catabolism in JA-induced responses triggered by herbivore attacks in rice.

AB  - The diet of a single Maghreb Owl Strix mauritanica (family Strigidae) was examined within its natural habitat at Kahf Lakhal cave on Jbel Moussa, a mountain in northern Morocco. The two distinct batches of pellets collected contained a total of 190 prey items. Pellet analysis revealed a diet comprised of four primary taxonomic classes of prey: mammals, insects, birds and reptiles. We identified 29 prey species, representing 21 families. Mammals were the most prominent component, accounting for 49.5% of the diet items and included at least nine distinct species. Insects constituted 28.9% of the diet, representing at least eight species; birds comprised 20%, representing at least 11 species; and reptiles were represented by a single species (3.4%). Numerically, the most frequently captured prey species were the common bent-wing bat Miniopterus schreibersii (22.1%), black rat Rattus rattus (8.4%) and European rhinoceros beetle Oryctes nasicornis (7.9%). In biomass, black rats were the biggest component of the owl's diet (31.8%), followed by Barbary Partridges Alectoris barbara and hares Lepus sp. (each 11.9%); together these three species comprised more than half the estimated biomass of the prey types consumed by the owl. This investigation significantly improves our knowledge of the diet of the Maghreb Owl in the North African region.

AB  - Nonhistone acetylation plays a crucial role in key cellular processes associated with ageing, such as autophagy. Heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), a vital chaperone protein for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), exerts a molecular chaperone function that is regulated by its acetylation status. However, the effects of this acetylation on CMA and granulosa cell senescence remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of Hsc70 acetylation on CMA activity and senescence in goat ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). Notably, Hsc70 acetylation was found to mitigate granulosa cell senescence and promote CMA activity. Mass spectrometry analysis identified Hsc70 K512 as the acetylation site, and Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) was found to catalyze the deacetylation of this site. In addition, Hsc70 expression and CMA activity were significantly reduced in ageing ovaries and under oxidative stress conditions. Subsequent experiments revealed that deacetylated Hsc70 increased the early and late apoptotic rates of GCs and inhibited CMA activity. Functionally, acetylation of the Hsc70 K512 site alleviates the ageing of GCs. In conclusion, this study elucidates the molecular mechanism through which Hsc70 K512 acetylation alleviates cell senescence by enhancing CMA activity in goat ovarian GCs, providing novel insights and potential intervention targets for female mammalian reproduction.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of novel ingredients is increasing in popularity within the pet food industry. Products utilizing both grain-free and more traditional ingredient profiles are widely available. Unfortunately, gastrointestinal impacts associated with changes in starch content and gelatinization from different grain or carbohydrate sources are unknown. The purpose of this work was to measure starch content and gelatinization in commercially manufactured dry dog food products and assess differences related to ingredient profile. Gelatinized starch was proportionately lower in products manufactured with traditional ingredients (chicken, chicken by-product meal, meat and bone meal and plant-based ingredients including rice, barley, oats, and corn). Diets manufactured with non-traditional ingredients including alligator, buffalo, venison, kangaroo, squid, quail, rabbit, and salmon along with plant-based ingredients including tapioca, chickpeas, lentils, potato, and pumpkin had higher proportions of starch gelatinized. The degree of gelatinization can impact digestibility in the canine digestive tract and is an important area requiring further investigation. Starch gelatinization in pet food may be affected by moisture, retention time, and ingredients used. Starch gelatinization has been associated with changes in digestibility but is not well studied using non-traditional ingredients in canine diets. The objective of this research was to examine differences in starch content and gelatinization associated with changes in ingredient profile (traditional vs. non-traditional) and nutrient content requirements associated with differing life stages. Traditional diets (n = 10) utilizing protein sources including chicken, chicken by-product meal, meat and bone meal and plant-based ingredients including rice, barley, oats, and corn were examined in comparison with non-traditional diets (n = 10) utilizing protein sources including alligator, buffalo, venison, kangaroo, squid, quail, rabbit, and salmon along with plant-based ingredients including tapioca, chickpeas, lentils, potato, and pumpkin. Total starch and gelatinized starch (as percent of total diet) were measured with variation due to ingredient type assessed using Student's t-test in SAS 9.4. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Total starch (as a percent of diet) was higher in traditional diets compared to non-traditional diets formulated for maintenance (p < 0.0032) or all life stages (p < 0.0128). However, starch gelatinization as a proportion of total starch was lower in traditional diets formulated for maintenance (p < 0.0165) and all life stages (p < 0.0220). Total starch and gelatinized starch had a strong negative correlation (r = -0.78; p < 0.01) in diets utilizing traditional ingredients. These novel data reveal important differences between starch content and gelatinization and may impact selection of various ingredient types by pet food manufacturers.

AB  - Geographically expanding and invading ticks are a global concern. The Asian longhorned tick (ALT, Haemaphysalis longicornis) was introduced to the mid-Atlantic US between 2010 and 2017 and recently invaded Ohio, an inland state. To date, ALTs in the US have been associated with livestock exsanguination and transmission of the agent of bovine theileriosis. To inform management, studies describing tick ecology and epidemiology of associated disease agents are critical. In this study, we described phenology, habitat and host associations, and tested for agents of medical and veterinary concern at the site of the first known established ALT population in Ohio, where pesticide treatment was applied in early fall 2021. In spring-fall 2022, we sampled wildlife (small mammals) and collected ticks from forest, edge, and grassland habitats. We also opportunistically sampled harvested white-tailed deer at nearby processing stations and fresh wildlife carcasses found near roads. Field-collected ALTs were tested for five agents using real-time PCR. We found that ALT nymphs emerged in June, followed by adults, and concluded with larvae in the fall. ALTs were detected in all habitats but not in wildlife. We also found a 4.88% (2/41) prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum across ALT adults and nymphs. Host and habitat associations were similar to other studies in the eastern United States, but two potential differences in phenology were identified. Whether ALTs will acquire more endemic disease agents requires further investigations. Our findings provide the first evidence regarding ALT life history from the Midwest region of the United States and can inform exposure risk and guide integrated management.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles are secretory vesicles involved in cell-to-cell communication via their encapsulated cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Bovine milk provides a rich source of extracellular vesicles (mEVs) that have been studied as therapeutics and drug delivery systems. Therefore, insight into the mEV cargo, such as its proteome, may help in understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the potential health benefits attributed to the mEVs. Hence, mEVs were isolated from healthy buffalo milk after screening the milk somatic cell count. The total proteins of mEVs were analyzed using LC-MS, and 331 proteins were found commonly present among three buffalo milk samples. These proteins were primarily derived from extracellular regions and lysosomes. The major biological roles associated with the proteins were immune response, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. The molecular functions of the proteins were transporter activity, catalytic activity, and GTPase activity. Further, comparative analysis with the previously available bovine mEVs proteome data showed 114 proteins to be newly identified in the buffalo mEVs. The biological pathways associated with these proteins may play a major role in muscle development. These findings shed a light on the potential health benefits of buffalo mEVs as therapeutics as well as drug delivery vehicles.

AB  - Simple Summary The impairment of reproductive and growth performance of pigs by disease is directly connected to the economic loss of a farm. Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is one of the diseases with the highest economic impact prevailing globally. However, the impact of PRRS outbreaks on swine production in South Korea has been rarely reported. By monitoring before and after a PRRS outbreak in a PRRS-negative farm with mass vaccination in sows and gilts, we found that a potential vaccine failure caused by PRRSV infection in this farm caused severe losses in both the farrowing period and growing period, which is similar to or exceeds reports from other countries. As a result, the pig farm in this study suffered extensive production and economic losses due to PRRSV infection, and further studies are needed to estimate the total cost of economic losses due to PRRS outbreaks in the South Korean swine industry. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease that has inflicted economic losses in the swine industry. The causative agent, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), is known to have a high genetic diversity which leads to heterogeneous pathogenicity. To date, the impact of PRRS outbreaks on swine production and the economy of the swine industry in South Korea has been rarely reported. In this study, we compare the reproductive performance in the breeding-farrowing phase and growth performance in the nursery phase, in two 27-week periods, one before and one after a PRRSV1 outbreak on a 650-sow farrow-to-nursery farm caused by a Korean PRRSV1 isolate which was genetically distinct from vaccine strains or other global strains. The reproductive performance of sows and the growth performance of nursery pigs were compared using row data consisting of 1907 mating records, 1648 farrowing records, and 17,129 weaning records from 32 breeding batches. The following variables were significantly different between the pre-PRRS outbreak period and the post-PRRS outbreak period: the farrowing rate (-7.1%, p < 0.0001), the abortion rate (+3.9%, p < 0.0001), the return rate (+2.9%, p = 0.0250), weaning to estrus interval days (+1.9 days, p < 0.0001), total piglets born (-1.2 pigs/litter, p < 0.0001), piglets born alive (-2.2 pigs/litter, p < 0.0001), weaned piglets (-2.7 pigs/litter, p < 0.0001), pre-weaning mortality (+7.4%, p < 0.0001), weaning weight (-0.9 kg/pig, p = 0.0015), the mortality rate (+2.8%, p < 0.0001), average daily gain (-69.8 g/d, p < 0.0001), and the feed conversion ratio (+0.26, p = 0.0036). Economic losses for a period of 27 weeks after a PRRS outbreak were calculated at KRW 99,378 (USD 82.8) per mated female for the breeding-farrowing phase, KRW 8,968 (USD 7.5) per pig for the nursery growth phase, and KRW 245,174 (USD 204.3) per sow in the post-outbreak period. In conclusion, the farrow-to-nursery farm in our study suffered extensive production and economic losses as a result of a PRRSV1 outbreak.

AB  - Pesticide resistance development is an example of rapid contemporary evolution that poses immense challenges for agriculture. It typically evolves due to the strong directional selection that pesticide treatments exert on herbivorous arthropods. However, recent research suggests that some species are more prone to evolve pesticide resistance than others due to their evolutionary history and standing genetic variation. Generalist species might develop pesticide resistance especially rapidly due to pre-adaptation to handle a wide array of plant allelochemicals. Moreover, research has shown that adaptation to novel host plants could lead to increased pesticide resistance. Exploring such cross-resistance between host plant range evolution and pesticide resistance development from an ecological perspective is needed to understand its causes and consequences better. Much research has, however, been devoted to the molecular mechanisms underlying pesticide resistance while both the ecological contexts that could facilitate resistance evolution and the ecological consequences of cross-resistance have been under-studied. Here, we take an eco-evolutionary approach and discuss circumstances that may facilitate cross-resistance in arthropods and the consequences cross-resistance may have for plant-arthropod interactions in both target and non-target species and species interactions. Furthermore, we suggest future research avenues and practical implications of an increased ecological understanding of pesticide resistance evolution.

AB  - Nepeta nuda L. shares a typical secondary chemistry with other Nepeta species (fam. Lamiaceae), characterized by the tendency to intensively produce monoterpenoid iridoids, whereas the phenylpropanoid chemistry is steered towards the production of a caffeic acid ester, rosmarinic acid. Combining complementary state-of-the-art analytical techniques, N. nuda metabolome was here comprehensively characterized in the quest for the organ-specific composition of phenolics and terpenoids that possess well-defined functions in plant-biotic interactions as well as therapeutic potential. N. nuda inflorescences showed generally higher constitutive levels of specialized metabolites, as compared to leaves, and the composition of major iridoids and phenolics in reproductive organs was found to be more conserved than in leaves across 13 populations from the Central Balkans. The results suggest that N. nuda plants most likely invest more in constitutive than inducible biosynthesis of functional metabolites in flowers, since they are of essential importance for both pollination and defense against herbivores and pathogens. Conversely, specialized metabolism of leaves is found to be more susceptible to reprograming in response to differential growth conditions. The defense strategy of leaves, primarily functioning in CO2 fixation during photosynthesis, more likely relies on the induction of metabolite levels following plant-environment interplay. Organ-specific biosynthesis of iridoids in N. nuda is found to be tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, and high constitutive levels of these compounds in inflorescences most likely result from the up-regulated expression of several key genes (NnG8H, NnNEPS1, NnNEPS2, and NnNEPS3) determining the metabolic flux through the pathway. The organ-specific content of rosmarinic acid and co-expression patterns of the corresponding biosynthetic genes were much less correlated, which suggests independent organ-specific transcriptional regulation of the iridoid and phenolic pathways. Knowledge gathered within the present study can assist growers to select productive genotypes and manipulate phenology of N. nuda towards maximizing yields and facilitating its integration into pest management systems and other applications related to human health.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a kind of high-quality oil supply species. Its seeds contain rich unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant active ingredients, which is a kind of high-quality edible oil. In this study, we used bioinformatics methods to decipher a hexaploid Camellia oil tree's mitochondrial (mt) genome based on second-generation sequencing data. A 709,596 bp circular map of C. oleifera mt genome was found for the first time. And 74 genes were annotated in the whole genome. Mt genomes of C. oleifera and three Theaceae species had regions with high similarity, including gene composition and gene sequence. At the same time, five conserved gene pairs were found in 20 species. In all of the mt genomes, most of nad genes existed in tandem pairs. In addition, the species classification result, which, according to the gene differences in tandem with nad5 genes, was consistent with the phylogenetic tree. These initial results provide a valuable basis for the further researches of Camellia oleifera and a reference for the systematic evolution of plant mt genomes.

AB  - Water pollution may be a serious environmental problem for Lake Hawassa, an important fishing and recreational site as well as a drinking-water source in Ethiopia. The present study aims at determining the distribution of metals and metalloids in the lake's water, sediment and fish tissues and assessing the resulting human health and ecological risks. Metals were detected in both abiotic and biotic samples. In water, only the Hg concentration was significantly different among sampling sites. The average concentration of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in water were below the environmental quality thresholds, thus not having potentially adverse effect on aquatic life. In sediment, significant differences in metals concentration among sites were found for As, Cd, Pb, Co, Zn and Hg (p < 0.05). Exceedances of As, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni and Zn were found in sediment, with Cr, Ni and Zn above the probable effect concentration and being potentially toxic to aquatic life. Fish stored more metals in their liver than in their muscle. The concentration of metals in carnivorous fish (Barbus intermedius) was not higher in muscle and liver than those in herbivores fish (Oreochromis niloticus). The Bioaccumulation Factor of Cr in all fish species muscle was >1. The Biota-Sediment Accu-mulation Factor of all metals in all fish species muscle were <1. Positive correlations among metals in water and cor-relations among metals in sediment were found, indicating a potential common pollution source. Positive correlation of total organic carbon with Cd, Co and Se and clay content with Pb, As and Hg was found and may imply that metals are easily adsorbed by the organic matter and fine sediment. With respect to the measured metals no potential health risk due to consumption of fish from Lake Hawassa was observed.

AB  - Herbivores in quest of food have to attend areas where predators also concentrate their attacks. They have to deal with two conflicting demands, the need of feeding and that of avoiding predation. Using a theoretical approach, we study the influence of these antagonistic constraints on the shaping of an herbivore's foraging strategy and their consequences in terms of functional response.
   In our model, the animal may curtail predation risk by being vigilant while foraging and by limiting its time of presence in the feeding area. Being vigilant means either stopping all feeding activities to scan for predators (exclusive vigilance) or using the time spent handling resources to do so, with reduced detection capacities (routine vigilance). Using an optimization criterium, we thus determine how long the animal will stay in the feeding area and how it will share its time and attention while present there, as a function of resource density and predation risk.
   All behavioural variables show smooth but sometimes non-monotonic variations in response to changes in these environmental conditions. When these variations are taken into account, the instantaneous intake rate of the herbivore, as well as the total biomass of plant consumed, increase in a decelerating but continuous manner with the patch's richness, in qualitative agreement with a type II functional response. This smooth pattern is explained by the possibility for the herbivore, when food abundance rises, to progressively redirect its attention to routine antipredator vigilance.
   The relative importance of routine vigilance with respect to exclusive vigilance declines when predation risk increases, as well as the duration of the patch's visit and the total quantity of food eaten. The exact shape of the functional response is thus mediated by subtle adjustments of behavioural and attentional priorities, in response to variations in both food availability and predation risk.

AB  - Endogenous neurosteroids and synthetic neuroactive steroids (NAS) are important targets for therapeutic development in neuropsychiatric disorders. These steroids modulate major signaling systems in the brain and intracellular processes including inflammation, cellular stress and autophagy. In this review, we describe studies performed using unnatural enantiomers of key neurosteroids, which are physiochemically identical to their natural counterparts except for rotation of polarized light. These studies led to insights in how NAS interact with receptors, ion channels and intracellular sites of action. Certain effects of NAS show high enantioselectivity, consistent with actions in chiral environments and likely direct interactions with signaling proteins. Other effects show no enantioselectivity and even reverse enantioselectivity. The spectrum of effects of NAS enantiomers raises the possibility that these agents, once considered only as tools for preclinical studies, have therapeutic potential that complements and in some cases may exceed their natural counterparts. Here we review studies of NAS enantiomers from the perspective of their potential development as novel neurotherapeutics.

AB  - Valved conduits are often required to replace pulmonary arteries (PA). A widely used Contegra device is made of bovine jugular vein (BJV), preserved with glutaraldehyde (GA) and iso-propanol. However, it has several drawbacks that may be attributed to its chemical treatment. We hypothesized that the use of an alternative preservation compound may significantly improve BJV conduit performance. This study aimed to compare the macroscopic and microscopic properties of the BJV treated with diepoxide (DE) and GA in a porcine model. Twelve DE-BJVs and four Contegra conduits were used for PA replacement in minipigs. To assess the isolated influence of GA, we included an additional control group-BJV treated with 0.625% GA (n = 4). The animals were withdrawn after 6 months of follow-up and the conduits were examined. Explanted DE-BJV had a soft elastic wall with no signs of thrombosis or calcification and good conduit integration, including myofibroblast germination, an ingrowth of soft connective tissue formations and remarkable neoangiogenesis. The inner surface of DE-BJVs was covered by a thin neointimal layer with a solid endothelium. Contegra grafts had a stiffer wall with thrombosis on the leaflets. Calcified foci, chondroid metaplasia, and hyalinosis were observed within the wall. The distal anastomotic sites had hyperplastic neointima, partially covered with the endothelium. The wall of GA-BJV was stiff and rigid with degenerative changes, a substantial amount of calcium deposits and dense fibrotic formations in adventitia. An irregular neointimal layer was presented in the anastomotic sites without endothelial cover in the GA BJV wall. These results demonstrate that DE treatment improves conduit integration and the endothelialization of the inner surface while preventing the mineralization of the BJV, which may reduce the risk of early conduit dysfunction.

AB  - Introduction: Classical homocystinuria is a genetic disease caused by partial or total deficiency of cystathionine-beta synthase (C beta S) enzyme activity, ultimately leading to brain alterations and early atherosclerotic disease. Currently, there is no cure for the disease and the treatments consist in reducing homocysteine levels through diet, however not all patients respond to therapy. Due to its ability to increase neurotrophins production and decrease oxidative stress in the brain, environmental enrichment (EE) has been used with success as an adjuvant non-pharmacological therapy for CNS disorders. Here, we investigated the effects of 4 weeks enriched environment in a severe chronic chemically-induced model of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) in Wistar rats. Methods: Animals of both sexes were subjected to homocysteine administration subcutaneously (12 h intervals) from day 6 of life (P6) to P28. After this period, animals were continuously exposed to the enriched environment (or standard cages) for 30 days. Animals were tested for cognition and locomotor abilities and hippocampi were collected for the assessment of oxidative stress and histological damage. Results: Animals in the HHCY group showed impaired learning in the reference memory assessment in the Morris water maze with no effects in the novel objects recognition test. HHCY did not impair locomotion in the open field nor in the horizontal ladder task. HHCY rats presented decreased hippocampal volume reversed by EE. Enrichment was also able to reverse cognitive impairments in the spatial memory, improve coordination in the ladder walking and recognition memory in the NOR test. HHCY altered redox balance, with no protective effects of EE. Conclusions: Due to its benefits and no side effects reported in literature, EE can be suggested as potential complimentary therapy to improve memory and motricity impairments in homocystinuric patients, however the mechanisms involved in this neuroprotection needs further investigation.

AB  - This paper presents an environmental cost-benefit analysis (CBA) comparing organic and non-organic sheep farming in Iceland over three decades. Environmental life cycle costing (ELCC) is the basis for the aggregate cost framework, encompassing costs for investment, operations, maintenance, and environmental externalities. Greenhouse gas emissions are included as an external cost as they relate to the monetization of damages to society. Net present value (NPV) and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) indicators reveal both systems as unprofitable over thirty years with and without subsidies. Depending on the discount rate, the organic farm's BCR ranges from 0.26 to 0.38, with a NPV between (-2.4) and (-1.1) million euros. The non-organic farm's BCR ranges from 0.12 to 0.19, with NPV between (-8.6) and (-3.7) million euros. Greenhouse gas emission costs constitute 28 % and 33 % of total life cycle costs for organic and non-organic farms. Across three discount rates, the LCC and ELCC per kilogram of organic lamb ranged between <euro>13.78-25.27 and <euro>18.23-37.07, respectively. The LCC and ELCC per kilogram of non-organic lamb ranged between <euro>9.75-18.05 and <euro>13.80-28.82, respectively. Due to a shortened value chain, organic sheep farming demonstrated revenue advantages as compared to non-organic. The external cost of greenhouse gas emissions from sheep farming forms a significant portion of lifetime costs suggesting that policymakers could incentivize organic practices aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, this study provides a deeper understanding of the long-term economic prospectivity of sheep farming under different production approaches.

AB  - Co-composting of solid manure (SM) and liquid manure (LM) is a new practice in livestock wastes recycling process and management. However, this practice is laced with various challenges including undesired leachate production, greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics poor nutrient quality of the final compost. Pragmatic utilization of the resource potential availed by combined LM and SM co-composting will be a game changer strategy for direct recycling of livestock wastes and reducing environmental contamination. By adapting a recently proposed LM addition model, we systematically investigated the promoting factors (thermophilic duration, organic matter (OM) degradation, and so on) necessary for successful co-composting of SM and LM, and for the first time examined the nutrient enrichment model essential to achieving final compost recyclability. Compared to the conventional SM co-compost, the proposed SM and LM controlled co-composting process elongated the thermophilic duration, reduced leachate generation, enhanced OM degradation, and simultaneously induced potential nutrients enrichment as evidenced by the nutrient balance analysis. The concentrations of TN, TP, TK, Cu and Zn in the controlled final compost were relatively enriched by 21.7 +/- 2.16%, 12.1 +/- 0.14%, 12.6 +/- 0.16%, 11.0 +/- 0.16% and 11.3 +/- 1.24%, respectively. In addition, the controlled co-composting technique allowed for reduction in nutrients loss due to volatile N, estimated at 28.8% decrease in N loss rate relative to the conventional SM co-compost, and approximately 1.8 t/day of livestock wastewater can be effectively managed. The study conclusively demonstrated that concomitant utilization of liquid and solid manure presents an environmental friendly and unique advantage for simultaneous management and recycling of livestock wastes.

AB  - Pose estimation as an effective method for behaviour detection has attracted wide attention in the field of animal health and welfare detection in recent years. Consequently, we can monitor individual pig behaviour changes over time, which will assist in the early detection of disease, allowing for earlier and more effective intervention. However, a real farming scenario with occlusions and opaque pig clustering may be a challenging computer vision problem. Inspired by human vision, we propose GANPose, a grouped pig pose estimation model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). This model uses the adversarial game to induce the model to learn prior information about the pig's body structure and output a pose with a reasonable skeleton structure. In addition, we also established a new pig pose estimation dataset, which not only included the basic back keypoints but also small keypoints, such as leg, elbow, and tail, as well as challenging occluded keypoints. This work is the study to tackle the occlusion problem, with a finely tuned GAN structure. Experiments and quantitative results on our dataset show that GANPose can detect keypoints of herd pigs with 74.09 % mAP, and the accuracy of the percentage of correct keypoint (PCK) is 11.37 % higher than the benchmark for occluded keypoints, achieving excellent performance in a real pigsty environment.

AB  - Experimental procedures involving farm animals are often associated with stress due to restraining. Stress can be reduced through use of positive reinforcement training, which then serves as refinement according to the 3Rs principles. Trainer skills, however, may influence the feasibility and success of animal training. The potential influence of trainer skills as well as the education of animal trainers are rarely described in literature but are necessary information for the implementation of positive reinforcement training as a refinement measure. To investigate the effect of educational programmes on animal trainers, we compared the training success of two groups of participants in training goats to elicit a behaviour that would allow simulated venipuncture. One group was educated in a two-day workshop while the other was provided with specific literature for self-instructed learning. Training success was evaluated using an assessment protocol developed for this study. A greater training success in the WORKSHOP GROUP, reflected by objective and subjective measures, was clearly supported statistically. In addition, 73 versus only 13% of the participants of the WORKSHOP GROUP and the self-instructed BOOK GROUP, respectively, stated that they could completely implement the knowledge gained in the course of this study. Our results indicate that more intensively educated trainers can train animals more successfully. In conclusion, if animal training is implemented as refinement, animal caretakers should receive instruction for positive reinforcement training.

AB  - Yellow-eyed grasses ( Xyris spp.) are flower-producing monocots found in seasonally or permanently wet habitats. Historically, they have been thought to be wind pollinated. However, recent research in North and South America has documented a number of insects pollinators, florivores, and other associates that visit Xyris flowers. We conducted a survey of Xyris flowers posted to the citizen science websites iNaturalist and BugGuide to assess whether Xyris flowers are visited by insects across their worldwide range. We found records of insect-flower interactions from all continents where Xyris occur and documented 29 arthropod taxa that had not previously been associated with yellow-eyed grasses.

KW  - Precision Livestock Farming
AB  - Pig detection in real production environments is a challenging task due to the variations of housing system and dynamic background. Though considerable progress has been made, for practical settings, there still existing challenges for densely housed pigs as they are often arbitrarily arranged at varying orientations in presence of lens distortion, overlap, occlusion, and motion blur. In this paper, we propose a rotated and oriented bounding box detector for fast and accurate predict the location and orientation of each animal. The key point is to parameterize pigs' geometric parameters (body centre, body length, body width, orientation) with an orientated bounding box (box centre, long edge, short edge and direction vector). To further improve the performance on video object detection, a fast sequential non-Maximum Suppression (FastSeq-NMS) method is proposed by making used of the orientation and temporal information. To quantitative evaluate the proposed method, 3123 images from 27 different pens were selected as training and validation sets, video clips from three new environments were selected as test set. Our lightweight model (1.7 M) achieves 99.21 Average Precision (AP@0.5) on validation set, and 96.54 AP@0.5 on test set, further improved to 97.41 AP@0.5 with the proposed NMS method. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method. More information available online: https://gi tlab.kuleuven.be/m3-biores/public/m3pig.

AB  - In temperate cold regions, the gradual resurgence of soil microbial activity during spring freeze-thaw events is frequently associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Enhanced greenhouse gas fluxes during spring freeze-thaw are related to the mineralization of bioavailable substrates, which may be elevated when soil is amended with organic residues (e.g., biobased residues such as compost, digestate, biosolids). The objective of this study was to determine the impact of biobased residues, compared to urea fertilizer, on greenhouse gas emissions during spring freeze-thaw events. The field treatments included urea (170 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), composted food waste (240 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), hydrolyzed biosolids (215 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), and anaerobic digestate (231 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Headspace gases were sampled from a closed static chamber in each replicate plot (n = 4) and categorized with three transient spring freeze-thaw phases (waterlogged, wet, and dry). Among the treatments, nitrous oxide (N2O) flux was significantly different (p < 0.05) where compost had the highest emission and digestate lowest while carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were not significantly different (p > 0.05). The greenhouse gas fluxes were significantly different among the freeze-thaw events (p < 0.05) likely due to intense microbial activity and anaerobic conditions. The CO2 and CH4 emissions were related to N2O emission (p < 0.05), and soil temperature strongly correlated with CO2 fluxes. This suggested that soil warming driven by ambient conditions as well as the type and quantity of carbon input influenced soil microbial activity, leading to greenhouse gases production. Therefore, soil amended with biobased residues may either increase or reduce greenhouse gas fluxes during spring freeze-thaw events depending on the source and production method of the organic material.

AB  - The Loyalhanna Limestone is one of the most recognizable rock units in the Appalachian Basin. Differential weathering of its large-scale cross-bedding and massive character make this unit a widely used dimension and quarry stone. Diverging thoughts on the origin of the iconic cross-bedding have led to a long-standing debate over whether the genesis of the Loyalhanna is eolian or marine. Diagnostic bedding characters exhibited by the Loyalhanna are equivocal with most features possible in environments of both subaerial or subaqueous dune formation. Other diagnostic subaerial textures such as exposure surfaces, translatent ripple laminates, tracks, and trails are unknown in the unit. However, the Loyalhanna does contain a number of features that can be attributed to subaqueous deposition. For example. endolithic algal borings and coatings are ubiquitous. The Loyalhanna Limestone also displays a north-to-south change in lithofacies characteristics. Along its northern and eastern boundaries, the typically massive Loyalhanna is interbedded with rippled sandstone and red to variegated shale. Near its southern geographic limits, the Loyalhanna is interbedded with nodular, argillaceous, fossiliferous limestone intervals. Between these two interbedded lithofacies. the unit consists of the typical massive, cross-bedded, sandy limestone. Petrographically. the Loyalhanna contains a common microfauna of endothyrid foraminifers, and fragmented brachiopods, bryozoans, and echinodernis. A macrofauna was noted at eight locations. This fauna consists of articulated brachiopods, gastropods, bivalves, and trilobites. At other locations, comminuted megafauna assemblages are widespread. These fragmental faunas are known even in north-central and northeastern Pennsylvania. The presence of marine micro- and megafossils from throughout the Loyalhanna depositional basin and the equivocal nature of the eolian features indicate that this unit is largely if not completely marine in origin.

AB  - Humans and animals use cognitive maps to represent the spatial structure of the environment. Although these maps are typically conceptualized as extending in an equipotential manner across known space, psychological evidence suggests that people mentally segment complex environments into subspaces. To understand the neurocognitive mechanisms behind this operation, we familiarized participants with a virtual courtyard that was divided into two halves by a river; we then used behavioral testing and fMRI to understand how spatial locations were encoded within this environment. Participants' spatial judgments and multivoxel activation patterns were affected by the division of the courtyard, indicating that the presence of a boundary can induce mental segmentation even when all parts of the environment are co-visible. In the hippocampus and occipital place area (OPA), the segmented organization of the environment manifested in schematic spatial codes that represented geometrically equivalent locations in the two subspaces as similar. In the retrosplenial complex (RSC), responses were more consistent with an integrated spatial map. These results demonstrate that people use both local spatial schemas and integrated spatial maps to represent segmented environment. We hypothesize that schematization may serve as a general mechanism for organizing complex knowledge structures in terms of their component elements.

AB  - For herbivorous insects with a broad diet breadth, host plant identity can influence larval development by either accelerating or delaying growth. For some species of Lepidoptera, the number of larval instars varies depending on the host plant's identity. Fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea, Drury) is a polyphagous herbivore that feeds on over 450 host plants worldwide. Of the 2 morphotypes (red- and black-head) of fall webworm, the number of instars for the red-head fall webworms has not been characterized. Given its broad diet breadth, fall webworm developmental stages may vary with plant identity. We investigated whether host plant identity affected the number of instars observed during red-head fall webworm development. We measured the head capsules of over 6,000 fall webworm larvae reared on 6 different plants commonly eaten by fall webworms in Colorado. We modeled head capsule widths as Gaussian mixture models, with a Gaussian distribution that corresponded to each instar. We show that our red-head fall webworms varied in number of instars depending on the identity of their host plant upon which they fed. We found that red-head fall webworm exhibited 7 instars on 5 of the host plants and 8 instars on 1 host plant that we studied. Our results for the number of instars for red-head fall webworm are consistent with reports of the number of instars for black-head fall webworm. Our research provides insight into the influence of host plant identity on fall webworm development, which can be used to advance lab and field research of this species.

AB  - The multifunctional cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) plays a crucial role in human steroid hormone synthesis (UniProtKB-P05093). It first carries out standard monooxygenase chemistry, converting pregnenolone (PREG) and progesterone (PROG) into 17OH-PREG and 17OH-PROG, utilizing a "Compound I" to initiate hydrogen abstraction and radical recombination in the classic "oxygen rebound" mechanism. Additionally, these hydroxylated products also serve as substrates in a second oxidative cycle which cleaves the 17-20 carbon-carbon bond to form dehydroepiandroster-one and androstenedione, which are key precursors in the generation of powerful androgens and estrogens. Interestingly, in humans, with 17OH-PREG, this so-called lyase reaction is more efficient than with 17OH-PROG, based on Kcat/Km values. In the present work, the asparagine residue at 202 position was replaced by serine, an alteration which can affect substrate orientation and control substrate preference for the lyase reaction. First, we report studies of solvent isotope effects for the N202S CYP17A1 mutant in the presence of 17OH-PREG and 17OH-PROG, which suggest that the ferric peroxo species is the predominant catalytically active intermediate in the lyase step. This conclusion is further supported by employing a combination of cryoradiolysis and resonance Raman techniques to successfully trap and structurally characterize the key reaction intermediates, including the peroxo, the hydroperoxo, and the crucial peroxo-hemiketal intermediate. Collectively, these studies show that the mutation causes active site structural changes that alter the H-bonding interactions with the key Fe-O-O fragment and the degree of protonation of the reactive ferric peroxo intermediate, thereby impacting lyase efficiency.

AB  - Cryopreservation is the most practical approach for the long-term storage of sperm in boars. However, the freezing and thawing processes result in compromised sperm function and in vitro fertilization ( IVF) success. The study aimed to evaluate the fertilizing ability of frozen-thawed semen on matured porcine oocytes following IVF. Semen was collected from three Large White boars and then transported to the laboratory for evaluation. Semen was diluted with Beltsville Thawing Solution then equilibrated at 17oC for 120 min, later centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 min at 15oC. Semen pellets were resuspended with egg yolk citrate base extender and placed back for 90 min at 5oC. Semen was supplemented with 4 different fraction B (control, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM GSH and a combination of 2.5 mM DTT + 2.5 mM GSH) extenders and loaded into 0.25 mL freezing straws, then placed in vapour for 20 min, later plunged into nitrogen tank (-196 degrees C). Semen was thawed at 37oC then evaluated for sperm motility. Pig ovaries were collected from the local abattoir and transported to the laboratory within an hour in 0.9% saline water in a thermos flask at 38oC. The slicing method was used to retrieve the oocytes from the ovaries. Oocytes were washed three times in modified Dulbecco phosphate buffered saline and modified Medium 199. Only good quality oocytes were in vitro matured for 44 hrs in North California State University-23 medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL of folliclestimulating hormone, 10 ng/mL of luteinizing hormone and 10% porcine follicular fluid. The oocytes were washed five times in pre-warmed (37oC) 100 mu l of IVF medium drops and then distributed into 50 mu l of the IVF drops. A drop of 50 mu l of capacitated diluted (1 x 106) fresh and frozen-thawed sperm was used for IVF. Sperm and oocytes were co- incubated at 38.5 degrees C in a moist atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in the air for 6 hrs. The fertilization rate was evaluated by the presence of a pronucleus with the aid of an inverted microscope using Hoechst 33342 staining. Data were analyzed using the GLM procedure. Treatment means were separated using Fisher's protected t- test least significant difference (LSD) at a 0.05 level of significance. Percentage data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation values. The sperm total motility of frozen- thawed semen ranged from 22.4 to 32.0% for all treatments ( P>0.05). The percentage of polyspermy differed significantly among the treatments (P<0.05). The total fertilization rate ranged from 31.9 to 48.7%. Raw semen (11.8 +/- 9.4) and combination of 2.5 mM DTT + 2.5 mM GSH (14.1 +/- 10.4) treatments recorded higher percentage of polyspermy as compared to the 5 mM GSH (0.8 +/- 1.9) and 5 mM DTT treatments (2.2 +/- 4.9), (P<0.05). The 5 mM DTT treatment ( 19.7 +/- 9.9) non-significantly had a high percentage of oocytes showing normal fertilization ( 2 PN) as compared to all the treatments. The 5 mM Glutathione treatment (31.9 +/- 8.6) non-significantly recorded the least percentage of total fertilization rate as compared to all the treatments (P>0.05). In conclusion, both Glutathione and Dithiothreitol did not have any effect on the fertilization rate by cryopreserved boar semen.

AB  - BackgroundGut microbes play crucial roles in the development and health of their animal hosts. However, the evolutionary relationships of gut microbes with vertebrate hosts, and the consequences that arise for the ecology and lifestyle of the microbes are still insufficiently understood. Specifically, the mechanisms by which strain-level diversity evolved, the degree by which lineages remain stably associated with hosts, and how their evolutionary history influences their ecological performance remain a critical gap in our understanding of vertebrate-microbe symbiosis.ResultsThis study presents the characterization of an extended collection of strains of Limosilactobacillus reuteri and closely related species from a wide variety of hosts by phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses combined with colonization experiments in mice to gain insight into the long-term evolutionary relationship of a bacterial symbiont with vertebrates. The phylogenetic analysis of L. reuteri revealed early-branching lineages that primarily consist of isolates from rodents (four lineages) and birds (one lineage), while lineages dominated by strains from herbivores, humans, pigs, and primates arose more recently and were less host specific. Strains from rodent lineages, despite their phylogenetic divergence, showed tight clustering in gene-content-based analyses. These L. reuteri strains but not those ones from non-rodent lineages efficiently colonize the forestomach epithelium of germ-free mice. The findings support a long-term evolutionary relationships of L. reuteri lineages with rodents and a stable host switch to birds. Associations of L. reuteri with other host species are likely more dynamic and transient. Interestingly, human isolates of L. reuteri cluster phylogenetically closely with strains from domesticated animals, such as chickens and herbivores, suggesting zoonotic transmissions.ConclusionsOverall, this study demonstrates that the evolutionary relationship of a vertebrate gut symbiont can be stable in particular hosts over time scales that allow major adaptations and specialization, but also emphasizes the diversity of symbiont lifestyles even within a single bacterial species. For L. reuteri, symbiont lifestyles ranged from autochthonous, likely based on vertical transmission and stably aligned to rodents and birds over evolutionary time, to allochthonous possibly reliant on zoonotic transmission in humans. Such information contributes to our ability to use these microbes in microbial-based therapeutics.

AB  - Changes in hydrological regimes due to rapid urbanization and increasing anthropogenic stress on hydro-geological system creating an alarming condition for the management of ground water resources. Isotope and hydro-geochemical integrated approach has been used to determine the processes governing chemical composition of groundwater and the mechanism influencing the chemical composition of groundwater in National Capital Region (NCR), Delhi. The chemical evolution of groundwater has studied by using flow direction, hydro-chemical facies, bivariate plots of ionic ratios and saturation index. Stable isotopes and tritium are used to understand the recharge mechanism. Pollution index of groundwater (PIG) is also used to check the level of contamination in the groundwater. In total, 57 water samples were collected for water chemistry, 36 water samples for environmental isotopes and 13 samples for tritium measurement. The dominant water type is Ca-Mg-HCO3 and mixed water type. The dominant cation are Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ and dominant anions are HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-> NO3-. The bicarbonate type water is dominant in quartzite, implies rapid and direct recharge through fracture and joints. Ionic ratios and saturation indices show that major processes controlling groundwater evolution are silicate hydrolysis and reverse cation exchange in the quartzite. Average values of delta 2H and delta 18O are-43.66 %o and-6.28%o. Stable isotopic ratio of groundwater of alluvium area falling on evap-oration line, due to the prevailing semi-arid and arid climatic conditions, evaporation is the predominant factor affecting the chemistry of groundwater. The stable isotope shows that the groundwater in the quartzite is mostly meteoric in origin and acting as a recharge area for the nearby alluvium aquifer. Tritium results reveal that groundwater occurring in quartzite and al-luvium aquifer in western parts are older than that of groundwater occurring in alluvium aquifer in the eastern parts.13% of groundwater samples are falling in very high pollution zone mainly occurring in alluvium aquifer that lies in the Eastern parts. It is inferred that alluvium aquifer (low lying) is having greater impact of anthropogenic activity than quartzite aquifer (high land).

AB  - Atrazine (ATZ), a widely used herbicide, induces neurotoxicity by disrupting microglial efferocytosis-a critical process for maintaining central nervous system homeostasis. Lycopene (LYC), a natural antioxidant, exhibits protective potential against pesticide-induced damage, yet its role in ATZ-impaired efferocytosis remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that LYC mitigates ATZ-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation and microglial dysfunction in mice. ATZ exposure triggered M1 polarization of microglia, apoptosis, and mitochondrial damage, accompanied by suppressed efferocytosis. However, LYC treatment significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, CD68), enhanced anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10, TGF-beta), and restored mitochondrial integrity. Mechanistically, LYC upregulated MERTK expression (phagocytic receptor), facilitating microglial efferocytosis via enhanced IBA-1/MERTK colocalization. Molecular docking revealed a strong binding affinity between LYC and MERTK (-8.9 kcal/mol), suggesting direct interaction. These findings highlight MERTK as a novel target for LYC-mediated neuroprotection against ATZ toxicity, providing insights into potential dietary interventions for pesticide-associated neurological disorders.

AB  - The expansion of Homo sapiens and our interaction with local environments, including the replacement or absorption of local populations, is a key component in understanding the evolution of our species. Of special interest are artifacts made from hard animal tissues from layers at Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria) that have been attributed to the Initial Upper Paleolithic. The Initial Upper Paleolithic is characterized by Levallois-like blade technologies that can co-occur with bone tools and ornaments and likely represents the dispersal of H. sapiens into several regions throughout Eurasia starting by 45 ka or possibly earlier. Osseous artifacts from the Initial Upper Paleolithic are important components of this record and have the potential to contribute to our understanding of group interactions and population movements. Here, we present a zooarchaeological, technological, and functional analysis of the diverse and sizable osseous artifact collection from Bacho Kiro Cave. Animal raw material sources are consistent with taxa found within the faunal assemblage including cervids, large bovids, and cave bears. A variety of bone tool morphologies, both formal and informal, indicate a diverse technological approach for conducting various on-site activities, many of which were focused on the processing of animal skins, likely for cold weather clothing. Technological flexibility is also evident in the manufacture of personal ornaments, which were made primarily from carnivore teeth, especially cave bear, though herbivore teeth and small beads are also represented. The osseous artifacts from Bacho Kiro Cave provide a series of insights into the bone technology and indirectly on the social aspects of these humans in southeast Europe, and when placed within the broader Initial Upper Paleolithic context, both regional and shared behaviors are evidently indicating widespread innovation and complexity. This is especially significant given the location and chronology of the site in the context of H. sapiens dispersals. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary This work investigates the olfactory mechanism of aphids with varying preferences for TMX-coated and uncoated wheat plants. This study utilized the olfactory localization preferences of aphids to identify the volatile metabolites of both TMX-coated and uncoated wheat. The differential metabolites were then used to assess the olfactory behavior of aphids. The results indicated that four compounds had repellent activity towards aphids, while two compounds demonstrated attracting activity towards aphids. These findings highlight the potential of using TMX-induced VOCs to manage aphid behavior and develop environmentally friendly pest control strategies.Abstract Pesticides can induce target plants to release odors that are attractive or repellent to their herbivore insects. But, to date, the activity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), singly or as mixtures, which play a crucial role in the olfactory behavior of herbivore insects, remains unclear. The objective of our research was to investigate the impact of thiamethoxam (TMX), a pesticide, on the emission of odors by wheat plants, and how these odors influence the behavior of grain aphids (Sitobion miscanthi). S. miscanthi showed a greater repellent response to the volatiles emitted by Thx-induced plants compared to those emitted by uncoated plants. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS), we discovered that TMX greatly induced the release of VOCs in wheat plants. For instance, the levels of Bornyl acetate, 2-Oxepanone, Methyl acrylate, Cyclohexene, alpha-Pinene, and 1-Nonanol in coated wheat plants were significantly higher as compared to uncoated wheat plants. Moreover, varying concentrations also had an impact on the olfactory behavior of S. miscanthi. For instance, Cyclohexene exhibited clear attractiveness to aphids at concentrations of 100 mu L/mL, whereas it displayed evident repellent properties at concentrations of 1 mu L/mL and 10 mu L/mL. These new findings demonstrate how TMX-induced VOCs affect the behavior of S. miscanthi and could help in developing innovative approaches to manage aphids by manipulating the emission of plant volatiles. Furthermore, these findings can also be utilized to evaluate substances that either attract or repel aphids, with the aim of implementing early monitoring and environmentally friendly methods to manage aphids, while simultaneously impeding the spread of viruses.

AB  - Herbivore feeding often increases secondary metabolite production in plants. These herbivore-induced plant proteins might end up in honeydew excreted by phloem-feeding insects. This is important because honeydew is one of the most abundant and accessible carbohydrate sources for natural enemies in many agroecosystems and these proteins can thus mediate many tri-trophic interactions. Here, we hypothesized that defensive metabolites induced in the phloem by herbivory accumulate in the honeydew excreted by phloem-feeding insects and, consequently, affect the fitness of the herbivores' natural enemies that feed on it. We used a tri-trophic system consisting of citrus plants, the mealybug Planococcus citri and its primary parasitoid Anagyrus vladimiri. First, we assessed A. vladimiri fitness when fed on P. citri honeydew. We then collected honeydew of seven phloem-feeding insects, including P. citri, and analysed their protein content. Finally, we analysed the effect of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant enzyme associated with plant defences that was commonly found in the analysed honeydews, on A. vladimiri fitness. The fitness of A. vladimiri increased when fed on honeydew compared to a sucrose-based diet, demonstrating that honeydew can contain compounds that benefit natural enemies. Proteomic analyses showed that defence-related plant proteins were present in honeydew of seven phloem-feeding insects analysed. Among these, the enzyme SOD was present in honeydew of all of them. Moreover, the levels of SOD were 10-fold higher in the phloem of plants infested by P. citri than in that of uninfested plants. SOD was also actively excreted in P. citri honeydew, and we proved that it increases the fecundity of the parasitoid A. vladimiri. We conclude that enzymatic proteins induced by herbivory in the phloem and involved in plant defence, accumulate in the honeydew excreted by phloem-feeding insects and, contrary to the current paradigm, at least some of these can have positive effects on the third trophic level.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   Al alimentarse de las plantas, los insectos herb & iacute;voros suelen inducir en & eacute;stas la producci & oacute;n de metabolitos secundarios. Estos compuestos pueden terminar en la melaza que excretan los propios insectos que se han alimentado del floema. Esto es importante porque la melaza es una de las fuentes de carbohidratos m & aacute;s abundantes y accesibles para los enemigos naturales en la mayor & iacute;a de agroecosistemas y, por tanto, estos metabolitos pueden modular numerosas interacciones tritr & oacute;ficas. En este estudio, se plante & oacute; si los metabolitos inducidos por los insectos herb & iacute;voros que se alimentan del floema se acumulan en la melaza que excretan y, en consecuencia, afectan los par & aacute;metros biol & oacute;gicos de los enemigos naturales que se alimentan de esta melaza. Las especies seleccionadas para este estudio fueron los c & iacute;tricos como plantas, la cochinilla Planococcus citri como herb & iacute;voro que se alimenta de floema y excreta melaza y su parasitoide primario Anagyrus vladimiri. Primero, se evalu & oacute; la longevidad y fecundidad de A. vladimiri cuando se aliment & oacute; de melaza de P. citri. Luego, se recolect & oacute; melaza de siete especies de insectos que se alimentan del floema, incluyendo P. citri, y se analiz & oacute; su contenido de prote & iacute;nas. Finalmente, se evalu & oacute; el efecto de la prote & iacute;na super & oacute;xido dismutasa (SOD) en la longevidad y fecundidad de A. vladimiri. Esta enzima, de reconocido efecto antioxidante y asociada con las defensas de las plantas, se encontr & oacute; en todas las melazas analizadas. La longevidad y fecundidad de A. vladimiri fue mayor cuando se aliment & oacute; de melaza que cuando lo hizo de una dieta basada s & oacute;lo en az & uacute;cares, demostrando que la melaza puede contener otros compuestos que benefician a los enemigos naturales. Los an & aacute;lisis prote & oacute;micos mostraron que hab & iacute;a prote & iacute;nas vegetales relacionadas con la defensa en la melaza excretada por las siete especies de insectos. Entre ellas, la enzima SOD, con niveles expresi & oacute;n diez veces m & aacute;s altos en el floema de plantas infestadas por P. citri que en plantas no infestadas. Al a & ntilde;adir SOD a una dieta basada en az & uacute;cares, la fecundidad del parasitoide A. vladimiri aument & oacute; de forma significativa. Este estudio concluye que las prote & iacute;nas enzim & aacute;ticas inducidas en la defensa de las plantas, se acumulan en la melaza excretada por insectos que se alimentan del floema y, contrariamente al paradigma actual, algunas de estas enzimas tienen efectos positivos en el tercer nivel tr & oacute;fico.

AB  - Sperm capacitation is a complex process endowing biological and biochemical changes to a spermatozoon for a successful encounter with an oocyte. The present study focused on the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in the remodeling of the sperm surface subproteome. The sperm surface subproteome from non-capacitated and in vitro capacitated (IVC) porcine spermatozoa, with and without proteasomal inhibition, was selectively isolated. The purified sperm surface subproteome was analyzed using high-resolution, quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in four replicates. We identified 1680 HUGO annotated proteins, out of which we found 91 to be at least 1.5x less abundant (p < 0.05) and 141 to be at least 1.5x more abundant (p < 0.05) on the surface of IVC spermatozoa. These proteins were associated with sperm capacitation, hyperactivation, metabolism, acrosomal exocytosis, and fertilization. Abundances of 14 proteins were found to be significantly different (p < 0.05), exceeding a 1.5-fold abundance between the proteasomally inhibited (100 & mu;M MG132) and vehicle control (0.2% ethanol) groups. The proteins NIF3L1, CSE1L, NDUFB7, PGLS, PPP4C, STK39, and TPRG1L were found to be more abundant; while BPHL, GSN, GSPT1, PFDN4, STYXL1, TIMM10, and UBXN4 were found to be less abundant in proteasomally inhibited IVC spermatozoa. Despite the UPS having a narrow range of targets, it modulated sperm metabolism and binding by regulating susceptible surface proteins. Changes in CSE1L, PFDN4, and STK39 during in vitro capacitation were confirmed using immunocytochemistry, image-based flow cytometry, and Western blotting. The results confirmed the active participation of the UPS in the extensive sperm surface proteome remodeling that occurs during boar sperm capacitation. This work will help us to identify new pharmacological mechanisms to positively or negatively modulate sperm fertilizing ability in food animals and humans.

AB  - Simple Summary In endoparasitoids that feed within small discrete resource patches, such as seeds or fruits, body size could be subject to a trade-off: larger size could lead to increased overall fitness but could simultaneously increase the risk of resource depletion and starvation, resulting in a body size just below the host holding capacity. We analyzed the relationship of the larval size of the within-fruits-developing curculionid beetle Curculio styracis (Roelofs, 1875) and the size of the fruits of its two congeneric host species of Camellia to test this hypothesis. A logistic model can most accurately describe larval size in association with host-fruit size after a series of models were tested. Based on the characteristics of the optimal model, the hypothesis seemed to be confirmed because larvae that developed in host plant with larger fruits had a larger size, and larval size in both host species remained only a little below the host-fruit capacity. The novelty of the study is that this hypothesis is being tested in a more formal way using appropriate mathematical models. The endoparasitoid body size hypothesis suggests that the size of larvae that develop in a single host should be subject to a trade-off: larger size could lead to increase overall fitness but could simultaneously increase the risk of resource depletion and starvation, resulting in a body size just below the host holding capacity. However, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested using mathematical models thus far. The camellia weevil, C. styracis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a notorious pest attacking fruits of Camellia oleifera Abel. and C. meiocarpa Hu., in which the larvae develop within a single fruit and larval development is limited by the available food resources. We developed a feasible method to test this hypothesis. First, five models were used to describe the relationship between larval mass and host size. Then, the minimum fruit threshold that had to be met for ad libitum larval development and the corresponding larval size (W-a) of this threshold were calculated based on the characteristics of the optimal model. Finally, the difference between the measured larval size and the predicted larval size (W-a) was determined. The results showed that (1) the data were better described by a logistic function than any other equation; (2) larval size in both host plants increased with increasing fruit size until leveling off when the fruits were large enough to allow unconstrained larval development; (3) larval size remained just below the host-fruit holding capacity, as there was no difference between the measured and predicted larval sizes (W-a); and (4) larvae developed in host plant with larger fruits had a larger size. These results confirmed the endoparasitoid body size hypothesis.

AB  - Successful pregnancy establishment in mammals depends on numerous interactions between embryos and the maternal organism. Estradiol-17 beta (E2) is the primary embryonic signal in the pig, and its importance has been questioned recently. However, E2 is not the only molecule of embryonic origin. In pigs, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is abundantly synthesized and secreted by conceptuses and endometrium. The present study aimed to determine the role of PGE2 and its simultaneous action with E2 in changes in porcine endometrial transcriptome during pregnancy establishment. The effects of PGE2 and PGE2 acting with E2 were studied using an in vivo model of intrauterine hormone infusions, and were compared to the effects of E2 alone and conceptuses' presence on day 12 of pregnancy. The endometrial transcriptome was profiled using gene expression microarrays followed by statistical analyses. Downstream analyses were performed using bioinformatics tools. Differential expression of selected genes was verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Microarray analysis revealed 2413 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the endometrium treated simultaneously with PGE2 and E2 (P < 0.01). No significant effect of PGE2 administered alone on endometrial transcriptome was detected. Gene ontology annotations enriched for DEGs were related to multiple processes such as: focal adhesion, vascularization, cell migration and proliferation, glucose metabolism, tissue remodeling, and activation of immune response. Simultaneous administration of E2 and PGE2 induced more changes within endometrial transcriptome characteristic to pregnancy than infusion of E2 alone. The present findings suggest that synergistic action of estradiol-17 beta and PGE2 resembles the effects of pregnancy on endometrial transcriptome better than E2 alone.
   Summary sentence
   Prostaglandin E2 acting simultaneously with estradiol-17 beta in vivo induces more changes within porcine endometrial transcriptome resembling pregnancy effects compared with estradiol-17 beta administered alone.

AB  - Blastocerus dichotomus is the largest deer in South America. We have used 25 microsatellite markers detected and genotyped by Next Generation Sequencing to estimate the genetic variability of B. dichotomus in Argentina, where most of its populations are threatened. Primer design was based on the sequence of a shallow partial genome (15,967,456 reads; 16.66% genome coverage, mean depth 1.64) of a single individual. From the thousands of microsatellite loci found, even under high stringency selection, we chose and tested a set of 80 markers on 30 DNA samples extracted from tissue and feces from three Argentinean populations. Heterozygosity levels were low across all loci in all populations (H=0.31 to 0.40). Amplicon sequencing is a fast, easy, and affordable technique that can be very useful for the characterization of microsatellite marker sets for the conservation genetics of non-model organisms. This work is also one of the first ones to use amplicon sequencing in non-invasive samples and represents an important development for the study of threatened species.

AB  - The global population as well as the demand for human food is rapidly growing worldwide, which necessitates improvement of efficiency in livestock operations. In this context, environmental factors during fetal and/or neonatal life have been observed to influence normal physical and physiological function of an individual during adulthood, and this phenomenon is called fetal or developmental programming. While numerous studies have reported the impact of maternal factors on development of the female progeny, limited information is available on the potential effects of fetal programming on reproductive function of the male offspring. Therefore, the objective for this review article was to focus on available literature regarding the impact of maternal factors, particularly maternal nutrition, on reproductive system of the male offspring. To this end, we highlighted developmental programming of the male offspring in domestic species (i. e., pig , cow and sheep) as well as laboratory species (i.e., mice and rat) during pregnancy and lactation. In this sense, we pointed out the effects of maternal nutrition on various functions of the male offspring including hypothalamic -pituitary axis, hormonal levels, testicular tissue and semen parameters.

AB  - 1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) is a highly toxic neurotoxicity, and the brain tissue is the main target organ. At present, long-term exposure to 1,2-DCE has been shown to cause cognitive dysfunction in some studies, but the mechanism is not clear. The results of this study showed that long-term 1,2-DCE exposure decreased learning and memory abilities in mice and impaired the structure and morphology of neurons in the hippocampal region. Moreover, except for the mRNA level of PAG, the enzymatic activities and protein levels of GS and PAG, as well as the mRNA level of GS were inhibited. With increasing dose of exposure, the protein and mRNA expression of GLAST and GLT-1 also decreased. Contrarily, there were protein and mRNA expression upregulation of GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B in the hippocampus, as well as increased levels of extracellular Glu and intracellular Ca2+. In addition, 1,2-DCE exposure also downregulated the protein expression levels of CaM, CaMKII and CREB. Taken together, our results suggest that long-term 1,2-DCE exposure impairs the learning and memory capacity in mice, which may be attributed to the disruption of Glu metabolism and the inhibition of CaM-CaMKII-CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus.

AB  - Sleep plays a crucial role in the modulation of physiological and cognitive functions. Many studies have reported the impairment effect of sleep deprivation (SD) on cognitive functions such as learning and memory. On the other hand, lithium as one of the oldest drugs used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, affects cognitive functions and mood state. In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of lithium, SD (for 24 h), and the interaction effect of SD and lithium, on memory function and anxiety-like behavior. The water box, the shuttle box, elevated plus maze, and the three-chamber paradigm test were used to evaluate rat's behavior. Also, lithium was injected intraperitoneal at the doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, for three consecutive days. The results showed that SD impaired passive avoidance memory and social interaction memory, and decreased anxiety-like behavior. Lithium also impaired passive avoidance memory and induced an anxiolytic effect, while it improved social interaction memory and reversed the impairment effect of SD on social interaction memory. In conclusion, we suggested that interaction effect of SD and lithium on the function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glycogen synthase kinase3-13 (GSK3-13) may be involved in the modulation of cognitive functions. As a limitation of this research, it was declared that we did not evaluate the function of GSK3-13 and BDNF in the brain of rats, especially in the hippocampus. We suggested conducting more studies focusing on the interaction of SD and lithium on the function of BDNF and GSK3-13, and on different cognitive functions.

AB  - White spruce (Picea glauca) emits monoterpenes that function as defensive signals and weapons after herbivore attack. We assessed the effects of drought and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, used as a proxy for herbivory, on monoterpenes and other isoprenoids in P. glauca. The emission of monoterpenes was significantly increased after MeJA treatment compared to the control, but drought suppressed the MeJA-induced increase. The composition of the emitted blend was altered strongly by stress, with drought increasing the proportion of oxygenated compounds and MeJA increasing the proportion of induced compounds such as linalool and (E)-beta-ocimene. In contrast, no treatment had any significant effect on the levels of stored monoterpenes and diterpenes. Among other MEP pathway-derived isoprenoids, MeJA treatment decreased chlorophyll levels by 40%, but had no effect on carotenoids, while drought stress had no impact on either of these pigment classes. Of the three described spruce genes encoding 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) catalyzing the first step of the MEP pathway, the expression of only one, DXS2B, was affected by our treatments, being increased by MeJA and decreased by drought. These findings show the sensitivity of monoterpene emission to biotic and abiotic stress regimes, and the mediation of the response by DXS genes.

AB  - L-arginine (L-Arg) is a semiessential amino acid that plays crucial roles in the reproductive performance of animals. This research aimed to investigate the effect of supplementing L-Arg on endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) of Hu sheep. In vivo, female Hu sheep were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n = 5), nutrient-restricted group (n = 5), and L-Arg supplemented nutrient-restricted group (n = 5). Then, the effect of L-Arg on ovine endometrial growth and antioxidant capacity was assessed. We found that L-Arg supplementation promoted the growth of endometrial ductal gland invaginations (DGI), and alleviated oxidative stress in nutrient-restricted sheep. In order to investigate its mechanism, a H2O2-induced EECs oxidative stress model was established, and roles of L-Arg in EECs oxidation resistance, proliferation, apoptosis and endocrine activity were studied in vitro. Our results showed that L-Arg markedly decreased the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malonaldehyde (MDA), and enhanced the expression and activity of certain antioxidant enzymes in EECs challenged by the H2O2 (p < 0.05). Supplementation of L-Arg significantly reduced the effect of 200 mM H2O2 on the viability of EECs (p < 0.05). In addition, EECs treated with L-Arg significantly alleviated the G0/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the inhibition of endometrial growth factors expression caused by H2O2 (p < 0.05). Overall, the results demonstrate that L-Arg performs crucial roles in maintaining the proliferation of ovine EECs, endocrine activity and inhibiting apoptosis through reducing oxidative stress. This study offers a theoretical basis for using L-Arg to improve sheep the uterine function. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrogen metabolism plays pivotal roles in the stress response of plants. Nitrate (NO3-) is a crucial factor that enhances plant tolerance to hypoxia. This study subjected tea plants to hypoxia stress and conducted a comprehensive analysis of their free amino acid content, NO3- absorption and distribution rates, endogenous NO3- and NH4+ levels, as well as the expression of related genes. The results indicated that hypoxic stress reduced both the total free amino acids and theanine content in tea plants, while significantly increased the levels of alanine (Ala) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Analysis using 15N-labeled NO3- revealed that hypoxic stress increased the absorption rate of NO3-. Furthermore, the distribution rate of 15NO3- was increased in roots but decreased in stems and leaves, suggesting that hypoxia impairs the transport of NO3- from underground parts to aboveground parts in tea plants. The ratio of NO3-/NH4+ was significantly reduced in roots, while increased in leaves under hypoxic conditions, indicating enhanced nitrate assimilation in roots but diminished assimilation in leaves during such stress. This study provides valuable insights into understanding how hypoxia affects nitrate absorption and amino acid metabolism in tea plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Ca Rater Mallorqui is a hunting and ratting dog that prevents disease spread and economic losses related to rodent activities on farms. Their presence on farms decreases the need for chemical products against rats and other rodents. Unfortunately, the breed's number of births has declined. We aimed to study the intra and interracial characterisation of the Ca Rater Mallorqui dog breed, clarify its genetic structure and relationship to other related canine breeds, and find preservation solutions for the breed. Our results clearly show that it is a genetically independent and well-defined breed. However, according to census data, this breed should be part of a conservation plan. Our study provides essential knowledge of the Ca Rater Mallorqui genetic situation and constitutes the starting point for designing and implementing a conservation plan to avoid extinction. Ca Rater Mallorqui is a dog breed from the Island of Mallorca (Spain) traditionally used as a hunting and ratting dog to prevent disease spread and economic losses related to rodent activities on farms. However, the census data shows a population decline that should be addressed by implementing a conservation program. The first step to implementing a conservation plan is knowing the genetic situation of the Ca Rater Mallorqui population. Therefore, we aimed to genetically characterise the breed in our study. We analysed 33 microsatellites recommended by the International Society of Animal Genetics (ISAG) in 77 samples. Data were obtained from 13 samples of Balearic, Spanish, and international dog breeds to study the genetic diversity among breeds. The population did not significantly deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with heterozygosity (Ho) of 0.655 and expected heterozygosity (He) of 0.685. The Wright's fixation indices, the Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA), a dendrogram representing Reynolds genetic distance between populations, and the pairwise F-ST values establish the Ca Rater Mallorqui as an independent breed distinct from the Balearic, Spanish, and international breeds.

AB  - Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is a hydrolyzate of the structural polysaccharide, chitin, extracted from crab and shrimp shells, which has significant health benefits for humans including boosting immunity. However, there is limited information on the potential use of COS for sheep health and production. We supplemented COS via a loose lick to pregnant ewes maintained on pasture for 11 weeks with an estimated COS intake @100-600 mg/d/ewe from 5 weeks pre-lambing until lamb marking at similar to 4 weeks of age. We demonstrated that COS is readily incorporated into sheep supplementary feed without compromising palatability. Maternal COS supplementation did not influence the body weight of ewes or lambs, but it significantly increased serum interleukin 2 concentrations in both ewes and lambs at marking and weaning, while boosting the first line of immune defence of the lamb through an increase in serum immunoglobulin M at lamb marking. Other immune markers or cytokines were not affected by maternal COS supplementation in either ewes or lambs.
   Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is derived through deacetylation of chitin from crustacean shells. Previous studies reported the benefits of COS to gut microbiota, immunity and health of host species. In this study, 120 pregnant composite ewes were subdivided into treatment and control groups in duplicate. COS was supplemented via a loose lick to provide an estimated intake of COS @100-600 mg/d/ewe for five weeks pre-lambing until lamb marking. Body weight was recorded pre-treatment for ewes, and at lamb marking and weaning for both ewes and lambs. Serum immunity markers immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), interleukin (IL)-2, IL10 and faecal sIgA were determined for ewes and lambs at lamb marking and weaning by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that COS can be incorporated in sheep feed without compromising palatability. Maternal COS supplementation did not influence the body weight of ewes or lambs. It did, however, significantly increase the concentrations of serum IL2 in ewes at marking and weaning (p < 0.001). In lambs, COS also significantly increased the IL2 concentration at making (p = 0.018) and weaning (p = 0.029) and serum IgM at marking (p < 0.001). No significant effect was observed in the concentration of any other immune marker or cytokine in either ewes or lambs. In conclusion, maternal COS supplementation significantly modulated some immunity markers in both ewes and lambs. The short duration of maternal COS supplementation and optimal seasonal conditions during the trial may explain the lack of significant body weight in ewes and lambs from the COS supplementation.
   Implications: Our findings indicate that COS can be incorporated in sheep feed without compromising palatability and maternal COS supplementation significantly modulated some immunity markers in both ewes and lambs, implying the functional role of COS and its use as a feed additive for improving sheep production and immunity. Findings from this study will help to develop alternative nutritional strategies to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases in sheep. COS can thus be proposed as a cost-effective functional feed targeting pregnant and lactating ewes and weaner lambs to improve sheep production.

AB  - Simple Summary This study evaluated the impacts of incentive and disincentive mechanisms in ensuring environmentally friendly livestock waste management, drawing on a survey of 499 pig farmers from China. An assessment framework was developed and empirically tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings suggest incentives and disincentives can be effective in ensuring adoption of environmentally friendly livestock waste management practices. However, the disincentive mechanism demonstrated relatively lower interaction values than the incentive mechanism. The survey results indicated that discounts, subsidies, and training provision were the most impactful factors. In summary, the balance and interactions between incentives and disincentives need to be well-planned and managed to strengthen farmers' adoption of environmentally friendly livestock waste management practices. Environmentally friendly waste management (EFWM) is a safer way of waste disposal that can foster a cleaner environment for both farms and their surroundings. It may lessen land, air, and water pollution, as well as moderate ecological footprints, and aid in sustainable agricultural development, which has become one of the major concerns of the modern era. To achieve these outcomes, incentives and control mechanisms initiated by the government may alter farmers' behavior. The study involved a review of relevant literature and the conduct of interviews with 499 pig breeders to evaluate the impacts of government incentives and control mechanisms on fostering the adoption of environmentally friendly waste management practices by farmers. A theoretical framework based on existing studies is proposed, utilizing a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to analyze the data and illustrate the relationships among incentives and control mechanisms. The results show that: (i) overall the impacts of incentive mechanisms were stronger and more effective than those of control mechanisms. Among them, subsidy policy and discount policy were the most influential for farmers' adoption behavior. However, penalty and disincentive policy also impacted the outcome variables; (ii) a significant relationship was observed among regulatory, disincentive, and subsidy policies and a moderate relationship among penalty, insurance, and discount policies. However, bonus-community service and social critic policies did not show any significant relationship with any other variables. The research findings can assist the Chinese government in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of two crucial mechanisms and promoting the adoption of environmentally friendly practices by farmers. The government should highlight and strengthen the importance of social obligations and orientation, as well as providing monetary support at the rural level to improve farmers' ability to adapt to environmentally friendly waste management practices.

AB  - High levels of social stress are known to negatively impact pig welfare. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of social stress in growing-finishing pigs by measuring serum metabolome changes and saliva biomarkers. Seventy-two undocked pigs (thirty-six males and thirty-six females) were housed in single-sex pens of four, with the second dominant pig in each pen selected as the focal pig. A social challenge was conducted by mixing the focal pig with three new pigs in its home pen on two consecutive days on trial days 62-64. Saliva and blood samples were collected, and the pigs' behaviour and body lesions were evaluated pre- and post-challenge. A total of 630 serum metabolites were analysed, 292 of which could be statistically compared using Biocrates WebIDQ v5 software. Salivary haptoglobin concentrations and the number of body lesions significantly increased after the challenge (p < 0.001), whereas the average daily weight gain decreased (p < 0.05). The serum showed decreases in essential amino acids (Thr, Met, and Phe), non-essential amino acids (Glu, Asn, Asp, Pro, and Tyr), betaine, ornithine, indoxyl sulphate, taurine, and some blood di- and triacylglycerols (q < 0.05), and increases in oleic, eicosanoic, eicosadienoic, and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acids; EPA; and DHA post-challenge (q < 0.05). Overall, the results suggest the potential of metabolomics as a tool providing a more holistic view of the impact of social stress.

AB  - Sperm cells are highly susceptible to oxidative stress, which decreases their motility and fertility. However, glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in protecting sperm cells from oxidative damage, a common byproduct of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. On the other hand, GSH biosynthesis in sperm is limited by the availability of cysteine (Cys), which is inherently unstable and found at low concentrations in boar seminal plasma. In somatic cells, Cys can be produced through the transsulfuration pathway, catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH). In this study, we report that a group of enzymes involved in GSH synthesis is present in boar sperm. Notably, CBS and CTH protein levels increase during incubation, suggesting active regulation of their synthesis. This increase is inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary for maintaining these levels. Our study also identified the presence of translation factors, such as eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and their activation through phosphorylation of the ERK1/2-RSK-eIF4E pathway during incubation. Additionally, we found that CBS mRNA transcripts with short poly(A) tails are present in boar sperm, and polyadenylation of these short-tailed mRNAs occurs during incubation to enhance their translation. The use of cordycepin, a polyadenylation inhibitor, significantly reduced the translation of CBS, leading to decreased GSH synthesis and impaired sperm motility. However, the addition of cysteine counteracted the inhibitory effects of cordycepin, underscoring the essential role of cysteine in maintaining GSH levels. These findings provide new insights into the post-transcriptional regulation of GSH synthesis in sperm and suggest potential strategies for enhancing sperm preservation and fertility by targeting polyadenylation and translation mechanisms.

AB  - Hippophae tibetana is an enigmatic least explored Seabuckthorn species, with exceptional adaptability to sub-zero temperatures in Trans-Himalayan region. This study integrates physiological and transcriptional profiling to understand its unique cold stress resilience. The physiological assessment including chlorophyll content, relative water content, and electrolyte leakage were least affected during the early response (ER) of cold stress as compared to prolonged (PR) and freeze response (FR), which was effectively restored during the recovery phase (RR). Genome-guided de novo assembly yielded 25,176 high-quality unigenes (N50: 2195 bp; BUSCO: 92.9%), with 75.9% functionally annotated using NCBI-nr, Araport11, SwissProt, COG, KEGG, and Pfam databases. Clustering of differentially expressed unigenes revealed ER (4467 DEGs) and RR (4478) grouped distinctly from PR (14,150) and FR (14,528), underscoring significantly heightened transcriptional reprogramming during PR/FR compared to ER/RR. Furthermore, the integration of transcriptional interactome network with GO and KEGG enrichment highlighted ICE1-CBF regulatory network with significant upregulation of Inducer of CBF Expression (ICE1), Cold receptive protein kinase (CRPK1), anti-freeze proteins (AFPs), and pathways like jasmonic acid signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, and membrane stabilization as key to cold tolerance during PR and FR phases. The current study advances our understanding of cold stress resilience in H. tibetana, elucidating its adaptive mechanisms in extreme Trans-Himalayan environments. The comprehensive genomic resources and key candidates identified here may provide a foundation for discovering cold tolerance-associated genome-wide variations in priority crops and plantation species.

AB  - Deer antlers, usually harvested annually on a farm, are an accessible material used to determine the exposition to potentially toxic elements, PTEs, during growth. Moreover, the study of antlers from animals of different ages allows the assessment of long-term exposition to these elements. The aim of the study was to analyze the concentration of eight potentially toxic elements (Cd, Pb, As, Ba, Ni, Sr, La, Ce) in individual positions of the antlers (first, second, and third position, corresponding to the stages of development and life of these animals) and in the food that the animals consumed during the growth of individual antler fragments, depending on the age of the farmed fallow deer (Dama dama). The mineral composition of samples was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The analysis included 31 male deer aged 2-8 years old. The average concentration of Pb, Ba, and Ni was higher in the second position of the antler, and As, La, and Ce in the third position. In addition, the oldest individuals showed a higher Cd, Pb, and As concentration in the third position. A significant positive relationship was found between the age of animals and accumulation of As (r = 0.582, p < 0.05), as well as Ba and Sr (r = -0.534, r = -0.644 at p < 0.05, respectively). The average content of Ba and Sr also significantly negatively depended on body mass and antler mass stags (r = -0.436, r = -0.515 at p < 0.05, respectively). Cd concentration in feed was significantly higher in June compared to winter, spring, and later summer (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the concentration of Ba in food was significantly higher in spring and winter than in early and later summer (p < 0.05). An increase in the PTEs in the pasture determined the concentration of these components in fallow deer antlers.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the effects of crude garden cress seed oil (CGCSO) on frozen-thawed boar sperm qualities. Semen ejaculates (n = 12) were collected and further divided into six equal aliquots based on CGCSO concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5% v/v) in the freezing extender. Semen samples were processed and cryopreserved utilizing the traditional liquid nitrogen vapor technique. Subsequently, semen samples were thawed in a thermos with warm water at 50 degrees C for 12 s and evaluated for sperm morphology using scanning electron microscopy, sperm motility using a CASA, sperm viability, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial function, MDA level, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) activity. The results indicated that 1% CGCSO resulted in superior post-thaw sperm characteristics, including enhanced sperm morphology, motility, viability, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial function. Particularly, the total motile sperm increased by 16.5%, progressive motile sperm increased by 13.0%, viability improved by 15.1%, acrosome integrity increased by 14%, and mitochondrial function improved by 14.1% compared to the control group. CGCSO treatment at 1% and 1.5% exhibited the lowest level of MDA (45.73 +/- 11.2 and 45.73 +/- 11.3 mu mol/L, respectively) compared to the other groups. The CGCSO-supplemented groups showed higher values of TAC, GSH-Px, and CAT than the control group but not significantly.

AB  - A safe water supply is a necessity, but it remains one of the backlogs of services rendered in rural areas of developing countries. This leads to vulnerable communities using water from available sources that is unsafe as it is contaminated with faecal matter. Microbial source tracking (MST) methods are gold-standard techniques that detect the exact sources of faecal contamination. This study, therefore, tracked and identified the exact sources of faecal contamination from the catchment to the point of use in rural areas of Vhembe District Municipality. Collected water samples (n = 1048) were concentrated by membrane filtration for the enumeration and detection of E. coli, followed by DNA extraction. The extracted DNA was subjected to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to track target host-specific Bacteroidales genetic markers from the water source to the point of use. Rivers and dams exhibited maximum E. coli counts of up to 90 CFU/100 mL during the wet season and up to 50 CFU/100 mL during the dry season. Due to the effective treatment of these water sources, no E. coli bacteria were detected in any of the sampled municipal drinking water treatment plants at the point of treatment, while this indicator bacterium was detected at the point of use (households), with a maximum of 4 CFU/100 mL recorded during both the wet and dry seasons. Overall, the most prevalent MST marker exhibited during the wet season was BacCan (dog-associated, 6.87%), followed by BacCow (cow-associated, 5.53%), while Pig-2-Bac (pig-associated, 2.48%) was the least prevalent. The most prevalent marker exhibited during the dry season was BacCan (5.34%), followed by BacCow, with Pig-2-Bac (1.72%) being the least prevalent. A positive correlation (r = 0.31, p = 0.001) was established between the presence of the MST markers and detected E. coli from water sources to the point of use. The knowledge of the faecal contamination attributes in both public and domestic domains will assist in developing prevention and control strategies.

AB  - Soil water-dispersible colloidal phosphorus (WCP) presents high mobility, however, the regulatory effect of biochar-coupled organic fertilizer is rarely known, especially under different cropping patterns. This study investigated the P adsorption, soil aggregate stability, and WCP in three paddy and three vegetable fields. These soils were amended with different fertilizers (chemical fertilizer, CF; substitution of solid-sheep manure or liquid-biogas slurry organic fertilizer, SOF/LOF; substitution of biochar-coupled organic fertilizers, BSOF/BLOF). Re-sults presented that the LOF averagely increased the WCP contents by 50.2% across the sites, but the SOF and BSOF/BLOF averagely decreased their contents by 38.5% and 50.7% in comparison with the CF. The WCP decline in the BSOF/BLOF-amended soils was mainly attributed to the intensive P adsorption capacity and soil aggregate stability. The BSOF/BLOF increased the amorphous Fe and Al contents in the fields in comparison with the CF, which improved the adsorption capacity of soil particles, further improving the maximum absorbed P (Qmax) and reducing the dissolved organic matter (DOC), leading to the improvement of > 2 mm water-stable aggregate (WSA>2mm) and subsequent WCP decrease. This was proved by the remarkable negative associa-tions between the WCP and Qmax (R2 = 0.78, p < 0.01) and WSA>2mm (R2 = 0.74, p < 0.01). This study manifests that biochar-coupled organic fertilizer could effectively reduce soil WCP content via the improvement of P adsorption and aggregate stability.

AB  - Our recent trial demonstrated individuals suffering from social anxiety with performance-related concerns who received virtual reality exposure augmented with scopolamine, a cholinergic antagonist, experienced significantly less post-treatment context renewal (CX) than placebo (Craske et al., 2019). The purpose of the present investigation was to determine who specifically benefits from scopolamine by examining hippocampal (HPC) functioning as a moderator of treatment response (Placebo n = 15, SCOP 0.5 mg n = 15, SCOP 0.6 mg n = 15). Skin conductance response to conditional stimulus (SCR-to-CS) termination suggested a dose-response relationship for enhanced HPC functioning individuals, wherein individuals receiving scopolamine demonstrated less fear at CX. In addition, SCR-to-CS onset indicated reduced fear at CX for impaired HPC individuals receiving SCOP 0.5 mg and SCOP 0.6 mg relative to Placebo. Our findings, however, lacked consistency across measures. Scopolamine remains a promising agent and additional research required to further understand its effects.

AB  - A new species of the genus Niphargus is described from the Gelendzhik-Tuapse area of the Russian southwestern Caucasus. It belongs to the "puteanus" species group and phylogenetically related to Caucasian N. ciscaucasicus and N. talikadzei, separating from other Caucasian species of the genus by the presence of 2 hooks in retinacules on pleopods, different rami of uropod I both in males and females, and relatively large inner ramus of uropod III. Molecular study has revealed that Niphargus bzhidik sp. nov. and related N. ciscaucasicus are relicts of the Late Miocene speciation, associated with the Messinian crisis (5.96-5.33Mya) separated widespread Paratethys species, which survived in long-term genetic isolation for a long time. The new species is blind and epigean, and probably unable to spread over long distances, but this way of life probably allowed surviving in refugee during the Quaternary period with a colder climate. Analysis of stable isotopes (delta C-13/delta N-15) revealed that the new species is carnivorous, in contrast to another studied stygobiotic herbivorous Niphargus species (e.g., Niphargus cf. tauricus). The key to the Caucasian and Eastern Asian species of the genus Niphargus, known from the territory of the former USSR, is presented in the article.

AB  - No diagnostic kits and reagents are available in the market to detect and evaluate camel immune responses to different pathogens. This study aimed to produce sheep anti-camel (Camelus dromedarius) polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) and to determine the specificity with other species immunoglobulin. Immunoglobulins (Igs) from camel serum samples were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation (40.00% saturated ammonium sulfate). Purity of the camel Igs was tested by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PAbs against (Camelus dromedarius) immunoglobulins were generated by immunizing sheep with purified Igs. Anti-camel Ig polyclonal antibodies titer and specificity were determined using ELISA and Western blot techniques. Polyclonal antibodies specific to camel Igs were significantly high in immunized sheep which confirmed the immunization procedure. PAbs reacted specifically with camel serum immunoglobulin and did not react with other species immunoglobulin of horse and chickens. Polyclonal antibodies produced in this study can be regarded as a valuable tool to be used for immune-diagnostic purposes in camel population world-wide. (c) 2022 Urmia University.

AB  - After intensive research on the gut-brain axis, intestinal dysbiosis is considered to be one of the important pathways of cognitive decline. Microbiota transplantation has long been thought to reverse the behavioral changes in the brain caused by colony dysregulation, but in our study, microbiota transplantation seemed to improve only behavioral brain function, and there was no reasonable explanation for the high level of hippo-campal neuron apoptosis that remained. Butyric acid is one of the short-chain fatty acids of intestinal metabolites and is mainly used as an edible flavoring. It is commonly used in butter, cheese and fruit flavorings, and is a natural product of bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and resistant starch in the colon, acting similarly to the small-molecule HDAC inhibitor TSA. The effect of butyric acid on HDAC levels in hippocampal neurons in the brain remains unclear. Therefore, this study used rats with low bacterial abundance, conditional knockout mice, microbiota transplantation, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and behavioral assays to demonstrate the regulatory mechanism of short-chain fatty acids on the acetylation of hippocampal histones. The results showed that disturbance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism led to high HDAC4 expression in the hippocampus and regu-lated H4K8ac, H4K12ac, and H4K16ac to promote increased neuronal apoptosis. However, microbiota trans-plantation did not change the pattern of low butyric acid expression, resulting in maintained high HDAC4 expression in hippocampal neurons with continued neuronal apoptosis. Overall, our study shows that low levels of butyric acid in vivo can promote HDAC4 expression through the gut-brain axis pathway, leading to hippo-campal neuronal apoptosis, and demonstrates that butyric acid has great potential value for neuroprotection in the brain. In this regard, we suggest that patients with chronic dysbiosis should pay attention to changes in the levels of SCFAs in their bodies, and if deficiencies occur, they should be promptly supplemented through diet and other means to avoid affecting brain health.

AB  - A common problem for interdisciplinary sustainability research is that scientists trained in different disciplines are often not rowing their boat effectively in the same direction. Sustainability tools can aid the implementation of this team-melding process. Here, our purpose is to illustrate our Multi-step Integrated graphical and structured discussion eXercise (MIX) tool that transforms diverse disciplinary experts into an interdisciplinary team. We use a visual puzzle-solving approach based on the blind men and the elephant metaphor (BMEM) because this story illustrates the shortcomings of siloed viewpoints and the need to integrate multiple perspectives. Our six-step MIX tool provides step-specific objectives, group activities, discussion questions, and learning outcomes. Activities promote experiential learning for team problem solving. The step-specific structured discussions are designed to get each individual to change their focus from their own discipline (i.e., an elephant trunk, tail, leg, or other isolated pieces of the whole animal) to the team's interdisciplinary goal (i.e., the whole elephant or the entire multi-faceted problem). In our example proof of concept, we show that a narrow focus on only economic yield (trunk), ecological conservation (legs), or human values (tail) misrepresents the biologically involved sustainability problem (elephant) and blocks innovative solutions.

AB  - Brain segmentation at different levels is generally represented as hierarchical trees. Brain regional atrophy at specific levels was found to be marginally associated with Alzheimer's disease outcomes. In this study, we propose an l(1)-type regularization for predictors that follow a hierarchical tree structure. Considering a tree as a directed acyclic graph, we interpret the model parameters from a path analysis perspective. Under this concept, the proposed penalty regulates the total effect of each predictor on the outcome. With regularity conditions, it is shown that under the proposed regularization, the estimator of the model coefficient is consistent in l(2)-norm and the model selection is also consistent. When applied to a brain sMRI dataset acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the proposed approach identifies brain regions where atrophy in these regions demonstrates the declination in memory. With regularization on the total effects, the findings suggest that the impact of atrophy on memory deficits is localized from small brain regions, but at various levels of brain segmentation. Data used in preparation of this paper were obtained from the ADNI database.

AB  - Goethert and colleagues use a host-specific retrotransposon targeted real time PCR assay on questing nymphal ticks to identify a reservoir for Powassan virus lineage 2 (or deer tick virus). Infected ticks were found to have preferentially fed on shrews, as opposed to white-footed mice as was expected, suggesting that they may be a reservoir host for this virus.
   Powassan virus lineage 2 (deer tick virus) is an emergent threat to American public health, causing severe neurologic disease. Its life cycle in nature remains poorly understood. We use a host-specific retrotransposon-targeted real time PCR assay to test the hypothesis that white-footed mice, considered the main eastern U.S. reservoir of the coinfecting agent of Lyme disease, is the reservoir for deer tick virus. Of 20 virus-infected host-seeking nymphal black-legged ticks 65% fed on shrews and none on mice. The proportion of ticks feeding on shrews at a site is positively associated with prevalence of viral infection, but not the Lyme disease agent. Viral RNA is detected in the brain of one shrew. We conclude that shrews are a likely reservoir host for deer tick virus and that host bloodmeal analysis can provide direct evidence to incriminate reservoir hosts, thereby promoting our understanding of the ecology of tick-borne infections.

AB  - This work investigated the effect of a plant-based phenolic supplement on the color, myoglobin forms, lipid oxidation, and antioxidative status of fresh and stored (10 days at 4 degrees C) meat (Longissimus thoracis et lumborum), as well as the antioxidative status of the blood and liver. The sensory quality of the meat was also evaluated for color, aroma, texture, juiciness, and palatability. Twenty-four finishing pigs, divided into two groups, were fed a basal diet and a diet with a phenolic supplement (0.1%). The supplementation increased the redness of the meat (+36% for a* and +28% for redness index), the myoglobin (Mb) content (+7%), the antioxidant activity, and the juiciness. The treatment increased the antioxidant status of meat, reflected by superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total glutathione (GSH + GSSG). The catalase and SOD activities and GSH + GSSG of the blood and liver were also elevated in the supplemented samples when compared to the control group. A significant effect of time was observed for all tested parameters (pH, color attributes, Mb forms, the antioxidant activity, lipid oxidation) except for the Mb content. For the stored samples, only TBARSs (thiobarbituric acid reagent substances) were affected by the diet. The slope of the plot for TBARS changes with time was significantly different between the control and treated groups (p = 0.017), which indicated a significant effect of dietary supplementation. A higher rate of lipid oxidation was observed in the control samples.

AB  - The metabolic changes associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) particularly affect the liver, which is a central metabolic organ and contributes significantly to the provision of energy and specific nutrients and metabolites. Therefore, our aim was to decipher and elucidate the molecular pathways of developmental processes mediated by miRNAs and mRNAs, as well as the metabolome in fetal liver tissue in IUGR compared to appropriate for gestational age groups (AGA). Discordant siblings representing the extremes in fetal weight at day 63 post conception (dpc) were selected from F2 fetuses of a cross of German Landrace and Pietrain. Most of the changes in the liver of IUGR at midgestation involved various lipid metabolic pathways, both on transcript and metabolite levels, especially in the category of sphingolipids and phospholipids. Differentially expressed miRNAs, such as miR-34a, and their differentially expressed mRNA targets were identified. Sex-specific phenomena were observed at both the transcript and metabolite levels, particularly in male. This suggests that sex-specific adaptations in the metabolic system occur in the liver during midgestation (63 dpc). Our multi-omics network analysis reveals interactions and changes in the metabolic system associated with IUGR and identified an important biosignature that differs between IUGR and AGA piglets.

AB  - This study investigated the performance of sorghum vinegar residue to enhance methane production from livestock manures during solid-state anaerobic digestion. Sorghum vinegar residue was co-digested with cattle, sheep, and pig manure, respectively. Results show that co-digesting vinegar residue with livestock manures effectively diluted inhibitory substances (e.g. ammonium, sodium ion, and potassium ion) to alleviate the accumulation of volatile fatty acids and amend microbial composition to enhance digester stability and thus methane production by 10.1 - 58.2%. The highest increase was observed for cattle manure, possibly due to its low inhibitory substances to induce effective synergistic effects with vinegar residue in co-digestion. Modified Gompertz model well fitted the experimental methane yield and exhibited an increase in the maximum methane production rate of livestock manures by 35.2 -58.0% to corroborate their enhanced methanogenesis kinetics with the addition of vinegar residue. Further microbial analyses also indicated that co-digesting vinegar residue with livestock manures enriched hydrolytic bacteria (e.g. the genus vadinBC27_wastewater-sludge_group), acetogenic bacteria (e.g. the genera Syntrophomonas and Petrimonas) and aceticlastic methanogens (e.g. the genera Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta) to promote substrate biodegradation and secure methane production.

AB  - Doppler shift (DS) compensating bats adjust in flight the second harmonic of the constant-frequency component (CF2) of their echolocation signals so that the frequency of the Doppler-shifted echoes returning from ahead is kept constant with high precision (0.1-0.2%) at the so-called reference frequency (f(rof)). This feedback adjustment is mediated by an audio-vocal control system that correlates with a maximal activation of the foveal resonance area in the cochlea. Stationary bats adjust the average CF2 with similar precision at the resting frequency (f(rost)), which is slightly below the f(ref). Over a range of time periods (from minutes up to years), variations of the coupled f(ref) and f(rest) have been observed, and were attributed to age, social influences and behavioural situations in rhinolophids and hipposiderids, and to body temperature effects and flight activity in Pteronotus pamellii. We assume that, for all DS-compensating bats, a change in body temperature has a strong effect on the activation state of the foveal resonance area in the cochlea, which leads to a concomitant change in emission frequency. We tested our hypothesis in a hipposiderid bat, Hipposideros armiger, and measured how the circadian variation of body temperature at activation phases affected f(rost). With a miniature temperature logger, we recorded the skin temperature on the back of the bats simultaneously with echolocation signals produced. During warm-up from torpor, strong temperature increases were accompanied by an increase in f(rest) of up to 1.44 kHz. We discuss the implications of our results for the organization and function of the audio-vocal control systems of all DS-compensating bats.

AB  - Simple Summary Tail biting is an abnormal behavior of pigs, posing serious welfare and economic challenges in intensive pig farming. There are no studies on the perceptions of farmers in south European countries on tail biting and tail docking. This study aims to examine the attitudes of Greek pig farmers toward tail biting and tail docking through a structured questionnaire. In case of an outbreak, the Greek farmers mainly choose to remove the victim, while 64.4% have tried at least once to raise pigs with intact tails. Chains are still the most commonly used enrichment material. Feed quality, environmental factors, and health problems are considered the most important risk factors. The study indicates that solutions for effectively reducing the need for tail docking should consider farmers' perceptions and everyday practices. Tail biting is both an important economic and a welfare problem. The primary preventive measure, almost on a routine basis throughout Europe, remains tail docking following a risk analysis. This study aimed to get insight on the perceptions of Greek pig farmers towards tail docking, intervention measures, and risk factors of tail biting, as well as opinions on pig welfare themes. Eighty-two farmers answered a questionnaire provided online and in printed form. In the case of a tail-biting outbreak, the most important intervention measure is the removal of the bitten pig (victim), while feed quality, air movements, and stocking density were ranked as the highest risk factors (p <= 0.05). Chains are the most common type of enrichment by 67% followed by plastic objects by 29.5%. Almost half of the farmers reported having no tail-biting problem on their farm, while 64.4% of the respondents have already tried at least once to raise pigs with intact tails. To reduce routine tail docking, it is essential to apply specific farm-oriented solutions effectively. To succeed in this aim, it is important to consider farmers' concerns and practices. This study is the first step in that direction.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that the BMP7 gene is differentially expressed in Hu sheep lamb skin of different pattern types, and its expression level is significantly correlated with hair follicle indices of different pattern types, but the molecular mechanism of the differential expression of the BMP7 gene remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of DNA methylation on the transcriptional expression of BMP7. Firstly, we found that the mRNA expression of the BMP7 gene and the activity of the core promoter of the BMP7 gene were upregulated after 5-Aza-Deoxycytidine-induced demethylation treatment using qRT-PCR and double luciferase reporter assay. Then, we found that the proliferation of Hu sheep DPCs in vitro was promoted after 5-Aza-Deoxycytidine-induced demethylation treatment through qRT-PCR, CCK-8, and EdU assay, and that the overexpression of DNMT1 in DPCs induced the opposite effect. In addition, the results of the cell cycle assay reveal that the percentage of cells in the S phase was increased after 5-Aza-Deoxycytidine-induced demethylation treatment, and that the percentage of cells in the S phase was decreased after overexpression of DNMT1 in DPCs. This study indicated that the differential expression of the BMP7 gene in different patterns of Hu sheep lamb skin may be regulated by DNA methylation modification. In addition, DNA methylation can regulate the proliferation and cell cycle of DPCs in Hu sheep.

AB  - The Korean freshwater goby, Rhinogobius brunneus, prefers shallow water bodies with pebble bottoms, which are easily exposed to air due to the lack of water in droughts or the decline of water level after rainfall. Histological studies using microscopic researches revealed its skin consisting of two large parts, the epidermis and dermis with modified vascularization and intraepithelial blood capillaries, considering such environmental habitat conditions. The epidermis (38.4-156.8 mu m in thickness) is classified into three parts; the outermost surface layer contained: stratified squamous and polygonal cells, mucous cells, and taste buds. The middle layer includes stratified polygonal cells and finally, the stratum germinativum consisting of a single layer of stratified polygonal cells and intraepithelial blood capillaries. In particular, there are very interesting findings that a small number of blood capillaries are situated at the stratum germinativum of the epidermis and dermal vascularization develops at the stratum laxum of the dermis. Consequently, the presence of the intraepithelial and intradermal blood capillaries, abundant mucous cells, well-developed dermal vascularization, a thick epidermis, as well as the reduced diffusion distance in some skin regions may be considered useful histological evidence to support cutaneous respiration during hypoxic conditions in stagnant water or during the periodic dry season.

AB  - Palatability of various substances (amino acids, carboxylic acids, some organic acids, and basic taste substances) is presented for eight species of cyprinids (Cyprinidae): bream Abramis brama, European bitterling Rhodeus sericeus amarus, sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus, crucian carp Carassius carassius, common bleak Alburnus alburnus, dace Leuciscus leuciscus, chub L. cephalus, and tiger barb Puntigrus tetrazona. The taste sensitivity to certain substances has been estimated for these species. A comparative analysis has been performed considering the published data on other species of the family; as a result, a high specificity of the taste spectra of cyprinids is obtained. No obvious relationship of taste preferences with the fish lifestyle, their diet, and phylogenetic similarity has been revealed. All cyprinids keep food objects in their oral cavity the longer, the most is the food object palatability. The number of orosensory testing events performed with a food object differs in fish of different lifestyles and belonging to different trophic categories, but does not correlate with the taste properties of the food object. During orosensory testing, the first retention of the grasped object in the oral cavity is longer than subsequent ones. Retentions are many times longer if the object is finally swallowed than when the fish refuse to consume. The great similarity of behavior in cyprinids during orosensory testing of food indicates the conservatism of the feeding behavior compared to taste reception.

AB  - We studied the mitotic chromosome sets in three elephantfish species of the genus Mormyrus (Mormyridae, Osteoglossiformes) occurring in the White Nile and Omo-Turkana basins in south-western Ethiopia. The karyotype structure (2n = 50, FN = 84) appeared to be similar in M. caschive, M. hasselquistii and M. kannume. The Mormyrus is 14th mormyrid genera studied cytogenetically and its karyotype is unique within the family because of the least number of uni-armed chromosomes.

AB  - Length-weight relations (LWRs) were estimated for ten freshwater fish species such as gin-buna, Carassius langsdorfii Temminck et Schlegel, 1846; lake minnow, Rhynchocypris percnura (Pallas, 1814); Siberian loach, Barbatula toni (Dybowski, 1869); Japanese smelt, Hypomesus nipponensis McAllister, 1963; masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou (Brevoort, 1856); rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792); whitespotted char, Salvelinus leucomaenis (Pallas, 1814); ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius (Linnaeus, 1758); hana-kajika, Cottus nozawae Synder, 1911; and a species of goby Rhinogobius sp. Specimens were collected once a month except in the snow season from the Abashiri River basin, eastern Hokkaido, between June 2007 and November 2011. Fishes were captured by an electrofishing device (Smith-Root Inc., Model 12-b). The estimated allometric coefficient b values ranged from 2.790 (ninespine stickleback) to 3.294 (hana-kajika), and r2 values ranged from 0.772 (lake minnow) to 0.994 (goby). All the LWRs were highly significant, with P < 0.001. Besides, the study provides the first estimates of LWRs for the Siberian loach, Japanese smelt, masu salmon, whitespotted char, hana-kajika, and the goby.

AB  - The great seahorse (Hippocampus kelloggi) is one of the larger species within the seahorse group and is widely distributed in coastal areas of the Indo-Pacific. However, the natural resources of this species continue to decrease, rendering it a vulnerable species that faces a high risk of extinction. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct research on the genetic diversity of this species to protect its genetic resources. In this study, we conducted whole-genome re-sequencing (WGRS) on three H. kelloggi populations from the Red Sea (RS, n = 30), the Andaman Sea (AS, n = 13), and the South China Sea (SCS, n = 13), and a total of 1,398,936 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The results indicate that the average observed heterozygosity (Ho) and the average expected heterozygosity (He) for the RS, AS, and SCS populations are 0.2031 and 0.1987, 0.1914 and 0.1822, and 0.2083 and 0.2001, respectively. The three geographic populations exhibit a high degree of genetic differentiation with only a minimal gene flow between them. Consistently, in a population structure analysis, the three groups are also clearly distinguished, which is consistent with the results of the population differentiation coefficient. Demographic analyses revealed that the effective population size (Ne) of the SCS population underwent a dramatic bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), followed by a substantial recovery, whereas the RS and AS populations maintained stable Ne values throughout this period. To investigate adaptive responses to climate change in the SCS population, we employed selective elimination analysis, which identified 21 candidate genes potentially involved in environmental adaptation. Of particular significance were myo5a, hps4, znf385a, msh3, and pfkfb4, which likely play crucial roles in the adaptive mechanisms of H. kelloggi. This comprehensive study not only illuminates the genetic diversity patterns of H. kelloggi but also provides a valuable foundation for future investigations into the species' evolutionary adaptations.

AB  - Specific features of the habitat and seasonal changes in the species composition and abundance of ichthyoplankton have been studied at four sites off the coast of South-Eastern Sakhalin. The minimum values of water temperature have been recorded in May (from 2.2 degrees C near Lake Ptich'e up to 5.5 degrees C (on average) in the northern part of the water area). The highest heating of the coastal zone (up to 13-17 degrees C on average) occurs in August-October. Water salinity is minimal in the area of entrance of the Dudinka and Dolinka rivers (on average similar to 30 parts per thousand), and maximum, in the area of Lake Ptich'e (31.7 parts per thousand). The ichthyoplankton includes eggs and larvae of 37 fish species from 14 families. Representatives of righteye flounders (Pleuronectidae) predominate in all areas, their proportion increases from south to north from 38 to 71%. High abundance of pelagic fish eggs (24.3-31.1 ind./m(3) on average during the field season) has been recorded only to the north from 47 degrees 30' N; to the south it did not exceed 1.5-6.3 ind./m(3). In the northern areas, the maximum abundance of fish eggs and larvae was formed in May-June, in the southern area, in August. The relationship between the number of fish eggs and environmental conditions has not been evaluated or was weakly expressed. Based on the results of factor analysis, species similar in terms of breeding time and spawning areas have been grouped in pairs: walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus and Bering flounder Hippoglossoides robustus, yellowfin sole Limanda aspera and speckled flounder Myzopsetta punctatissima, starry flounder Platichthys stellatus and yellow striped flounder Pseudopleuronectes herzensteini.

AB  - Category learning groups stimuli according to similarity or function. This involves finding and attending to stimulus features that reliably inform category membership. Although many of the neural mechanisms underlying categorization remain elusive, models of human category learning posit that prefrontal cortex plays a substantial role. Here, we investigated the role of the prelimbic cortex (PL) in rat visual category learning by administering excitotoxic lesions before category training and then evaluating the effects of the lesions with computational modeling. Using a touchscreen apparatus, rats (female and male) learned to categorize distributions of category stimuli that varied along two continuous dimensions. For some rats, categorizing the stimuli encouraged selective attention towards a single stimulus dimension (i.e., 1D tasks). For other rats, categorizing the stimuli required divided attention towards both stimulus dimensions (i.e., 2D tasks). Testing sessions then examined generalization to novel exemplars. PL lesions impaired learning and generalization for the 1D tasks, but not the 2D tasks. Then, a neural network was fit to the behavioral data to examine how the lesions affected categorization. The results suggest that the PL facilitates category learning by maintaining attention to category relevant information and updating category representations.

AB  - The present study integrates molecular and morphological data to support the proposal of new species of Telethecium Kritsky, Van Every & Boeger, 1996 and Diaphorocleidus Jogunoori, Kritsky & Venkatanarasaiah, 2004 from the nasal cavities of Bryconops melanurus (Bloch) of the coastal drainages of the Eastern Amazon. Telethecium tiquira sp. n. is characterized by possessing a male copulatory organ (MCO) with two circular sclerotized brims on the base, a coiled tubular shaft having 1 %2 counterclockwise rings, an accessory piece with enlarged base, pincer-shaped at the distal portion; a sclerotized calyx-shaped vaginal vestibule, and hooks with proximal shank dilatation comprising 3/4 of the shank length. Also, Telethecium tiquira sp. n. can be easily distinguished from other species of the genus by the absence of a protruding bag located at the level of the copulatory complex. Diaphorocleidus forficata sp. n. is characterized by having a MCO with two counterclockwise rings, circular sclerotized tandem brim associated with the base of the MCO; accessory piece non-articulated with the MCO, bifurcate, pincer-shaped; vaginal pore sinistral-ventral with opening marginal, vaginal canal sclerotized, elongated, comprising one loop in the proximal portion before entering to the seminal receptacle; ventral anchor with shaft elongated and evenly curved on the axis; point short and slightly curved, and hooks similar in shape and size, hooks with proximal dilatation comprising approximately %2 of the shank length. Furthermore, D. forficata sp. n. is supported by phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of the partial 28S rDNA gene, which placed D. forficata sp. n. in a well-supported clade of Diaphorocleidus spp. of characiform fishes. Thus, the two new species described here expand our knowledge about the diversity of monopisthocotylan parasites from the nasal cavities of Neotropical fishes. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the biodiversity of the region and highlight the importance of further research in this area.

AB  - This study presents the development of a magnetic relaxation switching (MRS) immunosensor for the sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos (CPF) with a signal amplification strategy using Pd/Cu-TCPP(Fe) hybrid nanosheets and polydopamine (PDA). Pd/Cu-TCPP(Fe) nanosheets, which exhibit high peroxidase-like activity and excellent storage stability, making them suitable replacements for natural enzymes in biosensors, are further functionalized with goat anti-mouse IgG (Ab2) to construct an immunosensor. The mechanism relies on the competition between free CPF and the immobilized bovine serum albumin-CPF conjugates for antibody binding, which modulates the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) that are related to the transverse relaxation time. The optimized immunosensor shows a linear detection range from 0.5 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.24 ng/mL, outperforming traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods by achieving an LOD that is about 9 times lower. Real sample analysis demonstrates the applicability of the Pd/ Cu-TCPP(Fe)-PDA-MRS immunosensor for detecting CPF residues in tomato and water samples, with results well consistent with those obtained using gas chromatography. This work highlights the potential of nanomaterials in enhancing the performance of MRS immunosensors for pesticide residue analysis in environmental and food safety monitoring.

AB  - Antarctica's ice shelves play a critical role in modulating ice loss to the ocean by buttressing grounded ice upstream. With the potential to impact ice-shelf stability, persistent polynyas (open-water areas surrounded by sea ice that occur across multiple years at the same location) at the edge of many ice-shelf fronts are maintained by winds and/or ocean heat and are locations of strong ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions. However, in situ observations of polynyas are sparse due to the logistical constraints of collecting Antarctic field measurements. Here, we used wintertime (May-August) temperature and salinity observations derived from seal-borne instruments deployed in 2014, 2019, and 2020, in conjunction with thermal imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) to investigate spatial, temporal, and thermal structural variability of polynyas near Pine Island Glacier (PIG). Across the three winters considered, there were 176 anomalously warm ( $3\sigma $ from background) seal dives near the PIG ice front, including 26 dives that coincided with MODIS images with minimal cloud cover that also showed a warm surface temperature anomaly. These warm surface temperatures correlated with ocean temperatures down to 150 m depth or deeper, depending on the year, suggesting that MODIS-derived surface thermal anomalies can be used for monitoring polynya presence and structure during polar night. The finer spatial resolution (100 m) of TIRS wintertime thermal imagery captures more detailed thermal structural variability within these polynyas, which may provide year-round insight into subice-shelf processes if this dataset is collected operationally.

AB  - Different types of milk are used in the production of milk kefir, but little information is available on the release of potentially antioxidant exopolysaccharides (EPS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the microbial dynamics and EPS release are dependent on the milk substrate. In our study, the inoculated microbial consortium was driven differently by each type of milk (cow, ewe, and goat). This was evident in the sugar consumption, organic acid production, free amino release, and EPS production. The amount and the composition of the secreted EPS varied depending on the milk type, with implications for the structure and functional properties of the EPS. The low EPS yield in ewe's milk was associated with a higher lactic acid production and thus with the use of carbon sources oriented towards energy production. Depending on the milk used as substrate, the EPS showed different monosaccharide and FT-IR profiles, microstructures, and surface morphologies. These differences affected the antiradical properties and reducing power of the EPS. In particular, EPS extracted from cow's milk had a higher antioxidant activity than other milk types, and the antioxidant activity was concentration dependent.

AB  - In order to clarify the mechanism of diurnal changes in photosynthesis of leaves of different leaf ages in Camellia oleifera, current-year leaves (CLs) and annual leaves (ALs) were used as the test materials to analyze the diurnal changes in photosynthetic parameters, assimilate contents and enzyme activities, as well as structural differences and expression levels of sugar transport regulating genes. The rate of net photosynthesis in CLs and ALs was highest in the morning. During the day, there was a decrease in the CO2 assimilation rate, and this decrease was greater in ALs than in CLs at midday. The maximal efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (F-v/F-m) showed a decreasing trend as the sunlight intensity increased, but no significant difference between CLs and ALs was found. Compared with CLs, ALs showed a greater decrease in the carbon export rate at midday and the levels of sugars and starch increased significantly in ALs, accompanied by higher enzyme activity of sucrose synthetase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. In addition, compared with CLs, ALs had a larger leaf vein area and higher leaf vein density, as well as higher expression levels of sugar transport regulating genes during the day. It is concluded that the excessive accumulation of assimilate is an important factor contributing to the midday depression of photosynthesis in Camellia oleifera annual leaves on a sunny day. Sugar transporters may play an important regulatory role in excessive accumulation of assimilate in leaves.

AB  - Consumption of African Palm Weevil larvae is a potential solution to the escalating need for protein in Ghana. Currently, insect farmers rely heavily on agricultural by-products, for their production. However, the changes in nutritional content of these substrates over the duration of the larval stage is not well understood as its decline could have a negative effect on the larval development. The palm weevil larvae were reared on eleven (11) substrates and the changes in the nutrient content of the substrates over time during the larval rearing duration, and their effect on larval survival, larval duration and larval weight were assessed. The substrates tested included cocoyam cake, spoilt onion, banana corm, spoilt garden eggs, coconut coir, cocoa pod, raphia palm, elephant ear corm, sliced false yam, sugarcane and palm yolk. The substrate samples were collected weekly from the first to the fourth week and analysed for crude fat, crude protein, ash and carbohydrate contents. The nutritional content of all the substrates did not differ in the first week. However, crude protein, crude fat and carbohydrate significantly differed in the second, third, and fourth weeks. Larval survival, larval duration and weight of larvae were significantly affected by the changes in the nutrient content of the substrates in the second, third and fourth weeks. The results showed that elephant ear corm, sliced false yam and palm yolk have necessary nutritional requirements to sustain the larvae during development.

AB  - Simple Summary The substitution of soybean meal in farm animal diets is considered vital for the economic and environmental sustainability of the livestock sector. However, data regarding the effects of a soybean meal replacement on the milk yield and quality traits in dairy sheep are scarce. In our study, two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were used, with soybean meal of a typical ration being replaced by a mixture of rapeseed meal, cottonseed cake, and fava beans. The milk yield and the body condition scores were recorded, and milk samples were analyzed monthly for their fat, protein, lactose, and total solids yields, as well as for somatic cell counts, total bacterial counts, pH, electrical conductivity, and the refractive index. Daily and 100-day fat yields were significantly increased in the group fed the experimental ration and the electrical conductivity was significantly decreased in the same group, while no adverse effects on any of the rest of the studied milk production traits were observed. The replacement of soybean meal (SBM) from intensively reared dairy sheep diets has emerged as a significant challenge for sustainable production. However, the effects of this replacement on milk production have not been sufficiently elucidated. The objective of this study was to prospectively assess the effects of replacing SBM with a mixture of alternative protein sources on the milk yield (MY) and the milk quality traits (MQT) in intensively reared dairy sheep. A total of 112 multiparous, purebred milking ewes of the Chios and Frizarta breeds, from two intensive dairy sheep farms, were involved in the study, postweaning, and were assigned to either the control (CR) or the experimental ration (ER) group. In the ER, 3/4 of the SBM was replaced by a mixture of rapeseed meal, cottonseed cake, and fava beans, producing a ration of a similar nutritional value. MY, MQT, and body condition scores were recorded for each individual ewe monthly for a period of 4 months during lactation. The experimental ration was associated with beneficial effects on daily and 100-day fat yields and on the electrical conductivity of milk as an improved udder health status indicator, with no adverse effects on any of the rest of the studied milk production traits.

AB  - Simple Summary Body condition score (BCS), linear body measures (height, length, and circumference), and body mass indexes (BMI) are useful tools for livestock feeding management and breeding practices. This study assessed relationships among these measures as well as with performance variables of body weight (BW), dry matter intake (DMI), and BW gain (ADG) in Katahdin (KAT) ewe lambs vs. Alpine (ALP) doelings fed diets varying in quality. Correlations between BMI and BW, DMI, and ADG were greater than those involving BCS, and ones for BCS of KAT were greater than for ALP. Correlations involving BMI based on combinations of two linear measures (wither height, hook or pin bone length, and heart girth) with BW and ADG were greater than for BMI based one or three linear measures. Thus, BMI based on two linear measures compared with the BCS may be a better livestock management tool because of being relatively less subjective than BCS. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of the dietary level of a condensed tannin-rich forage on linear measures, body condition score (BCS), body mass indexes (BMI), and performance and relationships among these variables in growing dairy goats and hair sheep raised for meat. An experiment with a 2 x 3 factorial treatment arrangement was conducted, with two species and three diets. Diets were 25% concentrate and 75% forage, which were alfalfa hay, condensed tannin-containing Sericea lespedeza hay, and a 1:1 mixture of both hay sources. Twenty-four Alpine (ALP) doelings and 24 Katahdin (KAT) ewe lambs were used in the 173-day study, consisting of four measurement periods. Variables included BCS, linear measures, BMI, and performance variables such as average daily gain (ADG) and dry matter intake (DMI, g/day). Linear measures were length from the shoulder point to pin (Pin) and hook (Hook) bones, height at the withers (Wither), circumference from heart girth (Heart), and width at the hook bones (Rump). Different BMI were based on the Wither, Hook, Pin, Heart, and various combinations. Heart, Rump, and all BMI were affected by species, whereas linear measures and BMI based on Wither and the combination of height and length measures were influenced by diet. There were positive (p < 0.05) correlation coefficients (r) between BCS and body weight (BW) and linear measures as well as BMI for both species, and correlations were greater for KAT than for ALP. Body condition score was correlated with BW, ADG, and DMI for KAT (p < 0.05). For ALP, the correlation between BCS and BW (p < 0.015) was much lower than for KAT (0.49 vs. 0.91), and there were only tendencies for relationships between BCS and ADG and DMI (p < 0.10). Body weight and ADG were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with all BMI for both species, and most correlations were greater for KAT than for ALP. Correlations involving BMI based on combinations of two linear measures with BW and ADG were in most instances greater than for BMI calculated from one or three linear measures. For ALP, DMI was related to BMI based on Wither and Pin (r = 0.43), Heart and Hook (r = 0.44), and Heart and Pin (r = 0.61), whereas for KAT, correlations were similar (0.72-0.75) for each of the four BMI based on two linear measures (i.e., Wither and Hook, Wither and Pin, Heart and Hook, and Heart and Pin). Therefore, it appears that each of these four BMI, preferably based on Heart and length, could be appropriate for better livestock management over BCS and in predicting animal performance.

AB  - Livestock farming sector is an important anthropogenic emission source of ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gases including nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). The NH3 , not N2O and CH4 , is known as an important gaseous precursor to cause atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution. However, the relationship between livestock-derived NH3 and atmospheric PM pollution has not been sufficiently investigated, especially in the developed regions with serious air pollution. Here, we studied the spatio-temporal emissions of NH3, N2O and CH4 from livestock farming as well as the relationship between livestock NH3 emission and atmospheric PM pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, one of the most developed and air polluted area in China. Over the past 40 years, livestock-derived emissions of NH3, N2O and CH4 had experienced four temporal stages (1978-1990: low level; 1991-1995: rapid growth; 1996-2005: reached hot moments; 2006-2018: stable at a high level). Livestock-derived emissions of NH3, N2O and CH4 were 813, 19 and 499 Gg in 2017, respectively. The southeastern plain was the hotspot, and the pig and cattle were the main sources (78-99%) of NH3, N2O and CH4 in livestock fanning. The livestock-derived NH3 emission explained approximately a quarter of the variations of atmospheric PM2.5 (size <= 2.5 mu m) (24%) and PM10 (size <= 10 gm) (22%) pollution. Based on the knowledge of atmospheric chemical processes, we concluded that the livestock-derived NH3 emission significantly affected atmospheric PM2.5 and PM10, pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. Consequently, the livestock fanning, especially pig and cattle breeding, should be paid more attention in the context of atmospheric particulate matter pollution and regional greenhouse gases management.

AB  - The standard seedling seedbox test (SSST) is the most prevalent phenotyping test in research on the genetics and breeding of planthopper-resistant rice. Using 16 rice lines that included plants susceptible, resistant and tolerant to the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), we compared the SSST to modified seedling seedbox tests (MSSTs) and the days-to-wilt (DTW) test. We also conducted a series of performance tests to assess nymph survival and development; adult longevity and egg-laying; egg survival; honeydew production; and plant weight loss. We also assessed the relative costs of the different phenotyping tests to better recommend test protocols that are suitable for high-throughput phenotyping. The SSST was found to be highly robust but fails to identify late-stage resistance; tolerance; or ovicidal responses. MSSTs improved phenotyping by identifying plants with low damage from planthoppers at later growth stages. Herbivore performance tests such as population or biomass build-up tests reduce space requirements and reduce setup and evaluation costs compared with bulk tests. They can also facilitate the assessment of plant tolerance; albeit with added costs. The DTW test most clearly segregates resistant and susceptible plants, thereby facilitating gene discovery and marker-assisted selection. We recommend that bulk testing be improved by switching from the SSST to a suitable MSST and that donor variety and pre-release lines be assessed for the nature of rice-planthopper interactions using biomass build-up tests-including the DTW test.

AB  - Groundwater resources are utilized near areas of intensive oil and gas development in California's San Joaquin Valley. In this study, we examined chemical and isotopic data to assess if thermogenic gas or saline water from oil producing formations have mixed with groundwater near the Elk Hills and North Coles Levee Oil Fields in the southwestern San Joaquin Valley. Major ion concentrations and stable isotope compositions were largely consistent with natural processes, including mixing of different recharge sources and water- rock interactions. Trace methane concentrations likely resulted from microbial rather than thermogenic sources. Trace concentrations of benzene and other dissolved hydrocarbons in three wells had uncertain sources that could occur naturally or be derived from oil and gas development activities or other anthropogenic sources. In the mid-1990s, two industrial supply wells had increasing Cl and B concentrations likely explained by mixing with up to 15 percent saline oil-field water injected for disposal in nearby injection disposal wells. Shallow groundwater along the western margin of Buena Vista Lake Bed had elevated Cl, B, and SO4 concentrations that could be explained by accumulation of salts during natural wetting and drying cycles or, alternatively, legacy surface disposal of saline oil-field water in upgradient ephemeral drainages. This study showed that groundwater had relatively little evidence of thermogenic gas or saline water from oil and gas sources in most parts of the study area. However, the evidence for groundwater mixing with injected disposal water, and possibly legacy surface disposal water, demonstrates produced water management practices as a potential risk factor for groundwater-quality degradation near oil and gas fields. Additional studies in the San Joaquin Valley and elsewhere could improve understanding of such risks by assessing the locations, volumes, and types of produced water disposal practices used during the life of oil fields.

AB  - Plant-induced responses to attack often mediate interactions between different species of insect herbivores. These effects are predicted to be contingent on the herbivore's feeding guild, whereby prior feeding by insects should negatively impact subsequent feeding by insects of the same guild (induced resistance) but may positively influence insects of a different guild (induced susceptibility) due to interfering crosstalk between plant biochemical pathways specific to each feeding guild. We compared the effects of prior feeding by leaf-chewing caterpillars (Spodoptera frugiperda) vs. sap-sucking aphids (Aphis gossypii) on induced defences in wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and the consequences of these attacks on subsequently feeding caterpillars (S. frugiperda). To this end, we conducted a greenhouse experiment where cotton plants were either left undamaged or first exposed to caterpillar or aphid feeding, and we subsequently placed caterpillars on the plants to assess their performance. We also collected leaves to assess the induction of chemical defences in response to herbivory. We found that prior feeding by both aphids and caterpillars resulted in reductions in consumed leaf area, caterpillar mass gain, and caterpillar survival compared with control plants. Concomitantly, prior aphid and caterpillar herbivory caused similar increases in phenolic compounds (flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids) and defensive terpenoids (hemigossypolone) compared with control plants. Overall, these findings indicate that these insects confer a similar mode and level of induced resistance in wild cotton plants, calling for further work addressing the biochemical mechanisms underpinning these effects.

AB  - Recent research in northern Spain has revealed the disappearance of Neanderthal populations in the Vasco-Cantabrian region a few millennia earlier than in eastern and southern Iberia and discovered a short period of overlap with modern humans, at least, in terms of radiocarbon dates. However, the causes of Neanderthal decline understood as a regional and temporal process remain open. Despite the abundance of technological studies, modern-quality chronological dating, and the availability of archaeofaunal and palaeoenvironmental data, there is a lack of consensus about how climatic and environmental conditions could have affected ungulate prey and, therefore, Neanderthal subsistence strategies. In this paper, an analytical summary of the archaeofaunal and taphonomic data available for the Vasco-Cantabrian region, combined with the most recent chronological evidence, present general knowledge about animal biogeography and ecology during the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic transition, and provides an interpretation of the behaviour of both human species in the region. This work reviews the palaeomammal community of animals represented in the record as exploited by human groups in several caves and rock shelters and pointing to continuing lacunae in knowledge. Further research is needed to verify and potentially explain the apparent hominin population gap and the ultimate fate of the Neanderthals.

AB  - Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that can be transmitted by infectious protein particles, PrPScs, encoded by the endogenous prion protein gene (PRNP). The origin of prion seeds is unclear, especially in non-human hosts, and this identification is pivotal to preventing the spread of prion diseases from host animals. Recently, an abnormally high amyloid propensity in prion proteins (PrPs) was found in a frog, of which the genetic variations in the PRNP gene have not been investigated. In this study, genetic polymorphisms in the PRNP gene were investigated in 194 Dybowski's frogs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplicon sequencing. We carried out in silico analyses to predict functional alterations according to non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, SIFT, and MutPred2. We used ClustalW2 and MEGA X to compare frog PRNP and PrP sequences with those of prion-related animals. To evaluate the impact of the SNPs on protein aggregation propensity and 3D structure, we utilized AMYCO and ColabFold. We identified 34 novel genetic polymorphisms including 6 non-synonymous SNPs in the frog PRNP gene. The hydrogen bond length varied at codons 143 and 207 according to non-synonymous SNPs, even if the electrostatic potential was not changed. In silico analysis predicted S143N to increase the aggregation propensity, and W6L, C8Y, R211W, and L241F had damaging effects on frog PrPs. The PRNP and PrP sequences of frogs showed low homology with those of prion-related mammals. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to discover genetic polymorphisms in the PRNP gene in amphibians.

AB  - The present work evaluated animal models comprising direct and maternal effects to estimate (co)variance components and genetic parameters of growth rates and Kleiber ratio in Harnali sheep. The information on pedigree and targeted traits of 1862 lambs born to 144 sires and 591 dams was collected for the period from 1998 to 2018. The traits studied were average daily gain from birth to 3 months of age (ADG(1)), 3 months to 6 months of age (ADG(2)), and 6 months to 12 months of age (ADG(3)) and their corresponding Kleiber ratios as KR1, KR2 and KR3, respectively. The statistical methods included the general linear model for analyzing the effects of fixed factors and animal models for deriving variance components for targeted traits. According to best model evaluated on the basis of likelihood ratio test, the estimated direct heritability was low in magnitude and ranged from 0.04 to 0.14. Direct heritability estimates for ADG(1), ADG(2), ADG(3), KR1, KR2 and KR3 were 0.06, 0.14, 0.05, 0.04, 0.11 and 0.05, respectively. The maternal genetic effects contributed (4-7%) significantly for ADG(1), KR1 and KR2 traits. The genetic correlations ranged from -0.35 +/- 0.11 (ADG(1)-KR2) to 0.98 +/- 0.01 (ADG(2)-KR2 and ADG(3)-KR3) and phenotypic correlations ranged from -0.36 +/- 0.02 to 0.98 +/- 0.01 for ADG(1)-KR2 and ADG(2)-KR2, respectively. The significant maternal effects along with low levels of direct effects for average daily gain and Kleiber ratio at different age group should be considered while setting selection and managerial strategies to achieve anticipated growth rates in Harnali sheep.

AB  - Growth of the city's population induces changes to airflow and pollutant and dust dispersion process, which is significantly affected by barriers and consequently influences human health and life. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the airflow pattern using simulation approaches. In this study, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a powerful numerical modeling tool, and Log-law and Power-law empirical models, along with several auxiliary data (DEM data) and several relevant software tools (Google Mapper, Sketchup 17, Rhinoceros 5, and Solid Works 19) were employed to simulate wind velocity and pressure distributions over a large-scale complex terrain and buildings in Gouyom to Shahrak-e Golestan, Shiraz, Iran. Validation procedure was performed through monthly measured wind velocity at seven elevations of 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18 m in three representative locations over a year using a digital handheld anemometer (UNI-T UT361) that was capable to measure wind velocity in the range of 2 to 30 m s-1 with an accuracy of 3%+0.5 The CFD results better agreed with the experimental data in real situations than those of the other two applied numerical models (Power-law and Log-law). Furthermore, wind velocity in three prescribed lines of different heights (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m) with different topographies and buildings had more fluctuations from the beginning of the study area to nearly 6 km. The turbulence intensity profiles also confirmed the mentioned issues. Results revealed that the minimum and maximum pressures were observed in the crest and flat surfaces, respectively. The CFD numerical simulation approach is recommended to predict airflow characteristics (wind velocity and pressure distributions), model soil erosion by wind, and present solutions to reduce the airflow pattern change-induced hazards.

AB  - Objective: Efficient production of functional and mature alveolar epithelial is a major challenge for developing any cell replacement therapy for lung degenerative diseases. The extracellular matrix (ECM) pro-vides a dynamic environment and mediates cellular responses during development and maintenance of tissue functions. The decellularized ECM (dECM) which retains its native-like structure and bio-chemical composition can provide the induction of embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation toward the tissue-specific lineages during in vitro culture. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sheep lung dECM-derived scaffold on differentiation and further maturation of ESC-derived lung progenitor cells. Materials and Methods: This study was an experimental study. In the first step, a sheep lung was decellularized to achieve dECM scaffolds and hydrogels. Afterwards, the obtained dECM scaffold was evaluated for collagen and glycosaminoglycan contents, DNA quantification, and its ultrastructure. Next, the three experimental groups: i. Sheep lung dECM-derived scaffold, ii. Sheep lung dECM-derived hydrogel, and iii. Fibronectin-coated plates were compared in their abilities to induce further differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived definitive endoderm (DE) into lung progenitor cells. The comparison was evaluated by immuno-staining and real-time polymerase chain Results: We found that the dECM-derived scaffold preserved its composition and native porous structures while lacking nuclei and intact cells. All experimental groups displayed lung progenitor cell differen-tiation as revealed by the RNA and protein expression of NKX2.1, P63 and CK5. DE cells differenti-ated on dECM-derived scaffold and dECMderived hydrogel showed significant upregulation of SOX9 gene expression, a marker of the distal airway epithelium. DE cells differentiated on the dECM-derived scaffold compared to the two other groups, showed enhanced expression of SFTPC (type 2 alveolar epithelial [AT2] cell marker), FOXJ1 (ciliated cell marker), and MUC5A (secretory cell marker) genes. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that dECM-derived scaffold improves the differentiation of DE cells towards lung alveolar progenitor cells in comparison with dECM-derived hydrogel and fibronectin-coated plates.

AB  - Latest advancements in the integration of camera sensors paves a way for new Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) applications such as analyzing geographical (spatial) variations of earth science in mitigating harmful envi-ronmental impacts and climate change. UAVs have achieved significant atten-tion as a remote sensing environment, which captures high-resolution images from different scenes such as land, forest fire, flooding threats, road collision, landslides, and so on to enhance data analysis and decision making. Dynamic scene classification has attracted much attention in the examination of earth data captured by UAVs. This paper proposes a new multi-modal fusion based earth data classification (MMF-EDC) model. The MMF-EDC technique aims to identify the patterns that exist in the earth data and classifies them into appropriate class labels. The MMF-EDC technique involves a fusion of histogram of gradients (HOG), local binary patterns (LBP), and residual network (ResNet) models. This fusion process integrates many feature vectors and an entropy based fusion process is carried out to enhance the classification performance. In addition, the quantum artificial flora optimization (QAFO) algorithm is applied as a hyperparameter optimization technique. The AFO algorithm is inspired by the reproduction and the migration of flora helps to decide the optimal parameters of the ResNet model namely learning rate, number of hidden layers, and their number of neurons. Besides, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based classification model is applied to assign appropriate class labels for a useful set of feature vectors. The proposed MMF-EDC model has been tested using UCM and WHU-RS datasets. The proposed MMF-EDC model attains exhibits promising classification results on the applied remote sensing images with the accuracy of 0.989 and 0.994 on the test UCM and WHU-RS dataset respectively.

AB  - Meat-eating among non-human primates has been well documented but its prevalence among Afromontane baboons is understudied. In this study we report the predatory and meat-eating behaviours of a habituated group of gray-footed chacma baboons (Papio ursinus griseipes) living in an Afromontane environment in South Africa. We calculated a vertebrate-eating rate of 1 every 78.5 hours, increasing to 58.1 hours when unsuccessful predation attempts were included. A key food source was young antelopes, particularly bushbuck ( Tragelaphus scriptus), which were consumed once every 115 observation hours. Similar to other baboon research sites, predations seemed mostly opportunistic, adult males regularly scrounged and monopolised prey, there was no evidence they used an active kill bite, and active sharing was absent. This is the first baboon study to report predation of rock python (Python sebae) eggs and likely scavenging of a leopard (Panthera pardus) kill (bushbuck) cached in a tree. We also describe several scramble kleptoparasitism events, tolerating active defence from antelope parents, and the baboons inhibiting public information about predations. In the latter case, baboons with meat often hid beyond the periphery of the group, reducing the likelihood of scrounging by competitors. This often led to prey carcasses being discarded without being fully exploited and potentially providing resources to scavengers. We also highlight the absence of encounters with numerous species, suggesting the baboons are a key component of several species' landscapes of fear. Given these findings it seems likely that their ecological role in the Soutpansberg has been undervalued, and such conclusions may also hold for other baboon populations.

AB  - Simple Summary Glycerol is widely used as a feed supplement in ruminant nutrition. However, its administration at moderate and high doses results in an increase in plasma osmolality and in an alteration of red blood cell (RBC) indices. The present study aimed at further elucidating the effect of glycerol on RBCs' functionality by evaluating the effect of different glycerol concentrations on RBC homeostasis under in vitro conditions. Obtained results showed that glycerol permeates the RBC membrane and leads to hemolysis when glycerol concentration exceeds 200 mg/dL. However, RBCs' antioxidant defenses appear to protect cell membranes without causing an increase of oxidative stress markers. Moreover, no alteration in RBCs' intracellular Ca2+ ion concentrations and metabolic activity were found. In conclusion, glycerol-based nutritional treatment should be designed in sheep to avoid exceeding 200 mg/dL glycerol circulating concentration to prevent RBC osmotic stress. The use of high doses of glycerol as a livestock feed supplement is followed by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations and consequently in plasma osmolality. Moreover, glycerol is a highly diffusible molecule that can readily permeate the red blood cell (RBC) membrane following a concentration gradient. A rise in glycerol plasma concentrations can thus alter RBC homeostasis. The present study aimed at investigating both glycerol osmotic effects on sheep RBCs and their oxidative response under in vitro conditions. Sheep blood samples were suspended in media supplemented with increasing glycerol concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 mg/dL), which reflected those found in vivo in previous studies, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 4h. Thereafter, osmolality and hemolysis were determined in spent media, while cell extracts were used to assay intracellular concentration of glycerol, ATP, Ca2+ ions, oxidative stress markers and reactive oxygen species (ROS).The study confirmed that glycerol intracellular concentrations are directly related with its concentration in the incubation media, as well as hemolysis (p < 0.001) which increased significantly at glycerol concentrations higher form 200 mg/dL. ROS intracellular level increased at all glycerol concentration tested (p < 0.01) and total thiols decreased at the highest concentrations. However, RBCs proved to be able to cope by activating their antioxidant defense system. Superoxide dismutase activity indeed increased at the highest glycerol concentrations (p < 0.001), while total antioxidant capacity and malonyldialdehyde, a typical product of lipid peroxidation by ROS, did not show significant changes. Moreover, no alterations in intracellular Ca2+ ions and ATP concentrations were found. In conclusion, glycerol-induced hemolysis can be related to the induced osmotic stress. In sheep, nutritional treatments should be designed to avoid reaching glycerol circulating concentrations higher than 200 mg/dL.

AB  - It is generally accepted that carnosine (beta-alanyl-l-histidine) content is higher in glycolytic than in oxidative muscle fibres, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for this difference remain to be elucidated. A first study to better understand potential mechanisms involved was undertaken (1) to determine whether differences in the expression of carnosine-related enzymes (CARNS1, CNDP2) and transporters (SLC6A6, SLC15A3, SLC15A4, SLC36A1) exist between oxidative and glycolytic myofibres and (2) to study the effect of carnosine on myoblast proliferative growth and on carnosine-related gene expression in cultured myoblasts isolated from glycolytic and oxidative muscles. Immunohistochemistry analyses were conducted to determine the cellular localization of carnosine-related proteins. Laser-capture microdissection and qPCR analyses were performed to measure the expression of carnosine-related genes in different myofibres isolated from the longissimus dorsi muscle of ten crossbred pigs. Myogenic cells originating from glycolytic and oxidative muscles were cultured to assess the effect of carnosine (0, 10, 25 and 50 mM) on their proliferative growth and on carnosine-related gene expression. The mRNA abundance of CNDP2 and of the studied carnosine transporters was higher in oxidative than in glycolytic myofibres. Since carnosine synthase (CARNS1) mRNA abundance was not affected by either the fibre type or the addition of carnosine to myoblasts, its transcriptional regulation would not be the main process by which carnosine content differences are determined in oxidative and glycolytic muscles. The addition of carnosine to myoblasts leading to a dose-dependent increase in SLC15A3 transcripts, however, suggests a role for this transporter in carnosine uptake and/or efflux to maintain cellular homeostasis.

The experiment followed the principle of randomized block design to systematically analyze the agronomic traits, yield quality, and soil health of oats among different treatments, and to screen for adaptable oat varieties and the optimal application rate of microbial fertilizers with organic manure. The results showed that the following: (1) The results of the oat variety screening test showed that the yield and quality indexes of 'Qing Yin No. 2' and 'Bai Yan No. 7' introduced in high altitude areas were higher than those of other oat varieties, with high membership function values of 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. (2) The combined application of microbial fertilizer and organic fertilizer showed that the combined application could significantly improve the growth and photosynthetic characteristics of 'Bai Yan No. 7'. The combination of the two also improved the yield quality of 'Bai Yan No. 7'; the hay yield with the BHC3 treatment was 8508.00 kg<middle dot>hm-2, significantly higher than the BCK treatment (p < 0.05). Regarding soil fertility, under the BHC3 treatment, compared with the BCK, soil nutrient contents and soil enzyme activities were also significantly improved (p < 0.05). At the same time, the combination of the two treatments also significantly improved the growth and photosynthetic characteristics of 'Qing Yin No. 2'. The combination of the two also improved the yield quality of 'Qing Yin No. 2', and the hay yield with the QDY4 treatment was 8707.67 kg<middle dot>hm-2, which was significantly increased by 25.37%, compared with that of QCK. Regarding soil fertility, under the QHC2 treatment, compared with the QCK treatment, soil nutrient contents and soil enzyme activities were also significantly improved. To sum up, 'Qing Yin No. 2' and 'Bai Yan No. 7' can better adapt to the ecological environment in high altitude areas, and are suitable for planting in areas with an altitude of 4200 m. The combined application of Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus licheniformis, and organic fertilizer can improve the yield, nutritional quality, and soil fertility of 'Qing Yin No. 2' and 'Bai Yan No. 7'. The best treatment for 'Qing Yin No. 2' is QDY4, that is, 15.00 kg of Bacillus licheniformis is applied per hectare, and 18,000 kg of cattle and sheep manure organic fertilizer is applied per hectare. The best treatment for 'Bai Yan No. 7' is BHC3, that is, 6.00 kg of Trichoderma harzianum is applied per hectare, and 18,000 kg of cattle and sheep manure organic fertilizer is applied per hectare. With the above treatment, the forage grass grows best, the soil nutrient content in the forage grass field is the highest, and the input-output ratio is the highest.

AB  - Lignosus rhinocerus (Cooke) Ryvarden, a traditional medicinal mushroom in Southeast Asia, is utilized for various health conditions. Although there is evidence that L. rhinocerus sclerotia supplementation had decreased systolic blood pressure and improved acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study investigated the vasorelaxant effect and possible mechanism of action of L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) sclerotial cold water extract (xLr (R)) on rat-isolated aortae using an organ bath technique. Aortic rings removed from Sprague Dawley rats were pre-contracted with phenylephrine (PE) prior to the construction of the cumulative concentration-response curve to xLr (R). Exposure to increasing concentrations of xLr (R) significantly relaxed the pre-contracted aorta [maximum tissue contraction or relaxation response (E-max): 97.70 +/- 5.21%; P = 0.0005]. Furthermore, our findings revealed that the xLr (R)-induced vasorelaxation is independent of endothelium and muscarinic receptor-mediated pathways. The attenuation of PE-induced contractions by SKF96365 and nifedipine suggests the possible effect of xLr (R)-induced vasorelaxation on the inhibition of external calcium influx through membrane calcium channels. This is the first study detailing the endothelium-independent vasorelaxant effects of xLr (R) in isolated blood vessels. These findings have enhanced our understanding of the pharmacological effects of xLr (R) on vasculature.

AB  - Simple Summary Mucosal morphology and microbiota composition are key components of the gut development of calves. Adverse health events during pre-weaning and diet changes at weaning can create a lasting impact on those components. Phytogenic feed additives such as the Macleaya cordata plant extract preparations (MCE) improved the gut morphology and microbiota composition of pigs and poultry in previous studies. In this study, MCE was fed to dairy x beef crossbred calves before (6 to 45 d) and after weaning (45 to 90 d). The cumulative impact on the ruminal and small intestinal morphology and microbiota composition were evaluated at 95 d of age. Despite the minor changes in ruminal and intestinal microbial populations, MCE increased the rumen papillae length and villus height: crypt depth in the small intestine, suggesting the potential to enhance gut health and development. The objective was to determine the impact of feeding MCE on ruminal and intestinal morphology and microbiota composition of calves. A total of 10 male and 10 female crossbred (dairy x beef) calves (6 d of age) were assigned randomly to control (CTL; n = 10) or MCE-supplemented (TRT; n = 10) groups. The MCE was fed in the milk replacer and top-dressed on the calf starter during pre-weaning (6 to 49 d) and post-weaning (50 to 95 d) periods, respectively. Calves were slaughtered at 95 d to collect rumen and intestinal samples to determine volatile fatty acid (VFA) profile, mucosal morphology, and microbiota composition. The effects of MCE were analyzed by accounting for the sex and breed effects. Feeding MCE increased rumen papillae length (p = 0.010) and intestinal villus height: crypt depth (p < 0.030) compared to CTL but did not affect rumen VFA profile. The TRT had a negligible impact on microbial community composition in both the rumen and the jejunum. In conclusion, feeding MCE from birth through weaning can improve ruminal and small intestinal mucosa development of calves despite the negligible microbiota composition changes observed post-weaning.

AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of postpartum day and parity season on the lactoferrin (LF), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and chemical composition of Murciano-Granadina goat colostrum during the first 96 h after kidding, and the use of the Brix refractometer to estimate IgG content. A herd of 3500 intensively managed Murciano-Granadina dairy goats (45-50 kg body weight) was used. Colostrum samples were collected from days 1 to 4 postpartum in the winter, spring, summer, and autumn. The colostrum composition was assessed using an automated infrared method; the LF and IgG concentrations were measured using an ELISA, and for the Brix percentage, we used a digital refractometer. Colostrum taken on the first postpartum day showed the highest concentrations of LF, IgG, proteins and non-fat solids (NFSs). As the postpartum days progressed, a rapid decrease in the LF, IgG, protein, and NFS contents and the Brix value was observed. In contrast, the lactose content increased steadily until the fourth postpartum day (p < 0.001). The season influenced milk yield, LF, IgG, protein, fat, and somatic cell content (p < 0.05). LF contents were significantly higher in the spring season, IgG contents were higher in autumn colostrum, and fat components were higher in the winter season. The colostrum Brix value showed a positive correlation with the ELISA colostrum LF (r = 0.716, p < 0.001) and IgG (r = 0.894, p < 0.001) determination; a 20 mg IgG/mL colostrum concentration corresponded to 18 degrees Brix. Our results corroborate the importance of feeding colostrum to newborns on the first day after birth, not only because of its high level of IgG but also because of its greater presence of the other bioactive protein compounds such as lactoferrin.

AB  - Simple Summary Larger litter size (born alive) and higher uniformity of piglets' birth weight are the most desired characteristics in pig production. Application of N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) was shown to increase litter size and decrease the coefficient of variation of piglets' birth weight from sows after conventional artificial insemination. In this study, we report that, in sows after fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI), NCG improved the number of piglets born alive and the coefficient of variation of birth weight through direct effects (increased serum NCG levels) and indirect effects (altered intestinal microbiome and serum metabolites). These findings indicate that NCG can improve reproductive performance by improving both the number of piglets born alive and the uniformity of piglets' birth weight in sows after FTAI. N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) supplementation during gestation improves reproductive performance in sows after conventional artificial insemination. However, whether NCG can improve reproductive performance and change fecal microbiota and serum metabolite levels during pregnancy in sows after fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) remains unclear. Two hundred multiparous sows were assigned a diet from mating until farrowing: control (corn-soybean meal) or NCG supplementation (0.05% NCG). At days 30, 70, and 110 of gestation and after farrowing, maternal microbial diversity and serum metabolites were studied. Supplementation of NCG increased the number of piglets born alive and the litter weight (all p < 0.05) and altered the fetal microbial community during gestation. Some genera were particularly abundant at different time points during gestation and after farrowing, but none were commonly abundant across all four time points. Metabolic analysis revealed that NCG supplementation significantly increased the serum concentrations of NCG, ferulic acid, cinnamoylglycine, 3-phenyllactic acid, and gamma-glutamylglutamic acid in the NCG group compared with levels in the control group. Our results reveal that NCG supplementation during gestation improves reproductive performance in sows after FTAI, exerting both direct (increased serum NCG levels) and indirect effects (altered intestinal microbiome and serum metabolites) on sow reproduction and, ultimately, improving placental and fetal development.

AB  - Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter of the central and peripheral nervous systems, predominantly secreted in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the gut. 5-HT is a crucial enteric signaling molecule and is well known for playing a key role in sensory-motor and secretory functions in the gut. Gastroenteropathy is one of the most clinical problems in diabetic patients with frequent episodes of hyperglycemia. Changes in 5-HT expression may mediate gastrointestinal tract disturbances seen in diabetes, such as nausea and diarrhea. Based on the double immunohistochemical staining, this study determined the variability in the population of 5-HT-positive neurons in the porcine small intestinal enteric neurons in the course of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The results show changes in the number of 5-HT-positive neurons in the examined intestinal sections. The greatest changes were observed in the jejunum, particularly within the myenteric plexus. In the ileum, both de novo 5-HT synthesis in the inner submucosal plexus neurons and an increase in the number of neurons in the outer submucosal plexus were noted. The changes observed in the duodenum were also increasing in nature. The results of the current study confirm the previous observations concerning the involvement of 5-HT in inflammatory processes, and an increase in the number of 5-HT -positive neurons may also be a result of increased concentration of the 5-HT in the gastrointestinal tract wall and affects the motor and secretory processes, which are particularly intense in the small intestines.

AB  - Application of salicylic acid (SA) leads to positive impacts in improving the physiological and growth parameters under drought in other crops. Knowledge on SA regulation on tea is scanty but important especially under drought. Therefore, potential of minimizing the drought effects on tea via exogenous application of SA was studied in a glasshouse at the Tea Research Institute, Talawakelle, Sri Lanka, using one-year-old potted tea cultivars of known drought tolerance (TRI 2025 - tolerant and TRI 2023 - susceptible). Plants were exposed to a drying cycle while they were foliar sprayed with SA in various concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 ppm) along with well-watered and no-spray treatments. Data were collected at 18 hours and 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after applying the treatments from randomly selected plants. Physiological parameters were measured along with soil moisture content. Drought stress led to declining of gas exchange parameters (rate of net photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance), leaf relative water content and increasing accumulation of osmolytes (total soluble sugar and proline) in both tea cultivars compared with well-watered plants. Exogenous application of 150 and 200 ppm SA significantly improved physiological parameters. These results revealed the role of exogenous application of 150 and 200 ppm SA in diminishing the negative effects of drought on tea plants. Exogenous application of SA 150 ppm will therefore be more effective in alleviating the drought impact on immature tea when considering the environmental impact and cost effectiveness.

AB  - One of the most typical abnormal cleavage patterns during early embryonic development is uneven division, but the first uneven division of pig zygote is common. Uneven division results in different daughter cell sizes and an uneven distribution of organelles such as lipid droplet, mitochondria, but the developmental capacity of daughter cells and proteomic changes of daughter cells are still unclear. Therefore, the developmental ability and proteomic quantification were investigated on blastomeres from even division (ED) or uneven division (UD) embryos at 2-cell stage in the present study. Firstly, the developmental ability was affected by the blastomeric size, when compared with medium blastomeres (MBs), the large blastomeres (LBs) with the higher cleavage rate but the small blastomeres (SBs) with the lower rate was observed. Subsequently, proteomic analysis was performed on blastomeres of LBs, MBs and SBs, a total of 109 DEPs were detected, which were involved in protein metabolism and processing, energy metabolism and ribosome. In particular, DEPs in LBs vs. SBs were focused on RNA binding and actin cytoskeletal tissue. Two protein-dense networks associated with RNA binding and cytoskeleton were revealed by further protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of DEPs in LBs vs. SBs, that DDX1 related to RNA binding and ACTB related to cytoskeleton were confirmed in UD embryos. Therefore, a briefly information of DEPs in blastomeres of 2-cell stage pig embryos was described in the present study, and it further confirmed that the formation of uneven division of the first cell cycle of pig embryos might be controlled by the cytoskeleton; the developmental capacity of daughter cells might be affected by the energy metabolism, RNA binding and ribosome, and further account for the developmental potential of the whole embryo.

AB  - Although soft mechano-electrochemical energy harvesters have attracted considerable attention as wearable sensors, they face challenges, including low output performance, high Young's modulus and low energyconversion efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel design featuring macroscopically coiled and microscopically buckled fibres to improve the mechano-electrochemical energy-harvesting capability, thereby maximising capacitance change and affording higher electrical output. The harvester achieved a gravimetric peak current density of 121 A/kg and a peak power density of 16 W/kg. Moreover, the harvester showed enhanced stretchability under a strain of over 400 %, low Young's modulus of 0.2 MPa and an energy conversion efficiency of 0.33 %. Furthermore, when implanted in a pig's bladder, it showed minimal impact during expansion and contraction thanks to its softness and provided real-time electrical output in response to static and dynamic volume changes.

AB  - Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) play an important role in ecological and atmospheric processes, including production of secondary air pollutants in urban areas. BVOC emission rates and composition are highly context-dependent and can change dramatically under conditions that elicit plant stress. This is particularly concerning given proposed expansion of urban forests where plants could regularly be exposed to spikes of at-mospheric pollution stress, such as tropospheric ozone. However, few studies have investigated the effects of ozone exposure on plants commonly found in urban forests. This study characterized the effect of acute ozone exposure on BVOC emission rates in Canary Island pines (Pinus canariensis), which are often used in urban landscaping in Southern California. Pine saplings were exposed to four different ozone doses (control, 200 ppb, 300 ppb, 400 ppb) for 2 h. BVOC emission measurements were collected both pre-treatment and 24 h after exposure. Emission rates of total monoterpenes and several individual monoterpene and sesquiterpene com-pounds decreased when treated with 200 ppb of ozone. Total sesquiterpene emissions decreased significantly only after exposure to 300 ppb ozone, an effect that was largely driven by reduced emissions of the dominant sesquiterpene, alpha-farnesene. These findings indicate that landscaping with the pines used in this study would not exacerbate urban air quality degradation due to acute ozone stress. Future studies should investigate the effect of other major stressors and combinations of stressors for this and other common urban trees.

AB  - Compared to their native range, non-native plants often experience reduced levels of herbivory in the introduced range. This may result in reduced pressure to produce chemical defences that act against herbivores. We measured the most abundant secondary metabolites found in Rumex spp., namely oxalates, phenols and tannins. To test this hypothesis, we compared native (UK) and introduced (NZ) provenances of three different Rumex species (R. obtusifolius, R. crispus and R. conglomeratus, Polygonaceae) to assess whether any significant differences existed in their levels of chemical defences in either leaves and roots. All three species have previously been shown to support a lower diversity of insect herbivores and experience less herbivory in the introduced range. We further examined leaf herbivory on plants from both provenances when grown together in a common garden experiment in New Zealand to test whether any differences in damage might be consistent with variation in the quantity of chemical defences. We found that two Rumex species (R. obtusifolius and R. crispus) showed no evidence for a reduction in chemical defences, while a third (R. conglomeratus) showed only limited evidence. The common garden experiment revealed that the leaves analysed had low levels of herbivory (similar to 0.5%) with no differences in damage between provenances for any of the three study species. Roots tended to have a higher concentration of tannins than shoots, but again showed no difference between the provenances. As such, the findings of this study provide no evidence for lower plant investments in chemical defences, suggesting that other factors explain the success of Rumex spp. in New Zealand.

AB  - Simple Summary Biological control of insect pests is the main alternative to the extensive application of chemicals. Mass rearing of biocontrol agents requires the development of a cost-effective diet. We evaluated the potential of using a mixed diet consisting of one low-quality (the grain moth eggs) and one high-quality (the green peach aphid) prey species as food for females of a predatory ladybird Cheilomenes propinqua. The fecundity of females fed only on the grain moth eggs was very low. Daily consumption of two aphids increased the proportion of egg-laying females and daily consumption of 10 aphids resulted in an increase in their mean fecundity. Thus, the use of a mixed diet can be considered a promising technique for mass rearing of C. propinqua, although the economic feasibility of this method would most probably require the improvement of aphid rearing system. The fecundity of C. propinqua females used for biological control of pests in greenhouses by preventing colonization and supplied with the grain moth eggs will be low but the appearance of pests will cause a proportional increase in the mean fecundity of ladybirds. It is known that food has a double impact on females of predatory ladybirds: qualitative signal effect (the onset of oogenesis) and quantitative nutritional effect (the increase in oogenesis intensity). We compared the patterns of these effects by feeding Cheilomenes propinqua females on mixed diets: unlimited low-quality prey (eggs of the grain moth Sitotroga cerealella) and limited high-quality prey (the green peach aphid Myzus persicae: 0, 2, 10, and 50 aphids per day). About half of the females fed only on the grain moth eggs oviposited and their fecundity was very low. Daily consumption of 2 aphids increased the proportion of egg-laying females whereas only consumption of 10 aphids increased their mean fecundity. Thus, the threshold of the signal effect was lower than that of the nutritional effect. As applied to mass rearing, we conclude that the addition of high-quality prey to low-quality food causes a substantial increase in egg production, although the economic feasibility of this method is not clear. Regarding biological control of pests by preventing colonization, we conclude that the fecundity of C. propinqua females supplied with the grain moth eggs in the absence of aphids will be low but the appearance of pests will cause a proportional increase in the mean fecundity of ladybirds.

AB  - PurposeHypoderma pantholopsum is a parasite that parasitizes Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii). This study aims was to reveal the genetic diversity within H. pantholopsum and contribute to the protection of Tibetan antelope.MethodsH. pantholopsum was subjected to mitochondrial genome sequencing, annotation, and phylogenetic analysis. PhyloSuite and BEAST were used to construct phylogenetic tree and divergence time for the parasite.ResultsThe complete H. pantholopsum genome was 16,265 bp in length. The complete mitochondrial genomes contained 37 typical genes, which included 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs. Phylogenetic trees constructed based on the 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and mitochondrial genome sequences showed that H. pantholopsum clustered on the same branch as the Hypoderma species in the GenBank database. According to the divergence time for the COI gene, H. pantholopsum emerged and differentiated approximately 11.59 million years ago (Mya), which indicates that H. pantholopsum appeared much earlier than H. bovis and H. sinense in the genus Hypoderma.ConclusionThe present study explored that the complete mitochondrial genome of H. pantholopsum, along with the phylogenetic evolution, and divergence time estimation, provide valuable data for future investigations into the phylogeny and differentiation of Hypoderma species on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a common air pollutant, which poses a serious threat to farm animals. L-selenomethionine is organic selenium (Se), which can inhibit intracellular ROS generation, block ROS-dependent autophagy, promote mitochondrial energy metabolism, and enhance the body's immunity. Lung, as an important organ of the respiratory system, is highly susceptible to the toxic effects of NH3. However, there were few studies on the mechanism of toxic effects of NH3 on lung tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NH3 on the lungs in pigs and the alleviating effect of L-selenomethionine. Twenty-four Large White*Duroc*Min pigs were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control group, NH3 group, Se group, and NH3 +Se group. The results showed that exposure to NH3 caused damage and inflammation in lung tissues and significantly increased blood NH3 concentration. NH3 induced changes of oxidative stress indexes (GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, MDA, Keap1, Nrf2, and HO-1) and expressions of energy metabolism related genes (HK1, HK2, PFK, PK, LDHA, and HIF-1 alpha). Ultrastructure showed that mitochondrial damage and autophagosome increased significantly, and the expression levels of autophagy related genes (Beclin1, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, and p62) changed. However, the addition of L-selenomethionine alleviated the above changes, but there was still a significant difference compared with the control group (P < 0.05). This finding can provide a new evidence for mitigation of NH3 toxicity.

AB  - One of the most important problems in agriculture is water scarcity. Biochar, as a soil amendment, has the potential to overcome this problem by improving soil's physicochemical and hydraulic properties. However, the study of biochar's physical and hydraulic characteristics, its potential to improve soil physical and soil water holding capacity, and its contribution to water saving and reduction in irrigation costs is lacking. The understanding of biochar's characteristics is so important because the effectiveness of biochar as a soil amendment is dependent on biochar properties. Our goal is to determine how biochar's pore volume, pore size distribution, specific surface area, and water uptake by biochar interact with soil's physical and hydraulic properties. The pore volume, pore size distribution, porous network, specific surface area, and water holding capacity (WHC) were evaluated in four biochars produced from elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), castor bean seeds, soybean seeds, and Jatropha sp. cake pyrolyzed at 380 ?. Our results demonstrated that the specific surface area and pore volume do not contribute to water uptake in hydrophobic biochars from castor bean seeds, soybean seeds, and Jatropha sp, but the results also demonstrated that these biochars have the potential to reduce soil compaction and increase soil porosity. Interestingly, the macroporosity and low hydrophobicity of the elephant grass biochar contributed to increase in its water uptake; these characteristics make this biochar promisor in increasing the soil water holding capacity and water saving and reducing the irrigation costs.

AB  - In order to more efficiently utilize the abundant cellulose resources in nature, increase the utilization rate of cellulose in aquaculture, implement precise feeding and save aquaculture costs, we have conducted research on cellulase genes related to the spotted knifejaw ( Oplegnathus punctatus ). Cellulose, as the most abundant renewable resource, is a cornerstone in the intricate ecological balance of diverse ecosystems. While herbivorous fish are recognized for their utilization of proteins, sugars, and fats, the extent of cellulose utilization by carnivorous and omnivorous fish remains an enigma. Here, through field sampling and behavioural observations, O. punctatus ' omnivorous diet has been demonstrated (stomach contents contain approximately several species of algae in the Bacillariophyta (1.12 %), Streptomyces (0.55 %), Chlorophyta (0.35 %), Rhodophyta (0.16 %), and Euglenophyta (0.19 %) phylum). Additionally, the high cellulase activity in the intestine of O. punctatus has been detected first discovery (enzyme activity up to 4800.15 U/g), indicating its ability to digest cellulose. By employing whole-genome scanning and high-throughput sequencing, a single cellulase gene ( beta -glucosidase ) within the genome of O. punctatus , suggesting the absence of a complete cellulose digestive system. However, microbiological analysis revealed the three crucial role of microorganisms, including Actinobacteria (25.80 %), Bacteroidetes (18.93 %), and Firmicutes phylum (0.82 %), were found to play a crucial role in the decomposition of plant cell walls, thereby facilitating plant material digestion to help the host to complete the process of cellulose digestion. Expression patterns and proteomic analysis of the beta -glucosidase were notably high in the gonads. In situ hybridization confirmed the expression of the beta -glucosidase gene in the intestinal contents and gonads, highlighting its role in supplying energy of gonads. These discoveries shed light on the dietary habits of O. punctatus and its cellulose utilization, offering insights that can inform the development of customized feeding strategies to enhance aquaculture sustainability and minimize resource expenditure.

AB  - The present study aimed to clarify the effects of neurotensin and xenin on pancreatic exocrine secretion in conscious sheep and their mechanism of actions. The animals were equipped with two silastic cannulae in the common bile duct to separately collect pancreatic fluid and bile, and a silastic cannula in the proximal duodenum to continuously return the mixed fluids. NT and xenin were intravenously injected at range of 0.01-3.0 nmol/kg during the phase I of duodenal migrating motor complex. A single intravenous NT injection significantly and dose-dependently increased pancreatic fluid, protein, and bicarbonate outputs. The effect of NT at 1 nmol/kg was completely inhibited by a background intravenous infusion of atropine methyl nitrate at a dose of 10 nmol/kg/ min, however, the effect was not altered by a prior injection of the neurotensin receptor subtype (NTR)-1 antagonist SR 48692 at 60 nmol/kg. Moreover, a single intravenous xenin-25 injection significantly and dosedependently increased pancreatic fluid and protein output, whereas the effect of xenin-25 did not clearly show dose-dependence. The prior SR 48692 injection at 30 nmol/kg did not significantly alter the effects of xenin-25 at 0.3 nmol/kg, while the atropine infusion significantly inhibited the increase in fluid secretion. Under the atropine infusion, xenin-25 at 0.3 nmol/kg did not increase protein and bicarbonate outputs, whereas the inhibitory effect of the atropine was not significant compared to that of the single injection of xenin-25. A single intravenous injection of NTR-2 agonist levocabastine at 0.1-3 nmol/kg did not alter pancreatic exocrine secretion. These results suggest that both NT and xenin-25 effectively stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion through the peripheral cholinergic system in sheep and that NTR-2 is not involved in the regulation of pancreatic exocrine secretion, however, we did not precisely determine the role of NTR-1 in the actions of both the peptides on pancreatic exocrine secretion.

AB  - To realize the harmless treatment and complete resource utilization of livestock manure, the Chinese government continues to promote the outsourcing livestock manure (OLM) services. Exploring OLM's impacts on farmers' incomes is of great significance to evaluate and improve the socialized service system. However, the economic effects of OLM still lack empirical support. This study collected data from 600 pig farmers and applied the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, endogenous switching regression, quantile regression, and mediation effect methods to analyze the influence mechanism of OLM on farmers' incomes. The results revealed that OLM significantly increases farmers' incomes, with those who adopt outsourcing services earning approximately 74,800 yuan more than those who do not. The main reason OLM has an income increasing effect is that it can promote large-scale farming and farming efficiency. As farmers' incomes grow, the income increasing effect of OLM has a clear inverted U shape, with the maximum effect occurring at the 50% income quantile. Meanwhile, with the increase of outsourcing degrees and expansion of the farming scale, the income increasing effect of OLM is also enhanced. After considering geographical characteristics, the analysis showed that OLM had a better income increasing effect in farms located between 500 and 1000 m above sea level. In conclusion, this study reveals the application performance of outsourced services in livestock manure treatment processing, which can help government departments to continuously promote and drive the recycling of livestock waste resources.

AB  - Simple Summary The piped water system in buildings that house growing pigs is used on many farms for short periods to medicate pigs with antimicrobials, in order to keep them healthy and productive. However, the effect that the design of a building's water system has on antimicrobial delivery to pigs in pens throughout the building is not known. Thus, we tracked the antimicrobial concentration in water available to pigs at four drinkers during four in-water dosing events, each conducted with looped water systems differing in their design. We found that the water system's design and the pigs' water usage and drinking patterns had a large influence on water flow and, therefore, the amount of antimicrobial delivered to pigs in each pen over time. We discovered that by using a circulator pump in a building's looped water system, all pigs within a building could be delivered the same antimicrobial concentration in water over time. We also showed how a hydraulic modelling tool can be used to predict the antimicrobial concentration at drinkers over time in a specific building during a dosing event. This provides an opportunity to compare alternative in-water dosing schedules for pigs in a given building and select the one likely to be the most effective. On many pig farms, growing pigs are mass-medicated for short periods with antimicrobial drugs through their drinking water for metaphylaxis and to treat clinical disease. We conducted a series of four prospective observational cohort studies of routine metaphylactic in-water antibiotic dosing events on a commercial pig farm, to assess the concentration of antimicrobial available to pigs throughout a building over time. Each dosing event was conducted by the farm manager with a differently designed looped water distribution system (WDS). We found that the antimicrobial concentration in water delivered to pigs at drinkers in each pen by a building's WDS over time was profoundly influenced by the design of the WDS and the pigs' water usage and drinking pattern, and that differences in the antimicrobial concentration in water over time at drinkers throughout a building could be eliminated through use of a circulator pump in a looped WDS. We also used a hydraulic WDS modelling tool to predict the antimicrobial concentration at drinkers over time during and after a dosing event. Our approach could be used to evaluate alternative in-water dosing regimens for pigs in a specific building in terms of their clinical efficacy and ability to suppress the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, and to determine the optimal regimen. The approach is applicable to all additives administered through drinking water for which the degree of efficacy is dependent on the dose administered.

AB  - This study demonstrates the application of a mathematical steroidogenic model, constructed with individual in vitro enzyme characterisations, to simulate in vivo steroidogenesis in a diseased state. This modelling approach was applied to the South African Angora goat, that suffers from hypocortisolism caused by altered adrenal function. These animals are extremely vulnerable to cold stress, leading to substantial monetary loss in the mohair industry. The Angora goat has increased CYP17A1 17,20-lyase enzyme activity in comparison with hardy livestock species. Determining the effect of this altered adrenal function on adrenal steroidogenesis during a cold stress response is difficult. We developed a model describing adrenal steroidogenesis under control conditions, and under altered steroidogenic conditions where the animal suffers from hypocortisolism. The model is parameterised with experimental data from in vitro enzyme characterisations of a hardy control species. The increased 17,20-lyase activity of the Angora goat CYP17A1 enzyme was subsequently incorporated into the model and the response to physiological stress is simulated under both control and altered adrenal steroidogenic conditions.

AB  - Increased calcium levels are associated with the ferroptosis pathway in neurodegenerative conditions. Recent evidence showed that exposure to particulate matter (PM) could accelerate the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of how PM could affect brain cell pathology is not fully understood. We hypothesized that diesel exhaust particles (NIST DEP) could alter the ferroptosis pathway through calcium signaling, and therefore accelerate the cell death pathway. In this study, we used mouse hippocampal neuronal-like HT22 cells to evaluate whether exposure to NIST DEP could accelerate RSL-3-induced ferroptosis by increasing calcium deregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS). MTT assay results showed that NIST DEP (25, 50, 75, and 100 mu g/mL) did not significantly reduce the survival rate of HT22 cells, while NIST DEP significantly increased RSL-3-induced ferroptotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on fluorescence image analysis, co-exposure to NIST DEP and RSL-3 disrupted HT22 cell mitochondrial morphology, intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels. Combined exposure resulted in an increase in ER-mitochondria contact sites measured by proximity ligation assay (PLA) compared to control solvent group. Additionally, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial ROS and malondialdehyde content, were increased significantly by combined exposure to NIST DEP and RSL-3. Interestingly, the calcium regulators of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCUi4 and positive modulation of small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels by CyPPA significantly preserved cellular metabolic activity, restored calcium homeostasis, and alleviated fragmentation of mitochondria. Consequently, targeting calcium signaling may be promising therapeutic option for xenoferroptotic conditions in which PM affect cell survival.

AB  - More food waste (FW) is desired to be treated in a certain processing period, while the degradation pattern of biochemical fractions during FW bioevaporation was significantly influenced by the organic loading (OL). Lower OL facilitated the lipids degradation, while higher OL favored the protein degradation. It was the more porous structure and abundant oxygen accelerated the lipids degradation, and the rapid proliferation of aerobic microorganisms compensated for the low protein degradation in lower OL. Detailly, 76.8% of the lipids was degraded in the trial with OL of 1.04 kg VSFW/kg TSBS (Trial A), but in the trial with OL of 3.16 kg VSFW/kg TSBS (Trial C) it was only 0.5%. For protein, the degradation was different that 17.5% of the protein was degraded in Trial A, whereas 69.1% was degraded in Trial C. Lipids degradation contributed 63.0% to the metabolic heat in Trial A, but its contribution in Trial C was only 0.5%. For protein, it contributed 4.1% to the metabolic heat in Trial A, but in Trial C it accounted for 53.6%. In addition, the degradation of carbohydrates (71.6-80.8%) and their contribution to metabolic heat (32.8-45.9%) were comparable in all trials, thus OL had little effect on carbohydrates degradation. Results from this study could provide important guideline for FW practical disposal during their biological treatment.

AB  - Senescence is defined as a chronological decline in demographic performance with age, showing a gradual deterioration of body functions and a related decline in survival. We analyzed biometric data from over 31 000 Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra L.) culled during 12 consecutive hunting seasons in 28 hunting districts with different geological substrate (calcareous, metamorphic, and siliceous) in Central-Eastern Alps (Italy). Available data confirmed that females experienced a later senescence than males, in terms of loss in eviscerated body mass. This is in accordance with a greater energy expenditure undergone by males in rut period. Interestingly the different geological substrate influenced the final body mass and the decline of body functions of chamois living in different areas. A pivotal role in this process seems to be played by tooth wear. The progressive wearing of the cheek teeth was assessed in a subset of 596 mandibles using the height of molars and their height/breadth ratio. Referring to the same sex and age, the wear progress on calcareous substrate is slower than the one on other substrates. Indeed, siliceous and metamorphic substrates hold meadows with higher resistance to mechanical stress due to the presence of opal silica and lower nutritional quality compared with calcareous ones. As a consequence, life expectancies and population dynamics depend on the substrate where the chamois population lives. Enhancing knowledge about environmental factors that can affect individual biometrical characters and senescence should be considered a priority to improve adaptive management of hunting species, as well the different distribution of the hunting classes and quotas.

AB  - Dynamic changes in the endometrium are crucial for establishing early pregnancy in ruminants. Blastocyst elongation and implantation require hormones and nutrients to be secreted from the maternal endometrium. The fatty acid-binding protein FABP4 is a widely expressed fatty acid transport protein that promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and is involved in conceptus implantation. However, the mechanism underlying the functional regulation of endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) by FABP4 during ovine peri-implantation remains unclear. We simulated hormonal changes in vitro in sheep EECs (SEECs) during the peri-implantation period and found that it elevated FABP4 expression. FABP4 inhibition significantly reduced cell migration, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy, suggesting that FABP4 regulates endometrial function in sheep. Moreover, the FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 counteracted hormone-mediated functional changes in SEECs, and an endoplasmic reticulum stress activator and autophagy inhibitor reversed the abnormal secretion of prostaglandins induced by FABP4 inhibition. These results suggest that FABP4 affects ovine endometrial function during early gestation by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy in SEECs.

AB  - The length-weight (LWRs) and length-length (LLRs) relations were estimated for 16 fish species obtained from Jiaxing section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, China. One species represented Engraulidae: Coilia nasus Temminck et Schlegel, 1846; 11 species Cyprinidae: Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844); Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845); Chanodichthys erythropterus (Basilewsky, 1855); Chanodichthys mongolicus (Basilewsky, 1855); Culter alburnus Basilewsky, 1855; Chanodich-thys dabryi (Bleeker, 1871); Pseudobrama simoni (Bleeker, 1864); Hemiculter leucisculus (Basilewsky, 1855); Megalobrama termi-nalis (Richardson, 1846); Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758); Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758; one species Bagridae: Tachysurus fulvidraco (Richardson, 1846); two species Odontobutidae: Odontobutis potamophilus (Gunther, 1861); Micropercops swinhonis (Gunther, 1873); and one species Osphronemidae: Macropodus ocellatus Cantor, 1842. Fishes were collected using multipanel nylon gillnets with mesh sizes of 1-8 cm from November 2020 through August 2021. All fishes were measured for length (total length, TL; standard length, SL) to the nearest 0.1 cm and weight (W) to the nearest 0.1 g. The coefficients of determination R2 of LWRs and LLRs were all over 0.950, and the 16 values of LWR parameter b were estimated from 2.505 to 3.364. Our study provides new information on LWRs for 2 species and LLRs for 7 species, as well as a new maximum total length recorded for 3 species for Fish -Base. This study would allow for the convenience of the conversion of TL-W and SL-TL in fish stock assessment and is expected to provide a useful baseline for further studies of population parameters to improve management decisions.

AB  - Simple Summary Encephalitozoonosis is a disease caused by Encephalitozoon cuniculi. It is diagnosed primarily in rabbits, and is less frequently so in other animal species. E. cuniculi is classified as Microsporidia-fungi frequently found in the environment, that are resistant to numerous external factors. This pathogen is diagnosed primarily in rabbits, and is less frequently so in other animal species. The objective of the study was to analyze the prevalence of E. cuniculi infections in guinea pigs with different clinical disorders. The infected animals most frequently exhibited nervous and urinary system symptoms, as well as issues with vision organs, while several animals were recorded as having problems with the respiratory system and thyroid gland dysfunction. The study shows that encephalitozoonosis constitutes a significant problem in rodents kept as domestic animals, which in turn may be a source of infection for humans.

AB  - Post-reactivation amnesia of contextual fear memories by blockade of noradrenergic signaling has been shown to have limited replicability in rodents. This is usually attributed to several boundary conditions that gate the destabilization of memory during its retrieval. How these boundary conditions can be overcome, and what neural mechanisms underlie post-reactivation changes in contextual fear memories remain largely unknown. Here, we report a series of experiments in a contextual fear-conditioning paradigm in mice, that were aimed at solving these issues. We first attempted to obtain a training paradigm that would consistently result in contextual fear memory that could be destabilized upon reactivation, enabling post-retrieval amnesia by the administration of propranolol. Unexpectedly, our attempts were unsuccessful to this end. Specifically, over a series of experiments in which we varied different parameters of the fear acquisition procedure, at best small and inconsistent effects were observed. Additionally, we found that propranolol did not alter retrieval-induced neural activity, as measured by the number of c-Fos(+) cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. To determine whether propranolol was perhaps ineffective in interfering with reactivated contextual fear memories, we also included anisomycin (i.e., a potent and well-known amnesic drug) in several experiments, and measures of synaptic glutamate receptor subunit GluA2 (i.e., a marker of memory destabilization). No post-retrieval amnesia by anisomycin and no altered GluA2 expression by reactivation was observed, suggesting that the memories did not undergo destabilization. The null findings are surprising, given that the training paradigms we implemented were previously shown to result in memories that could be modified upon reactivation. Together, our observations illustrate the elusive nature of reactivation-dependent changes in non-human fear memory.

AB  - There is widespread pain, wound healing delay, mental anxiety and other clinical symptoms after minimally invasive facial cosmetic procedures. These symptoms increased not only the patient's psychological and physical burden but severely affected the quality of life and limited postoperative recovery. In recent years, Medicine and food homologous Chinese medicinal materials have been highly effective, and safe with low toxic properties. They received great attention in the health and wellness industries. It was reported that medicine food homology plants rich in active components such as flavonoids, polysaccharides, and saponins, have the functions of antiinflammation and pain relief, promote wound healing, improve sleep, and regulate gastrointestinal function; and can be used as dietary supplements for postoperative recovery. Network pharmacology is an effective way to reveal the efficacy components, mechanism of action, compatibility principles, and the safety of Chinese medicine formulas as dietary supplements. Although there are many in vivo and in vitro studies on homologous traditional Chinese medicinal materials and food for common clinical symptoms such as postoperative pain, delayed wound healing, decreased sleep quality, and anxiety. However, the material basis and mechanism of action of traditional Chinese medicinal materials of medicine and food still lack scientific, reasonable, and safety evaluation experiments to confirm their efficacy in promoting postoperative rehabilitation of facial minimally invasive aesthetic medicine. Therefore, more research is still needed in clinical aspects to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of homologous traditional Chinese medicinal materials of medicine and food in treating facial minimally invasive aesthetic medicine to support its therapeutic application. The current manuscript summarized the active ingredients and mechanisms of action of medicinal homologous Chinese herbal medicine to facilitate post-operative rehabilitation. Compatibility principles, mechanism of action, and selection of functional evaluation models of medicinal homologous Chinese herbal medicines as dietary supplements were reviewed. Our investigation provided new perspectives for the future extraction of active ingredients from medicinal homologous plants as drug or for the development of new dietary supplements, and potential alternative treatments for postoperative rehabilitation of minimally invasive cosmetic procedures.

AB  - Mechanisms of saliva formation by wombat parotid glands were investigated in anaesthetized wombats at two levels of cholinergically-stimulated flow viz. mid-range (30-40% maximum flow) and maximum flow using ion-transport and carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors. Bumetanide (0.005-0.1 mmol l(-1) carotid plasma) progressively reduced mid-range flow by 52 +/- 3.4% (mean +/- SEM). Concurrently, saliva [Cl] decreased, [Na] and [HCO3] increased but HCO3 excretion was unaltered. Salivary flow during high-rate cholinergic stimulation was 31 +/- 1.1% of the pre-bumetanide maximum. During mid-range stimulation, SITS (0.075 mmol l(-1)) was without effect whereas 0.75 mmol l(-1) stimulated transient increases in fluid output. The higher SITS concentration caused no alterations to flow or electrolyte concentrations during maximal stimulation. Carotid plasma [amiloride] (0.05 mmol l(-1)) caused immediate falls in flow rate of 20-30% followed by progressive recovery over 25 min to levels above pre-amiloride flow rates despite plasma [amiloride] increasing tenfold. Concurrently, salivary [Na] and [Cl] rose to equal plasma concentrations and [K] fell by 50% indicating blockade of acinar Na/H exchangers and luminal Na channels in the ducts. Increased salivary osmolarity caused the flow recovery. Saliva flow during maximum cholinergic stimulation was reduced by 38-46%. The depression of flow was interpreted as resulting from competition between amiloride and acetylcholine for access to the muscarinic receptors. Plasma [acetazolamide] (0.35-2.5 mmol l(-1)) did not alter saliva outflow during mid-range or maximum flow regimes whereas salivary [Cl] increased and [HCO3] decreased consistent with reduced anion exchange resulting from inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Combined with bumetanide, acetazolamide (1.5 mmol l(-1)) reduced flow by an additional 18-22% relative to bumetanide alone thereby demonstrating that acinar HCO3 synthesis supported a limited proportion of saliva formation and that some HCO3 secretion was independent of carbonic anhydrase activity.

AB  - Schooling as an ecological phenomenon first arose in the early Teleostei about 200-220 million years ago; there are currently no rigorous data on the presence of this form of social behavior in older fish, including Elasmobranchii. The evolutionary path of the emergence of schools could pass through several successive stages from asociality to aggregations and proto-schools and then to true equipotential schools. Schooling fish follow the same path in their early ontogeny. This article discusses the motives for the emergence of schooling behavior (ensuring the protection and survival of ancient fish during their development of the pelagic zone) and the prerequisites for the emergence and development of schooling (characteristics that fish transitioning to schooling should have). It is quite obvious that schooling is not related to evolutionary age or phylogenetic relationships of taxonomic groups or individual species of Teleostei. The transition to a schooling lifestyle is due to a change in the ecology of fish in connection with the development of new habitat conditions. Having arisen, schooling behavior disappears and again and repeatedly arises independently not only in different groups, but also among closely related Teleostei. Evolutionarily acquired schooling can be transformed into other forms of social behavior when personalization appears. Information about the genetic nature of schooling has been given.

AB  - This study aims to propose a large language model (LLM)-enhanced defect question-answering (QA) method that can secure private and sensitive data while yielding high performance. Prompt responses to residents' complaints are crucial for preventing recurring defects. However, traditional defect analysis and response methods rely on the expertise of a few skilled workers, making it difficult to ensure timely responses. The rapid advancement of LLMs offers a potential solution for improving defect QA tasks. However, many companies prohibit the use of closed-source LLM services, such as ChatGPT, due to concerns about potential data breaches. One possible solution is to use open-source LLMs like Llama and BERT, which can be locally installed and used. However, opensource LLMs typically perform worse than closed-source LLMs. Although the performance of open-source LLMs can be greatly improved through fine-tuning, the preparation of training datasets requires a significant amount of time and labor. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid defect QA method that deploys an opensource LLM for defect management to secure sensitive information, and a closed-source LLM for generating a training dataset to reduce both the time and labor required. To validate the proposed method, we compare it to the state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o and Llama 3, as well as graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG)based QA systems, which have been extensively studied recently. Our results show that the hybrid LLM-based QA method achieved the highest ROUGE score of 81.6%. These findings demonstrate superior practical applicability, enabling cost-effective data generation and reliable domain adaptation within a secure data environment. This approach is beneficial for domain-specific tasks beyond defect management, where the accurate provision of specialized information and integration of historical knowledge are essential.

AB  - The study evaluated the effect of piper meal which contains flavonoids, essential oils, and phenolic adds on the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT), and as well as oxidative stress indicators such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl-scavenging activity and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the ruminal fluid, mammary tissue, milk, and blood of lactating goats. Fourteen early lactating Saanen goats (body weight, 44 +/- 2.51 kg; 14 +/- 3 days in milk) were allotted in equal number to two experimental groups, each received one of the two total mixed rations: control (CON) diet (containing 0% piper meal) and CPM diet (CON diet containing 1.3% piper meal per kg dry matter). Compared with goats fed the CON diet, those fed CPM diet had similar 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl-scavenging, GPx and CAT activity in ruminal fluid, mammary tissue, milk, and blood; however, those samples had increased SOD activity. Dietary CPM diet had a tendency to decrease TBARS production in ruminal fluid, mammary tissue, milk, and plasma by about 2.4, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.4 folds, respectively. Furthermore, alleviated values of TBARS were associated with dwindling mRNA expression of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) but greater expression of SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NFE2L2) in mammary tissue. Our findings showed that the inclusion of 13.09 piper meal in per kg diet (CPM) can improve the oxidative status of Saanen goats in early lactation.

AB  - Plastid-mediated RNA interference has emerged as a promising and effective approach for pest management. By expressing high levels of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in plastid that target essential pest genes, it has been demonstrated to effectively control certain herbivorous beetles and spider mites. However, as plants are sessile organisms, they frequently experience a combination of biotic and abiotic stresses. It remains unclear whether abiotic stress, such as drought stress, influences the accumulation of dsRNAs produced in plastids and its effectiveness in controlling pests. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of drought stress on dsACT expression in transplastomic poplar plants and its control efficiency against the willow leaf beetle (Plagiodera versicolora). Our findings revealed that drought stress did not significantly affect the dsRNA contents in transplastomic poplar plants, but it did lead to higher mortality of insect larvae. This increased mortality may be attributed to increased levels of jasmonic acid and cysteine proteinase inhibitor induced by water deficit. These results contribute to understanding of the mechanisms linking water deficit in plants to insect performance and provide valuable insights for implementing appropriate pest control strategies under drought stress conditions.

AB  - Swine growers seeking to lower costs and environmental impact have turned to alternative carbohydrate feed sources. A feeding trial was conducted to determine the effect carbohydrate sources have on manure composition and gas emissions. A total of 48 gilts averaging 138 kg BW were fed diets consisting of (a) low fiber (LF) grain, or (b) high fiber (HF) aro-industrial co-product (AICP). The LF diets included corn and soybean meal (CSBM) and barley soybean meal (BSBM). The HF AICP diets were CSBM based and supplemented with one of the following materials: beet pulp; corn distillers dried grains with solubles; soybean hulls; or wheat bran. Diets were fed for 42 d with an average daily feed intake of 2.71 kg d(-1). Feces and urine were collected twice daily and added to manure storage containers in which manure slurries were monitored for gas emissions and chemical properties. Manures of animals fed HF diets had significantly (P < 0.05) more excretion of solids, C, N, and organic N, but less total S compared to pigs fed the LF diets. Animals feed HF diets had significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of ammonia, sulfide, volatile fatty acids, and phenols in manure compared to pigs fed the LF diets. Manure of animals fed HF diets had 30% (P < 0.05) lower NH3 and 17% lower hydrogen sulfide emissions; however, fiber had no impact on odor emissions. Based on the partitioning of nutrients, animals fed HF fiber diets had increased manure retention for C and N but decreased levels of N gas emissions and manure S. There were little differences in manure and gas emissions for animals fed LF diets, but the source of HF AICP diets had a significant impact on manure composition and gas emissions.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the taxonomic and functional patterns of the microbiome associated with Barbour's seahorse (Hippocampus barbouri) using a combination of shotgun metagenomics and bioinformatics. The analyses revealed that Pseudomonadota and Bacillota were the dominant phyla in the seahorse skin microbiome, whereas Pseudomonadota and, to a lesser extent, Bacillota and Bacteroidota were the dominant phyla in the seahorse gut microbiome. Several metabolic pathway categories were found to be enriched in the skin microbiome, including amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactor and vitamin metabolism, energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, as well as membrane transport, signal transduction, and cellular community-prokaryotes. In contrast, the gut microbiome exhibited enrichment in metabolic pathways associated with the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism, and quorum sensing. Additionally, although the relative abundance of bacteriocins in the skin and gut was slightly similar, notable differences were observed at the class level. Specifically, class I bacteriocins were found to be more abundant in the skin microbiome, whereas class III bacteriocins were more abundant in the gut microbiome. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first comprehensive examination of the taxonomic and functional patterns of the skin and gut microbiome in Barbour's seahorse. These findings can greatly contribute to a deeper understanding of the seahorse-associated microbiome, which can play a pivotal role in predicting and controlling bacterial infections, thereby contributing to the success of aquaculture and health-promoting initiatives.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients were usually found with the hyper-activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and a deficit in fear extinction learning. The OFC can be subdivided into the lateral OFC (lOFC) and the medial OFC (mOFC). Previous studies have suggested that both subregions are involved in the modulation of negative emotions. However, how aberrant activation of the OFC interacts with the encoding of Pavlovian fear remains unknown. In this study, the lOFC or the mOFC was pharmacologically activated or inactivated before the fear conditioning on Day 1, followed by a context test on Day 2 and a tone test on Day 3 in male Long-Evans rats. We found that for the animals that underwent fear conditioning under aberrant activation of either the lOFC or the mOFC, they showed normal within-session fear expression. However, the acquisition/consolidation of contextual fear was impaired under mOFC activation, while the acquisition/consolidation of cued fear was impaired under either the lOFC or the mOFC activation, in that these animals showed lower freezing compared to controls during the retrieval test. On the other hand, for the animals that underwent fear conditioning under inactivation of either the lOFC or the mOFC, they showed normal within-session fear expression, as well as intact encoding of both the contextual and cued fear. Together, our results suggested that the OFC was not actively engaged in the acquisition of Pavlovian fear conditioning, but aberrant activation of the OFC impaired fear learning.

AB  - We have previously reported specific swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) haplotype associations with significant effects on several reproduction performance traits in a highly inbred miniature pig population of Microminipigs (MMPs). In this study, to clarify the effects on farrowing rates of SLA similarity between mating partners in the MMP population, we compared the farrowing rates as a measure of reproductive success after 1063-cumulative matings among the following three groups of mating partners: (1) completely sharing SLA class I or class II haplotypes or alleles between partners (CS), (2) only one sharing the haplotypes or alleles (OS), and (3) non-sharing the haplotypes or alleles (NS). Average farrowing rates in CS groups consisting of completely sharing SLA class II haplotypes or DRBI and DQB1 alleles were lowest in the three groups. Moreover, lower farrowing rates were indicated in mating pairs with smaller amino acid pairwise genetic distances of SLA-1, SLA-3, DRB1 and DQB1 alleles between the pairs. These results suggested that the dissimilarity of SLA class I and class II alleles between mating partners markedly improved reproductive performance; therefore, SLA alleles or haplotypes are potentially useful genetic markers for the selection of mating pairs in breeding programs and epistatic studies of reproductive traits of MMPs.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition of total ration silage (TRS) containing two babassu by-products to replace the corn. The silages were formulated to meet the requirements of sheep for an average daily gain of 200 g/day. A completely randomized experimental design was used with four treatments and five replications. The treatments consisted of CS: Corn silage (Control); TRSS: Corn silage with corn and soybean meal; TRSF: Total ration silage with babassu mesocarp flour; and TRSC: Total feed silage with babassu cake. The chemical composition of the silages had a significant difference (p < 0.05) for all variates. There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) for gas (LG, p < 0.001) and effluent losses (LE, p < 0.001), dry matter recovery (DMR, p < 0.001), buffer capacity (BC, p < 0.001), lactic acid (LA, p < 0.001), butyric acid (BA, p < 0.001), lactic acid/fermentation products (LA:FP, p < 0.001), and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N, p < 0.001). The babassu by-products can replace ground corn by up to 50% in total ration silage and improve the fermentation profile and nutritional value of the silage, meeting the nutritional requirements of finishing sheep.

AB  - With the vigorous development of intelligence agriculture, the progress of automated largescale and intensive pig farming has accelerated significantly. As a biological feature, the pig face has important research significance for precise breeding of pigs and traceability of health. In the management of live pigs, many managers adopt traditional methods, including color marking and RFID identification, but there will be problems such as off-label, mixed-label and waste of manpower. This work proposes a non-invasive way to study the identification of multiple individuals in pigs. The model was to first replace the original backbone network of YOLOv4 with MobileNet-v3, a popular lightweight network. Then depth-wise separable convolution was adopted in YOLOv40s feature extraction network SPP and PANet to further reduce network parameters. Moreover, CBAM attention mechanism formed by the concatenation of CAM and SAM was added to PANet to ensure the network accuracy while reducing the model weight. The introduction of multi-attention mechanism selectively strengthened key areas of pig face and filtered out weak correlation features, so as to improve the overall model effect. Finally, an improved MobileNetv3YOLOv4-PACNet (M-YOLOv4-C) network model was proposed to identify individual sows. The mAP were 98.15 %, the detection speed FPS were 106.3frames/s, and the model parameter size was only 44.74 MB, which can be well implanted into the small-volume pig house management sensors and applied to the pig management system in a lightweight, fast and accurate manner. This model will provide model support for subsequent pig behavior recognition and posture analysis.<br /> (c) 2023 China Agricultural University.

AB  - The presence of predators can induce non-consumptive effects on prey that result in subsequent changes to prey behaviour and defence. We investigate the interaction between top-down non-consumptive effects of various stages of the predator Coccinella septempunctata L.(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (larvae and adult) and bottom-up effects of host nutrition on Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) oviposition and larval host choice. We also compare the effect of presence of intact predators, predators without mandibles, confined predators and a no predator control treatment on P. xylostella larval growth, survival and herbivory. Host plant nutrition influenced the host choice of adult female P. xylostella; no interaction was observed between bottom-up host plant nutrition and the presence of C. septempunctata adults or larvae on oviposition or larval host choice by P. xylostella. Predator presence impacted larval feeding and weight gain. The presence of free-moving C. septempunctata adults without mandibles that could not predate P. xylostella reduced mean leaf consumption by P. xylostella larvae to 1.88 +/- 0.21 cm2 and reduced weight gain to 2.12 +/- 0.16 mg. Despite differences in leaf damage and larval weight gain, survival remained consistent across the non-consumptive treatments. Intact C. septempunctata larvae reduced leaf damage and subsequent P. xylostella larval weight gain. The presence of larval predators across the non-consumptive treatments, however, had no effect on feeding damage or weight gain. Results of our investigation indicate that C. septempunctata causes some non-consumptive effects on P. xylostella that depend on predator life stage, level of confinement and prey life stage. It is likely that P. xylostella responds to multi-modal cues in predator detection.
