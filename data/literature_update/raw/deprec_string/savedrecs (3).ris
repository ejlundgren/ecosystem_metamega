AB  - Camellia oleifera is intensively cultivated in subtropical areas of China, exposing soils to various threats. However, the effect of long-term cultivation of Camellia oleifera on soil properties remains unclear and needs to be elucidated to improve soil and Camelia oleifera sustainable management. This study collected soil samples from different Camellia oleifera planting ages (2, 10, and 40 years) and performed aggregate fractionation and various analyses including physico-chemical, soil organic matter chemical composition analyses and a semi-quantitative analysis of organic carbon functional groups to investigate the effect of long-term cultivation of Camellia oleifera on soil macroaggregates (< 2 mm), mesoaggregates (2-0.25 mm) and microaggregates (< 0.25 mm) formation, soil organic matter (SOM), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK). The aggregate particles increased with increasing Camellia oleifera planting ages. Camellia oleifera long-term cultivation did not affected the soil pH in the aggregates, but significantly (P < 0.05) increased SOM concentration with the decrease in soil aggregate size. Similarly, Phenolics-C, ketones-C, lignins-C, and alkenes-C increased in soil aggregates with increasing cultivation time and are mainly distributed in < 0.25 mm fraction. The aromatics-C, carboxylic-C, aliphatic-C, and polysaccharides-C declined with increasing cultivation time and were mainly distributed in 2-0.25 mm and < 2 mm fraction. AN is abundantly distributed in 2-0.25 mm and its abundance increases with Camellia oleifera long-term cultivation. All soils were poor in AP and AK. Our study indicated that long-term cultivation of Camellia oleifera promoted soil aggregate formation, increased available nitrogen (AN), soil organic matter (SOM) and controlled the change of SOM chemical composition. However, our study recommended providing available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) in soil with Camellia oleifera cultivation for sustainable management.

AB  - Asphondylia borrichiae induces galls at the apical meristems of its host plant, Borrichia frutescens, and the larvae develop and pupate within the gall. During development, immature stages of the midge are attacked by four species of parasitic wasps; two of these parasitoids, Galeopsomyia haemon and Torymus umbilicatus, are the most common members of the guild, and both are hyperparasitic.In the current study, plots of B. frutescens were randomly assigned to control (unmanipulated), salted or fertilised in a long-term press experiment. Although plots initially exhibited no differences in stem length, gall and flower densities, after 3 months, they began to exhibit significant differences, suggesting stress (salted plots) and vigour (fertilised plots).Galls produced on plants from fertilised plots were approximately 20% and 31% larger than those from control and salted plots, respectively.Larger gall diameter in fertilised plots resulted in a shift of the parasitoid community towards the largest parasitoid, T. umgbilicatus, whereas smaller galls produced in salted plots became biased towards the smallest, but gregarious, G. haemon; interestingly, this pattern held for T. umbilicatus across treatments, and the effect for G. haemon was not significant when all treatments were combined.This study suggests that abiotic factors that alter host plant characteristics, such as gall diameter, affect the composition of the parasitoid guild that attacks A. borrichiae, which has implications for the acquisition of enemy-free space during host range expansion of the midge.

AB  - The Karoo Basin of South Africa is renowned for its abundance and diversity of therapsid fossils. Among the most ubiquitous and persistent of the Permian fauna is the small herbivorous dicynodont Diictodon feliceps. Intraspecific variation in Diictodon is historically confounding, and while ontogeny is frequently cited as a potential source of variation, observable developmental changes have never been calibrated. The present study revisits this issue, comparing three-dimensional landmark configurations of 82 Diictodon crania to investigate the association between shape, size and dimorphism. Beyond the statistically significant relationship between shape and allometry, our results determine the shape differences between juvenile and adult skulls of Diictodon, aligned with common craniofacial features documented in other tetrapod taxa. Functionally, these changes are attributed to development of the jaw musculature for feeding on larger, tougher plant matter during later ontogeny. Cranial morphological variation owing to sexual dimorphism is negligible, but distinct differences are noted in the allometric trajectories of each morphotype. A component of non-allometric variation cannot be accounted for, and we propose that this represents natural variation, rather than an artefact of taphonomic deformation.

AB  - Natural selection should favor individuals that synchronize energy-demanding aspects of reproductive activity with periods of high resource abundance and predictability, leading to seasonal patterns of reproduction at the population level. Nonetheless, few studies-especially those on bats in the Neotropics-have used rigorous quantitative criteria to distinguish among phenological patterns for different populations from the same habitat or for the same species in different habitats. To explore such issues, we quantified annual patterns of reproduction in male and in female bats from lowland Amazonia (environs of Iquitos, Peru), and did so at the level of populations and ensembles. Five species exhibited unimodal patterns including Artibeus obscurus, A. planirostris, Carollia benkeithi, Phyllostomus hastatus, and Rhinophylla pumilio. Two species (A. lituratus and Glossophaga soricina) evinced bimodal patterns with reproductive peaks separated by patterns of inactivity, whereas four species (C. brevicauda, C. perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, and S. tildae) evinced a bimodal pattern in which peaks in activity occur in tandem, with the first peak generally markedly higher than the second peak. Frugivore, gleaning animalivore, and nectarivore ensembles exhibited bimodal, unimodal, and bimodal reproductive phenologies, respectively. Nonetheless, interannual variation in phenology (i.e., the monthly timing of peaks within a season rather than the number of peaks per year) characterized four (A. obscurus, C. brevicauda, C. perspicillata, and S. lilium) of the eight species and each of the three ensembles (frugivores, gleaning animalivores, and nectarivores) with adequate sampling. Regardless of interspecific variation in strategies, the phenology of reproduction enhances the likelihood that parturition and recruitment of young into the population occurs during the wet season, the period of likely highest resource abundance. Based on a comparison of our results with those from other well-studied bat populations, four species did not exhibit geographic variation in reproductive phenologies (A. obscurus, G. soricina, C. brevicauda, and R. pumilio), whereas three species evinced such geographic variation (A. lituratus, A. planirostris, and C. perspicillata). Climate change will likely alter the seasons and extents of propitious times for reproductive activities, as well as the reliability of proximate cues for initiating reproduction, compromising current reproductive strategies and leading to altered phenological patterns of reproduction or reproductive success, possibly resulting in local extinction of some species.

AB  - The currently most widespread stunning method for pigs is high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), but this method is under scrutiny due to animal welfare deficits. One alternative method currently under development with potential to replace CO2 is nitrogen (N2) filled high expansion foam. While N2 does not elicit the same aversive behaviour as CO2, it is currently not known if the high expansion foam itself may be frightening to the pigs. Means to alleviate fear reactions to foam could consist of diverting pigs' attention using aromas (an odour in combination with taste) of interest to them. The current study aimed to investigate if an added aroma (vanilla aroma) affected pigs' avoidance and exploratory behaviour when exposed to air-filled high expansion foam in a foam box. The study included 50 pigs (30 females, 20 males) of 14-16 weeks of age, of different crosses between Yorkshire, Hampshire and Duroc. The pigs were randomly assigned to either the treatment with air-filled foam with added aroma or the control treatment with no added aroma, which they were exposed to in a foam box. The results showed that pigs with the aromatised foam expressed significantly more exploration behaviour directed towards the foam and box walls, but not towards the floor or the lid. The aromatised foam also resulted in a higher activity level of the pigs. In contrast to the hypotheses, pigs with aromatised foam expressed more avoidance behaviour, and escape attempts were exclusively observed when pigs were exposed to aromatised foam. Slipping events and frequency of vocalisations did not differ between pigs with and without aroma added to the foam. This study shows that an added aroma (taste and odour in combination) increased pigs' exploration behaviour towards the foam, and thus could serve as a distraction for the pigs when inside a confined foam box. The results emphasise the importance of taking foam aroma into consideration in the further development of the N2-filled high expansion as a stunning method. The potential anxiety- or stress-reducing effect of any added aroma needs further investigation, and future studies should focus on assessing various types of aromas, and/or odours, as well as different concentrations of the compounds to determine which solution is most efficient in alleviating pig stress and anxiety.

AB  - Agroforestry and protected areas are alternatives to mitigate the adverse impacts generated by human activities in the tropical forests of the Peruvian Amazon. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of natural and agroforestry systems of Cedrilinga catenaeformis (Tornillo) on soil properties. The physical, chemical, and soil macrofauna properties, as well as dendrometric variables of Tornillo aged 140 and 180 years in natural systems and 7, 17 and 37 years in agroforestry systems, were examined. Results revealed variability in soil properties depending on their origin; however, no marked differences were observed due to tree age or natural versus agroforestry condition. Regarding soil macrofauna, greater diversity was noted in the older agroforestry system, while dendrometric variables exhibited a sigmoidal behavior, except for wood volume, which showed a linear increase. Agroforestry systems of Tornillo associated with Centrosema macrocarpum (Centrosema) maintain soil properties similarly compared to natural systems; however, the soil of the oldest agroforestry system showed higher activity of earthworms Rhinodrilus lavellei, Rhinodrilus pashanasii, Diptera orders, and Julidae, compared to soils of more recent agroforestry systems and natural systems. It was estimated that dendrometric variables of Tornillo show stagnation in the increase of total height at 150 years, commercial height at 165 years, and DBH at 70 years. Meanwhile, total height and DBH showed very strong and strong positive correlations (p < 0.05) with soil N content and CEC in agroforestry systems with 17 and 37 years. Estimating dendrometric variables and understanding the nutritional requirements in the growth and development of Tornillo will contribute to its more effective management in natural and agroforestry ecosystems in the Amazon region.

AB  - Stable isotopes are increasingly being used to unlock the wealth of information contained in specimens preserved in museum collections. However, preservation methods that employ formalin may confound ecological interpretations. To quantify the effects of fonnalin fixation and subsequent fluid storage in ethanol on the isotopic signatures of small mammal hair, we analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-1(5) values from specimens of seven rodent species that were sampled repeatedly both before and after varying lengths of formalin fixation (1-11 days) and ethanol storage (1-6 years). We supplemented these data with a 2-week fixation experiment using deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in which no ethanol storage was employed. As expected, preservation in fonnalin and ethanol had no discernable effect on delta N-1(5) values. In contrast, specimen delta C-13 values decreased in a saturating fashion during formalin fixation and over subsequent years of fluid storage in ethanol. On the basis of models that we fit to these time series, we estimate the long-term effect of fixation and storage on delta C-13 values to be -0.92 parts per thousand after 4 years. This biologically relevant shift in VC values should be accounted for when inferring the diets of species from fluid-stored museum collections and when comparing across specimens with different preservation histories.

AB  - Inadequate handling of poultry manure can cause significant releases of NH3, heavy metals, and estrogen, thereby impairing environmental quality. This study was a composting experiment involving the combination of poultry manure with plant residues (corn stalks, mushroom residues, and vegetable straw), as well as with either wheat stalk biochar (WB) or rice husk biochar (RB). The integrated effects of plant residues and biochar on NH3 loss, heavy metal (Cu, Zn, As, and Cd) stabilization, and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) dissipation were investigated during composting. The poultry manure co-composted with corn straw and mushroom residue showed the highest potential for E2 degradation. Biochar enhanced E2 dissipation and decreased estrogenic activity in all treatments, with RB showing a stronger effect than WB. Both biochars decreased microbial diversity and increased bacterial groups related to E2 and organic matter degradation center dot NH3 emission was reduced by 50-82% with 15% WB and 86-97% with 15% RB. The extractable fraction of As was reduced by 0-53% with WB and 50-84% with RB, while that of Cd was reduced by 5-28% for WB and 25-41% for RB in poultry manure compost. However, biochar showed little effect on Cu and Zn. Biochar appears to have a promotional effect and enhances the microbial degradation of E2. Specifically, the integration of corn stalks, mushroom residues, and RB in poultry manure compost had a positive effect by preventing nitrogen loss while reducing the bioavailability of heavy metals and hormones.

AB  - Although invertebrate herbivores commonly impact terrestrial plant diseases by facilitating transmission of plant pathogens and increasing host susceptibility to infection via wounding, less is known about the role of herbivores in marine plant disease dynamics. Importantly, transmission via herbivores may not be required in the ocean since saline ocean waters support pathogen survival and transmission. Through laboratory experiments with eelgrass (Zostera marina), we showed that isopods (Pentidotea wosnesenskii) and snails (Lacuna spp.) created grazing scars that increased disease severity and thus indirectly facilitated transmission of Labyrinthula zosterae (Lz), a protist that causes seagrass wasting disease. Experiments also quantified different feeding preferences among herbivores: Amphipods (Ampithoe lacertosa) selectively consumed diseased eelgrass, while isopods and snails selectively grazed asymptomatic leaves, suggesting different herbivore taxa may have contrasting impacts on disease dynamics. Our experiments show no sign that herbivores directly vector Lz from diseased to asymptomatic eelgrass. However, we isolated live Lz from isopod, amphipod, and snail feces and detected Lz with quantitative polymerase chain reaction in amphipods and snails, suggesting that herbivores eating diseased eelgrass could pass the live pathogen. Finally, field surveys demonstrated a close association between seagrass wasting disease and invertebrate grazing scars; disease prevalence was 29 +/- 4.7% (95% CI) higher on eelgrass leaves with herbivore scars. Collectively, these findings show that some herbivores can increase eelgrass disease risk by facilitating the spread of an important pathogen via wounding, but not via direct transmission. Thus, herbivores may play different roles in plant disease dynamics in terrestrial versus marine ecosystems depending on the pathogen's ability to survive and transmit without a vector.

AB  - Lvliang black goat (LBG) is an excellent local breed resource in China that is known for its black fur, excellent meat quality, and strong adaptability. Studying the genetic mechanism and germplasm characteristics of LBG can provide theoretical and practical basis for the protection of the genetic resources of this breed and help implement conservation and breeding. In this study, the genetic diversity of the LBG population was evaluated using whole-genome SNP data. It was found that the LBG population had a high genetic diversity and a low degree of inbreeding. According to the clustering results of male goats and the relationship between individuals, the LBG population was divided into 13 families. Then, through population structure analysis, it was found that LBG had a close genetic relationship with the Nanjiang goat and Qinggoda goat populations, and they may have the same ancestors. The LBG population has retained some ancient genetic characteristics and is a special population that integrates local genetic characteristics and foreign gene flow. Through four selection signal analyses, we detected multiple candidate genes related to economic traits (CFL2, SCD, NLRP14, etc.) and adaptability (C4BPA, FUT8, PRNP, etc.) in the LBG population. In addition, in a comparative analysis with three commercial breeds (Saanen goat, Boer goat and Angora goat) we also found multiple genes related to physical characteristics (ERG, NRG3, EDN3, etc.). Finally, we performed functional enrichment analysis on these genes and explored their genetic mechanisms. This study provides important data support for the protection and breeding of LBG and provides a new perspective for enriching the genetic diversity of goat populations.

AB  - Purpose The effects of microbes and agrochemicals on crop plants are previously reported via seed treatments. We know little about the impacts of fungicides and microbial seed treatments on soybean shoot and root traits.
   Methods We investigated the effects of separate consortia of two plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) such as Bacillus simplex R180 and Burkholderia ambifaria C628, two Fusarium species (Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium graminearum) (Fusarium), and Fungicides seed treatments on soybean traits.
   Results and Conclusions The PGPR and Fusarium increased and reduced the root and shoot dry mass of soybean plants, respectively. Fusarium infected plants had a relatively higher trichome leaf density followed by the PGPR, Control, Fungicide + PGPR, and Fungicides treatments. The PGPR increased P contents, while Fusarium reduced Mg and Mn contents of soybean shoot tissues. The nutrient contents of large and fine roots also varied across the seed treatments. Overall, fine roots showed higher mineral contents than large roots. Soybean roots showed relatively higher mineral contents such as Mg, Zn, Ca, Mn, Cu, B, Fe, and Mo in the fungicide + PGPR and fungicide treatments. Root K contents were substantially higher in the microbial than chemical treatments. The reduced and increased trichome density as well as tissue P contents in response to the Fungicides and microbial (PGPR, Fusarium) treatments, respectively, suggest the negative and positive effects of fungicides and microbes on soybean root and shoot traits. In conclusion, chemicals, pathogenic and beneficial microbes may influence plant shoot and root traits that are important for plant growth and development.

AB  - The cultivation of fast-growing tree species in short rotation coppices has gained popularity in Germany in recent years. The resilience of these coppices to phyllophagous pest organisms is crucial for their profitable management, since the loss of a single annual increment can lead to uncompensable economic losses. To study the effects of leaf loss on the growth of poplar and willow varieties that are frequently cultivated under local conditions, three sample short rotation coppices including five poplar (Populus spp.) and three willow (Salix spp.) varieties were established in a randomized block design with four artificial defoliation variants and, on one site, with three different variants regarding the number of defoliation treatments. After up to three defoliation treatments within two growing seasons, the results show negative effects of leaf loss on the height growth and the fresh weight of the aboveground biomass of plants. Our data also suggests a lasting effect of defoliation on plant growth and re-growth after the end of the treatment. In general, defoliation had a greater impact on the growth of poplars than on willows. We conclude that even minor leaf loss can have an impact on plant growth but that the actual effects of defoliation clearly depend on the site, tree species, and variety as well as the extent and number of defoliations, which determine the ability of plants for compensatory growth.

AB  - Polydrusus aeratus Gravenhorst, 1807 is a pest of both coniferous and deciduous trees in forests. It is widespread throughout the Czech Republic from the lowlands to the mountains. Adult beetles occur from April to September. In the western Czech Republic, a number of 1- to 2-m tall Abies alba were recently damaged by P. aeratus adults at an altitude of 750 m. P. aeratus can damage older saplings that were damaged as young saplings by the pine weevil. The damage caused by P. aeratus is so for rather small but should not be neglected by foresters. As the ongoing climate change modifies the relationship between trees and pests, also currently indifferent species may become dangerous for forests in near feature. Therefore, scientists would focus also on relatively less dangerous species of pests, especially insects. Possible methods for controlling of P. aeratus are suggested as main output of the study.

AB  - Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), traditionally used for textile fiber, has gained interest as animal feed due to its nutritional properties. This study investigated the impact of supplementing goats' diets with hemp hay on the milk yield, composition, and fatty acid profile of 20 dairy goats. The milk yield was higher in the hemp group, though the milk composition remained unchanged. The fatty acid profile of the hemp group's milk showed lower levels of certain saturated fatty acids (C11:0, C12:0, C13:0, C14:0, C15:0, and C17:0) and higher levels of C16:0 and C18:0. Additionally, the hemp group's milk had lower levels of some polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18:2 n6 and C20:4) but higher C20:5 n3 levels. Hemp hay may represent an advantageous alternative as feed supplementation in grazing goats' diet. Also, in terms of eco-sustainability and the efficiency of agricultural production, the hemp hay is a by-product of the supply chain, which may represent an additional benefit of its use in ruminant nutrition. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a cosmopolitan annual herbaceous plant used in the past as a source of textile fiber. Currently, hemp is receiving great interest as animal feed due to its chemical and nutritional properties. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of supplementing goats' diets with hemp hay on the milk yield, chemical composition, and fatty acid profile. Twenty multiparous goats, immediately after kidding, were divided into two homogenous groups (C: control vs. H: hemp); the goats had free access to the pasture, and both groups received a supplement of 500 g/head/day of a barley and corn meal mixture (50/50). In addition, group H was given 250 g/head/day of hemp hay while group C received the same amount of alfalfa hay. The milk yield was measured daily, and milk samples were collected monthly 4 times to evaluate the milk composition and fatty acid profile. The milk yield was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the experimental group, while no differences were found in the milk chemical composition. Concerning the fatty acid profile, the milk from group H was characterized by significantly lower concentrations of C11:0, C12:0, C13:0, C14:0, C15:0, and C17:0 and higher C16:0 and C18:0. Among the polyunsaturated FA, C18:2 n6 and C20:4 were significantly (p < 0.001) lower, and C20:5 n3 was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the milk from group H than that from group C. The n6/n3, LA/ALA and AA/EPA ratios were significantly (p < 0.001) lower in the milk from group H, while the CLAs were unaffected by the treatment.

AB  - Huge genetic diversity is evident among the diverse goat breeds in terms of production, reproduction, adaptability, growth, disease resistance and thermo-tolerance. This diversity is an outcome of both natural and artificial selection acting on the caprine genome over the years. A fine characterization of whole genome variation is now possible by employing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. To explore underlying genetics, genome-wide analysis of genetic markers is the best resolution. The study strived to capture variation in terms of CNV/CNVRs among 11 Indian goat breeds. In this study, the first ever resequencing-based CNV/CNVR distribution of Indigenous goat breeds was delineated, providing a sizable addition to the prior caprine CNVRs reported. Different diversity metrics were analyzed using identified CNVR. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed separate clustering of Kanniadu (KAN) and Jharkhand Black (JB) from other breeds under the study, indicating their unique genetic profile as the former breeds were sampled from institutional farms. The admixture analysis and introgression revealed by f3 statistics suggested distinct genetic structuring of JB, KAN and TEL(Tellicherry) as compared to the rest of the studied populations. Apart from this, we also identified 32 selection signatures through VST (Variance-stabilizing transformation) method and key genes such as ZBTB7C, BHLHE22, AGT were found elucidating the genetic architecture of hot and cold adaptation in Indian goats.

AB  - The nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulate the hepatic metabolism of androstenone, a testicular steroid that accumulates in the fat of intact male pigs and causes boar taint. This study evaluated natural product-derived compounds and conventional agonists targeting these nuclear receptors for their effects on androstenone metabolism in primary hepatocytes from slaughter-weight boars, to assess their potential as treatments for boar taint. Cells were incubated with natural products, conventional agonists, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; control), then being treated with androstenone. Culture media and cells were analyzed to assess changes in androstenone metabolism and gene expression. UGT1A6 was upregulated by treatments targeting both PXR and CAR and downregulated by FXR agonists. Additionally, PGC1 alpha and NR2F1 were downregulated by compounds targeting PXR/CAR, while FXR and NR0B2 were upregulated and HNF4 alpha downregulated by treatments acting on FXR. The natural products diallyl sulfide (DAS) and (Z)-guggulsterone (GUG) increased overall androstenone metabolism (DAS, GUG) and the production of Phase I androstenol metabolites (DAS), but only in hepatocyte culture replicates that responded positively to these treatments. Although gene expression was similar between positive-response and negative/non-responsive replicates following treatments, negative/non-responsive replicates for several treatments had higher basal expression of UGT2B31, UGT2A1, and SIRT1 and lower basal expression of FXR, PXR, and NR0B1 compared to positive-response replicates. These findings suggest that DAS and GUG may be promising treatments for boar taint, specifically in animals with lower basal rates of androstenone metabolism and higher expression of key nuclear receptors.

AB  - The geographic distribution of the breeds has its role in the management and conservation of the animal genetic resources. Geographically concentrated populations are more vulnerable, due to increased risk of loss of animals in case of disaster or disease outbreak. Many systems for estimation of the risk include components to account for the concentration, usually via the minimum enclosing circle centred in the centroid of the farm locations and containing 75% of the breed. In this study, we present an approach to investigate the concentration on sub-population level and its impact on the population size and diversity. For each subset of farms, concentrated in a circle with radius 25 km and 50 km, we have calculated the potential loss of animals and estimated the effective population size of the remaining population. Although this method is applicable to breeds present in a small number of farms, it provides insight of potential loss of groups of closely located farms The Bulgarian Screw-Horn Longhair Goat, one of the few local goat breeds, is an example of such breed. In year 2020, 20 flocks with 3107 animals were kept, mainly in two distant regions in North-West and South-West Bulgaria, estimated effective population size of the breed - 346. The application of the method to the Bulgarian Screw-Horn Longhair Goat showed that although the breed is not geographically concentrated on country and regional level, there are some clusters of farms in the two main regions. The distribution of the farms and the animals within the farms present a threat of potential loss of 25% to 58% of the population size and effective population size of the remaining population 40% to 88% of the current one.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the suitable reclamation ways of post-mining magnesite. It was hypothesized that adding amendments and planting would decrease pH, increasing the nutrient availability and enhancing the soil microbial activity. Treatments included 200 g gypsum, 2 kg goat manure, and 200 g sulfur per square meter. Cedar (Cedrus libani A. Rich.), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), black pine (Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold), and sainfoin (Onobrychis sativa L.) were planted. Before and after the treatments, samples were taken from each experimental unit and analyzed. Analysis of the data indicated that the pH had decreased by 0.6 and 0.5 units on the gypsum + sulfur- and gypsum + manure-treated experimental units, respectively, compared to the other treated plots. In addition, using manure significantly increased the organic matter N, P, and K content, by 3-fold, 2.5-fold, 7.5-fold, and 2.5-fold, respectively, and enhanced microorganism activity. The sulfur + manure treatment increased microbial C and N approximately twofold. Because the manure, sulfur, and gypsum treatments improved the tailings conditions for plant growth, the use of these amendments for mine tailing reclamation was strongly recommended. Across all treatments, cedar and black pine demonstrated 83 and 77% survival rates for the first 3 years of afforestation, respectively. For the same period, the black locust survival rate was 35% lower than that of the other species. The gypsum + manure application increased seedling height growth by about 20% for all three species compared to the other treatments.

AB  - Yaks have strong adaptability to extremely cold and hypoxic conditions but are susceptible to high ambient temperature when yaks are raised in low-altitude areas during the high-temperature season. Twenty-four adult male yaks with similar weights and ages were randomly divided into TN (Thermoneutral, altitude = 3464 m), LHS (Light heat stress, altitude = 1960 m), and MHS (Medium heat stress, altitude = 906 m) groups to evaluate adaptation strategies to HS. Non-targeted and targeted metabolomics were applied to investigate the effects of different extents of HS on yaks. LHS- and MHS-yaks showed higher rectal temperatures and respiratory rates than TN-yaks. MHS-yaks had higher levels of red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), whole blood relative index of middle shear at a shear rate of 5 S-1 (WMS), whole blood relative index of high shear at a shear rate of 200 S-1 (WHS), Casson viscosity (CV), middle shear flow resistance at a shear rate of 5 S-1 (MSFR), and high shear flow resistance at a shear rate of 200 S-1 (HSFR) as compared to TN- and LHS-yaks. Differential metabolites and metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, were altered by HS. Metabolites in the glucose metabolism pathway in LHS- and MHS-yaks were lower than those in TN-yaks. However, LHS-yaks showed higher levels of metabolites in the HIF-1 signaling pathway compared to TN- and MHS-yaks. Most of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates and fatty acids were significantly decreased in MHS-yaks compared to the other two groups. As a whole, yaks raised at a low altitude (25.6 degrees C) suffered from severe HS, but they adapted to HS with vasodilatation for dissipating heat and the increased antioxidants and metabolite levels of energy substrates.

AB  - Simple Summary Accurate and efficient automatic individual recognition of livestock such as goats is one of the key tasks to achieve smart farming. However, this task is challenging due to factors such as the dense distribution of livestock in a barn. To accurately recognize Chengdu ma goats, a high-quality sheep breed with local characteristics, we construct a Chengdu ma goat dataset containing nearly one thousand images with manual annotation information and propose a method for the automatic individual recognition of Chengdu ma goats using a computer. Experiments demonstrate the usability of our method to accurately recognize Chengdu ma goats under extreme conditions such as dense target distribution and drastic differences in scale. It is worth noting that the method is scalable, which enhances the network's representation ability for data by learning the structural information of goats' head area. The location and category information obtained by our automatic individual recognition method is the basis for realizing a series of subsequent intelligent breeding tasks, such as precision feeding based on age and sex. Our method provides a new idea for automatic livestock recognition and can be extended to be applied to additional types of livestock. The Chengdu ma goat is an excellent local breed in China. As one of the breeds listed in the National List of Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources Protection, the protection of its germplasm resources is particularly important. However, the existing breeding and protection methods for them are relatively simple, due to the weak technical force and lack of intelligent means to assist. Most livestock farmers still conduct small-scale breeding in primitive ways, which is not conducive to the breeding and protection of Chengdu ma goats. In this paper, an automatic individual recognition method for Chengdu ma goats is proposed, which saves labor costs and does not depend on large-scale mechanized facilities. The main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) a new Chengdu ma goat dataset is built, which forms the basis for object detection and classification tasks; (2) an improved detection algorithm for Chengdu ma goats based on TPH-YOLOv5 is proposed, which is able to accurately localize goats in high-density scenes with severe scale variance of targets; (3) a classifier incorporating a self-supervised learning module is implemented to improve the classification performance without increasing the labeled data and inference computation overhead. Experiments show that our method is able to accurately recognize Chengdu ma goats in the actual indoor barn breeding environment, which lays the foundation for precision feeding based on sex and age.

AB  - Heavy metal contaminants may influence tri-trophic interactions among plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies and affect the results of pest management practices. We examined how the widely distributed heavy metal cadmium (Cd) could modify interactions between kidney bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande, and a predator, Orius sauteri (Poppius) by examining Cd effects on the feeding damage on leaves, the growth and reproduction of the thrips, and the feeding and plant location selection behaviors of predators. Leaf feeding damage was significantly reduced only at the highest Cd treatment (625 mg L-1). Survival, reproduction, and population growth of thrips decreased with the increase of Cd treatment concentration (0, 25, and 625 mg L-1). The reproduction rate of thrips from the highest Cd treatment group was reduced to less than 30% of the controls. Predator choice of plants was not impacted at the lowest level of Cd treatment (25 mg L-1) when prey were excluded, but the predators were deterred from plants treated at the high level of Cd (625 mg L-1). However, the predators responded strongly to the presence of prey, and the Cd-based deterrence was effectively eliminated when prey were added. Thus, the presence of Cd can cause a bottom-up effect on the fitness of pests without disrupting the foraging behavior of its predator. Our results provide baseline data on the toxic impacts on the pest and predator, and indicate that the ecology of the system and the biological control efficiency would be potentially impacted by high levels of Cd (625 mg L-1).

AB  - Studying teratological abnormalities in ticks are taxonomically important because this poorly understood biological phenomenon causes difficulties in tick's identification. Globally, reports regarding these abnormalities in ticks, reasons of their causes and their impacts are scarce. According to the available published data, there are no studies regarding teratological abnormalities in ticks from Pakistan. Herein, ticks examined for these abnormalities were museum deposited, collected from buffalos, cattle, camels, goats and sheep in 17 districts of Pakistan during 2017-2023. The abnormalities were observed in 88 out of 3279 (2.68%) ticks, representing eight ixodid species (Rhipicephalus microplus, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides, Haemaphysalis bispinosa, Haemaphysalis montgomeryi, Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma scupense, Hyalomma dromedarii). Among abnormal ticks, 67 abnormalities were characterized as local, 12 as general and nine as a combination of both. Local abnormalities were observed in the scutum, palpal segments, anal aperture, spiracular plates, ventral plates, caudal appendage, festoons and posterior grooves. Also, the constrictions and excavations of body parts were observed. General abnormalities included irregular idiosoma and lateral idiosomal bifurcation. This study, for the first time, highlights the diversity of teratological abnormalities in Pakistani ticks, and are reported in in Hy. anatolicum, Ha. bispinosa and Ha. montgomeryi for the first time.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in adaptation to herbivory has been studied in juvenile (sapling) and adult (reproductive) stages of woody species in African savannas, but has not been studied at the early seedling stage. We hypothesized that, among Vachellia species commonly occurring in African savannas, spinescence increases and growth rate decreases after herbivory, but these responses would be expressed most strongly in populations with slower growing seedlings. Seedlings of V. nilotica , V. tortilis, and V. karroo were grown from seeds of different populations within the Southeastern Coastal Hinterland geomorphic province of South Africa. Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse and clipped at three intensities when they were 3 months old. Responses were determined for seedlings harvested 3 months later. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) interacting effects of clipping and population were rare. Clipping increased the spine mass fraction of V. tortilis seedlings from one population. Clipping reduced the relative height growth of V. nilotica and V. tortilis seedlings, while populations of V. nilotica and V. karroo differed in relative growth rate. We interpret weak vertical regrowth of V. nilotica and V. tortilis seedlings as reflecting adaptation to herbivory reported for saplings and adults in other studies. Conversely, we interpret strong height regrowth of V. karroo seedlings as reflecting adaptation to fire in association with herbivory or shading, as reported for older plants elsewhere. The study highlights the importance of studying plant traits relevant to herbivory in different populations and at different life stages to better understand adaptations to herbivory.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has different functions that affect the absorption and resolution behavior of soil Cd. We investigated two exogenous DOM (pig manure and rice straw) in soils, analyzed their structural features, and explored their effect on Cd behavior in soil. Our results showed that the two exogenous DOM contain similar functional groups, including carboxylic acids, alcohols, alkanes, phenols, and polysaccharides. The molecular weight of DOM in F2 to F4 (3 kD-30 kD) have the effect of activating and migration of Cd. Pot and field experiments demonstrate that DOM from pig manure is more effective in enhancing soil Cd adsorption and reduces the exchangeable Cd in soil during the seedling stage of rice. Under the treatment of pig manure and straw, the Cd in the roots, stems and leaves of rice decreased by 14%, 11%, 10%, and 8%, 14%, 10%, respectively. It indicates that pig manure application reduces Cd accumulation in rice roots, and straw application reduces it in rice stems. Overall, after applying pig manure and rice straw, Cd concentration in rice grains decreased by 36% and 17%, respectively. This study is conducive to a further understanding the behavior and morphological changes of Cd in paddy soil.

AB  - Caloric restriction (CR) studies have traditionally focused on species with conventional reproductive roles, emphasising female's greater investment in costly gametes and parental care. While the divergent impact of CR on males and females is evident across species, the factors driving this variation, that is, resource allocation to reproductive elements as part of distinct life history strategies, remain unclear. To address this, we investigated the effects of CR on development, gene expression and intestinal microbiota in the lined seahorse Hippocampus erectus, a species with male pregnancy, where fathers invest in offspring through gestation. Juvenile seahorses were subjected to ad libitum (AL) or CR feeding for 5 months. CR stunted male growth and brood pouch development, reflecting the energy demands of this crucial parental care trait. However, condition index declined in CR females but not males, while ovarian weight remained unchanged. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated organ- and sex-specific responses to CR with distinct lipid and energy-related pathways activated in male and female livers, indicative of survival enhancement strategies. CR had minimal impact on genes associated with spermatogenesis, but downregulated lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes in ovaries, emphasising the importance of pre-copulatory resource allocation in female gametes. CR strongly shaped gut microbial composition, creating distinct communities from AL seahorses while also driving sex-specific taxonomic differences. Our research indicates that nutrient limitation's impact on males and females is influenced by their allocation of resources to reproduction and parental investment. We underscore the significance of studying species with diverse reproductive strategies, sex roles and life-history strategies.

AB  - Stormwater biofilters are one of the most widely used nature-based solutions for urban water management. In the last 20 years, biofilters have been extensively studied for their pollutant removal performance; however, their application in the field is limited by high maintenance requirements. In this work, we propose the concept of zero additional maintenance (ZAM) biofilters as a solution to this challenge. To understand the design and operation of ZAM biofilters, a three-stage research programme was conducted to (i) examine filter media configurations that could protect against surface clogging, (ii) test the pollutant removal performance of a variety of lawn grasses, and (iii) validate the laboratory findings through field monitoring. The results showed that a protective filter media layer delayed the onset of clogging. Five lawn grasses - Kenda Kikuyu, Empire Zoysia, Santa Ana Couch, Village Green Kikuyu and Palmetto Soft Leaf Buffalo - were found to effectively reduce nitro-gen concentrations and meet other local pollution reduction requirements. Monitoring of three field-scale ZAM biofilters confirmed their high nutrient and heavy metal removal performance. Overall, the findings of these three studies confirm the potential for well-designed ZAM biofilters to achieve stormwater management requirements with no additional maintenance compared with standard street landscaping.

AB  - The Indian forest management system introduced during colonial times has led to the progressive loss of the grazing rights of the country's pastoralists, culminating in the abolishment of grazing fees and replacement with grazing fines in 2004. This scenario has had a negative knock-on effect on the conservation of many of the livestock breeds that pastoralists have developed in adaptation to local environments and that are the basis of the country's food security. This paper illustrates the dilemma with the example of the Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS) in Rajasthan that represents the traditional monsoon grazing area for local camel, sheep and goat pastoralists. Raika herders have engaged in a long-standing but losing legal battle with the state for their continued seasonal access to this area. This situation contributes to the rapid decline of the camel which is an iconic part of Rajasthan's desert identity, a major attraction for tourists and was declared state animal in 2014. The aims of the forest department to conserve wild animals and those of pastoralists and camel conservationists could easily be integrated into a more equitable governance system as is endorsed by Aichi Target 11 of the CBD Strategic Plan 2011-2020. However, deeply engrained concepts about nature being separate from (agri-)culture, as well as unequal power structures, stand in the way.

AB  - Root foraging enables plants to obtain more soil nutrients in a constantly changing nutrient environment. Little is known about the adaptation mechanism of adventitious roots of plants dominated by asexual reproduction (such as tea plants) to soil potassium heterogeneity. We investigated root foraging strategies for K by two tea plants (low-K tolerant genotype "1511" and low-K intolerant genotype "1601") using a multi-layer split-root system. Root exudates, root architecture and transcriptional responses to K heterogeneity were analyzed by HPLC, WinRHIZO and RNA-seq. With the higher leaf K concentrations and K biological utilization indexes, "1511" acclimated to K heterogeneity better than "1601". For "1511", maximum total root length and fine root length proportion appeared on the K-enriched side; the solubilization of soil K reached the maximum on the low-K side, which was consistent with the amount of organic acids released through root exudation. The cellulose decomposition genes that were abundant on the K-enriched side may have promoted root proliferation for "1511". This did not happen in "1601". The low-K tolerant tea genotype "1511" was better at acclimating to K heterogeneity, which was due to a smart root foraging strategy: more roots (especially fine roots) were developed in the K-enriched side; more organic acids were secreted in the low-K side to activate soil K and the root proliferation in the K-enriched side might be due to cellulose decomposition. The present research provides a practical basis for a better understanding of the adaptation strategies of clonal woody plants to soil nutrient availability.

AB  - This study explores a novel surgical method for population control in pregnant capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) within areas endemic to Brazilian spotted fever (BSF), a disease caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii and transmitted by the Amblyomma sp. tick. The proposed technique involves fetus removal and sterilization through a cesarean section performed along the linea alba. Conducted on 43 capybaras in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with all necessary ethical and legal clearances, the surgical procedure featured a periumbilical incision through the linea alba for direct uterine access, facilitation fetal removal and subsequent uterine horn ligature for complete sterilization. The technique proved efficient, with surgeries lasting between 60 and 90 minutes and incisions spanning 5-7 cm, offering minimal hemorrhage, and avoiding excessive abdominal viscera manipulation. Post-surgery, anesthetic recovery was smooth, and no sterilized females produce offspring after the procedure, underscoring the method's effectiveness for capybara population control. This is particularly significant in urban areas where human-capybara interactions are increasing due to residential expansion. The proposed surgical approach demonstrated herein presents a time-efficient and effective strategy for BSF prevention by controlling capybara population. In conclusion, the cesarean section along the linea alba emerges as a viable option for reproductive control in capybaras, with positive outcomes observed in tissue samples and overall animal health condition supporting its application in BSF-endemic regions to help reduce disease incidence.

AB  - Alcids generally fly at low altitudes (below 5 m) over the sea but may occasionally fly higher in certain areas, which may put them at risk of collision with turbine blades in offshore wind farms. We used GPS loggers to investigate the location and altitude of flying Rhinoceros Auklets Cerorhinca monocerata. They typically flew at low altitudes averaging < 1 m but flew higher (> 20 m) when returning the last 5-10 km to their colony, which was located at an elevation of 120-130 m above sea level. Thus, the region over which Rhinoceros Auklets fly highest may vary, depending on the location and elevation of their breeding sites. Therefore, it is important to consider spatio-temporal flight altitude patterns when assessing their collision risks with offshore wind turbines.

AB  - Previous research showed that biochar addition facilitated composting and elevated nutrient retention. However, few of these studies explored bacterial structure and abundance in the compost mixture and biochar additive. Thus, this study aims to distinguish bacterial communities in both compost and bamboo biochar (BB) additive. Results indicated that the dynamics of nutrient contents in compost and BB samples were in a similar pattern, although there were lower levels of nutrients and metals (i.e., Cu and Zn) in BB additives. The total number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in both compost and BB additives peaked on day 7 and then gradually reduced during composting. There was more abundance of bacteria in compost, whereas the diversity of bacteria was more in BB additives. Furthermore, the dominant bacteria in compost and BB samples were distinct at the different stages of composting. The Firmicutes steadily decreased in compost samples (from 34.78% to 7.65%), while it was the dominant phylum in BB additives during the whole composting period. Furthermore, Ruminofilibacter, Pseudoxanthomonas, and Actinomadura were the most abundant genera in compost samples than Pseudoxanthomonas, Azoarcus, and Paenibacillus in BB additives at the final stage of composting. Results from this study could provide a theoretical reference for the sound performance of biochar-added composting.

AB  - This project simulates the Multi-Hazard Tournament (MHT) framework, a decision support system designed for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, using AI agents to enhance decision-making processes for flood mitigation and water resource management. Traditional hydrological models often overlook social dynamics and community preferences crucial for sustainable implementation. The objective of the framework is to develop optimal strategies for protecting water resources, habitats, and communities within a defined budget. The simulation integrates AutoGen for managing multi-agent interactions and DarkIdol-Llama-3.1-8B, an advanced language model, to facilitate complex, long-context discussions. AI agents are configured with distinct roles and engage in structured dialogues to collaboratively evaluate and refine mitigation strategies. Analysis of 1,000 diverse agents revealed age as the most significant factor (importance: 0.14) influencing budget allocation, with younger participants (19-30) favoring immediate infrastructure investments while older participants (61+) preferred conservative strategies. The study demonstrates the potential of AI-driven simulations to replicate real-world collaborative environments, improving stakeholder engagement and enhancing the efficiency of hazard mitigation planning. The findings highlight the effectiveness of AI agents in multi-stakeholder decision-making processes, offering valuable insights for disaster risk reduction. This work contributes significantly to fostering more resilient, well-prepared communities through innovative approaches to decision-making.

AB  - The Wellington Caves were the first Australian locality from which Europeans collected and analysed vertebrate fossils. Within this system, Cathedral Cave contains Australia's stratigraphically deepest sequence of fossil-bearing infill sediments, the age and depositional history of which has been poorly understood. Here we present results from a new excavation of the upper 4.2 m of the deposit, reanalysing the stratigraphy, petrography, sedimentology and geochemistry, and employing optically stimulated luminescence dating, radiocarbon dating and Bayesian age modelling to establish a robust chronology. We recognise 13 sedimentary layers and sublayers in two stratigraphic units. Unit 2 accumulated between 72 000 +/- 5000 and 38 000 +/- 7000 years ago as sediments and animals entered through a now-blocked ceiling hole. Accumulation halted for around 30 000 years when the hole closed. Unit 1 accumulated when deposition was reinitiated around 7000 +/- 2000 years ago, continuing through to a few hundred years ago. Our chronology refutes earlier dating of the deposit, which suggested that extinct Pleistocene megafauna taxa persisted locally until the Last Glacial Maximum. It confirms the deposit as one of the few in Australia that formed during the interval of major environmental upheaval marked by the arrival of humans, variable climate and the extinction of many megafaunal species.

AB  - The influence of glucocorticoids on reproductive hormones and antler cycles in cervids remains poorly understood, particularly in tropical species. Most Neotropical deer, like the marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus), lack a defined breeding season or a clear link between antler stage and reproductive status. Furthermore, conflicting data regarding stress impacts on androgen levels and antler development underscore the need for further research. We evaluated the effects of stress on fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs), fecal androgen metabolites (FAMs) and antler status in captive marsh deer. Nineteen males underwent a quarantine after being transferred to a new breeding site, with antler status monitored weekly. Daily fecal samples from 17 individuals were analyzed using EIA to measure FAM and FGM concentrations. Among 12 animals with fully developed antlers, nearly 60 % (n = 7) experienced antler casting, an unusual synchrony for this species. A positive correlation was found between FAM and FGM levels (p < 0.001; r = 0.40). We compared FAM and FGM levels between juveniles and adults, as well as among the antler categories. Adults exhibited 1.2-fold higher FGM levels than juveniles, with no differences in FAM levels. Males with hard antlers showed the highest FAM levels, while FGM levels were highest in males with velvet antlers. We hypothesize that intense stress negatively affected antler retention, leading to antler casting. Our findings suggest that stressful stimuli may trigger adrenal secretion of glucocorticoids and androgens, providing insights into the relationship between stress and antler dynamics in marsh deer.

AB  - Roost for bats, which are responsible for a wide range of vital ecological and economic services, is crucial. Their availability affects both the geographic occurrence and the diversity of bat communities. Hence, understanding how bats use roosts and variables that influence these patterns could contribute to the development of management plans to ensure their survival. In this study, species distribution modeling of two bat species, the greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum) and the small mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma muscatellum), were carried out using the sdm package in R. To do so, 16 environmental variables were used as the predictors to explore their relationships with the occurrence of the two species using 12 modeling algorithms. The prediction models for each species were then combined into an ensemble model. The random forest modeling algorithm showed better performance than the other individual models in this modeling. Moreover, the prediction performance of the ensemble model was more substantial than all the individual models for both species. For the greater mouse-tailed bat, elevation, annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, and distance to roads-railways were identified as the essential variables for summer roosting habitat selection. Meanwhile, distance to roads-railways, annual mean temperature, elevation, and distance to the ridge were significant for the small mouse-tailed bat. Since this study facilitates the management of future and suitable habitats by identifying important environmental conditions, it can be used in conservation plans.

AB  - The flowering time and plant architecture of Brassica napus were significantly associated with yield. In this study, we found that the BREVIPEDICELLUS/KNAT1(BP) gene regulated the flowering time and plant architecture of B. napus. However, the precise regulatory mechanism remains unclear. We cloned two homologous BP genes, BnaBPA03 and BnaBPC03, from B. napus Xiaoyun. The protein sequence analysis showed two proteins containing conserved domains KNOX I, KNOX II, ELK, and HOX of the KONX protein family. The CRISPR/Cas9 knockout lines exhibited early budding and flowering time, coupled with floral organ abscission earlier and a larger leaf angle. On the contrary, overexpression plants displayed a phenotype that was the inverse of these characteristics. Furthermore, we observed upregulation of gibberellin and ethylene biosynthesis genes, as well as floral integrator genes in knocked-out plants. The results revealed that BnaBPs play a role in flowering time, floral organ abscission, and leaf angle as well as germination processes mediated. Additionally, BnaBPs exerted an impact on the biosynthesis pathways of ethylene and GA.

AB  - Simple Summary Parasitic infections are a significant problem in the sheep and goat industries worldwide. This issue is compounded by parasites becoming resistant to commercially available dewormers. Currently, the efficacy of tannins and other plant secondary compounds is being evaluated as natural dewormers in sheep and goats. The main objective of this study was to determine if cranberry vine was safe to feed pregnant and lactating ewes. The results of this study indicate that there were minimal effects on the growth and health of the ewe and her offspring from the consumption of a 50% cranberry vine pellet during late gestation and lactation. When creating any new anti-parasitic interventions, it is important to evaluate their effects across all life stages. This study had three objectives, which were to evaluate the effect of feeding cranberry vine pellet (CVP) on (1) ewes' body weights and BCS during late gestation and lactation; (2) ewes' milk quality during lactation; and (3) lambs' body weight and growth parameters from birth to 65 days of age. Across two years, 41 Dorset ewes were fed either a 50% CVP or a matching control pellet (CON) from 104 & PLUSMN; 1.60 days of gestation for 62.8 & PLUSMN; 0.68 days of lactation. Measurements were collected from ewes (BW, BCS, and milk) and lambs (BW and body size). Milk from CVP ewes exhibited reduced milk fat and solids (p < 0.01) and increased concentrations of milk urea nitrogen (p = 0.02) when evaluated for the treatment-time. There was no significant difference in the BCS, protein, lamb BW, or growth measurements for treatment-time (p & GE; 0.05). Additional research that targets blood biochemistry and metabolic assessments is needed to fully determine the impact of this pellet on ewes and lambs.

AB  - The southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina, is one of the top predators inhabiting the Southern Ocean. Foraging at sea represents 80% of their annual cycle, during which they make extraordinary wide-ranging trips with long, deep, and continuous dives. Their feeding habits have been broadly studied using both traditional and advanced techniques, like stable isotope analysis. Here, we analyzed stable isotope ratios of C and N of host and sucking lice tissues to investigate the potential use of lice to infer the isotopic patterns of their host at a major scale while using a less invasive method. We collected samples of blood and lice, Lepidophthirus macrorhini, from 15 weaned pups in Peninsula Valdes (Chubut, Argentina). C and N isotopic signals of lice and pups were correlated. The delta C-13 values of the lice were not different from those of their hosts, while the delta N-15 signals were statistically significantly enriched with respect to those of the pups. The isotopic composition of the lice would predictably mirror that of their hosts. However, the values of Delta C-13 and Delta N-15 (difference between lice and pup signals) differed from the literature-based reference values for hematophagous ectoparasites, indicating that lice could have changed the host recently or that the residence time in the pups has not been enough. Given that mothers and weaned pups differ isotopically due to lactation, the isotopic composition of lice could therefore be more representative of signals from females, implying a useful and a safe tool for identifying and measuring the magnitude of trophic interactions in this species.

AB  - Simple Summary The yak (Bos grunniens) is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and data on their nutritional requirements are lacking. Previous reports have shown that yaks have a higher nitrogen utilization efficiency than Bos taurus, so we hypothesize that yak diets should have a lower level of dietary crude protein than beef cattle. Two diets with different dietary protein content were designed to investigate the effect of dietary protein levels on yaks in the cold season. The results showed that during the cold season, high protein level could promote rumen microbial protein synthesis, elevate arginine and proline metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, taste transduction and glutathione metabolism pathways, enhance antioxidant and immune function, and promote growth performance of yak. However, a high-protein diet enhanced the renin secretion pathway, which might increase a yak's water intake. This experiment was aimed to compare the effects of two diets with different protein content on the growth performance, immune indexes, rumen fermentation characteristics and plasma metabolomics of growing yak in the cold season. A total of 24, 2-year-old healthy yaks with similar body weight (142.9 +/- 3.56 kg) were randomly allocated to two isoenergetic diets with different protein content (10 vs 14%) according to a non-paired experimental design, and the protein of the diets was increased by increasing soybean meal, rapeseed meal and cottonseed meal. The growth performance experiment lasted 56 days. Four days before the end of the growth experiment, the digestion trial was conducted, and the rumen fluid and plasma was collected for measurement. The results showed that the average daily feed intake (p < 0.001) and average daily gain (p = 0.006) of yak fed a high-protein diet was significantly greater, while the feed conversion ratio was lower (p = 0.021) than that of yaks fed a low-protein diet. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde (p = 0.001), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (p = 0.032) and interferon-gamma (p = 0.017) of the high-protein group were significantly lesser, whereas superoxide dismutase (p = 0.004) and interleukin-2 (p = 0.007) was significantly greater than that of the low-protein group. The rumen microbial crude protein (p < 0.047) and crude protein digestibility (p = 0.015) of yak fed a high-protein diet was significantly greater than that of the low-protein group. The metabolomics results showed that yaks fed a high-protein diet were elevated in protein digestion and absorption, arginine and proline metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, purine metabolism, butanoate metabolism, taste transduction, pyrimidine metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism and renin secretion pathways. It is concluded that a high-protein diet in the cold season can promote rumen microbial crude protein synthesis, enhance antioxidant and immune function and promote growth performance of yaks.

AB  - Context Human-elephant conflict is a growing global problem. To mitigate such conflict, understanding factors affecting elephant intrusions into human-dominated areas is crucial. These factors are, however, complex because they are site specific and context dependent.Aims This study aimed to identify factors associated with crop damage incidents from elephants in a buffer zone of a protected area in western Thailand.Methods Interviews were conducted with local people to quantify crop damage by elephants between November 2020 to April 2021. We used compositional analysis to determine whether different crop types received different damage from elephants, and logistic regression analysis to examine environmental factors associated with crop damage incidents.Key results Although it was previously thought that elephants focus on dominant palatable crops, we found that small patches of highly preferred crops can influence where elephants choose to feed. Distance from village was also a significant factor in crop foraging. Crop damage was not different between dry and wet seasons, probably because key crops were available year-round.Conclusions Crop damage occurred across multiple crop types but mainly those with higher sugar content. The damage mostly occurred in fields farther from villages, suggesting that presence of humans may alter elephant crop foraging. No specific seasonal period of crop damage was observed.Implications Changing crop types from species preferred by elephants to less preferred species and growing mixed species (multi-crop systems) instead of single species (mono-crops) may reduce elephant incursions. However, this needs field testing, including market-based assessments to evaluate the economic viability for farmers.
   Human-elephant conflicts occur frequently across countries within the elephant species range, but solutions remain elusive and are probably site-specific. In our study in western Thailand, pineapple received the most damage. Plantations further away from villages and those with larger areas of corn (an elephant-preferred crop) were associated with more crop damage. Based on local experience, planting multiple crops less preferred by elephants may reduce conflicts.

AB  - Studies of the evolutionary causes and consequences of variation in circulating glucocorticoids (GCs) have begun to reveal how they are shaped by selection. Yet the extent to which variation in circulating hormones reflects variation in other important regulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and whether these relationships vary among populations inhabiting different environments, remain poorly studied. Here, we compare gene expression in the brain of female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) from populations that breed in environments that differ in their unpredictability. We find evidence of inter-population variation in the expression of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in the hypothalamus, with the highest gene expression in a population from an extreme environment, and lower expression in a population from a more consistent environment as well as in birds breeding at an environmentally variable high-altitude site that are part of a population that inhabits a mixture of high and low altitude habitats. Within some populations, variation in circulating GCs predicted differences in gene expression, particularly in the hypothalamus. However, some patterns were present in all populations, whereas others were not. These results are consistent with the idea that some combination of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity may modify components of the HPA axis affecting stress resilience. Our results also underscore that a comprehensive understanding of the function and evolution of the stress response cannot be gained from measuring circulating hormones alone, and that future studies that apply a more explicitly evolutionary approach to important regulatory traits are likely to provide significant insights.

AB  - The yak is an important source for the people living and ecological environment in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In every winter, many domestic yaks will lose bodyweight or dead under cold and food scarcity. Moving the plateau yaks to farm in the plain is a useful approach to reduce their environmental stress and gain more production. In this study, we measured growth, slaughter and beef quality traits every month and sequenced mRNA expression levels of muscles of two groups yaks living in plateau and plain respectively. We found there is significant difference (p-value <0.01) in the third (60 days), fourth (90 days), fifth (120 days) and sixth (150 days) weights between subpopulations in the plateau and plain. We identified 540 different expressed genes (DEGs) including 123 known genes and 417 unknown genes. Using the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to build a co-express network, the modules were strong relative to weight traits. The findings highlighted the underlying way and a relative network to yield a new view about gene expression between the yaks living plateau and plain.

AB  - The uptake and accumulation of silicon (Si) in grass plants play a crucial role in alleviating both biotic and abiotic stresses. Si supplementation has been reported to increase activity of defence-related antioxidant enzyme, which helps to reduce oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) following herbivore attack. Atmospheric CO2 levels are known to affect Si accumulation in grasses; reduced CO2 concentrations increase Si accumulation whereas elevated CO2 concentrations often decrease Si accumulation. This can potentially affect antioxidant enzyme activity and subsequently insect herbivory, but this remains untested. We examined the effects of Si supplementation and herbivory by Helicoverpa armigera on antioxidant enzyme (catalase, CAT; superoxide dismutase, SOD; and ascorbate peroxidase, APX) activity in tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea) grown under CO2 concentrations of 200, 410, and 640 ppm representing reduced, ambient, and elevated CO2 levels, respectively. We also quantified foliar Si, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) concentrations and determined how changes in enzymes and elemental chemistry affected H. armigera relative growth rates and plant consumption. Rising CO2 concentrations increased plant mass and foliar C but decreased foliar N and Si. Si supplementation enhanced APX and SOD activity under the ranging CO2 regimes. Si accumulation and antioxidant enzyme activity were at their highest level under reduced CO2 conditions and their lowest level under future levels of CO2. The latter corresponded with increased herbivore growth rates and plant consumption, suggesting that some grasses could become more susceptible to herbivory under projected CO2 conditions.

AB  - Cell proliferation and migration mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) are important processes of hypoxic cardiac vascular remodeling. HIF-1 alpha also regulates the physiological hypoxic adaptation of the coronary artery in the yak heart, but the potential mechanism remains to be completely elucidated. In this study, coronary artery proliferation increased with age and hypoxia adaptation time. In vitro analysis showed that hypoxia can promote the proliferation of coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (CASMCs). Meanwhile, HIF-1 alpha plays an important role in the regulation of proliferation and migration under hypoxia. Autophagy regulates cell proliferation and migration to participate in hypoxia adaptation in plateau animals. Here, the level of autophagy increased significantly in yak coronary arteries with age and was regulated by HIF-1 alpha-mediated hypoxia. In addition, autophagy could also mediate the hypoxic effect on the proliferation and migration of CASMCs. In summary, the results revealed that the increase in yak heart coronary artery thickening with age increases vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, mainly achieved through hypoxia-mediated HIF-1 alpha-regulated autophagy. These results contribute to understanding how the heart adapts to life in a hypoxic environment.

AB  - Ecological connectivity is a key attribute of landscapes and indicates how landscapes facilitate or impede movement. It is an essential criterion to consider in the design of green infrastructures (GIs) when landscape planners and managers deal with population viability, which in part depends on the movement capacities of organisms. Our goal is to inform about the conservation value of land parcels to maintain or enhance connectivity. For this, we developed a red deer functional connectivity model at a regional scale. We focused our study on this large mammal species inhabiting the Greater Geneva agglomeration between Switzerland and France. Our study site is dominated by forested mountains and lowlands, which are highly fragmented by human infrastructures and agricultural lands. We used GPS location data from 15 red deer to parameterize the habitat resistances with a multivariate analysis. To predict connectivity at the regional scale, we used local expert knowledge to design a graph-based landscape. Then, we used electric circuit theory with Circuitscape software to detect pinch points and map corridors, using the set of resistances parameterized with experimental data and the putative core areas and links identified with the help of expert knowledge. We obtained a map that highlights suitable regional habitat patches and corridors or connectivity pinch points potentially used by red deer between the mountains and the lowlands, ratifying the importance of the transfrontier collaboration while implementing the GI. The obtained results are used to assist landscape managers and planners in their effort to include functional connectivity in the prioritization of the GI across the region.

AB  - Analyses of human samples and murine models of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) reveal that the Elk-3 target Abhd10 ameliorates hepatotoxic injury and fibrosis in ALD by downregulating PRDX5 S-palmitoylation.
   Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and other forms of chronic hepatotoxic injury can lead to transforming growth factor & beta;1 (TGF & beta;1)-induced hepatic fibrosis and compromised liver function, underscoring the need to develop novel treatments for these conditions. Herein, our analyses of liver tissue samples from severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) patients and two murine models of ALD reveals that the ALD phenotype was associated with upregulation of the transcription factor ETS domain-containing protein (ELK-3) and ELK-3 signaling activity coupled with downregulation of & alpha;/& beta; hydrolase domain containing 10 (ABHD10) and upregulation of deactivating S-palmitoylation of the antioxidant protein Peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5). In vitro, we further demonstrate that ELK-3 can directly bind to the ABHD10 promoter to inhibit its transactivation. TGF & beta;1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling induce ABHD10 downregulation and PRDX5 S-palmitoylation via ELK-3. This ELK-3-mediated ABHD10 downregulation drives oxidative stress and disrupts mature hepatocyte function via enhancing S-palmitoylation of PRDX5's Cys100 residue. In vivo, ectopic Abhd10 overexpression ameliorates liver damage in ALD model mice. Overall, these data suggest that the therapeutic targeting of the ABHD10-PRDX5 axis may represent a viable approach to treating ALD and other forms of hepatotoxicity.

AB  - To better assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock folds in semi-arid steppe zones and reduce uncertainties in regional and national GHG emission inventories, we measured the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from sheepfolds under contrasting management regimes (i.e., summer sheepfolds under continuous and rotational grazing strategies and the winter sheepfold) for 3 consecutive years. Our results showed that these GHG fluxes had high intra-annual and interannual variations, emphasizing the importance of multi-year measurement for achieving temporally representative annual budgets. Sheep presence and temperature appeared to be the key factors driving CH4, CO2 and N2O fluxes from sheep-folds, e.g., higher GHG emissions usually occurred in seasons with sheep presence. However, the sheepfold type exerted a distinct influence on the temperature sensitivity of GHG fluxes, i.e., the Q10 values for GHG fluxes were generally higher in summer sheepfolds than in winter sheepfold. The annual CH4, CO2 and N2O emissions for the 3 sheepfolds were estimated to be 1.5-16.5 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 1.9-2.6 g C yr(-1)sheep(-1)), 8.6-16.0 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 5.1-6.6 kg C yr(-1)sheep 1) and 28.3-41.9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 19.0-26.8 g N yr(-1)sheep 1), respectively. Averaging across the 3 years, the annual net GHG emissions (CH4 + CO2 + N2O) for all sheepfolds ranged from 47 to 71 t CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 27-36 kg CO2-eq yr(-1) sheep(-1)), of which CO2 and N2O emissions contributed the most; moreover, the annual net GHG emissions had no significant differences between sheepfold types or grazing strategies. Given that local steppe soils have a lower magnitude of soil respiration (CO2) and N2O emissions and are also net sink for atmospheric CH4, the sheepfold sites in this region are undoubtedly one of the significant hotspots for GHG emissions and could be key areas to focus mitigation action.

AB  - Background and aims Interactions with soil biota can shape the success of plants, but we still have much to learn about the role of belowground interactions in plant invasions. In this study, we investigated how soil factors affect the growth of an introduced plant species. Methods In a glasshouse experiment, we grew Plantago lanceolata L. seeds from Europe (native range) and Australia (introduced range) in soil samples collected from 21 sites within and beyond the established range of P. lanceolata in Australia. Results P. lanceolata seedlings grown in unsterilized soil were 34% smaller than seedlings grown in sterilized soil. The effect of soil biota on plant growth was not correlated with latitude or whether the soil was from the established range of P. lanceolata, just outside its range, or well beyond the species' distribution. Individuals growing in new sites richer in organic carbon than their initial range experienced stronger release from belowground enemies. Conclusions Our study does not support the idea that plant species experience significant release from belowground enemy pressure when colonizing new regions. Rather, soil organisms have strong net negative impacts on plant growth regardless of soil origin.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in river watersheds dynamically changes based on its source during a monsoon period with storm event. However, the variations in DOM in urban and rural river watersheds that are dominated by point and non-point sources have not been adequately explored to date. We developed an innovative approach to reveal DOM sources in complex river watershed systems during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon periods using end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) by combining multi-isotope values (delta 13C-DOC, delta 15N-NO3 and delta 18O-NO3) and spectroscopic indices (fluorescence index [FI], biological index [BIX], humification index [HIX], and specific UV absorbance [SUVA]). Several potential end-members of DOM sources were collected from watersheds, including top-soils, groundwater, plant group (fallen leaves, riparian plants, suspended algae), and different effluents (cattle and pig livestock, agricultural land, urban, industry facility, swine treatment facility and wastewater treatment facility). Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, NO3- N, and NH4-N increased during the monsoon period with an increase in the input of anthropogenic DOM, which have higher HIX values owing to the flushing effect. The results of EMMA indicate that soil and agricultural effluents accounted for a substantial contribution of anthropogenic DOM at varying rates based on seasons. We also found that results of EMMA based on combining spectroscopic indices and delta 13C-DOC isotope values were more accurate in tracing DOM sources with respect to land-use characteristics compared to applying only spectroscopic indices. The positive relationship between FI, BIX and delta 15N-NO3 were revealed that nitrate would be decomposed from DOM affected by intensive agricultural activities. In addition, consistent with the EMMA results, the molecular composition of the DOM was clearly evidenced by a large number of CHON formulas, accounting for over 50% of the total characterized compounds, including pesticides and pharmaceuticals used in agriculture farmland and livestock. Our results clearly demonstrated that EMMA based on combing multi-stable isotopes and spectroscopic indices could be trace the DOM source, which is important for understanding changes in the DOM quality, and application of nitrate isotopes and molecular analysis supports in-depth interpretation. This study provides easy and intuitive techniques for the estimation of the relative impacts of DOM sources in complex river watersheds, which can be verified in various ways rather than relying on a single technique approach.

AB  - Termites are social insects living in colonies composed of worker, soldier, and reproductive castes. Termite hindguts are inhabited by all three domains of life- Eukarya (protists), Bacteria, and Archaea. These gut microorganisms are horizontally and vertically transferred by nestmates and reproductives, respectively. Prior evidence suggests that every colony potentially has a different gut microbiome that was transferred vertically and horizontally over time. However, we do not know if different colonies reared in the laboratory on the same diet will ultimately demonstrate similar microbial composition and structure. Therefore, we looked at gut bacteria in Eastern subterranean termite (Reticulitermes flavipes) colonies that were reared in the laboratory with identical diets and rearing conditions. Based on16S rRNA gene sequencing, the observed features, and Shannon's diversity were significantly different between the colonies while differences in Pielou evenness and Faith phylogenetic diversity were not statistically significant. In addition, the microbial community structures were significantly different between colonies. Based on ANCOM (Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes), the taxa Elizabethkingia (Bacteroidetes: Flavobacteriales) and Chryseobacterium (Bacteroidetes: Flavobacteriales) were differentially abundant between the colonies. These results suggest that providing the exact same diet and rearing environment for >2 yr cannot result in identical gut microbiomes between termite colonies.

AB  - Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is a highly contagious pathogen that severely impacts goats and sheep due to its high contagiousness and pathogenicity. Viruses rely on host proteins for their pathogenicity and replication, but the specific mechanisms facilitating PPRV replication by host proteins remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified goat growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45A (GADD45A) as a positive regulator of PPRV replication. Overexpression of GADD45A enhances PPRV replication, while its knockdown significantly inhibits PPRV replication. Furthermore, GADD45A suppresses SeV- or Poly(I:C)-induced IFN-beta promoter and ISRE activation in a dose-dependent manner, as well as the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). We also demonstrate that goat GADD45A interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), leading to the downregulation of TBK1 expression. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy confirmed that GADD45A interacts with the PPRV V protein. Both GADD45A and V synergistically inhibit IFN-beta promoter activation and TBK1 expression, thereby promoting PPRV replication. Our findings suggest that GADD45A promotes PPRV replication by downregulating TBK1, offering new insights into host proteins that counteract innate immune responses during PPRV infection. These findings offer valuable insights into the role of host proteins in viral replication and immune evasion, shedding new light on how PPRV antagonizes innate immunity.

AB  - Simple Summary: Wildlife monitoring plans are not uniformly applied in all European countries, even if theWorld Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) identified passive surveillance of wildlife as the strategy of choice to investigate the health status of wild animals. The plan in use in the Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) for the past 11 years has allowed for the collection of a large amount of data on the wild boar population. Research has been conducted on diseases for which the wild boar could be a reservoir and/or source of infection for domestic pigs due to their increasingly frequent interfaces (trichinellosis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, african swine fever, classical swine fever, Aujeszky's disease, swine vesicular disease, and swine influenza A). Although the results do not allow us to make inferences about the resident population due to the sampling method and sample size, they still give us some indications about the strengths and weaknesses of the plan itself. For instance, an active search for carcasses on the territory should be implemented. In order to improve surveillance activities, it would also be desirable to increase the harmonization of sample collection schemes and data organization from a One Health perspective, as recommended by the WOAH.
   In recent years, the growth of wild ungulates has increased the focus on their health monitoring. In particular, the health status of wild boars is relevant for the economic impact on the pig industry. The Emilia-Romagna region activated a wildlife monitoring plan to better evaluate the health status of the wild boar population. Between 2011 and 2021, samples of found dead and hunted wild boar have been examined for trichinellosis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, african swine fever, classical swine fever, Aujeszky's disease, swine vesicular disease, and swine influenza A. Trichinella britovi was identified in 0.001% of the examined wild boars; neither M. bovis nor M. tuberculosis were found in M. tuberculosis complex positive samples; 2.3% were positive for Brucella suis; 29.4% of the sera were positive for Aujeszky's disease virus; and 0.9% of the samples were positive for swine influenza A virus. With an uncertain population estimate, the number of animals tested, the number of positives, and the sampling method do not allow us to make many inferences but suggest the need to implement and strengthen the existing surveillance activity, as it seems to be the only viable alternative for safeguarding animal and human health.

AB  - Paleobotany is at a crossroads. Long-term trends in the fossil record of plants, encompassing their interactions with herbivores and with the environment, are of the utmost relevance for predicting global change as pCO(2) continues to rise. Large data compilations with the potential to elucidate those trends are increasingly easy to assemble and access. However, in contrast to modern ecology and unlike various other paleontological disciplines, paleobotany has a limited history of "big data" meta-analyses. Debates about how much data are needed to address particular questions, and about how to control for potential confounding variables, have not examined paleobotanical data. Here I demonstrate the importance of analytical best practices by applying them to a recent meta-analysis of fossil angiosperms. Two notable analytical methods discussed here are propensity score matching and specification curve analysis. The former has been used in the biomedical and behavioral sciences for decades; the latter is a more recent method of examining relationships between, and inherent biases among, models. Propensity score matching allows one to account for potential confounding variables in observational studies, and more fundamentally, provides a way to quantify whether it is possible to account for them. Specification curve analysis provides the opportunity to examine patterns across a variety of schemes for partitioning data-for example, whether fossil assemblages are binned temporally by stage, epoch, or period. To my knowledge, neither of these methods has been used previously in paleontology, however, their use permits more robust analysis of paleoecological datasets. In the example provided here, propensity score matching is used to separate latitudinal trends from differences in age, climate, and plant community composition. Specification curve analysis is used to examine the robustness of apparent latitudinal trends to the schema used for assigning fossil assemblages to latitudinal bins. These analytical methods have the potential to further unlock the promise of the plant fossil record for elucidating long-term ecological and evolutionary change.

AB  - Sewage sludge is the byproduct of wastewater treatment plants, which host enormous diversity of microbes including potential pathogens. However, there are still challenges in assessing hygienization during sludge stabilization due to the complex relationships between dominant microbes and human pathogenic bacteria (HPB), and the accuracy of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) is also disputed. Here, the responses of the bacterial community, HPB, and FIB to sludge pretreatment-anaerobic digestion (AD) were comprehensively compared using culture-based and 16S rRNA gene molecular analysis methodologies. Bacterial and HPB communities differed in response to sludge pretreatment-AD. AD drove the variation of bacterial community, but led to the convergence of HPB communities in pretreated sludge, indicating the existence of ecological niches that favors HPB dissemination in digesters. The correlation analysis indicated that FIB was suitable for characterizing general pathogen removal instead of showing the real pattern of HPB (i.e., each HPB), implying the need for comprehensive assessment approaches. Moreover, AD-related parameters including pH, total solids destruction, and methane yield were found to play important role in assessing pathogen inactivation given their correlation. This work provides theoretical basis for the selection of appropriate sludge stabilization approaches and future supervision of biosolids biosafety, which finally benefits human health.

AB  - Simple Summary This manuscript investigated the effects of different feeding regimes on antioxidant activity, meat quality, fatty acid composition, lipid oxidation, and volatile matter production in the longissimus thoracis muscle of Sunit sheep during postmortem aging. It was found that pasture-fed sheep had better oxidative stability, meat quality, and fatty acid composition. At the same time, aging affected the oxidative stability, meat quality, and fatty acid composition of sheep meat, which in turn had an impact on the flavor composition of sheep meat. Aging also eliminates the differences caused by different feeding regimes to a certain extent. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding regimes and aging time on the meat quality of sheep and to provide meat professionals with a theoretical basis that can be applied in practical production. It also accelerated the transition from traditional grazing to indoor rearing to maintain ecological balance. The effects of different feeding regimes on antioxidant activity, meat quality, fatty acid composition, lipid oxidation, and volatile matter production in the longissimus thoracis (LT) of Sunit sheep at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postmortem were investigated. The results showed that the activity of antioxidant enzymes, tenderness, water retention, and percentage of unsaturated fatty acids were significantly higher in the pasture-fed sheep (PF) than in the concentrate-fed sheep (CF) (p < 0.05). During postmortem aging, antioxidant activity, water retention, and the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids decreased in the PF and CF (p < 0.05), while malondialdehyde (MDA) content, the proportion of saturated fatty acids, and the content of flavor substances resulting from fat oxidation increased. After 24 h of LT muscle aging, the pH and shear force of the meat started to increase and the color stabilized. The differences between shear force values and lipid volatile flavor substance content of sheep meat under different feeding regimes disappeared with increasing aging time. PF had better oxidative stability and fatty acid composition. Postmortem aging changed the oxidative stability of sheep meat, thus affecting meat quality and fatty acid composition and consequently meat flavor composition, while aging also eliminated to some extent the differences caused by feeding regimes.

AB  - The fetal sheep model has been widely used in fetal therapy research. However, there is a significant degree of variability among published normal values. Our study aimed to evaluate the literature available on normal values for hemodynamics, blood gases, and acid-base status in the sheep fetus and to determine the best possible estimation of such physiologic values. We conducted a systematic review with a comprehensive search of several databases. We included 189 articles in the database and over 2,800 sheep fetuses. Analysis revealed a mean umbilical blood flow of 202 mL/kg/min (95% CI: 182 to 223); mean arterial pCO(2) of 49.8 mm Hg (95% CI: 49.2 to 50.3); mean arterial pO(2) of 22.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 21.9 to 22.7); mean arterial pH of 7.35 (95% CI: 7.3487 to 7.3562); and mean arterial oxygen saturation of 59.8 (95% CI; 58 to 61.7). Our findings were punctuated by a high heterogeneity, for which we conducted several subanalyses. The results showed high heterogeneity and small study effect in the literature available and provided our best assessment of relevant variables on normal hemodynamics, blood gases, and acid-base status in the fetus after using strategies to mitigate the risk of bias present in the literature.

AB  - Trend analysis can provide valuable information about marine mammal population dynamics, potentially revealing the influence of environmental factors and inform conservation and management decisions. We reviewed the marine mammal stock assessment reports (SARs) published by the US National Marine Fisheries Service and found that 80% of the selected 244 marine mammal stocks with SARs lack assessment for trends in population abundance. We compared trend analysis with another common management tool, potential biological removal (PBR), a measure of the maximum human-caused mortality that can still result in positive population growth. We found that, generally, estimates of PBR were lower for declining stocks than for increasing or stable stocks and varied by life history characteristics. As a case study, we used a resampling approach on three well-studied stocks, killer whale (Orcinus orca-Northern Resident), beluga (Delphinapterus leucas-Cook Inlet), and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae-CA/OR/WA), to test the minimal amount of time and sampling necessary to detect population trends with high statistical power. We found seven sampling events over more than 10 years were needed for a high statistical power level for all three stocks. Altogether, these findings suggest that well-studied stocks can provide crucial information on the statistical requirements for detecting trends. Furthermore, our proposed resampling approach might enable more frequent trend analysis, even with limited time series available for many stocks.

AB  - Context. The development of reliable and cost-efficient survey techniques is key to the monitoring of all wildlife. One group of species that presents particular challenges for monitoring is the arboreal mammals. Traditional techniques for detecting these species often yield low detection probabilities (detectability) and are time-consuming, suggesting the potential for novel methods to enhance our understanding of their distribution, abundance and population trajectories. One technique that has been shown to increase detectability in a range of terrestrial species is thermal imaging, although it has rarely been applied to arboreal species. The true conservation status of Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) is uncertain because of low detectability under typical survey techniques, and a more suitable method is required to enable effective monitoring of the species, making it an ideal candidate for the present study.
   Aims. We aimed to compare the success and cost-effectiveness of surveys utilising thermal imaging with two traditional methods, namely, spotlighting and daytime surveys, so as to optimise monitoring of D. lumholtzi.
   Methods. We conducted surveys at 10 sites in Queensland (Australia) where D. lumholtzi was known to occur, by using each method, and modelled both the detectability of D. lumholtzi and the cost-effectiveness of each technique.
   Key results. Detectability of D. lumholtzi was significantly higher with the use of thermal imaging than it was with the other survey methods, and thermal detection is more cost-effective. In average survey conditions with a trained observer, the single-visit estimated detectability of D. lumholtzi was 0.28 [0.04, 0.79] in a transect through rainforest, by using thermal imaging. Using only spotlights, the detection probability was 0.03 [0, 0.28] under the same conditions.
   Conclusions. These results show that incorporating thermal technology into monitoring surveys will greatly increase detection probability for D. lumholtzi, a cryptic arboreal mammal.
   Implications. Our study highlighted the potential utility of thermal detection in monitoring difficult-to-detect species in complex habitats, including species that exist mainly in dense forest canopy.

AB  - The present study aims to describe the anatomical bone, muscular, and nervous components of the capybara's pelvic limb, associating dissections with radiographic imaging findings. Four animals (two adult females, one adult male, and one young male) were used for macroscopic dissections, and one adult male for radiographic acquisitions. A specimen was prepared for bone descriptions using a maceration procedure. The results demonstrated an elongated thigh bone, the obturator foramen obturator, the ilial wing, and the iliac body straight. The anatomical variations of the pelvic limb of capybaras found were: in the femur, the third trochanter is absent; in the tarsal-metatarsal complex, the I tarsal and the I and V metatarsals are vestigial, and a single portion of the M. sartorius and M. gracilis muscles was demonstrated. Furthermore, variations were found in the origin and insertion of each muscle. Macroscopic musculoskeletal descriptions associated with radiographic analyses made it possible to establish a standard of comparative normality for knowledge of species examinations. The pelvic limb was innervated by nerves that emerge from the lumbosacral plexus, which gives rise to the following nerves: N.gluteus cranialis, N. gluteus caudalis, N. genitofemoralis, N. obturatorius, ischiadicus-rami musculares, N. cutaneus surae lateralis, N. cutaneus surae caudallis, N. pudendus, N. femoralis, N. saphenous, N. tibialis, and N.fibularis communis. In conclusion, the anatomy of the capybara's pelvic limb locomotor system presents particular characteristics related to its aquatic behavior and the absence of arboreal habits.

AB  - The conventional aeration method is compulsorily continuous ventilation or aeration at equal intervals, and a uniform aeration rate does not vary during composting. A dynamic on-demand aeration approach based on the diverse oxygen consumption of microorganisms at different composting stages could solve the problems of insufficient oxygen supply or excessive aeration. This study aims to design an aerobic composting system with dynamic aeration, investigate the effects of dynamic aeration on the temperature rise and physicochemical characteristics during the aerobic composting of corn straw and pig manure, and optimise the control parameters of oxygen concentration. Higher temperatures and longer high-temperature durations were achieved under dynamic aeration, thereby accelerating the decomposition of organic compounds. Dynamic aeration effectively reduced the aeration frequency, the convective latent heat and moisture losses, and the power consumption in the middle and later stages of composting. The dynamic aeration regulated according to the oxygen concentration of 14%-17% in the exhaust was optimum. Under the optimal conditions, the period above 50 degree celsius lasted 8.5 days, and the highest temperature, organic matter removal, and seed germination index reached 65.82 degree celsius, 37.59%, and 74.59%, respectively. The power consumption was decreased by 33.58% compared to the traditional intermittent aeration. Dynamic aeration would be a competitive approach for improving aerobic composting characteristics and reducing the power consumption and the hot exhaust gas emissions, especially in the cooling maturation stage, which was of great significance for realising the low-cost production of composting at scale and promoting the blossom of the organic fertiliser industry.

AB  - Understanding and tracking the complexities of animal movement patterns is of paramount importance in wildlife management, conservation efforts, and the sustainable use of natural resources. An infinite number of factors influence the movement path of animals within their respective habitats, including: the structure of the habitat, the availability of resources, the presence of natural predators, social memory, the topographic attributes of the environment, etc. Numerous studies have attempted to delineate the spatial boundaries of animal habitats by elucidating the complexities of their movement dynamics. These investigations have highlighted the profound impact of factors such as environmental topography and the presence of natural impediments and other anthropogenic structures on animal mobility, but very few have analyzed topographic factors at a fine three-dimensional spatial scale. This research focuses on a novel methodology for identifying animal trajectories at a fine scale and evaluating the influence of topographic factors on these trajectories, specifically of deer herds in southern Spain. To understand movement patterns, transects recorded in the field due to continued use by deer are analyzed. Topographical information was obtained in two steps: first with a graphical analysis of orthophotos for the incorporation of the sufficient data set. Secondly, the veracity of this data was verified using Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking technology. The integration of data from multiple sources with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allowed the analysis to be automated. Next a statistical linear regression model, based on both the ascent and descent lengths and the total length of the path traveled, was designed to infer the trajectories between two designated points within the study area. Using topographical variables obtained in the study environment, such as the slope, the elevation difference (cumulative vertical distance), and the 3D length of the transect paths, the influence of these variables on the movement decisions of animals within their habitat is established in order to facilitate their subsequent prediction. Analytical tests of the trajectories have shown that the movement behavior of cervids is predictable. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the methodology presented which, by providing and collect valuable topographic information on movement and transit areas, can guide sustainable management practices for deer populations and their habitats.

AB  - Insect herbivory is a dominant interaction across virtually all ecosystems globally and has dramatic effects on plant function such as reduced photosynthesis activity and increased levels of defenses. However, most previous work assessing the link between insect herbivory, photosynthesis and plant defenses has been performed on cultivated model plant species, neglecting a full understanding of patterns in natural systems. In this study, we performed a field experiment to investigate the effects of herbivory by a generalist foliar feeding insect (Lymantria dispar) and leaf mechanical damage on multiple leaf traits associated with defense against herbivory and photosynthesis activity on two sympatric oak species with contrasting leaf habit (the evergreen Quercus coccifera L. and the deciduous Quercus pubescens Willd). Our results showed that, although herbivory treatments and oak species did not strongly affect photosynthesis and dark respiration, these two factors exerted interactive effects. Insect herbivory and mechanical damage (vs control) decreased photosynthesis activity for Q. coccifera but not for Q. pubescens. Insect herbivory and mechanical damage tended to increase chemical (increased flavonoid and lignin concentration) defenses, but these effects were stronger for Q. pubescens. Overall, this study shows that two congeneric oak species with contrasting leaf habit differ in their photosynthetic and defensive responses to insect herbivory. While the evergreen oak species followed a more conservative strategy (reduced photosynthesis and higher physical defenses), the deciduous oak species followed a more acquisitive strategy (maintained photosynthesis and higher chemical defenses).

AB  - Microbial source tracking (MST) tools provide insights on fecal pollution levels in aquatic environments using predominantly quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays that target host-associated molecular marker genes. Existing wastewater associated marker genes have shown limited or significant cross-reactions with non-human fecal samples. In this study, we mined the current Gut Phage Database (GPD) and designed a novel untreated wastewater-specific Bifidobacterium phage qPCR assay (i.e., Bifi assay). The sensitivity and specificity of the Bifi marker genes were assessed by collectively analyzing untreated (n = 33) and treated (n = 15) wastewater and non-human fecal samples (i.e., Rabbit, mouse, cow, horse, pig, chicken, sheep, dog, deer, kangaroos; n = 113) in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China and Brisbane, Australia. Bifi assay revealed 100% host-specificity against non-human fecal samples collected from Shenzhen and Brisbane. Furthermore, this marker gene was also detected in all untreated and treated wastewater samples, whose concentrations ranged from 5.54 to 6.83 log10 GC/L. In Shenzhen, the concentrations of Bifi marker gene were approximately two orders of magnitude lower than Bacteroides (HF183/BacR287 assay) and CrAssphage (CPQ_56 assay). The concentration of Bifi marker gene in untreated wastewater from Brisbane was 1.35 log10 greater than those in Shenzhen. Our results suggest that Bifi marker gene has the potential to detect and quantify the levels of human fecal pollution in Shenzhen and Brisbane. If additional detection sensitivity is required for environmental studies, Bifi marker gene should be paired with either CrAssphage or HF183/BacR287 marker genes.

AB  - A perfectly preserved left felid hemimandible has been found in fluvial deposits of the Po River near Cremona (Northern Italy). The fossil, found in allochthonous position within an alluvial bar, corresponding in morphology and size at the hemimandible of modern and fossil lions. The bone, in excellent conditions, is characterized by the presence of all the teeth and shows a slight erosion of the condyle and angular process indicating a very limited transport (rafting). Based on the comparison with a large dataset of morphometric measurements of cave lion and fossil leopard hemimandibles, the studied fossil is classified as a subadult female of the chronosubspecies Panthera spelaea intermedia.
   The mammalian fossil record from Po River consists predominantly of large herbivores Palaeoloxodon antiquus, Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis, Bison priscus, Megaloceros giganteus, Mammuthus primigenius, Alces alces, Cervus elaphus, some carnivores like Panthera cf. pardus, Crocuta crocuta, Ursus arctos, Canis lupus, Vulpes vulpes and primates such as Homo neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. The species composition indicates a mixing of different faunal assemblages from interglacial and glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - Woody oil plants are important economic trees which are widely cultivated and distributed throughout China. Surveys conducted during 2020 and 2021 on several woody oil plantations from five regions of Sichuan Province, China, revealed a high diversity of Botryosphaerialean fungi. The identification of 50 botryosphaeriaceous isolates was carried out based on both morphology and multi-gene phyloge-netic analysis of internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1) and & beta;-tubulin gene (tub2). This allowed the identification of twelve previously known Botryosphaeriales species: Aplosporella prunicola, A. ginkgonis, Barriopsis tectonae, Botryosphaeria dothidea, Bo. fabicerciana, Diplodia mutila, Di. seriata, Dothiorella sarmentorum, Neofusicoccum parvum, Sardiniella guizhouensis, Sphaeropsis citrigena, and Sp. guizhouensis, and four novel species belonging to the genera Diplodia and Dothiorella, viz. Di. acerigena, Di. pistaciicola, Do. camelliae and Do. zanthoxyli. The dominant species isolated across the surveyed regions were Botryosphaeria dothidea, Sardiniella guizhouensis and Diplodia mutila, representing 20%, 14% and 12% of the total isolates, respectively. In addition, most isolates were obtained from Pistacia chinensis (14 isolates), followed by Camellia oleifera (10 isolates). The present study enhances the understanding of Botryosphaeriales species diversity on woody oil plants in Sichuan Province, China.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on chemotaxis and phagocytic activity of neutrophils for spermatozoa and semen quality of preserved boar semen. The different concentrations of dexamethasone were added to boar semen dilutions to detect its effects on the chemotaxis of neu-trophils and phagocytosis of neutrophils and sperm motility sperm malformation rate, plasma mem-brane integrity, mitochondrial activity, and spermatozoa motility parameters. The study results showed that the experimental groups of DEX significantly inhibited the phagocytosis and chemotaxis of PMNs for spermatozoa. With the increased concentration of DEX, there was an inhibition effect on PMNs activity. In addition, under 17 degrees C storage conditions, the addition of DEX 1 x 10-6 mol/mL concentration has the best preservation effect on boar semen, which can effectively improve the sperm motility, movement parameters, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, T-AOC activity, and significantly reduce the sperm malformation rate and H2O2 content. Therefore, the most suitable concentration of DEX to preserve boar semen at 17 degrees C is 1 x 10-6 mol/mL. The significant increase of conception rate of sows and litter size of piglets proved that DEX has practical application value. Thus, it is shown that the use of DEX to inhibit uterine inflammation is effective and feasible for sperm damage providing new methods for developing low-dose artificial insemination technology.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Trait-based ecology (TBE) has proven useful in the terrestrial realm and beyond for collapsing ecological complexity into traits that can be compared and generalized across species and scales. However, TBE for marine macroalgae is still in its infancy, motivating research to build the foundation of macroalgal TBE by leveraging lessons learned from other systems.Our objectives were to evaluate the utility of mean trait values (MTVs) across species, to explore the potential for intraspecific trait variability, and to identify macroalgal ecological strategies by clustering species with similar traits and testing for bivariate relationships between traits. To accomplish this, we measured thallus toughness, a trait associated with resistance to herbivory, and tensile strength, a trait associated with resistance to physical disturbance, in eight tropical macroalgal species across up to seven sites where they were found around Moorea, French Polynesia.We found interspecific trait variation generally exceeded intraspecific variation across species. Furthermore, MTV within species varied across sites, suggesting future research should focus on whether these traits are influenced by site-specific differences in biotic and abiotic drivers. Species grouped into three clusters representing different ecological strategies: species that were defended against herbivores but not strong, species that were strong but not defended and species that were neither. Intraspecific standardized major axis regressions revealed five species exhibited significant or marginally significant positive relationships between these two traits, suggesting trait syndromes within species. Only one species exhibited a significant intraspecific trade-off, as indicated by a negative regression slope.Synthesis. Our results point to three key takeaways that should provide a foundation to rapidly advance development of TBE for macroalgae in the future. First, our evidence supports the use of MTVs for macroalgae. Second, we identified significant spatial variability in macroalgal traits that may indicate an ability to respond to shifting environmental drivers. Third, measuring even a few traits can be a powerful tool to identify different ecological strategies to resist disturbances such as herbivory and removal by wave action. We hope these novel findings motivate future research into a wider suite of macroalgal traits, functions and strategies to further develop trait-based approaches for marine macroalgae.

AB  - In this perspectives paper, we discuss fertilization strategies for Taenia saginata and Taenia saginata asiatica as well as heterogeneity in Taenia solium, the causative agent of human cysticercosis. Two different genotypes of T. solium (Asian and Afro/American) were confirmed by mitochondrial DNA analysis approximately two decades ago. Since then, outcrossings of the two genotypes have been identified in Madagascar where the two genotypes are distributed sympatrically. Outcrossings were confirmed by the presence of discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Since multiple tapeworm infections are common in endemic areas, outcrossing events likely occur quite frequently. Therefore, mitochondrial DNA from T. solium specimens collected from humans and pigs in endemic areas should be analyzed. If variations are found between specimens, nuclear DNA analysis should be performed to confirm the presence of discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Additional outcrossings likely add complexity to understanding the existing genetic diversity. Serological surveys are also recommended since serodiagnostic glycoprotein can also differentiate between the two genotypes. Viable eggs from different genotypes or from hybrids of two different genotypes should be used for experimental infection of pigs or dogs in order to observe any pathological heterogeneity in cysticercosis development. Although genetic diversity of T. solium is expected to result in clinical heterogeneity of cysticercosis in humans and pigs, there is currently no evidence showing that this occurs. There are also no comparative experimental studies on this topic. Therefore, studies evaluating the link between parasite heterogeneity and clinical outcome are warranted.

AB  - Seagrasses thrive in shallow lagoons between land and fringing coral reefs, serving as a buffer that mitigates the propagation of environmental stressors from land to reefs. However, mass grazing by megaherbivores poses a significant threat to seagrass loss, impacting the sustainability of tropical coastal habitats. Despite the urgency of this issue, few studies have investigated the possible consequences of grazing on the mitigating functions of seagrass beds. To explore the roles of seagrass beds in sediment accumulation and stabilization and assess the effects of herbivory on these functions, we conducted sediment trap experiments in a coral reef lagoon to examine the impact of seagrasses on sediment mobility. Hydrodynamic forces governing sediment mobility were quantified using a customized reef-scale hydrodynamic model. The results indicated that sediment resuspension primarily driven by bottom shear stress was the primary factor influencing sediment mobility within the lagoon. Resuspension within healthy seagrass beds was generally low and exhibited minimal sensitivity to hydrodynamic forcing. Consequently, river-borne mineral soil particles predominantly remained confined within the nearshore seagrass zone due to the trapping and stabilizing effects of seagrasses. Since 2019, seagrasses have been severely depleted due to intensive grazing by sea turtles. Simultaneously, sediment resuspension has intensified, and its dependence on bottom shear stress has become evident. Our findings demonstrate that reef seagrass can effectively suppress sediment resuspension by capturing river-borne mineral soil. Furthermore, the loss of this function through mass grazing could potentially lead to sediment destabilization and erosion.

To address this question, multi-omics were performed on porcine Sertoli cells and mice testis. The data suggest that AFB1 induced testicular damage manifested as decreased expression of GJA1, ZO1 and OCCLUDIN in mice (p < 0.01) and inhibition of porcine Sertoli cell proliferation. Transcriptomic analysis suggested changes in noncoding RNA expression profiles that affect the cell cycle-related Ras/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway after AFB1 exposure both in mice and pigs. Specifically, AFB1 caused abnormal cell cycle of testis with the characterization of decreased expressions of CCNA1, CCNB1 and CDK1 (p < 0.01). Flow cytometry revealed that the G2/M phase was significantly increased after AFB1 exposure. Meanwhile, AFB1 downregulated the expressions of Ras, PI3K and AKT both in porcine Sertoli cell (p < 0.01) and mice testis (p < 0.01). Metabolome analysis verified the alterations in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (p < 0.05). Moreover, the joint analysis of metabolome and microbiome found that the changes of metabolites were correlated with the expression of flora. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that AFB1 impairs testicular development via the cell cycle-related Ras/PI3K/Akt signaling.

AB  - Uncertainty still exists on the directions and intensity of changes in leaf herbivory under scenarios of global warming. We, therefore, conducted an investigation on insect herbivory along an elevational gradient to explore how leaf herbivory may respond to future climate warming using a space-for-time substitution approach. We hypothesize that the leaf herbivory for alpine woody species should decline with elevation. We also guess the leaf herbivory may not differ between different leaf-age groups, for the old leaves are less attractive to insect due to their lower nutrients. To approve these assertions, we measured different aspects of leaf herbivory, i.e., the intensity (leaf area consumed per damaged leaf), frequency (percentage of leaves damaged), and rate (percentage of consumed leaf area over the total number of leaves), across different leaf-age groups for Rhododendron aganniphum var. schizopeplum along an elevational gradient (4280-4640 m) in the Sergymla Mountains, southeast Tibet. Related leaf traits of leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen (N-mass), as well as total phenolics for 1-year-old leaves, were also investigated. In contrast with our expectation, the rate of herbivory did not vary with elevation, while the frequency and intensity reflected increasing and declining patterns, respectively. LMA and total phenolics tended to increase with elevation, while N-mass significantly declined. Further analysis indicated that N-mass and total phenolics mainly explained the variation of frequency of herbivory, while N-mass reflected a significant effect on the variation of intensity. No differences in herbivory were found between the leaf-age groups. Our results suggest that the lower intensity of leaf herbivory at higher elevations is mainly associated with the declined nutritional levels, while the higher frequency might be related to the higher costly anti-herbivore defenses like phenolics and the lower nutritional levels. Although the older leaves are exposed to herbivore attacks for a longer time, they possessed the same herbivory levels as current-year leaves partly due to their lower nitrogen concentrations. Both supporting the nutrient limitation hypothesis, i.e., plants with lower leaf nutrient levels possess less leaf herbivory. In all, the herbivory on the alpine Rhododendron is small in magnitude, but given the higher herbivory (for intensity at least) under persistent warming conditions and its potential impacts on mediating plant-insect interactions, insect herbivory should be included in predictions of climate change impacts on alpine ecosystems.

AB  - Throughout the present study a total of 425 specimens were collected to assess the distribution and abundance of Odonata fauna. Odonata is order of Dragonflies and Damselflies, their nymphs and adults are predators. They are environmental indicators and play important role in biological control of insect pests. Result revealed 19 species belonging to 02 suborders viz., Anisoptera and Zygoptera under 06 families. Most abundant family recorded was Libellulidae (74%) followed by family Chlorocyphidae and Calopterigidae (11%) and (7%) respectively. Whereas family Aeshnidae were found least abundant (2%). Genus Orthetrum (Newman, 1833) dominated with percentage (51%) followed by genera Rhinocypha (Rambur, 1842), Neurobasis (Selys, 1853) and Pantala (Hagen, 1861) 11%, (7%) and (7%) respectively. While least abundant genus was sympetrum (Newman, 1833) having percentage (2%). Highest richness is observed at locality Galli badral (12.47%) followed by Shungli (12.00%) and Phulra (11.29%) respectively. However lowest richness was recorded at locality Lassan (4.47%). Regarding species abundance Orthetrum triangulare triangulare (Selys, 1878) was dominated (18.11%) followed by O. purinosum neglectum (Rambur, 1842), (16.47%), Neurobasis chinensis chinensis (Linnaeus, 1758), (7.05%) and Rhinocypha quadrimaculata (Selys, 1853), (5.88%), respectively. While lowest abundance was observed for Ictinogomphus rapax (Rambur, 1842) (1.41%).The canonical correspondence analysis showed thatall Odonata species were associated with submerged vegetation. Anisoptera and Zygoptera species were associated with sunny and shady biotypes. Two species; O. triangulare triangulare and O. pruinosum neglectum showed positive association with temperature. A Zygoptera species Megalestes major was found in moist habitat. Relative humidity was found as an influencing factor for the population growth of Anisopteran and Zygopteran species. Cluster analysis showed that all species were clustered into two groups; genera Anax Ictingomphus Crocothemis, Neurothemis, Orthetrum Palpopleura, Pantala and Sympetrum were clustered into group I. Wheras Group II comes up with all Zygoptera species. The current information/data base will be helpful in preservation of ecosystem management approaches of Odonata.

AB  - Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi is one of the most important fishery resources in the Argentinean Continental Shelf (ACS; SW Atlantic Ocean). In the last decades, the Northern stock (34 degrees 30 '-41 degrees S) has supported a drastic biomass decreasing due to overexploitation. Since the strength of a year class is highly influenced by the survival of age-0+ individuals, studies on their nutritional condition are essential. Age-0+ northern hake nurse in a highly complex oceanographic and ecological system, where environmentally-driven changes upon their physiological status are expected. Hence, several condition (relative condition factor, hepatosomatic index, liver lipid content) and feeding (prey intake) indices were combined with physical (temperature, salinity) and biological (chlorophyll-a concentration, prey abundance) variables to determine spatial variations in age-0+ hake nutritional status. Better conditioned individuals inhabited areas of the study region where chlorophyll-a concentration and zooplanktonic prey abundance exhibited their maximum. A bottom-up control of age-0+ hake physiological status is suggested, mediated by the consumption of the herbivorous euphausiid Euphausia lucens, which was the preferred prey. These lipid-rich prey would be beneficial with respect to other available options in the environment, such as hyperid amphipods. Results complement previous observations upon individuals of the Patagonian stock, and provide a thorough insight into age-0+ Northern hake nutritional status, significantly contributing to M. hubbsi recruitment studies and management in the ACS.

AB  - Providing outdoor recreational opportunities to people and protecting wildlife are dual goals of many land managers. However, recreation is associated with negative effects on wildlife, ranging from increased stress hormones 1,2 to shifts in habitat use 3-5 to lowered reproductive success. 6,7 Noise from recreational activities can be far reaching and have similar negative effects on wildlife, yet the impacts of these auditory encounters are less studied and are often unobservable. We designed a field-based experiment to both isolate and quantify the effects of recreation noise on several mammal species and test the effects of different recreation types and group sizes. Animals entering our sampling arrays triggered cameras to record video and broadcast recreation noise from speakers-20 m away. Our design allowed us to observe and classify behaviors of wildlife as they were exposed to acoustic stimuli. We found wildlife were 3.1-4.7 times more likely to flee and were vigilant for 2.2-3.0 times longer upon hearing recreation noise compared with controls (natural sounds and no noise). Wildlife abundance at our sampling arrays was 1.5 times lower the week following recreation noise deployments. Noise from larger groups of vocal hikers and mountain bikers caused the highest probability of fleeing (6-8 times more likely to flee). Elk were the most sensitive species to recreation noise, and large carnivores were the least sensitive. Our findings indicate that recreation noise alone caused anti-predator responses in wildlife, and as outdoor recreation continues to increase in popularity and geographic extent, 8,9 noise from recreation may result in degraded or indirect wildlife habitat loss.

TI  - Soil microbiota and herbivory drive the assembly of tomato plant-associated microbial communities through different mechanisms
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Plant-associated microbial communities are key to shaping many aspects of plant biology. In this study, we tested whether soil microbial communities and herbivory influence the bacterial community of tomato plants and whether their influence in different plant compartments is driven by microbial spillover between compartments or whether plants are involved in mediating this effect. We grew our plants in soils hosting three different microbial communities and covered (or not) the soil surface to prevent (or allow) passive microbial spillover between compartments, and we exposed them (or not) to herbivory by Manduca sexta. Here we show that the soil-driven effect on aboveground compartments is consistently detected regardless of soil coverage, whereas soil cover influences the herbivore-driven effect on belowground microbiota. Together, our results suggest that the soil microbiota influences aboveground plant and insect microbial communities via changes in plant metabolism and physiology or by sharing microorganisms via xylem sap. In contrast, herbivores influence the belowground plant microbiota via a combination of microbial spillover and changes in plant metabolism. These results demonstrate the important role of plants in linking aboveground and belowground microbiota, and can foster further research on soil microbiota manipulation for sustainable pest management.
   This study shows that the soil microbial community and herbivory both influence the assembly of the plant-associated microbial communities, but their effects are generated through different mechanisms.

AB  - This work aims to assess the utility of World-View 3 satellite imagery of 31 cm resolution for con-ducting population censuses of southern elephant seals (SES). For the first time, we present a comparison of the results of image analyses of a 31 cm resolution satellite image and 1.39 cm res-olution drone-based orthophoto of a SES breeding colony located at Patelnia Point (King George Island, breeding season 2019). The time distance separating both visualisations of the same area was 15 h 4 min, which allowed us to determine the female recognition from the VHR image with an error of 1.5-7.0%, depending on the density of females in the breeding formation. An impor-tant component of this error is false negative matches, which can have a significant impact when selecting the objects needed to train deep learning models. In addition, the pup recognition error was much higher and was 24.6-40.2%, which depended on the density of animals in harems, a large variation in the size of the pups and the diverse substrate on which they were deposited. Counting on VHR images was performed manually by eleven observers familiar with the morpho-logical characteristics of SES. The resolution of the VHR photo allows the identification of fe-males and males involved in breeding due to the clear dimorphism of their sizes. We recommend using VHR satellite imagery to determine the number of breeding formations and spatial relation-ships between them, as well as for counting females and males during the breeding haul-out. The resolution of satellite imagery available at this time is still insufficient to be used to determine breeding success. With increasing access to satellite resources and an ever-expanding database of VHR images, this is a promising tool to fill the gaps in knowledge about the global population of SESs.

AB  - Fish-livestock integrated farming is a traditional practice in South China and Southeast Asia. The administration of antimicrobial agents in livestock may potentially facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance to aquaculture through the drainage of livestock manure. Aeromonas spp. are fish pathogens that are the predominant bacteria in water bodies. The aim of this study was to characterize multiple-drug-resistantAeromonas spp. isolated from integrated and nonintegrated fish-livestock farms and to investigate the occurrence of class 1 integrons. Of the 481 Aeromonas strains examined in this study, isolates from pig manure, fish, and environmental samples from pig-fish or goose-fish integrated farms were significantly more resistant to various antimicrobial agents than those from nonintegrated farms (P < 0.05). High rates of resistance to nalidixic acid and sulfamonomethoxine were observed in the isolates from the integrated farm. Fifty Aeromonas isolates (10.4%) from integrated farms contained class 1 integrons. In addition, 96.0% (48/50) of the integron-positive strains displayed multiple-drug resistance. Ten types of gene cassette arrays were determined by sequencing, including dfrA17, dfrA12-orfF-aadA2, catB8, dfrB4-catB3-aadA1, aac6(6 ')-Ib-cr-arr-3, aac-II-blaOXA-21-catB3, aar2-aacA4-drfA1-orfC, aac(6 ')-Ib-cr, dfrA15, and dfrB4-catB3-blaOXA-10-aadA1. Notably, among the 50 integron-positive isolates, twenty isolates showed integrons located in plasmids, which may facilitate the transmission of resistance in integrated farms. Our investigation confirmed the high prevalence of multiple antimicrobial resistances mediated by class 1 integrons in Aeromonas isolates from integrated farms. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a risk assessment method for antimicrobial resistance in aquaculture.

AB  - Tea seedlings (Camellia sinensis) have a well-developed root system with a strong taproot and lateral roots. Compared with ordinary cuttings, tea has stronger vitality and environmental adaptability, thus facilitating the promotion of good varieties. However, there is less of detailed research on the rooting and germination process of tea seeds. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry was used to conduct non-targeted spatial mass spectrometry imaging of the main organs during growth of tea seedlings. A total of 1234 compounds were identified, which could be divided into 24 classes. Among them, theanine, as the most prominent nitrogen compound, was synthesized rapidly at the early stage of embryo germination, accounting for >90% of the total free amino acids in the radicle, and it was then transferred to each meristem region through the mesocolumnar sheath, indicating that theanine-based nitrogen flow plays a decisive role in organ formation during the development of tea seedlings. Nutrients stored in the cotyledon were rapidly hydrolyzed to dextrin and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde at the early stages of germination, and subsequently converted to other forms that provided carbon and energy for development, such as raffinose and d-galactose (glucose), which were mainly distributed in the growing zones of the root apex and the apical meristems of the stem. This study provides a new perspective on the synthesis and metabolism of substances during the development of tea seedlings and contributes to a better understanding of the biological characteristics of tea varieties.

AB  - Understanding the evolutionary processes that influence fitness is critical to predicting species' responses to selection. Interactions among evolutionary processes including gene flow, drift and the strength of selection can lead to either local adaptation or maladaptation, especially in heterogenous landscapes. Populations experiencing novel environments or resources are ideal for understanding the mechanisms underlying adaptation or maladaptation, specifically in locally co-evolved interactions. We used the interaction between a native herbivore that oviposits on a patchily distributed introduced plant that in turn causes significant mortality to the larvae to test for signatures of local adaptation in areas where the two co-occurred. We used whole-genome sequencing to explore population structure, patterns of gene flow and signatures of local adaptation. We found signatures of local adaptation in response to the introduced plant in the absence of strong population structure with no genetic differentiation and low genetic variation. Additionally, we found localized allele frequency differences within a single population between habitats with and without the lethal plant, highlighting the effects of strong selection. Finally, we identified that selection was acting on larval ability to feed on the plant rather than on females' ability to avoid oviposition, thus uncovering the specific ontogenetic target of selection. Our work highlights the potential for adaptation to occur in a fine-grained landscape in the presence of gene flow and low genetic variation.

AB  - Mitochondrial function needs strong interactions of mitochondrial and nuclear (mitonuclear) genomes, which can be disrupted by mitonuclear mismatch due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression between two formerly isolated populations or taxa. This mitonuclear disruption may cause severe cellular stress in mismatched individuals. Gene expression changes and alternative splicing (AS) are two important transcriptional regulations to respond to environmental or cellular stresses. We previously identified a naturally introgressed population in the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis). Individuals from this population belong to R. a. himalayanus and share almost identical nuclear genetic background; however, some of them had mtDNA from another subspecies (R. a. macrurus). With this unique natural system, we examined gene expression changes in six tissues between five mitonuclear mismatched and five matched individuals. A small number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional enrichment analysis revealed that most DEGs were related to immune response although some may be involved in response to oxidative stress. In contrast, we identified extensive AS events and alternatively spliced genes (ASGs) between mismatched and matched individuals. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that multiple ASGs were directly or indirectly associated with energy production in mitochondria which is vital for survival of organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the role of AS in responding to cellular stress caused by mitonuclear mismatch in natural populations. Our results suggest that AS may play a more important role than gene expression regulation in responding to severe environmental or cellular stresses.

AB  - In natural and agricultural ecosystems, plants are often simultaneously or sequentially exposed to combinations of stressors. Here we tested whether limited water availability (LWA) affects plant response to insect herbivory using two populations of Eruca sativa from desert and Mediterranean habitats that differ in their induced defenses. Considering that such differences evolved as responses to biotic and possibly abiotic stress factors, the two populations offered an opportunity to study ecological aspects in plant response to combined stresses. Analysis of chemical defense mechanisms showed that LWA significantly induced total glucosinolate concentrations in the Mediterranean plants, but their concentrations were reduced in the desert plants. However, LWA, with and without subsequent jasmonate elicitation, significantly induced the expression of proteinase inhibitor in the desert plants. Results of a no-choice feeding experiment showed that LWA significantly increased desert plant resistance to Spodoptera littoralis larvae, whereas it did not affect the relatively strong basal resistance of the Mediterranean plants. LWA and subsequent jasmonate elicitation increased resistance against the generalist insect in Mediterranean plants, possibly due to both increased proteinase inhibitor expression and glucosinolate accumulation. The effect of LWA on the expression of genes involved in phytohormone signaling, abscisic acid (ABA-1) and jasmonic acid (AOC1), and the jasmonate responsive PDF1.2, suggested the involvement of abscisic acid in the regulation of defense mechanisms in the two populations. Our results indicate that specific genotypic responses should be considered when estimating general patterns in plant response to herbivory under water deficiency conditions.

AB  - With a long-term amendment of manure-based organic fertilizers (MOFs), significant elevations of antibiotics and their resistance genes in agricultural soil have aroused great concerns worldwide, but their relationships to animal farming and possible environmental risks of fertilization lack systematic studies. This study collected 41 commercial MOFs made from manures of chicken, swine, sheep/goat, and cattle, respectively, in 10 provinces (including autonomous re-gions) of China mainland with large animal farming industries. Twenty-nine compounds, consisting of 20 antibiotic compounds, sulfonamides' synergist (trimethoprim) and 8 non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, were quantified in the col-lected MOF samples, ranging from below the quantification limits (<0.02 & mu;g kg-1 dry mass) up to 110 mg kg-1 dry mass (oxytetracycline), using a high throughput protocol with 83 target compounds (37 antibiotic ones) of 6 pharma-ceutical categories. Antibiotic compounds of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones collectively dominated pharmaceuti-cal residues in the MOF samples, accounting for 71.9-99.9 % of total loads, except 6 samples. Pharmaceuticals for human use only (4 antibiotic and 4 non-antibiotic compounds) and for both human and veterinary uses (5 antibiotic and 1 non-antibiotic compounds) were quantified in the MOF samples according to the Chinese pharmacopeia. The MOF samples made from chicken and swine manures (mainly captivity) had greater number, frequency, and level of the quantified pharmaceutical compounds than the ones made from sheep/goat and cattle manures (mainly graz-ing). Antibiotics, particularly enrofloxacin and oxytetracycline, in the MOF samples would lead to medium risks to mi-croorganisms and invertebrates in soil and high risk to plants, and considerable risk to antibiotic resistance selection if applied in agricultural soils. Findings of this study suggest that pharmaceutical contaminations should be taken into account for the quality guidelines of the commercial MOFs as well as other pollutants (such as heavy metals), especially the MOFs made from manures of the captive chicken and swine.

AB  - Individual specialization in the foraging behaviour of marine predators can affect the ecology, evolution, and ability of a population to respond to environmental variability and human impacts.
   Here, blood serum and whisker stable isotope values from New Zealand (NZ) sea lion pups (Phocarctos hookeri) are compared with their mother's values to identify whether they can be used as proxies to identify their mother's isotopic niche and foraging strategy.
   Female NZ sea lions have been identified, both through telemetry and stable isotope research of blood serum and whiskers, to have two distinct foraging ecotypes (mesopelagic or benthic), consistent across their adult life. Females who are mesopelagic foragers have higher overlap and a greater risk of harmful interactions with fisheries.
   Stable isotope analysis of adult females can be used to determine the proportion of the female population exposed to these detrimental interactions. However, the capture, restraint, and removal of a whisker or blood from an adult female NZ sea lion is an expensive, time-consuming, and invasive undertaking. Instead, by comparing the blood serum and whisker delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of 12 NZ sea lion mother-and-pup pairs, for whom the foraging behaviour of the female is known, the question as to whether a pup's blood serum or whisker isotope value can be used as a proxy to identify female foraging ecotype was investigated.
   The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for the blood serum and whiskers of pups and their mothers were correlated and differed significantly between foraging ecotypes. This research validates that pup blood serum and whisker stable isotope values from 1-month-old pups can be used as indicators of female isotopic niche and therefore foraging ecotype.
   This tool can be used across all NZ sea lion colonies to indicate female NZ sea lion foraging ecotypes. For the Auckland Islands, it could determine the proportion of breeding females exposed to negative interactions with fisheries, leading to a better understanding of the level of these effects and helping to implement appropriate management to mitigate impacts.

AB  - Plants produce an immense diversity of defensive specialized metabolites. However, despite extensive functional characterization, the relative importance of different defensive compounds is rarely examined in natural settings. Here, we compare the efficacy of three Nicotiana benthamiana defensive compounds, nicotine, acylsugars and a serine protease inhibitor, by growing plants with combinations of knockout mutations in a natural setting, quantifying invertebrate interactions and comparing relative plant performance. Among the three tested compounds, acylsugars had the greatest defensive capacity, affecting aphids, leafhoppers, spiders and flies. Nicotine mutants displayed increased leafhopper feeding and aphid colonization. Plants lacking both nicotine and acylsugars were more susceptible to flea beetles and thrips. By contrast, knockout of the serine protease inhibitor did not affect insect herbivory in the field. Complementary experiments under controlled laboratory conditions with caterpillars, grasshoppers and aphids confirmed results obtained in a natural setting. We conclude that the three metabolite groups collectively provide broad-spectrum protection to N. benthamiana. However, there is a gradient in their effects on the interacting invertebrates present in the field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, even if individual metabolites do not have a measurable defensive benefit on their own, they can have an additive effect when combined with other defensive compounds.

AB  - Sea buckthorn is becoming an increasingly popular medicinal plant. This plant material contains many nutrients and bioactive substances used in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Compounds found in the organs of this plant have antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal properties, but, despite these features, sea buckthorn is affected by many pathogens. As shown by studies on the health and presence of pathogenic fungi on the aboveground organs of this plant, no obligatory pathogens and Basidiomycota fungi were found in 2019. The mycological analysis of the aboveground organs, i.e. leaves, fruits, and shoots, showed that Alternaria alternata was the most frequent species of fungi isolated from all examined organs. Moreover, the Monilinia fructigena and Botrytis cinerea species were often isolated from fruits and Cladosporium cladosporioides fungus was found on leaves. Numerous isolates of the pathogenic Fusarium sporotrichiodes fungus and single isolates of Phomopsis spp., i.e. fungi causing gangrene and drying out of the bark of shoots and the bark of many fruit plant species, and Nigrospora oryzae causing leaf blotch of herbaceous plants and fruit trees were obtained from the examined organs of the sea buckthorn. The mycological analysis revealed no species of the genus Verticillium, universally recognized as the most dangerous to this plant.

AB  - Capture and handling techniques for individual-based, long-term research that tracks the life history of animals by recapturing the same individuals for several years has vastly improved study inferences and our understanding of animal ecology. Yet there are corresponding risks to study animals associated with physical trauma or capture myopathy that can occur during or following capture events. Rarely has empirical evidence existed to guide decisions associated with understanding the magnitude of capture-related risks, how to reduce these risks when possible, and implications for mortality censoring and survival estimates. We used data collected from 2,399 capture events of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) via helicopter net-gunning to compare daily survival probabilities within a 10-week period centered on a capture event and evaluated how animal age, nutritional condition (body fat), and various handling methods influenced survival before, during, and following a capture event. Direct mortality resulting from capture efforts was 1.59%. Mean daily survival was 0.9993 +/- 0.0001 (SE) during the 5-week pre-capture window, was depressed the day of capture at 0.9841 +/- 0.0004, and rebounded to 0.9990 +/- 0.0008 during the 5-week post-capture window. Neither capture nor handling had a detectable effect on post-capture survival, including handling time (x over bar $\bar{x}$ = 13.30 +/- 1.87 min), capture time of year (i.e., Dec or Mar), tooth extraction, and the number of times an animal had been recaptured (2-17 times). Although mortality rate was slightly elevated during capture (resulting from physical trauma associated with capture), age and nutritional condition did not influence the probability of mortality during a capture event. Following a capture event, nutritional condition influenced survival; however, that relationship was consistent with expected effects of nutritional condition on winter survival and independent of capture and handling. Overall survival rates 5 weeks before capture and 5 weeks after capture were not different. A specified window of time with depressed survival following capture and handling was not evident, which contradicts the implementation of a predetermined window often used by researchers and managers for censoring mortalities that occur after capture. Previous notions that censorship of all mortality data in the 2 weeks following capture is unwarranted and risks removal of meaningful data. With previous evidence guiding our protocols for capture (e.g., reduced chase time) and handling (e.g., temperature mitigation), low direct mortality and almost undetectable indirect mortality post capture reinforces the efficacy of helicopter net-gunning for capture and recapture of mule deer in long-term, individual-based studies.

AB  - In salt marshes, abiotic factors, interspecific competition or facilitation, and herbivory have been discussed extensively as important drivers of marsh plant distribution patterns. However, the relative importance of various regeneration processes across stress gradients received little attention, despite their importance in explaining plant community dynamics. In this study, we built a stage-structured plant assembly model to study how the influence of each regeneration process on plant assembly dynamics varies with environmental stress level, plant succession stage and initial seed availability, in a salt marsh in Yellow River Delta National Nature Reserve in China. We found plant assembly at higher saline conditions is mainly governed by stress tolerance regardless of the stage of succession and initial seed availability, as salinity stress can suppress biomass accumulation and propagule production of salt intolerant species. Under less saline conditions with high seed availability, juvenile competition plays the most important role throughout succession. When initial seed availability is low, dispersal is more important at the beginning, but juvenile competition is more important at later stage and determines the plant competition outcomes. Our findings imply seed availability is important in determining plant succession trajectories under less stressful conditions, and should be given more attention during restoration management in coastal marshes.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a major conservation challenge negatively impacting elephant populations and local agricultural livelihoods. Studies of drivers and spatiotemporal patterns of HEC have potential to indicate where mitigation actions should be prioritized with the goal of achieving long-term coexistence. We examined temporal and spatial patterns of elephant crop raiding adjacent to Kuiburi National Park in southern Thailand by assessing locations of elephant raids in conjunction with multiple environmental variables along with crop characteristics and crop availability. Raiding incidents primarily happened in pineapple plantations, however compositional analysis suggested that fruit orchards were most preferred by elephants probably reflecting the high frequency of raiding in orchards relative to their small spatial area. Logistic regression models predicted that crop type and crop maturity stage, distance to forest and mitigation strategy combined had the strongest support in explaining the probability of crop raiding. Relative probability of raiding appeared to be associated with crop accessibility for elephants and perhaps crop nutrient value, with orchards with ripe fruit being most raided, while oil palm the least. The most frequently used mitigation measure was guarding by local people and could lower the probability when compared with other mitigations, although the relative effectiveness did not show a clear pattern; local guarding, patrolling by park rangers and physical barriers appeared to have some benefit but elephant-preferred crops still had >40% chance of being raided. Other results also indicated that water availability and season were not associated with elephant raiding, but rather crop type/crop stage had the most influence. The surprising lack of seasonality was likely due to the availability of the elephant's preferred crops year-round. Finally, our results indicated that there is no zone in Kuiburi that is free from elephant raiding, leaving the entire community vulnerable. We recommend improvements in the mitigation measures through better coordination among stakeholders in such communities and development of concrete action plans for all stakeholders including an extensive market-based examination of the feasibility of growing crops less preferred by elephants.

AB  - The 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor plays an important role in schizophrenia. The 5-HT2A receptor is also involved in the regulation of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in rodents. The aim of this study was to determine whether selective 5-HT2A receptor agonizts or antagonists may alter PPI in rats and to identify the critical brain regions in which the activity of 5-HT2A receptors regulates PPI. The results showed that infusion of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2 into the lateral ventricle disrupted PPI, but the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 had no such effect. In addition, local infusion of TCB-2 into the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum disrupted PPI, whereas the same manipulation in the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area did not disrupt PPI. In conclusion, agonism of 5-HT2A receptors in the ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens can disrupt PPI. The ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens are critical brain regions responsible for the regulation of PPI by serotonin. These findings contribute to the extensive exploration of the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying the regulatory effect of 5-HT2A receptor activity on PPI, especially the neural circuits modulated by 5-HT2A receptor activity.

AB  - Collection from jugular vein (JV) or intrathoracic cavity is the traditional procedure for blood sampling dead wildlife, but it is often source of preanalytical biases. Cavernous sinus of dura mater (CS) is an alternative site for withdrawal that may help to solve these issues but it has been used only for serology, while no data are available for biochemistry. This work compares metabolic profiles from CS and JV blood in red deer Cervus elaphus, to evaluate the usability of CS for metabolic profiling. A total of 134 deer were sampled in the frame of a culling program within the Stelvio National Park (Central Italian Alps). Hemolysis was statistically lower in CS than JV with 88% vs 44% of samples suitable for biochemistry. Thirty-six couples of poorly hemolytic sera were used for biochemical analysis: total protein, albumin, urea, triglycerides, total cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), betahydroxybutyrate (BOHB), calcium, and phosphorus. Statistical differences were found for protein, albumin, cholesterol, and calcium; agreement was found for urea, NEFA, BOHB, and phosphorus while for total protein, albumin, cholesterol, and calcium, CS showed lower concentrations with both constant and proportional biases. These results may be related to a higher impact of water dilution in CS. Although the lower protein concentration in CS cannot significantly influence the serological results, caution is required for potential false negative results when antibody levels are close to cut-off values. CS leads to a higher percentage of samples suitable for metabolic profiles but results should be compared with adequate reference intervals.

AB  - The scarcity of water resources in South Africa remains a considerable challenge for water users. This study evaluated the impact of climate variability on the adaptive water-use behaviour of sugarcane producers by identifying the factors influencing their adaptation decisions. A survey, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to achieve this objective. The study involved 54 sugarcane producers from the Impala Irrigation Scheme, selected through random sampling. Socio-economic profiles revealed a largely male, older demographic with varied education levels and farm characteristics. Results indicated that attitude (beta = 0.349, p < 0.1) and subjective norms (beta = 0.281, p < 0.05) significantly influenced farmers' intentions to adapt, while perceived behavioural control had no significant effect (beta = 0.051, p > 0.1). These findings suggest that improving farmers' attitudes and strengthening social support systems can enhance their intentions to adopt adaptive strategies. However, the model's explanatory power (R-2 = 0.276) suggests that other unexamined factors may also influence farmers' adaptive intentions, highlighting the need for further research. Overall, our findings suggest that interventions targeting attitudes, social support, and resource access can improve adaptive behaviours.

AB  - Coccidiosis is one of the most common infectious diseases in goat farming. The disease causes major economic loss in the world. In this study, we aimed to investigate the activity of heat shock protein 70 in intestine cells of goats with coccidiosis. We used total of twenty-seven goats for this purpose. Gross findings were diarrhoea, cachexia, and dehydration. In the microscopical examination, we observed proliferative enteritis with Eimeria. parasites. Immunohistochemical examinations revealed moderate to severe Hsp70 immunoreactivity in intestines. Considering Hsp70 is a stress protein with anti-apoptotic and immune regulatory features, Hsp70 immunoreactivity attributed to the stress caused by infection and anti-apoptotic activity of the protein along with immune regulatory effects of Hsp70.

AB  - Pigs are largely raised for food and translational biomedical research. In several intentional and unintentional situations pigs experience pain. In 2020, the Unesp-Botucatu pig composite acute pain scale (UPAPS) was validated according to the COSMIN guidelines for quick and simple assessment of pain in pigs. Recently, an algorithm has been used to estimate the importance of different behaviors in sheep and horses, however, the statistical weight of each pain-related behavior is still unknown for pigs. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether UPAPS pain-related behaviors in pigs have different statistical weights and to rank their importance. A database from a previous study was used, containing the behavioral records of 45 pigs in the perioperative period of castration. The pigs were filmed between 16 and 24 h before the castration, 3.5 and 4 h after the castration, 1.5-2 h after intramuscular administration of analgesics, and 24 h after the end of the castration. Two experienced observers individually and randomly assessed all videos, without knowing which time-point they were observing (blind analysis). At the end of each video observation, the observers recorded whether they would indicate analgesia, if they considered the pigs were suffering pain, according to their clinical experience, and scored the UPAPS. The intra- and inter-observer reliability were calculated with intraclass correlation coefficient and weighted kappa. A multilevel binomial logistic regression algorithm was constructed to estimate the statistical weights of each UPAPS behavior. The intra- and inter-observer reliability values ranged from 0.71 to 0.88. According to the algorithm, 10 of 19 slope coefficients of the behaviors were significant, evidencing a difference in weight for each pain-related behavior in pigs undergoing castration. The change in posture 'protecting the affected area' was the heaviest pain-related behavior based on the algorithm. We conclude that the pain-related behaviors in pigs from the UPAPS have different statistical weights. The algorithm has the potential to indicate the degree of importance of different pain behaviors in pigs undergoing castration and, therefore, to select the most relevant pain behaviors to be targeted when assessing pain in pigs.

AB  - Epidemiological evidence regarding the effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is inconclusive because NO2 assays measure nitrous acid (HONO) as NO2. Epidemiological study using separate measurements of indoor HONO and NO2 suggests that indoor HONO levels are associated with decrease in lung function, and HONO exposure experiment in rats suggests that HONO adversely affects respiratory function more than NO2. Effects of NO2 on respiratory tract resistance have not been observed in rats but have been observed in guinea pigs, including baseline specific airway resistance (sRaw). The present study aimed to investigate the effects of HONO exposure on baseline sRaw in guinea pigs. Eighteen male Hartley guinea pigs were divided into Groups C, M, and H (n = 6 per group) and exposed to HONO at three concentrations, respectively, 24 h/d for 7 weeks. Double-flow plethysmography was used to measure the sRaw once a week and grade respiratory waveforms, indicating increased airway resistance. The experiment was performed twice. Mean HONO concentrations of two experiments in Groups C, M, and H were 0.02, 0.66, and 3.43 parts per million (ppm). The sRaw increased significantly in Groups H and M compared with sRaw in Group C, and in a concentration-dependent manner after the 4th week of HONO exposure. Increased airway resistance was observed in 50% of animals in Group M and 100% of animals in Group H in some weeks. However, in some animals from Group M, increased airway resistance was observed earlier than the airway resistance increases observed in all animals in Group H. These sRaw results suggest that HONO affects asthma symptoms or COPD, at a lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of < 0.66 ppm. HONO may affect baseline sRaw after shorter exposure periods and at lower concentrations compared with the reported effects of NO2. The present results suggest that HONO is the most important nitrogen oxide affecting asthma and COPD indoors, and that HONO may be the causative agent in the association between NO2 and asthma symptoms in epidemiological studies.

AB  - This study analysed the effect of sow parity (P), terminal boars (TB), and their combination on reproductive parameters of sows, losses of piglets, and their individual live-weight (LW) and average daily gain (ADG) from birth to weaning. A total of 120 sows of Large White x Landrace hybrid combination from the first to the fourth parity (30 sows per parity) were included in the observation. The sows were inseminated by terminal boars of Pietrain (Pn), Large White(sireline) (LWSL), and Duroc (D) breeds and Duroc x Large White(sirelinie) (D x LWSL), Large White(sirelinie) x Pietrain (LWSL x Pn), and Duroc x Pietrain (D x Pn) hybrid combinations (20 sows per terminal boar population). The results proved a significant effect of P on the total numbers of piglets (TN), the numbers of stillborn piglets (SB), and the pre-weaning losses of piglets (L) (p <= 0.01) with the lowest losses found in the third parity sows. A significant effect of TB was confirmed for TN, the numbers of live-born piglets (LB), SB, the numbers of mummified piglets (M) and non-viable piglets (N), and (L) (p <= 0.01). The sows inseminated by D and LWSL boars showed the lowest total numbers of piglets but also the highest survivability of piglets until weaning. Significant effects of interaction between P and TB were observed for the TN, SB, N, and L (p <= 0.05). Evaluation of growth parameters in piglets (n = 1547) showed that P significantly influenced LW in the first three weeks of life (p <= 0.01) and ADG from birth to Day 7 and from Day 15 to Day 21 (p <= 0.01). Additionally, a significant effect (p <= 0.01) of TB was proven on individual weight and ADG in all the observed time intervals, with the highest growth found in the piglets of the D and LWSL boars. Significant interactions (p <= 0.01) between P and TB were found for LW and ADG in all the time intervals.

AB  - Federal and state agencies within the United States have recently issued directives prioritizing the conservation of ungulate migration corridors and winter ranges. The ability to identify and delineate the spatial distribution of seasonal ranges underpins these policies. While such delineations are often derived from global positioning system (GPS) collar data collected for a few years on a focal population, they are being used in long-term conservation planning. Our objectives were to quantify consistency in migration corridors from year to year and cumulatively across multiple years and identify which aspects of the sampling design of GPS collar deployment will delineate a consistent and relatively complete migration corridor. We used data from 6 sub-herds of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), a species known to have high migratory fidelity, located in Wyoming and northern New Mexico, USA, monitored for 5-7 years (510 unique individuals). We calculated 2 types of migration corridors over time: cumulative corridors where each new year of data was added to all previous years and yearly corridors where each year was based only on data collected in that year. We then calculated the year-to-year consistency in the 2 types of migration corridors by calculating the percent overlap between corridors calculated in sequential years. We found that collaring a higher proportion of a sub-herd increased the consistency in migration corridors, whereas collaring new individuals via redeployments in a subsequent year of monitoring caused corridors to shift. To obtain a corridor with >= 90% consistency (i.e., approaching the complete area used by a population in our data), our results suggest that biologists should strive to collar >= 6% of a sub-herd for a minimum of 2 years. However, if >= 6% of a sub-herd cannot be collared, monitoring for longer (3-4 years) will provide roughly 90% consistency in a migration corridor estimate for mule deer. Furthermore, adding 16-25% new individuals each year will help capture variation among individuals while maintaining corridor consistency of >= 90%, leading to a more accurate delineation of the corridor. Our results provide managers with a logistical framework for collaring projects aimed at delineating migration corridors that are durable into the future.

AB  - BackgroundTesticular descent is a physiological process regulated by many factors. Eventually, disturbances in the embryological/fetal development path facilitate the occurrence of scrotal hernia, a congenital malformation characterized by the presence of intestinal portions within the scrotal sac due to the abnormal expansion of the inguinal ring. In pigs, some genes have been related to this anomaly, but the genetic mechanisms involved remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression profile of a set of genes potentially involved with the manifestation of scrotal hernia in the inguinal ring tissue.Methods and resultsTissue samples from the inguinal ring/canal of normal and scrotal hernia-affected male pigs with approximately 30 days of age were used. Relative expression analysis was performed using qPCR to confirm the expression profile of 17 candidate genes previously identified in an RNA-Seq study. Among them, the Myosin heavy chain 1 (MYH1), Desmin (DES), and Troponin 1 (TNNI1) genes were differentially expressed between groups and had reduced levels of expression in the affected animals. These genes encode proteins involved in the formation of muscle tissue, which seems to be important for increasing the resistance of the inguinal ring to the abdominal pressure, which is essential to avoid the occurrence of scrotal hernia.ConclusionsThe downregulation of muscular candidate genes in the inguinal tissue clarifies the genetic mechanisms involved with this anomaly in its primary site, providing useful information for developing strategies to control this malformation in pigs and other mammals.

AB  - Introduction: Pigs have been an increasingly popular preclinical model in nutritional neuroscience, as their anatomy, physiology, and nutrition requirements are highly comparable to those of humans. Eyeblink conditioning is one of the most well-validated behavioral paradigms in neuroscience to study underlying mechanisms of learning and memory formation in the cerebellum. Eyeblink conditioning has been performed in many species but has never been done on young pigs. Therefore, our aim here was to develop and validate an eyeblink conditioning paradigm in young pigs. Method: Eighteen intact male pigs were artificially reared from postnatal day 2-30. The eyeblink conditioning setup consisted of a sound-damping box with a hammock that pigs were placed in, which allowed the pig to remain comfortable yet maintain a typical range of head motion. In a delay conditioning paradigm, the conditional stimulus (CS) was a 550 ms blue light-emitting diode (LED), the unconditional stimulus (US) was a 50 ms eye air-puff, the CS-US interval was 500 ms. Starting at postnatal day 14, pigs were habituated for 5 days to the eyeblink conditioning setup, followed by 5 daily sessions of acquisition training (40 paired CS-US trials each day). Results: The group-averaged amplitude of conditioned eyelid responses gradually increased over the course of the 5 days of training, indicating that pigs learned to make the association between the LED light CS and the air-puff US. A similar increase was found for the conditioned response (CR) probability: the group-averaged CR probability on session 1 was about 12% and reached a CR probability of 55% on day 5. The latency to CR peak time lacked a temporal preference in the first session but clearly showed preference from the moment that animals started to show more CRs in session 2 and onwards whereby the eyelid was maximally closed exactly at the moment that the US would be delivered. Conclusion: We concluded that 3-week-old pigs have the capability of performing in a cerebellar classical conditioning task, demonstrating for the first time that eyeblink conditioning in young pigs has the potential to be a valuable behavioral tool to measure neurodevelopment.

AB  - When plants are sequentially attacked by multiple herbivores, herbivore identity and host specialization can greatly influence the patterns of herbivore-herbivore and plant-herbivore interactions. However, how prior herbivory and the resulting induced plant responses potentially affect subsequent herbivores deserves further investigation. In this study, we conducted a common-garden experiment that manipulated sequential herbivory by the specialist caterpillar Gadirtha fusca Pogue (Lepidoptera: Nolidae) and the generalist caterpillar Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on Chinese tallow, Triadica sebifera (L.) Small (Euphorbiaceae). We tested how prior exposure to herbivores with different levels of host specialization affected the performance of subsequently arriving con- and heterospecifics, as well as plant growth and defense responses under subsequent herbivory. We found that prior exposure to the specialist G. fusca facilitated the performance of subsequent conspecifics, resulting in a significant decrease in the growth (height and stem diameter at ground level) of tallow plants. However, prior exposure to the generalist S. litura did not affect the feeding of subsequent con- or heterospecifics or the growth of tallow plants. Sequential herbivory by specialist and generalist conspecifics resulted in lower levels of tannins and flavonoids, respectively, in leaves of tallow plants, whereas sequential herbivory by the two species did not affect the levels of tannins or flavonoids, compared to a single damage event. We conclude that herbivore species-specific plant responses appear to be more important than herbivore identity or specialization in determining herbivore-herbivore interactions and plant responses to sequential herbivore attack.

AB  - Background and aimsHerbivore dung varies among species in terms of nutrients and microbial composition, but the effect of the microbial activity in the dung on plant growth and symbiotic association is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the influence of cow dung quantity and dung microbial activity on plant-microbe interactions (mycorrhiza, nodulation) and the growth of Trifolium pratense seedlings.MethodsA mesocosm experiment was conducted with gradients of unsterilized or sterilized cow dung applied to pots with T. pratense seedlings. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), root phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity, nodulation, and root mycorrhizal colonization of the seedling were measured after 7 weeks.ResultsGrowth of T. pratense increased with increasing dung supply, while sterilization marginally decreased growth by 15-20% (P = 0.068). Root nodulation increased with increasing dung supply but was significantly lower with sterilized dung. Both root PME activity and mycorrhizal colonization decreased with increasing dung supply but were unaffected by sterilization.ConclusionsThe decreased growth and nodulation due to dung sterilization aligned with our predictions but could not be attributed to reduced dung decomposition and nutrient availability. Instead, the reduced microbial activity from sterilization likely negatively impacted bacterial N2-fixing activity and, consequently, plant growth. This suggests that herbivore dung's effect on plant growth and interactions is more complex than previously anticipated, influenced not only by nutrient supply and stoichiometry but also by microbial composition and activity.

AB  - Recovering nutrients from organic materials to reduce artificial fertilizer inputs requires the implementation of processing technologies and can involve considerable logistics and transportation costs. Reducing such costs by directly applying organic materials to agricultural land can contribute to pollution due to potential contaminants and unbalanced nutrient ratios. Assessing the cost of increased recycling requires a spatially explicit approach because availability of organic materials, nutrient demand and agro-ecosystem properties vary spatially. A multi-objective model was developed to estimate the trade-offs between costs of nutrient recovery and improvements in nutrient distribution for a case study area in The Netherlands. The evaluated recovery processes included solid-liquid separation followed by reverse osmosis to recover nutrients from pig manure which was compared to a conventional process via hygienisation and export. Results indicate that, even in a nutrient saturated area, replacement potential of artificial nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers through locally reclaimed nutrients is limited to about 17% N and 55% P. A cost optimum was found when about 48% of the initial pig manure quantities were processed via nutrient recovery and directed to land. Increasing manure processing for nutrient recovery led to a redistribution of nutrients and trace metals (zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu)), resulting in more localized concentration. Zn and Cu were enriched by about 8% and 2%, respectively, when maximizing nutrient recovery. Our generic model offers a methodology to assess the trade-offs between increased recycling and associated spatial effects to facilitate sustainable recycling infrastructures for achieving more circular agriculture.

AB  - Public concern for farm animal welfare is increasing. Animal welfare is defined as the balance of positive and negative emotions, where positive emotions are key to a good animal life. Emotion is defined as an experience that varies in valence and arousal. Many methods developed to identify positive emotions in animals involve disadvantages. For example, they require training the animals, are age specific or invasive. Vocalisations are a promising indicator of positive emotions. We aimed to review current knowledge on farm animal vocalisations putatively associated with positive emotions and discuss the potential of vocalisations as an on-farm tool to assess positive emotions in farm animals. Vocalisation types and acoustic structures that can potentially be used to identify positive emotions depend upon species. In pigs, lower frequency vocalisations are produced more in positive situations, however, within grunts, higher frequencies reflect positive situations. In horses, more snorts and shorter, lower frequency whinnies could be linked to positive situations. In cows, closed-mouth vocalisations (lower in frequency) might be more common in positive emotions. Food calls and fast clucks may be linked to positive emotions in chickens. In goats, the fundamental frequency shows less fluctuations during positive compared to negative situations. A link between vocalisations and positive emotions has not been shown yet in sheep. Overall, a combination of vocalisations and other measures of emotions could be a promising on-farm tool to monitor positive emotions.

AB  - The growing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has led to a better understanding of the underlying processes that lead to this expansion. Intensive pig farms are considered one of the hotspots for antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) transmission. Phages, as important mobile carriers of ARGs, are widespread in the animal intestine. However, our un-derstanding of phage-associated ARGs in the pig intestine and their underlying drivers is limited. Here, metagenomic sequencing and analysis of viral DNA and total DNA of different intestinal (ileum, cecum and feces) contents in healthy piglets and piglets with diarrhea were separately conducted. We found that phages in piglet ceca are the main reposi-tory for ARGs and mobile genetic element (MGE) genes. Phage-associated MGEs are important factors affecting the maintenance and transfer of ARGs. Interestingly, the colocalization of ARGs and MGE genes in piglet gut phages does not appear to be randomly selected but rather related to a specific phage host (Streptococcus). In addition, in the feces of piglets with diarrhea, the abundance of phages carrying ARGs and MGE genes was significantly increased, as was the diversity of polyvalent phages (phages with broad host ranges), which would facilitate the transfection and wider distribution of ARGs in the bacterial community. Moreover, the predicted host spectrum of polyvalent phages in diarrheal feces tended to be potential enteropathogenic genera, which greatly increased the risk of enteropathogens acquiring ARGs. Notably, we also found ARG-homologous genes in the sequences of piglet intestinal mimiviruses, sug-gesting that the piglet intestinal mimiviruses are a potential repository of ARGs. In conclusion, this study greatly expands our knowledge of the piglet gut microbiome, revealing the underlying mechanisms of maintenance and dissemination of piglet gut ARGs and providing a reference for the prevention and control of ARG pollution in animal husbandry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explored the impact of Leucothyreus femoratus, a previously unreported folivorous pest in cacao cultivation, on cacao tree survival, development, and yield. The study was conducted in an experimental cacao plot in the Colombian plains, it featured 20 cacao genotypes in an agroforestry system, with plantain and Mexican sunflower providing temporary shade, and yopo offering permanent shade.RESULTS: We found an infestation rate of 2.9 +/- 0.3 adult beetles per cacao tree. L. femoratus larvae were discovered in association with the roots of all plants within the agroforestry arrangement; however, yopo and plantain exhibited the highest incidence of root-feeding larvae among these associated plants. Interestingly, male and female L. femoratus displayed distinct leaf consumption patterns in the laboratory, with females consuming more foliage relative to their body weight. Moreover, field observations highlighted the detrimental impact of L. femoratus herbivory on cacao tree survival and growth, leading to leaf skeletonization, reduced plant height, and stem diameter. Trees with over 50% leaf consumption suffered more than 20% mortality. Additionally, herbivory negatively affected cacao yield, correlating higher leaf surface damage with a decrease in harvested pods. The study also identified varying antixenotic resistance in different cacao genotypes, with some consistently displaying resistance while others showed variable levels during tree establishment and production stages.CONCLUSION: This research underscores the significant role of L. femoratus as a cacao pest, emphasizing its adverse effects on cacao tree survival, development, and yield. Consequently, implementing effective control measures is vital for ensuring sustainable cacao cultivation. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Context A better understanding of animal habitat use informs fundamental ecology and can provide underpinnings for effective management.Aims This study explored the temporal variation in feeding ground utilisation by dugongs (Dugong dugon) in two intertidal seagrass beds in Talibong Island, Thailand (Sites A and B), focusing on the distribution and direction of dugong feeding trails.Methods Drone-based aerial photography was conducted quarterly over 1 year and daily over 2 weeks to observe feeding trails and behaviour.Key results During five and seven separate photography periods over 1 year, 0.04 +/- 0.01% (range: 0.03-0.06%) of Site A (200,000 m2) was covered with new feeding trails daily, while 0.35 +/- 0.31% (range: 0.07-0.96%) of Site B (278,000 m2) was covered daily. This temporal variation in the feeding trail area corresponded to that in seagrass coverage. Daily observations over 2 weeks during six separate photography periods revealed a significant decrease in overlapping rates (intersection over union) of the core areas (50% kernel density estimation [KDE]) as time elapsed. The 1-year observation highlighted relatively higher overlapping rates of home ranges (95% KDE) (Site A: 0.27 +/- 0.09; Site B: 0.49 +/- 0.08) and low overlapping rates of core areas (Site A: 0.02 +/- 0.03; Site B: 0.09 +/- 0.09). The relative frequencies of the feeding trail direction remained consistent across survey seasons, and the most and least dominant directions were common across all survey seasons and sites. The circular correlation coefficient between the directions of dugong body axis and the estimated tidal current was 0.45, suggesting that feeding generally occurred in the upstream direction. The direction and spatial range of dugong feeding may be affected by temporally consistent factors. One factor that can affect the feeding direction is the tidal current.Conclusions Overall, dugongs may feed and move within seagrass beds in a temporally consistent manner, even when there are shifts in feeding hotspots.Implications This research enhances our understanding of how dugongs utilise their feeding grounds and highlights the importance of not only identifying feeding hotspots but also predicting their feeding routes by considering the direction and distribution of feeding trails.

AB  - Although the utilization of biosolids in agricultural lands is widely considered as an effective way to improve resource reuse, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) severely restricts biosolids returning to fields. A 12-year long-term experiment with different biosolids application rates (from 0 to 36 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) was conducted to study the effect of biosolids application on shaping ARGs in soil. Biosolids application significantly increased ARGs abundance in the soil, except for MBS treatment (9 t ha(-1) yr(-1) biosolids application). The abundance of ARGs in soil did not increase linearly with the dose of biosolids applied, but they were significantly (P < 0.05) positively correlated. A total of 173 subtypes were detected, among them mobile genetic elements (MGEs), aminoglycoside, and multidrug resistance genes were the most dominant types. Except for MBS treatment, most of the ARGs detected were enriched in amended soils after long-term continuous biosolids application. Specifically, tetPA, sul1, mefA, and IS6100 were highly enriched in all amended soils. In addition, biosolids application increased soil nutrients and heavy metals, and changed the soil microbial community, all of which affected ARGs formation. But MGEs may be a greater factor for shaping ARGs profiles than soil properties. Overall, controlling the rate of biosolid application is the key to reducing the accumulation and horizontal transfer of ARGs in soils.

AB  - Introduction and aimAlthough the sense of smell in pigs is widely recognized as being highly developed, surprisingly little is known about their sensory ability. This study aimed to (a) identify which non-social odors pigs were able to detect and distinguish between, (b) investigate the types of behavior expressed when exploring odors and, (c) compare pigs' responses to the different odors to evaluate their interest in the odors. MethodsGrowing pigs (N = 192) of crossbred commercial breeds were enrolled in the experiment (32-110 days of age, weighing 64.9 +/- 10.1kg). Littermate pairs of opposite sex were tested in test pens with two odor insertion points in the pen wall, 55 cm apart. All pigs were habituated to the test pens and experimenters. Twelve odors were tested (eight essential oils and four synthetic perfumes) in groups of three odors, with each pig pair tested once with one set of three odors (all possible orders of the three odors were tested on 24 pairs in total), always against a non-odor control (demineralized water). In a test, each of the three odors were presented during three trials in a row (a total of 9 trials per test; trial duration: 1 min; inter-trial breaks: 2 min; total test duration: 25 min). Response variables included: duration of sniffing, feeding-related behavior (licking, biting and rooting), agonistic behavior (biting, displacement and pushing) and no approach of the odor or control, recorded throughout each 1-min odor presentation. ResultsAll pigs sniffed an odor less when repeatedly presented (LMM: all odors P < 0.05), and significantly longer at the subsequent presentation of a new odor [LMM (3(rd) vs. 1(st) presentations): P < 0.001]. Specific odor and odor type (essential oil vs. synthetic perfume) had no significant effect on sniffing duration. Overall, feeding-related behavior and agonistic behavior were expressed significantly more when pigs explored the odor compared with the control insertion point (Paired t-tests: P < 0.001), and specific odor only affected the expression of feeding-related behavior. ConclusionCollectively, pigs express sniffing, agonistic, and feeding-related behavior when exploring odors, which suggests that pigs perceive odors of non-social origin as a resource. Odors may thus constitute relevant enrichment material for pigs.

AB  - Blastocystis is a genus of intestinal stramenopiles that infect vertebrates, and may cause disease of the alimentary tract. Currently, at least 40 genotypes ("subtypes") of Blastocystis are recognised worldwide based on sequence data for the small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) gene. Despite the numerous studies of Blastocystis worldwide, very few studies have explored Blastocystis in wild animals, particularly in Australia. Here, we used a PCR-based next generation sequencing (NGS)-phylogenetic approach to genetically characterise and classify Blastocystis variants from selected wildlife in the Australian state of Victoria. In total, 1658 faecal samples were collected from nine host species, including eastern grey kangaroo, swamp wallaby, common wombat, deer, European rabbit, canines and emu. Genomic DNA was extracted from these samples, a 500 bp region of the SSU-rRNA gene amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and, then, a subset of samples sequenced using Illumina technology. Primary PCR detected Blastocystis in 482 of the 1658 samples (29%), with the highest percentage in fallow deer (63%). Subsequent, Illumina-based sequencing of a subset of 356 samples revealed 55 distinct amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing seven currently-recognised subtypes (STs) [ST13 (prominent in marsupials), ST10, ST14, ST21, ST23, ST24 and ST25 (prominent in deer)] and two novel STs (ST45 and ST46) in marsupials. Mixed infections of different STs were observed in macropods, deer, emu and canids (fox, feral dog or dingo), but no infection was detected in rabbits or wombats. This study reveals marked genetic diversity within Blastocystis in a small number of species of wild animals in Australia, suggesting complexity in the genetic composition and transmission patterns of members of the genus Blastocystis in this country.

AB  - Simple Summary Limited attention is paid to sperm thawing protocols, and their study could be relevant to endangered species or breeds, especially for cryopreserved material present in the existing gene banks. The aim of this study was to determine the most optimal thawing protocol for Iberian boar sperm through testing different thawing rates and different modifications of the thawing extender. Based on the findings, the most optimal results were obtained thawing at 70 degrees C for 8 s with the inclusion of cyclodextrins loaded with cholesterol (CLC) in the extender, revealing the importance of adapting the thawing protocols. Thawing protocols have been barely studied, and their modifications may lead to a substantial improvement in post-thawing sperm quality, which could be of great relevance to existing sperm banks, such as those for Iberian pig breeds with varieties in danger of extinction. For that, the study aimed to evaluate different thawing rates and to evaluate modifications in the composition of the thawing extender (basic pH to 8-8.2, incorporation of cyclodextrins loaded with cholesterol [CLC] and the incorporation of ion chelators [EDTA and EGTA]). After thawing, overall sperm motility and kinematic parameters, acrosome status and sperm membrane integrity were evaluated. The most optimal results were obtained with the thawing rate reaching 70 degrees C for 8 s with the inclusion of 12.5 mg of CLC/500 x 10(6) spermatozoa in the thawing extender, which showed an improvement compared to the control at 70 degrees C. In conclusion, to adapt the thawing conditions may be relevant, especially for endangered species or breeds such as some varieties of Iberian pig, since this process could also be used in samples cryopreserved in gene banks.

AB  - Rewilding is an ambitious approach to conservation aiming at restoring and protecting natural processes. As the world is rapidly transitioning into conditions that have not been observed before, we need to be able to extrapolate and predict how natural processes would act under new conditions. Species distribution models have a good potential to inform rewilding decisions by the predictive modeling of potential species presence under various habitat conditions. A critical requirement when utilizing these models is to be able to express the uncertainty in the environment or its predictions. This study demonstrates the use of Bayesian statistical models to address this challenge. As a case study, we explore Bayesian logistic regression and Bayesian generalized additive models in order to predict suitable habitats for Asian elephants ( Elephas maximus ) until the year 2070 under the worst case working scenario of climate change. In this comparative study predictions of habitat suitability are solely based on climatic conditions. The results of the two Bayesian models are compared to two benchmark models, maximum -likelihood estimated logistic regression and random forest. We analyze and discuss trade-offs, relative advantages, and limitations of these modeling choices. The results of our analysis suggest that one configuration of Bayesian logistic regression gives the most robust predictions in this setting, which tend to correspond with the distribution of woodland biomes broadly similar to those in the species ' historical range.

AB  - Tiamulin (TML) has been studied and analyzed in pigs, cattle, chickens, ducks, and other domestic animals, however, its metabolic state in fish has not been well explored. This study investigated TML metabolism in Crucian carp (Carassius carassius). After intraperitoneal injection of TML into Crucian carp, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) analysis, was conducted to identify TML metabolites. The UPLC/Q-TOF MS analysis and the relative molecular mass of the metabolites obtained from related literature identified five metabolites in Crucian carp. These metabolites were M1 (510.2908, C28H48NO5S+), M2 (510.2908, C28H48NO5S+), M3 (466.2750, C26H44NO4S+), M4 (482.2663, C26H44NO5S+), and M5 (482.2663, C26H44NO5S+). The enrichment and metabolism of TML and its metabolites in Crucian carp were investigated using the drug bath method combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). TML exhibited an overall trend of an initial increase followed by a decrease. Moreover, the drug enrichment rate was fast and reached saturation after two days. The bioconcentration factor of TML in Crucian carp was 3.01. However, the drug had a slow elimination rate, with its complete metabolism occurring after 20 days.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are prevalent in aquatic ecosystems; however, inland water bodies have received relatively little attention. These ecosystems provide essential habitat for various fish species, which contribute to ecological equilibrium and support the livelihoods and food security of millions. Fish demonstrate increased vulnerability to microplastic ingestion, making them essential bioindicators of ecosystem health and contamination levels. This study evaluates the presence of MPs in the intestine, gills, and muscle tissue of 30 individuals belonging to five commonly found fish species (Rhinomugil corsula, Mystus tengara, Ompok pabda, Labeo bata, and Cirrhinus mrigala) in the Padma River. A total of 252 MP items of different shapes were recorded in 100% of individuals investigated, exhibiting an average frequency of 8.27 +/- 2.16 items per individual. Among the fish species, Ompok pabda exhibited the highest ingestion of MPs, with an average of 11.5 +/- 1.87 items per individual, followed by other species. Organ-wise analysis of MPs trend was found to be: intestine > gill > muscle. Fiber was recognized as the most commonly consumed MP type (72%), followed by fragment (22%), pellet (4%), and foam (2%). The white-color MP (24%) was predominant, followed by other colored MPs. The majority of MP particles were found in the size class 1-5 mm (41.10% +/- 12.34%), followed by <500 mu m (34.18% +/- 16.34%) and 500 mu m-1 mm (24.72% +/- 11.51%). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy investigation confirms both high- and low-density polyethylene polymeric compositions of MPs. The study assesses the prevalence of microplastics in Padma River fish, highlighting the immediate necessity for focused conservation initiatives, ongoing monitoring, and evaluation of microplastic pollution to protect aquatic ecosystems and human health.

AB  - Disruptions in light/dark cycle have been associated with an altered ability to form and retrieve memory in human and animals. Animal studies have shown that chronic light deprivation disrupts the light/dark cycle and alters the neural connections that mediate hippocampal memory formation. In order to better understand how light deprivation affects the formation and retrieval of memory in adult rats, we examined the effect of total darkness on spatial and auditory fear learning and memory formation and BDNF/TRKB protein levels during the light and dark phases of the rat circadian cycle. Male Wistar rats (n = 60), were randomly divided into two main groups: normal rearing (NR, 12 h light/dark cycle for 3 weeks) and dark rearing (DR, kept in constant darkness for 3 weeks); and each of these groups had a "light (day)" and "dark (night)" sub-group. After 3 weeks, the Morris Water maze and auditory fear conditioning were used to assess spatial and fear memory acquisition and retrieval, respectively. BDNF and TRKB protein levels in the hippocampus of rats from the four sub-groups were measured by Western blot, at the completion of the 3 week constant darkness exposure and after the behavioral experiments. These studies revealed that DR for 3 weeks impaired spatial memory retrieval and enhanced extinction of auditory fear memory specifically during the light (day) phase. DR also eliminated the normal fluctuations in BDNF/TRKB levels observed in the hippocampus across the light/dark cycle.

AB  - Disinfectants and antibiotics are widely used for the prevention and control of bacterial infectious diseases. Frequent disinfection is thought to exacerbate antibiotic resistance. However, little is known about how disinfectants and antibiotics co-induce changes in the soil antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study determined the ARG profiles and bacterial community dynamics between unamended soil and manure-amended soil exposed to benzalkonium chloride (C12) (BC, 10 mg kg- 1) disinfectant and sulfamethazine (SMZ, 1 mg kg- 1), using highthroughput quantitative PCR and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Manure application enriched the soil in terms of ARGs abundance and diversity, which synergistically amplified the co-selection effect of BC and SMZ on soil antibiotic resistome. Compared with the control treatment, BC and SMZ exposure had a smaller impact on the bacterial infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance-related functions in manure-amended soil, in which bacterial communities with greater tolerance to antimicrobial substances were constructed. Manure application increased the proportion of rank I ARGs and potential human pathogenic bacteria, while BC and SMZ exposure increased the drug-resistant pathogens transmission risk. This study validated that BC and SMZ aggravated the antimicrobial resistance under manure application, providing a reference for managing the spread risk of antimicrobial resistance in agricultural activities.

AB  - Over the last few decades, Oral Rabies Vaccinations (ORV) has eliminated sylvatic rabies from most of Central and Western Europe. Despite this success, they will probably be needed in the near future, due to the expansion of native and invasive reservoirs. It is unclear if they still work, at this time when many countries have an abundant wild boar population and complex assemblages of mammals. The ORV boasts a non-invasive and socially acceptable approach, but it presents some critical issues that we have analyzed in our study. Between November 2011 and March 2015, a total of 249 Rabigen (R) SAG2 VIRBAC baits were positioned on the ground at 5 sites in the study area. Baits were monitored by weekly inspections of camera traps. Overall, 63.4% of baits were found to have been worn after one week, mostly due to rainy weather, and had to be replaced. Remaining baits lasted on the field 3.66 +/- 1.07 days and 54.4% of them were consumed by wild boar (Sus scrofa). Our data highlight how a potential reservoir species such as the grey wolf did not ingest the vaccine baits while only few were taken by red fox, due to numerous competitors, especially wild boar. Findings raise doubts about the effectiveness of ORV in areas of Europe characterized by the presence of non-target species, particularly wild boar. The rising number in wild boar populations around Europe could seriously reduce baits presence in the environment, limiting their effectiveness. Future ORV campaigns against re-emerging rabies in Europe should either account for bait loss, or experiment with targeted forms of bait distribution, that prevent their uptake by non-target species.

AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) concentrations in various tissues and organs of grassland sheep from Inner Mongolia, China, were determined. The abilities of PBDEs binding to ovine serum albumin (OSA) and Cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP3A24) were assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking simulations. The PBDE concentrations in the sheep tissue and organ samples were 33.4-167 pg/g dw. The distribution of PBDEs in sheep organs and tissues is affected not only by the function of organs and tissues, but also by the characteristics of PBDEs. Adipose tissue tends to bioaccumulate more-brominated BDEs (BDE-154, -153, and -183), but muscle tissues and visceral organs mainly bioaccumulate less-brominated BDEs. The distribution of PBDEs in visceral organs is mainly affected by the transport of ovine serum albumin (OSA) and the metabolism of CYP3A24 enzyme. The distribution of PBDEs in adipose tissue and brain is mainly affected by their logK(OW).

AB  - The enteropathogenic Yersinia genus is commonly detected in wildlife including wild boars. Difficulties in its cultivation may hamper subsequent epidemiological studies and outbreak investigations. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) of Yersinia (Y.) enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis has proven useful in source attribution and epidemiological studies but has hitherto relied on the analysis of isolates. In the present study, MLVA profiles generated from 254 isolates of Y. enterocolitica indicated similarities between human, pig and rodent isolates. Further, MLVA analyses of 13 Y. pseudotuberculosis pure-cultured isolates were compared to MLVA analyses performed directly on the 14 PCR-positive enrichment broths from which the isolates originated, which showed matching MLVA profiles. This indicates that MLVA analysis performed directly on enrichment broths could be a useful method for molecular epidemiological investigations. In addition, 10 out of 32 samples of wild boar minced meat obtained from private hunters and from approved wild-game-handling establishments were PCR-positive for the presence of Y. enterocolitica and may indicate a risk for public health.

AB  - Insect infestation triggers multiple defense responses in plants, both locally at the infection site and systemically throughout the plant, including the production of feeding deterrents, toxins, defensive proteins, enzymes, and secondary metabolites. Our study aimed to compare the endogenous levels of antioxidative enzymes, photosynthetic pigments, phytohormones, total phenols, and flavonoids in bark-beetle-infested and uninfested trees. We evaluated the surviving trees in bark-beetle-infested stands, assessing both the condition and defense of uninfested and infested beech (Fagus sylvatica), pine (Pinus sylvestris), and fir (Abies alba) trees. Sampling was performed at six affected sites in the Czech Republic, targeting trees that were resilient to significant health deterioration caused by abiotic and biotic factors. The results showed different levels of most of the measured compounds in the three species. Among all the tested species, photosynthetic pigment levels showed the strongest association with infestation status, which was generally lower in the infested plants. For chlorophyll a, extremely significant reductions were observed from 123 +/- 20.6 to 101 +/- 17.9 mu g/g dry weight (DW) in pine, from 231 +/- 33.1 to 199 +/- 22.2 mu g/g DW in beech, and from 60 +/- 5.66 to 51.3 +/- 6.27 mu g/g DW in fir. In contrast, enzymatic activities indicated only isolated instances of significant association, whereas antioxidative properties (total phenolic content, flavonoids, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity) were not significantly associated with infestation status. There was a statistically significant increase in glutathione reductase activity in infested fir and pine trees. However, this difference was not statistically significant in beech. In contrast, a significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity was detected in infected beech trees. Phytohormones have emerged as the most diverse group of analyzed compounds. Cytokinins were the most distinct, with many of them being significantly increased in infested pines, whereas both beech and fir showed only one significant association. Additionally, derivatives of jasmonic acid also showed a distinct pattern of change associated with bark beetle infestation, with the levels of three out of the four analyzed jasmonates being significantly decreased in infested pines, whereas no effects were observed in beeches and firs. Notably, many phytohormones were significantly elevated in the infested pine, whereas both beech and fir exhibited only one significant association. Overall, the data showed that pines responded differently to bark beetles than to beeches or firs. The greatest changes in phytohormones were observed in pine, whereas the most significant changes in photosynthetic pigments were observed in beech and fir trees.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel (C. oleifera) is an evergreen shrub classified under the Camellia genus. It is an important oil species and has great economic benefits. At present, C. oleifera is widely cultivated in the Yangtze River Basin in South China, and its wild species are mainly distributed in the native forests of Hainan Province. Therefore, in the current study, we used the MaxEnt model to predict the suitable habitat for C. oleifera and different environmental factors affecting its current and future distribution. The AUC values exceeded 0.98, showing that the simulation of the model was good, and the TSS values were all above 0.96, indicating that the model was feasible. The results showed that C. oleifera was mainly distributed in Southern China, with a total area of 56.68 x 104 km2. The suitable habitats of Camellia oleifera are affected by the precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18), human activity, soil available water content (awc_class), and minimum temperature of the coldest month and seasonal temperature (bio04). Furthermore, rainfall in the warmest quarter (bio18) was recognized as a crucial factor impacting its distribution. Under future climate conditions, the suitable habitat area of C. oleifera is projected to expand with a slight northward shift in its distribution center. Therefore, in addition to maintaining the current planting area of C. oleifera, the planting area can be appropriately expanded upward along the current area and along the Yangtze River Basin.

AB  - Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) and mastitis caused by Pasteurella (P.) multocida, Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and Streptococcus (Str.) agalactiae are important ailments of the dairy industry especially in South Asia. The present study evaluates the efficacy of a locally prepared hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) and mastitis combined vaccine. To this end, a total of 70 HS, S. aureus and Str. agalactiae-free lactating (early stage of lactation) buffaloes (n = 45) and cows (n = 25), and 50 lactating (early stage of lactation) cows (n = 25) and buffaloes (n = 25) positive for S. aureus/Str. agalactiae were subjected to two doses of HS-mastitis combined vaccine with an interval of 21 days. Antibody response was monitored by ELISA up to six months (180 days). Antibody titers against HS and mastitis were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in vaccinated groups as compared to the non-vaccinated groups. Cumulative mean somatic cell counts and mastitis severity scores in vaccinated groups were significantly lower (p < 0.05), and milk yield was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the respective non-vaccinated controls. In conclusion, Montanide (R)-adjuvanted HS-mastitis combined vaccine showed significant immunogenic effects in dairy cows and buffaloes. However, challenge studies remain overdue.

AB  - Simple Summary Heterozygosity-rich regions (HRRs) are regions of high heterozygosity, which can harbor important genes associated with key functional traits such as immune response and disease resilience. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous homozygous segments of the genome, which can be informative of the population's history, structure, demography events, and overall genetic diversity. We first detected factors impacting the identification of ROH and HRR in worldwide sheep populations, which were artificially selected for specific purposes or under natural conditions. We also identified common regions of high homozygosity or heterozygosity among these populations, where a diversity of candidate genes with distinct functions might indicate differential selection pressure on these regions in breeds with different trait expression. Moreover, we evaluated a tool commonly used in the corporate environment, making use of the business intelligence (BI) concept to support managers in the decision-making process, which allowed us to combine results from multiple analyses and create visualization schemes integrating different information. Our findings and proposed tools contribute to the development of more efficient breeding strategies and conservation of genetic resources in sheep and other livestock species. In this study, we chose 17 worldwide sheep populations of eight breeds, which were intensively selected for different purposes (meat, milk, or wool), or locally-adapted breeds, in order to identify and characterize factors impacting the detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity-rich regions (HRRs) in sheep. We also applied a business intelligence (BI) tool to integrate and visualize outputs from complementary analyses. We observed a prevalence of short ROH, and a clear distinction between the ROH profiles across populations. The visualizations showed a fragmentation of medium and long ROH segments. Furthermore, we tested different scenarios for the detection of HRR and evaluated the impact of the detection parameters used. Our findings suggest that HRRs are small and frequent in the sheep genome; however, further studies with higher density SNP chips and different detection methods are suggested for future research. We also defined ROH and HRR islands and identified common regions across the populations, where genes related to a variety of traits were reported, such as body size, muscle development, and brain functions. These results indicate that such regions are associated with many traits, and thus were under selective pressure in sheep breeds raised for different purposes. Interestingly, many candidate genes detected within the HRR islands were associated with brain integrity. We also observed a strong association of high linkage disequilibrium pattern with ROH compared with HRR, despite the fact that many regions in linkage disequilibrium were not located in ROH regions.

AB  - In this study, the bacterial communities of the c oe lomic microbiota were characterized in three Echinoderms: the deposit feeder sea Cucumber Holothuria forskali, the herbivorous sea Urchin Sphaerechinus granularis, and the carnivorous sea Star Marthasterias glacialis. Samples were collected from the same habitat in the Gl & eacute;nan Archipelago (Brittany, France) at different times for 2 years. The c oe lomic microbiota were analyzed by targeted metagenomic with V4-16S metabarcoding and by a culturable approach with the isolation of strains and antimicrobial activity assays. Most of the OTUs of the c oe lomic microbiota were affiliated with the phylum Proteobacteria and, notably, five orders: Burkholderiales, Flavobacteriales, Alteromonadales, Vibrionales and Pseudomonadales. Significant differences were observed regarding richness, biodiversity and composition between species and sampling dates. They could be explained by sub-abundant taxa that represented the global diversity. C oe lomic microbiota also revealed shared and unshared bacterial communities, validating a potential "specific" microbiota among the three Echinoderm species. Moreover, significant variations of the microbiota occurred among the sampling dates, suggesting a plasticity and, thus, a potential selection of these microbiota. Finally, out of the 831 bacterial strains isolated from culturable microbiota, 20 strains exhibited antibacterial activities, most of them assigned to the genera Shewanella, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio.

AB  - In Mexico, Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii are major causes of reproductive problems in sheep. Understanding the environmental factors that influence the spread of these parasites is crucial for developing effective control strategies. The objective of this study was to identify the environmental factors associated with N. caninum and T. gondii infections in sheep in western Mexico. Blood samples were collected from 184 sheep and determine seroprevalence using the ELISA test. Based on the seroprevalence data and information about the climatic regions and geographic characteristics, logistic regression analysis was employed to identify the environmental factors associated with N. caninum and T. gondii infections. Antibodies for N. caninum were found in 27 of the 184 blood samples. The environmental risk factors associated with N. caninum were K & ouml;ppen climate area Ca(w1) with an OR = 6.55 and rainfall (700-800 mm) with an OR = 3.23. For T. gondii, antibodies were detected in 113 of the 184 sheep sampled. The main risk factors were K & ouml;ppen climate area Cb(w1) with an OR = 10.5 and rainfall (900-1000 mm) with an OR = 4.6. Identifying these factors is crucial for developing more effective control strategies to reduce the incidence of these infections and improve the reproductive health of sheep flocks in the region.

AB  - Despite limited understanding of gut fungal roles in fat deposition among indigenous pig breeds, a comparative study between high-fat-accumulating Ningxiang (NX) pigs and lean-type Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) pigs reveals a fungal-driven regulatory mechanism. NX pigs exhibited significantly higher fat percentage, elevated serum glucose, and markedly reduced total colonic short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) compared to DLY pigs (all p < 0.001), with butyrate showing the most pronounced decrease. Beta-diversity confirmed distinct fungal communities (p = 0.002), where NX pigs were enriched with Aspergillus and Penicillium, while DLY pigs harbored dominant Rhodotorula. Strong correlations were observed: NX-enriched fungi positively correlated with glucose and negatively with SCFAs, whereas Rhodotorula strongly associated with SCFAs (p < 0.001). FUNGuild analysis linked Aspergillus/Penicillium to enhanced polysaccharide degradation and glucose bioavailability. The findings propose a gut fungal-mediated "Glucose-SCFAs axis": NX-enriched fungi elevate glucose (promoting lipogenesis) and suppress SCFAs (reducing butyrate-mediated adipocyte inhibition), whereas Rhodotorula in DLY pigs enhances SCFAs-induced lipolysis. Crucially, we demonstrate that fungal modulation primarily drives fat deposition differences between breeds, offering novel probiotics/antifungal strategies for precision swine breeding.

AB  - Although most prey are attacked by multiple predators, much of the ecological theory on prey suppression focuses on the effects of a single predator. The presence of multiple predators can lead to complex interactions such as trait-mediated interactions (TMIIs) and intraguild predation which can influence the suppression of pest populations. Here we explore the effect of two predators, a native anole lizard species Anolis cristatellus (Squa-mata: Dactyloidae) and a non-native ant species Wasmannia auropunctata (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), on the coffee leaf miner, Leucoptera coffeella (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae) (CLM). In a laboratory experiment we examined the effects of these two predators in isolation and when co-occurring. Our results show that when each predator is alone, they are able to consume the CLM in a comparable way. However, when they are together, their effect is not greater than when alone. This indicates that there is a negative effect when both predators co-occur. The results from this experiment have practical implications since both predators are present in coffee agro-ecosystems in Puerto Rico, where the CLM is considered the main insect pest. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the potential dynamics among several predators in agroecosystems and the potential implications for herbivore regulation.

AB  - With the growing diversity and complexity of diet, animals and humans are at risk of exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), which is a well-known contaminant in the food chain that causes various toxicological effects. The in-testine acts as the first barrier against external contaminants, but the effect of AFB1 on intestinal barrier has not been determined. This study aimed to evaluate AFB1 on the intestinal barrier function in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, porcine jejunal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) were treated with increasing concentrations of AFB1 (10-60 mg/L). In vivo, Kunming (KM) mice were used as controls or gavaged with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (110 mg/kg b.w.) and AFB1 (0.3 mg/kg b.w.) for 28 days. In IPEC-J2 cells, the cell viability decreased with increasing mycotoxin concentrations, and the viability of IPEC-J2 cells decreased significantly (P < 0.05) when the AFB1 concentra-tions were greater than 30 mg/L. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and immuno-fluorescence results show that AFB1 can downregulate the tight junction proteins and increase the expression levels of Caspase-3 and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, suggesting that AFB1 was cytotoxic to IPEC-J2. In vivo, the ratio of villus height to crypt depth, the intestinal wall thickness, the number of intestinal villus per 1000 mu m in the jejunum, the expression levels of ZO-1, Claudin-3, Occludin, MUC2, and Caspase-3, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were significantly affected in mice exposed to AFB1. In vitro and in vivo results showed that the effects of exposure to AFB1 on the intestinal function in the jejunum of KM mice and in the IPEC-J2 was similar, suggesting that AFB1 may adversely affect animal intestine.

AB  - Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) commonly detected in milk and dairy products. These compounds pose a serious threat to the health of consumers due to their considerable bioaccumulation potential, high stability, and toxicity. (2) Methods: The study evaluated the potential of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus probiotic cultures to reduce HCB residues in fermented goat milk beverages during 21-day refrigerated storage. HCB content was determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). (3) Results: A strong negative correlation was found between HCB concentration in fermented milk and storage time. After 21 days, a 75-78% reduction in HCB content was observed, with L. plantarum showing greater efficiency in reducing hexachlorobenzene levels than L. rhamnosus. (4) Conclusions: The use of probiotic cultures contributed to a significant reduction in the HCB content of fermented goat milk. Our findings support the hypothesis that the lactic acid bacteria Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus can lower hexachlorobenzene levels in fermented products

AB  - Some anxiety-related disorders, such as panic disorder, specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), develop because of the poor regulation and inappropriate expression of fear-related behavior at the wrong place and wrong time. In clinical settings, exposure therapy, which consists of repeated presentation of trauma-related stimuli without real threats in the therapeutic context, is commonly used to treat these disorders. However, 30-50 % of patients suffer from the recurrence of anxiety symptoms after they leave the therapeutic context. This behavioral phenomenon is called renewal. In this study, ABA Pavlovian fear renewal paradigm was used to assess the role of the aberrant orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation, a symptom of OCD patients, on fear regulation in laboratory settings. The rats were fear conditioned in one context (context A), extinguished to the tones in another context (context B), and then tested in either context A or B. During extinction, rats were subjected to lateral or medial OFC activation. We found that rats that underwent extinction with either lateral or medial OFC activation were unable to use the context to determine whether it was a safe or dangerous context during renewal test. Interestingly, the rats with lateral OFC activation during extinction showed generally high fear, whereas the rats with medial OFC activation during extinction showed generally low fear. In conclusion, our results suggested that aberrant activation of specifically the lateral OFC may have a negative impact during exposure therapy treatments and results in their poor regulation of fearrelated behavior.

AB  - Rangifer tarandus has experienced recent drastic population size reductions throughout its circumpolar distribution and preserving the species implies genetic diversity conservation. To facilitate genomic studies of the species populations, we improved the genome assembly by combining long read and linked read and obtained a new highly accurate and contiguous genome assembly made of 13,994 scaffolds (L90 = 131 scaffolds). Using de novo transcriptome assembly of RNA-sequencing reads and similarity with annotated human gene sequences, 17,394 robust gene models were identified. As copy number variations (CNVs) likely play a role in adaptation, we additionally investigated these variations among 20 genomes representing three caribou ecotypes (migratory, boreal and mountain). A total of 1,698 large CNVs (length > 1 kb) showing a genome distribution including hotspots were identified. 43 large CNVs were particularly distinctive of the migratory and sedentary ecotypes and included genes annotated for functions likely related to the expected adaptations. This work includes the first publicly available annotation of the caribou genome and the first assembly allowing genome architecture analyses, including the likely adaptive CNVs reported here.

AB  - Plants often face chronic seed loss from predispersal seed predation by insects. Although many studies have documented the rates of seed loss for single species in different communities, it is unclear how rates of predispersal seed predation vary among co-occurring species within the same community. If interspecific asymmetries in seed loss are great, this common interaction could have important implications for coexistence. Species traits, such as seed size or seed nitrogen and carbon, might correlate with interspecific variation in predispersal seed predation among co-occurring grassland forb species. We collected infructescences from 13 co-occurring forb species from each of four western Montana grasslands over 2 years. We quantified the magnitude of seed loss due to predispersal seed predation by insects. The average level of seed loss was 15.8%. Larger seeded species suffered significantly higher levels of predispersal seed predation than smaller seeded species, and seed size predicted seed loss more than seed nitrogen or carbon. Although large-seeded species often have greater proportional recruitment and early survival than small-seeded species, our study suggests that these advantages are partially counterbalanced by greater predispersal seed loss for larger versus smaller seeded species. Asymmetries in predispersal seed predation may importantly affect coexistence among these species.

AB  - The issue of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) pollution in manure has garnered significant attention, with viruses now being recognized as crucial carriers and disseminators of ARGs. However, the virus-associated ARG profiles and potential health risks in composts are still unclear. In this study, the viral communities and associated ARGs in biogas residue and pig faeces composts were profiled by virome analysis. The viral communities were dominated by Caudovirales, and non-thermophilic viruses were inactivated during composting. The diversity and abundance of ARGs were lower in virome than in metagenome, while ARGs' risk was greater in virome than in metagenome. There were six bacterial genera identified as viral hosts at the genomic level, Pseudomonas and Clostridium carried high-risk ARGs. Virus-associated ARGs in viral hosts had a higher risk rank than non-virus-associated ARGs. Composting reduced the diversity, abundance and risk of viral ARGs. The risk of ARGs in biogas residues was significantly lower than that of pig faeces in the initial period of composting, and the two different substracts equally less harmful after composting. These results revealed that viruses play a non negligible role in spreading ARGs, posing high risk to environmental and human health.

AB  - Globally, predation is an important and ongoing problem facing the livestock sector. This study estimated the downstream economic impact of predation in the South African red meat industry using a recent South African Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) and a partial equilibrium model. Due to predation the total output decreased by R 3,806 million and R 648 million for large (cattle) and small livestock (sheep and goat), respectively. The result implies that the loss of livestock due to predation reduces the number of livestock available for marketing and the presence of predators influences the level and intensity of best management practices employed by the red meat industry. The findings of this study, which looked at the macroeconomic implications of predation in the South African red meat industry, as well as the biodiversity and ecology aspects of predation, could help government and policymakers develop appropriate policies and mitigation strategies to reduce prediction and prioritize strategies that will help lessen the impact of predation.

AB  - Mutualisms characterized by reciprocal benefits between species are a fundamental relationship of tropical ecosystems. Ant Gardens (AGs) represent an interesting ant-plant mutualism, involving specialized interactions between vascular epiphytes and ants. While this relationship has been extensively studied in various tropical regions, the available information on Peruvian ecosystems is limited. The objective of this study was to identify the ant and epiphyte species that constitute AGs. From February 2023 to January 2024, a study was conducted on two 50 x 10 m transects within the Mauritia flexuosa peat swamp forest, located within the Water Association Aguajal Renacal del Alto Mayo (ADECARAM) Tingana in San Mart & iacute;n, Peru. A total of 69 ant gardens were documented, comprising 18 phorophyte species, 19 epiphyte species, and three ant species. The results demonstrated that neither the height nor the diameter at breast height (DBH) of phorophytes exhibited a statistically significant correlation with the number of AGs per host. However, a positive correlation was observed between the length and width of the AGs and the number of ants per AG. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of AG mutualism in Peruvian ecosystems.

AB  - Avoiding humans will be more difficult and energetically costly for animals as outdoor recreation increases and people venture farther into wildland areas that provide high-quality habitat for wildlife. Restricting human access can be an attractive management tool to mitigate effects of human recreation activities on wildlife; however, the efficacy of such measures is rarely assessed. In 1982, Yellowstone National Park identified areas important to grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) to help protect critical grizzly bear habitat and reduce the likelihood of human injuries by bears. Referred to as bear management areas (BMAs), human access is restricted in these areas for 2-8 months each year, with timing and type of restrictions varying by area. We examined 2 datasets to evaluate grizzly bear selection of BMAs and differences of bear density in BMAs and non-BMAs. First, we used 17 years of recent global positioning system telemetry data for grizzly bears to assess their selection of BMAs during periods when human access was allowed, and when access was restricted. We used step-selection functions to test the hypothesis that bears spend time in places that allow them to avoid people and select quality food sources. There was support that grizzly bears differentially select for BMAs regardless of whether human access was restricted at the time, compared with areas outside BMAs, and that selection changed with sex and season. Only males during the summer and hyperphagic seasons changed their selection of BMAs based on whether access restrictions were in place, and overall, male bears preferred unrestricted BMAs (BMAs without restrictions in place). Females preferentially selected BMAs regardless of whether the area had access restrictions in place only during the mating season. Individuals varied widely in their preference for BMAs and access restrictions. Bears likely choose to spend time in BMAs based on available food resources rather than restrictions to human access. Supporting this interpretation, our analyses indicated that a greater proportion of BMA in an area was associated with higher densities of grizzly bear. Thus, restrictions to human access likely help reduce the potential for human-bear interactions, accomplishing one of the original objectives for establishing the BMAs.

AB  - Whether nutrient availability interacts with induced resistance to alter plant chemistry and, consequently, the preference and performance of herbivores on plants remains unclear. We hypothesized that changing fertilizer inputs modulates responses induced by exogenous application of the defensive phytohormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) against Tuta absoluta, a devastating pest of tomatoes. We found that tomato plants grown at or 2-fold above optimal fertilizer rates had higher nutrient content and were more preferred by T. absoluta females for oviposition and were better hosts for their offspring. MeJA increased phenolic content and volatile emissions in plants, which correlated with lower T. absoluta oviposition preference and offspring performance. However, we found no significant interactions when fertilizer and MeJA were applied simultaneously, such that induced responses against T. absoluta in tomatoes were similar regardless of fertilizer rate. These results provide novel insights into the bottom-up effects of fertilization and induced resistance on plant-insect herbivore interactions.

AB  - Apple is a widely cultivated fruit in the world, and China is the country with the largest apple planting area and production. It is of great agricultural and economic significance to study the fertilization strategy of new apple orchards on poor soil. Under the same nitrogen input, the effects of different livestock manure (chicken manure, swine manure, sheep manure, and cattle manure) and chemical fertilizers were compared in fertilized and non- fertilized area after five-years continuous fertilization. The results showed that compared with the fertilizer applied area, soil available nutrients were lower in the non-applied area. In fertilizer applied area, the soil NO3--N content was significantly increased by manure application, except chicken manure, when compared with chemical fertilizer. However, the available P and K contents under the chicken manure application were significantly higher than those in all other treatments, except for the available P content under the swine manure application. All manure treatments increased the alpha diversity of microorganisms and the dominant populations of microbial species at the phylum level were consistent. Redundancy and correlation analyses showed a significant positive correlation between Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and available P and a significant negative correlation between Glomeromycota and available P. A significant negative correlation was observed between Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and available K. The highest Chao1 and Shannon indices were achieved under the swine manure application. The microbial community structure under the chicken manure treatment was different from that under the other manure treatments. The study initially identified differences in the performance of fertilizers from different sources, and found that swine and chicken manures have significant effects on improving soil fertility and microbial diversity, which provided scientific basis for soil management and fertilizer selection in practical agricultural production.

AB  - Memory retrieval involves recalling previously consolidated information, while memory extinction refers to the gradual weakening of such memories after recall. Stress and glucocorticoids influence the retrieval and extinction of memory. This study employed a passive avoidance task to examine the impact of acute mild stress and equivalent doses of exogenous corticosterone on fear memory retrieval and extinction in male mice. Subsequently, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of Ginkgo biloba extract, EGb 761, on memory impairments induced by stress and corticosterone. Corticosterone was administered systemically 30 min before memory reactivation to model glucocorticoid activity during retrieval. Mild acute stress, like the stress levels typically experienced before an exam, was induced through 20-min restraint immediately before reactivation in separate groups. EGb 761 was injected 30 min before corticosterone or stress exposure. Results demonstrated that both corticosterone and acute stress impaired context-specific fear memory retrieval and enhanced subsequent extinction. Pretreatment with EGb 761 inhibited these impairing effects of acute stress and corticosterone on avoidance memory retrieval and extinction. Our findings suggest that the glucocorticoid system and acute stress markedly influence avoidance memory retrieval and extinction. Ginkgo biloba may possess therapeutic and memory-enhancing effects, particularly in stressful situations.

AB  - Rice is an important food crop in China, fertilization measures significantly affect soil properties and ultimately change rice yield. Thus, examining the effects of long-term green manure cultivation on the rice yield and the driving factors on rice yield, plays a crucial role in maintaining food security. Based on the long-term green manure cultivation, the treatments included no fertilizer (CK), chemical fertilizer (NPK), chemical fertilizer + Chinese milk vetch (NPK + GM), chemical fertilizer + Chinese milk vetch + rice straws (NPK + GM + S), and chemical fertilizer + Chinese milk vetch + pig manure (NPK + GM + M) treatments. One-way repeated ANOVA was used to determine the effects of diverse fertilizer modes on temporal variations in rice yields. The redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to calculate the magnitudes of the effects of soil properties on rice yield. Compared with the CK treatment, four fertilizer treatments led to significantly increased double-season rice yields (116.40-124.49%), with no significant difference between four fertilizer treatments (p > 0.05). There were five soil properties accounting for 66.3% variation in rice yield (p < 0.05), with available potassium (AK) being the most influential factor (32.2% variation), whereas potential of hydrogen (pH), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and soil organic carbon (SOC) accounted for 15.3%, 10.5%, 5.1%, and 3.2% variation in rice yield (p < 0.05), respectively. Thus, SOC, TN, TP, AK, and pH were major factors affecting the double-season rice yield of red paddy soil under long-term green manure cultivation. However, the results suggested that the effect of green manure on soil fertility is limited by the relatively large amount of chemical fertilizer. The results reported herein can not only increase soil fertility and improve the soil ecological environment, but also enhance and stabilize the yields of double-season rice grown in the red paddy soil of southern China.

AB  - Simple Summary: To develop alternative silage resources, we employed buffaloes as an animal model to evaluate the possibility and effects of forage rape silage in the dairy buffalo diet. We comprehensively assessed the nutrition value of forage rape silage by the apparent total-tract digestibility, rumen fermentation characteristics, blood metabolism and milk composition of lactating buffaloes. Our current results showed that the inclusion of forage rape silage in diets improved the milk quality, such as milk protein, milk fat, and total solid percentage. Furthermore, partial supplementation of forage rape silage also promotes buffaloes' dry matter intake. These may be related to the favorable physiological and metabolic changes induced by the forage rape silage. Thus, our current data show the applicability of forage rape silage as a good feed resource for ruminants.
   Worldwide, silage is considered the main component in dairy animal diets; however, this portion is mainly dominated by corn silage, which raises availability challenges in some agricultural production systems. The present study evaluated a partial replacement of corn silage with forage rape silage (FRS) and its effect on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, milk production, and blood metabolites in buffalo. Thirty-six lactating buffaloes were randomly assigned to four different groups, according to supplementation of FRS (only corn silage, FRS0) or with 15% (FRS15), 25% (FRS25), and 35% (FRS35) of forage rape silage instead of corn silage. The results showed that, compared to corn silage, forage rape silage has a lower carbohydrate but a higher protein concentration. The buffalo intake of dry matter and organic matter were improved linearly with the FRS increasing in the diet. The apparent total-tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, organic matter, nitrogen, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber also increased by the FRS supplementation compared with FRS0. Conversely, FRS supplementation decreased the propionic, butyric, and valeric acid contents and increased the acetic:propionic ratio and microbial protein content. Furthermore, FRS inclusion led to a significantly higher milk urea and non-fat milk solid content, higher blood glucose, total globulins, blood urea nitrogen, and lower blood high-density lipoprotein. These results suggested that FRS has high a nutritional value and digestibility, is a good feed resource, and showed favorable effects when supplemented with dairy buffalo ration.

AB  - Wildlife managers adjust harvest quotas based on population changes and specific management goals, like controlling population size and demography or minimizing human-wildlife interactions. However, establishing quotas that best meet these goals can be challenging due to e.g. population fluctuations, climate change, and bias or variation in harvest effort. High-Arctic Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus experience strong interannual variation in population size and demographic structure due to environmental stochasticity. Here, we analyzed the demographic and spatial bias of reindeer harvest in relation to quota regulations, hunter preferences, and population dynamics. Despite the protective management goal to avoid demographic impacts, 30 yr of data revealed that the harvest was consistently biased towards yearlings and male adults. This hunting selectivity resulted from both hunter preferences and the coarse license categories separating 'calf', 'yearling or female adult', and 'free choice' licenses. We developed Bayesian multinomial likelihood models to account for hunting selectivity and optimize annual quota distributions among license categories using population monitoring data. Optimized annual quota distributions varied strongly due to demographic fluctuations associated with strong climate variability, whereas simulated harvest offtakes showed that the protective management goal is inherently challenged by the coarse license categories. Although on average, only 7 % of the hunted population was harvested annually, we found strong spatial variation in harvest pressure, with potential implications for spatial population dynamics. Our adaptive management approach accounting for hunting selectivity and demographic fluctuations can be of general relevance for harvested species in stochastic environments.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of infrared thermography (IRT) to be used for the in situ clinical assessment of udder health status across lactation in goats. Two epidemiological studies were designed, with 106 purebred Skopelos goats being prospectively monitored over one lactation in the first study and 132 goats of the same breed from a second farm being enrolled in the second, cross-sectional study. Goats were categorized based on the clinical status of each udder half (healthy, fibrotic, both fibrotic and asymmetric, asymmetric, swollen supra-mammary lymph nodes, and abscessed). Skin surface temperature values of teats (TSST) and udder halves (USST), as well as temperature variations between different types of abscesses, based on the stage of their development (superficial developed, superficial fully mature, drained), and the symmetrical sites of the non-affected udder halves, were evaluated. Mixed linear regression analyses indicated that fibrosis, particularly when accompanied by asymmetry, resulted in a decrease of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.3 degrees C (p < 0.05) and of 0.6, 0.9, and 1.4 degrees C (p < 0.001) in the maximum, mean, and minimum USST, respectively. Recording season significantly affected USST and TSST (p < 0.001), with both of them increasing between February and August. Additionally, TSST appeared to be an unreliable indicator of udder health status, while abscesses exhibited distinct temperature patterns based on their developmental stage. It is concluded that IRT has the potential to be used on site for the detection of temperature alterations associated with chronic udder health issues, yet future studies on a larger and more diverse population of goats with various udder health conditions is needed to confirm its extensive applicability under real-world conditions.

AB  - A total of 35 male roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) from Lugo province (north-western Spain) were examined for pedicle myiasis between 2020 and 2022. All these animals had died by different causes and were examined or preserved just after their death to avoid post-mortem infestations. After external and internal head inspection, five animals were diagnosed with severe myiasis at the basis of the antlers (14.29%; 95% confidence interval = 5.38-31.04). All the affected bucks presented a cutaneous wound (1.5-15 cm in diameter) around the pedicles with extensive tissue destruction, exposition of frontal and parietal bones, and massive infestation by dipteran larvae (2-12 mm long). Four of five roe deer showed whitish egg clusters adhered to the basis of the antlers. Moreover, in one animal, six larvae had penetrated the cranial cavity, and in two of them larvae were also found in the nasopharyngeal cavity. All the cases were recorded in summer (May-August). Morphological identification and subsequent molecular confirmation revealed that all animals were infested by different larval stages of Lucilia caesar (Diptera: Calliphoridae). This study represents the first report of pedicle myiasis in Spain. Since this disease is reported sporadically, the detection of five cases in a short period of time suggests an increase in the incidence of this myiasis.

AB  - C. tetracocca are local characteristic plants with significant medicinal and economic values. However, little is known about the relationship of soil nutrient contents and the accumulation of primary and secondary metabolites from C. tetracocca. The metabolic accumulation of C. tetracocca grown in karst areas and non karst areas have not been compared. In this study, we sampled soil and leaves of C. tetracocca in karst areas and non karst areas to compare the relationship between soil nutrients (soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, calcium, magnesium) and organic components (organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, calcium, magnesium), free amino acids, functional components (catechin (C), caffeine (CAFF), gallic acid (GA), epicatechin (EC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) of C. tetracocca. The results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between K and EC in soil and plants and a significant negative correlation between P and EC. There was a negative correlation between Mg and EGC in soil and plants. Therefore, increasing the content of K and reducing the content of Mg and P can improve the functional components of C. tetracocca. The C. tetracocca in karst areas and non karst areas share excellent quality and have not been severely affected by the harsh environment. Therefore, these findings emphasized the significance of ancient tea trees and laid a solid foundation for the promotion and planting of C. tetracocca.

This study aims to map A. obtusifolia distribution in Ujung Kulon using PRISMA hyperspectral imagery and MESMA (Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis). 38 spectra samples for the A. obtusifolia, sand, wetland vegetation and other vegetation were collected, and optimized using the IES (Iterative Endmember Selection), Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and Automated MUsic and Spectral Separability based Endmember Selection (AMUSES) algorithms. Here, different schemes of MESMA were tested by using spectral weighting (SPEC) and stable zone unmixing (STABLE). Our results demonstrated that MESMA and PRISMA data was able to identify A. obtusifolia with the accuracy ranging from 55.36 (AMUSES-STABLE) to 83.93% (MUSIC-STABLE). Our results indicated the potential of MESMA and PRISMA hyperspectral data using optimized spectra from MUSIC and stable zone unmixing for mapping invasive A. obtusifolia.

AB  - Despite the known persistence and bioaccumulation potential of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), much uncertainty exists regarding their bioavailability in the terrestrial environment. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of soil characteristics and PFAS concentrations on the adsorption of PFAS to soil and their influence on the PFAS bioavailability to terrestrial plants and invertebrates. PFAS concentrations and profile were compared among different invertebrate and plant species and differences between leaves and fruits/nuts of the plant species were assessed. Soil concentrations were primarily affected by organic carbon content. The PFAS accumulation in biota was, except for PFOA concentrations in nettles, unrelated to the soil concentrations, as well as to the soil characteristics. The PFAS profiles in soil and invertebrates were mainly dominated by PFOA and PFOS, whereas short-chained PFAS were more abundant in plant tissues. Our results show that different invertebrate taxa accumulate different PFAS, likely due to dietary differences. Both long-chained and, to lesser extent, short-chained PFAS were observed in herbivorous invertebrate taxa, whereas the carnivorous invertebrates only accumulated long-chained PFAS. Correlations were observed between PFOA concentrations in herbivorous invertebrates and in the leaves of some plant species, whereas such relationships were absent for the carnivorous spiders. It is essential to continuously monitor PFAS exposure in terrestrial organisms, taking into account differences in bioaccumulation, and subsequent potential toxicity, among taxa, in order to protect the terrestrial ecosystem.

AB  - Feeding for most animals involves bouts of active ingestion alternating with bouts of no ingestion. In insects, the temporal patterning of bouts varies widely with resource quality and is known to affect growth, development time, and fitness. However, the precise impacts of resource quality and feeding behavior on insect life history traits are poorly understood. To explore and better understand the connections between feeding behavior, resource quality, and insect life history traits, we combined laboratory experiments with a recently proposed mechanistic model of insect growth and development for a larval herbivore, Manduca sexta. We ran feeding trials for 4th and 5th instar larvae across different diet types (two hostplants and artificial diet) and used these data to parameterize a joint model of age and mass at maturity that incorporates both insect feeding behavior and hormonal activity. We found that the estimated durations of both feeding and nonfeeding bouts were significantly shorter on low-quality than on high-quality diets. We then explored how well the fitted model predicted historical out-of-sample data on age and mass of M. sexta. We found that the model accurately described qualitative outcomes for the out-of-sample data, notably that a low-quality diet results in reduced mass and later age at maturity compared with high-quality diets. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of diet quality on multiple components of insect feeding behavior (feeding and nonfeeding) and partially validate a joint model of insect life history. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to insect herbivory and discuss ways in which our model could be improved or extended to other systems.

AB  - Herbivorous pests and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) coexist on the same host plant, having an indirect effect on one another. We established an experiment in a randomised complete block design with four treatments and six replications to examine the impact of AMF on the population and the damage caused to plane trees by the leafhopper Zyginella pulchra. Manure, manure plus fertiliser, manure plus fertiliser plus AMF, and non-inoculated plants (control) were all of the treatments. The findings revealed that while the nutritional content and soluble carbohydrate content were significantly enhanced by all treatments, they largely reached their peak in the AMF-inoculated plants. When compared to control trees that were not inoculated, the concentrations of N, P, and Zn were boosted by 39%, 81%, and 425%, respectively. AMF inoculation increased the population of Z. pulchra nymphs and adults compared to the control. However, the plants with AMF inoculation eventually suffered greater leaf loss as a result of this rise in the pest population. The findings show that while AMF enhance nutrient absorption and are necessary to improve the nutritional state of the host trees, they also enhance the absorption of pests that are thought to be harmful to plane trees. However, AMF colonisation improved the potential attractiveness of Z. pulchra to plane trees.

AB  - Minerals are among the important nutritional components that are indispensable for animals. In particular, the acquisition of sodium is important for plant-feeding animals because sodium may be deficient for these animals as plants do not need sodium. This study compiled data on the mineral contents of leaves in 28 forests in Japan, with special emphasis on the effect of distance from the sea and bedrock type. The aim of this study was to provide basic data on mineral availability for forest-dwelling folivores, which provide important baseline data for understanding the mineral acquisition strategy of plant-feeding animals. Sodium and phosphorus contents of live leaves were lower than the levels required for folivores (captive non-human primates and ungulates). The effect of the distance from the sea was evident only for magnesium and sodium. The sodium content of live leaves was high enough to satisfy folivores' requirements at only a few hundred meters from the sea. The live leaves in forests growing on sedimentary bedrocks contained more minerals than those on granite/rhyolite. Seasonality was also evident based on repeated sampling at three study sites. The mineral contents of dead leaves at the three study sites showed similar inter-site and inter-season variations to those of live leaves. Phosphorus and potassium contents in dead leaves were consistently lower and iron content was consistently higher than in live leaves.
   Data on the mineral contents of leaves in the 28 forests in Japan indicated the sodium and phosphorus contents of live leaves were lower than the levels required for folivores. Sodium and magnesium contents decreased with increasing distance from the sea and bedrock type also affected mineral contents. image

AB  - BACKGROUND: Goat milk has balanced nutritional composition, is conducive to digestion and absorption, and does not easily lead to allergic reactions. However, the special goaty flavor in milk has seriously affected consumer acceptance. It is imperative to alleviate the goaty flavor in a safe and efficient way.
   RESULTS: This study indicated that the supplementation of 6 g kg(-1) beta-cyclodextrin or 8 g kg(-1) lactitol in goat milk significantly alleviated goaty flavor and improved sensory characteristics. Furthermore, the supplementation of beta-cyclodextrin and lactitol had a synergistic effect in reducing the content of free fatty acids that cause goaty flavor. The content of caproic acid (C6H12O2), octanoic acid (C8H6O2), and decanoic acid (C10H20O2) decreased by 42.46%, 39.45%, and 46.41%, respectively, after a combined group was supplemented with 6 g kg(-1) beta-cyclodextrin and 7 g kg(-1) lactitol, which was significantly lower than in groups given beta-cyclodextrin or lactitol individually.
   CONCLUSION: This study provides a novel and effective approach to alleviate goaty flavor and promote the competitiveness of goat milk products. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Predation has direct effects on prey population dynamics through mortality, and it can induce indirect effects through fear. The indirect effects of predation have been documented experimentally, but few studies have quantified them in nature so that their role in prey population dynamics remains controversial. Given the expanding or reintroduced populations of large predators in many areas, the quantification of indirect effects of predation is crucial. We sought to evaluate the direct and indirect fitness effects of intense cougar (Puma concolor) predation using 48 years of data on marked bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) on Ram Mountain, Alberta, Canada. We compared years of intense cougar predation with years with no or occasional cougar predation. We first quantified the effects of predation on neonatal, weaning, and overwinter lamb survival, three metrics potentially affected by direct and indirect effects. We then investigated the possible indirect effects of intense cougar predation on lamb production, female summer mass gain, and lamb mass at weaning. We found strong effects of cougar predation on lamb survival, lamb production, and seasonal mass gain of lambs and adult females. In years with high predation, neonatal, weaning, and overwinter lamb survival declined by 18.4%, 19.7% and 20.8%, respectively. Indirect effects included a 14.2% decline in lamb production. Female summer mass gain decreased by 15.6% and lamb mass at weaning declined by 8.0% in years of intense cougar predation. Our findings bring key insights on the impacts of predation on prey fitness by reporting moderate to large effects on recruitment and illustrate the importance of indirect effects of predation on population dynamics.

AB  - Kyphosids are conspicuous members of temperate and tropical reef fish communities. Some species contribute to commercial and recreational fisheries but are vulnerable to capture in large numbers due to their schooling behaviour and site fidelity. Previous ageing studies of kyphosids have determined that some species are long-lived, with maximum ages >40 years, which is a trait often associated with low natural mortality rates. Kyphosus sydneyanus is one of the largest kyphosids and has historically been caught in large numbers as a bycatch species in the demersal gillnet fishery in southern Western Australia. A large K. sydneyanus specimen was collected from that fishery in March 2021. A count of the growth (opaque) zones in the sectioned otoliths were used to determine that the age of this individual was 93 years, more than double the previous maximum age of a Kyphosus species and the longest-lived coastal species in southern Australia.

AB  - Using various forms of enrichment, animal care specialists encourage species-specific behaviors and discourage stereotypic behaviors. Within the zoo community, bears (Ursids spp.) are commonly housed, yet are prone to exhibiting stress-related behaviors. Here, we assess the effect of access to multiple habitats, including areas of off guest view, on the welfare of two American black bears (U. americanus) housed at the North Carolina Zoo. In this study, we looked at two behaviors, pacing and foraging to represent negative and positive welfare indicators. We performed logistic regressions to model the effect of access on these behaviors. Because having an animal visible to guests is important to consider when creating management plans, we also explored the effect of access on the bears' visibility. We found that full access reduced the likelihood of pacing by an average of 13% and increased the likelihood of foraging by an average of 5%. Access to multiple areas reduced the probability of visibility by 57% for one individual but did not impact visibility of the other bear. This case study suggests the value of access to zoo animal welfare and should incite future research aimed at exploring the effects of access on various behavioral outcomes.

AB  - While native species' interactions underlie coevolution, non-native species might benefit from their novel cues and a lack of recognition, resulting in potential competition advantages in interactions. In predator-predator interactions for example, non-native predators bearing novel cues might experience reduced interference. However, non-native predators might experience similar interference if their cues are similar to those of native predators, such as in congeneric species. Here, we studied aggressive re-sponses by ants towards several native and non-native lady beetles, and in turn compared the responses of these lady beetle species to ants. We expected strongest ant aggression towards coevolved native North American lady beetles, intermediate aggression towards non-native, congeneric lady beetles (due to potential cue similarities) and least aggression towards the non-native Harmonia axyridis. A similar ranking was expected for the lady beetle responses to ants. Furthermore, we analysed cuticular hydro-carbons (CHCs) of all lady beetle species and tested for similarities of CHCs between congeneric native and non-native species in the genera Coccinella and Hippodamia. Overall, similar ant aggression towards different lady beetle species could not be attributed only to cue similarities between them, suggesting that ants might additionally respond to different defensive traits of lady beetles. Surprisingly, we found CHC similarities not only between congeneric native and non-native lady beetles, but also between non-native H. axyridis and both Hippodamia species. Despite similar ant aggression, reaction behaviour of the native Coleomegilla maculata was relatively strong compared to that of non-native lady beetles, sug-gesting a low tolerance towards ant attacks. In particular, during times of food scarcity, non-native lady beetle species that are tolerated by ants might have an advantage over less-tolerated native lady beetles. Future field studies on ant-lady beetle-aphid interactions are required to shed light on ant tolerance and competitive advantages of non-native lady beetle species.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The pelvis plays an active role in weight bearing and countering the ground reaction forces incurred by the hindlimbs thus making it a critical component of the locomotor skeleton. Accordingly, this anatomical region is theoretically ideal for inferring locomotor behavior from both external skeletal morphology and trabecular microarchitecture, with the latter possibly offering nuanced insights into the mechanical loading environment given its increased plasticity and higher turnover rate. However, trabecular microarchitecture is also known to be influenced by a variety of factors including body size, sex, age, genetic regulation, diet and activity level, that collectively hinder the ability to generate consistent functional inferences. In this study, a comparative sample of mammals (42 species spanning four orders) of varying sizes, yet comparable locomotor repertoires, were evaluated to determine the effects of body size, phylogeny and locomotion on hipbone trabecular microarchitecture. This study found a weak functional signal detected in differences in bone volume fraction and the degree of anisotropy across certain pre-assigned locomotor categories, while confirming previously recognized allometric scaling trends reported for other mammalian samples based on the femur. Within primates, a more anisotropic pattern was observed for quadrupedal species attributed to their repetitive loading regimes and stereotypical limb excursions, while isotropic values were revealed for taxa utilizing more varied arboreal repertoires. Humans, despite a frequent and predictable loading environment associated with their use of bipedalism, showed relatively isotropic values. This study highlights the confounding factors that influence trabecular microarchitecture and consequently limit its utility as a method for investigating locomotor adaptation.

AB  - Recently, nanomaterials have received considerable attention in the agricultural sector, due to their distinctive characteristics such as small size, high surface area to volume ratio, and charged surface. These properties allow nanomaterials to be utilized as nanofertilizers, that can improve crop nutrient management and reduce environmental nutrient losses. However, after soil application, metallic nanoparticles have been shown to be toxic to soil biota and their associated ecosystem services. The organic nature of nanobiochar (nanoB) may help to overcome this toxicity while maintaining all the beneficial effects of nanomaterials. We aimed to synthesize nanoB from goat manure and utilize it with CuO nanoparticles (nanoCu) to influence soil microbes, nutrient content, and wheat productivity. An X-ray diffractogram (XRD) confirmed nanoB synthesis (crystal size = 20 nm). The XRD spectrum showed a distinct carbon peak at 2 theta = 42.9 degrees. Fourier-transform spectroscopy of nanoB's surface indicated the presence of C=O, C equivalent to N-R, and C=C bonds, and other functional groups. The electron microscopic micrographs of nanoB showed cubical, pentagonal, needle, and spherical shapes. NanoB and nanoCu were applied alone and as a mixture at the rate of 1000 mg kg(-1) soil, to pots where wheat crop was grown. NanoCu did not influence any soil or plant parameters except soil Cu content and plant Cu uptake. The soil and wheat Cu content in the nanoCu treatment were 146 and 91% higher, respectively, than in the control. NanoB increased microbial biomass N, mineral N, and plant available P by 57, 28, and 64%, respectively, compared to the control. The mixture of nanoB and nanoCu further increased these parameters, by 61, 18, and 38%, compared to nanoB or nanoCu alone. Consequently, wheat biological, grain yields, and N uptake were 35, 62 and 80% higher in the nanoB+nanoCu treatment compared to the control. NanoB further increased wheat Cu uptake by 37% in the nanoB+nanoCu treatment compared to the nanoCu alone. Hence, nanoB alone, or in a mixture with nanoCu, enhanced soil microbial activity, nutrient content, and wheat production. NanoB also increased wheat Cu uptake when mixed with nanoCu, a micronutrient essential for seed and chlorophyll production. Therefore, a mixture of nanobiochar and nanoCu would be recommended to farmers for improving their clayey loam soil quality and increasing Cu uptake and crop productivity in such agroecosystems.

AB  - Animals have evolved highly effective locomotion capabilities in terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic environments. Over life's history, mass extinctions have wiped out unique animal species with specialized adaptations, leaving paleontologists to reconstruct their locomotion through fossil analysis. Despite advancements, little is known about how extinct megafauna, such as the Ichthyosauria one of the most successful lineages of marine reptiles, utilized their varied morphologies for swimming. Traditional robotics struggle to mimic extinct locomotion effectively, but the emerging soft robotics field offers a promising alternative to overcome this challenge. This paper aims to bridge this gap by studying Mixosaurus locomotion with soft robotics, combining material modeling and biomechanics in physical experimental validation. Combining a soft body with soft pneumatic actuators, the soft robotic platform described in this study investigates the correlation between asymmetrical fins and buoyancy by recreating the pitch torque generated by extinct swimming animals. We performed a comparative analysis of thrust and torque generated by Carthorhyncus, Utatsusaurus, Mixosaurus, Guizhouichthyosaurus, and Ophthalmosaurus tail fins in a flow tank. Experimental results suggest that the pitch torque on the torso generated by hypocercal fin shapes such as found in model systems of Guizhouichthyosaurus, Mixosaurus and Utatsusaurus produce distinct ventral body pitch effects able to mitigate the animal's non-neutral buoyancy. This body pitch control effect is particularly pronounced in Guizhouichthyosaurus, which results suggest would have been able to generate high ventral pitch torque on the torso to compensate for its positive buoyancy. By contrast, homocercal fin shapes may not have been conducive for such buoyancy compensation, leaving torso pitch control to pectoral fins, for example. Across the range of the actuation frequencies of the caudal fins tested, resulted in oscillatory modes arising, which in turn can affect the for-aft thrust generated.

AB  - Simple Summary Wild boar (WB) originate in southeastern Asia. With the migration of WBs into the European continent, their domestication started as early as the Neolithic period. With the continuous domestication and considering people's different needs for pork, many local WB breeds with their own characteristics appeared on European land. In this article, the whole genome files of 10 local WB and 38 domestic local breeds (1098 individuals in total) were screened in terms of genetic differences in metabolism, disease, and temperament by genome-wide association scan selection signals. Moreover, the geographical distribution and historical events of the different breeds were combined to confirm the wide genetic contribution of WB to the domestication process. The results of this study will provide a reference on the metabolism and emotionality between European WBs and domestic pigs. The phenotypic characteristics of existing domestic pigs (DPs) greatly differ from those of wild boar (WB) populations thousands of years ago. After thousands of years of human domestication, WB and DP have diverged greatly in terms of genetics. Theoretically, worldwide local pigs have independent contributions from their local WBs at the beginning of Sus scrofa domestication. The investigation of the vicissitude of the heredity material between domestic populations and their wild ancestors will help in further understanding the domestication history of domestic animals. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide association scan (GWSA) and phylogeny estimation with a total of 1098 public European Illumina 60K single nucleotide polymorphism data, which included 650 local DPs and 448 WBs. The results revealed that the phylogenetic relationship of WBs corresponds to their geographical distribution and carries large divergence with DPs, and all WB breeds (e.g., HRWB, SBWB, and TIWB) presents a closely linkage with the middle WB (e.g., HRWB, and PLWB). In addition, 64 selected candidate genes (e.g., IDH2, PIP5K1B, SMARCA2, KIF5C, and TJP2) were identified from GWSA. A total of 63 known multiple biological functional pathways were annotated by 22 genes, and ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis pathways that belong to the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were significantly enriched (p < 0.05). The most frequent (28.57%) pathways were classified under metabolism. We confirmed that the middle European WB has made an important genetic contribution to the entire European WB populations. A series of selected genes discovered from this study provides the scientific community with a deeper understanding of the heredity performance of metabolism and emotion and the real purpose behind domestication.

AB  - While quantitative studies are robust at assessing the extent of climate change adaptation, and statistical relationships among variables involved, qualitative studies are also essential to understand the social rationales underlying relationships among variables, and to identify the roles of variables that have been overlooked or are hard to measure. This study investigates factors that influence the adoption of climate resilient agricultural practices by resource-poor Giriama farmers in southeast Kenya, with a view to understanding why some smallholders from this cultural group adopt climate resilient practices, while others do not. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with 30 farmers, 15 of whom had adopted climate resilient farming practices recommended by agricultural experts, and 15 of whom had not adopted any of those practices. The adopters were market-oriented, and tended to have individual land tenure, higher levels of experience in farming, slightly larger farm sizes, middle to high school education levels, and be younger. They had access to agricultural extension, access to farm inputs, and their off-farm activities tended to be related to agricultural supply chains. Non-adopters farmed entirely for subsistence, on communal or leased land, had less formal education, and adhered strongly to cultural beliefs and practices. Their off-farm income was unrelated to agriculture. More of the adopters were males, while many of the non-adopters were female. Particular cultural practices and taboos inhibited the adoption of several of the climate resilient practices, such as planting hybrid maize, keeping dairy goats, using improved goats such as the Kenyan Alpine for breeding purposes and the use of water conservation structures for crop production. Further, the qualitative information explains how and why factors such as land ownership, gender, culture, and access to information are interrelated, in ways that are not necessarily obvious in statistical analysis. The study thus highlights issues that need to be considered in conceptual frameworks underpinning both quantitative and qualitative studies, and particularly how they interact, in order to provide the knowledge essential to policy and programs intended to enhance smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity.

AB  - Bipedal hopping is a mode of locomotion seen today in four rodent lineages and one clade of marsupials. The Argyrolagidae, marsupials from the Oligocene to Pliocene of South America, have also been considered to be hoppers. These lineages all convergently evolved similar general morphologies, with elongated hindlimbs, reduced forelimbs, and elongated tails, and their similarities and variations may be informative in understanding the evolution of hopping in mammals. This study uses principal components analysis and log-log regressions to investigate variation in the hindlimb proportions of these hopping mammals and how this relates to body mass. We find that the distribution of hopping mammal masses is bimodal, divided at roughly 500 g. These two domains among hopping mammals may reflect optimisation for different forms of hopping locomotion; species under 500 g tend to have more elongated metatarsals relative to the rest of their hindlimbs, perhaps to facilitate rapid vertical jumps for predator evasion, a behaviour not seen in larger hoppers. Despite this bimodal distribution in body mass, hindlimb proportions cluster more by clade than mass, with some similarities among clades being especially noteworthy. The jerboas (Dipodidae, Rodentia) and Argyrolagidae share a particularly extreme degree of metatarsal elongation. The drivers of this convergence are unclear, but we hypothesise that the elongation may be related to the reduction/fusion of metatarsals in these groups, or a greater reliance on bipedality at slow speeds, as jerboas are known to utilise multiple bipedal gaits in addition to hopping.

AB  - Nitrogen-fixing tree species (NFTs) have been widely planted in mixed plantations to increase ecosystem available N. However, it is not clear whether symbiotic nitrogen fixation by NFTs, interspecific N transfer in mixed plantations, and the factors that affect them vary under different soil water conditions in semiarid regions. Therefore, symbiotic N fixation by Hippophae rhamnoides and N transfer from H. rhamnoides to Populus tomentosa in a mixed plantation were detected by the N-15 dilution method in 2019 (drier year) and 2020 (normal year) on the Loess Plateau, China. This study also measured the leaf net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of these plantation species. The daily net photosynthetic rate (A(ndaily)), the percentage N derived from atmospheric (%Ndfa) and the N fixed amount (NFA) for H. rhamnoides was significantly lower in 2019 than in 2020 (P < 0.05). Drought also significantly decreased the percentage N transferred (P-transfer) and the N transferred amount (NTA) from H. rhamnoides to P. tomentosa, although there was no significant difference in A(ndaily) for P. tomentosa in the mixed plantation between 2019 and 2020. In addition, %Ndfa and NFA were significantly and positively correlated with A(ndaily) for H. rhamnoides in the mixed plantation in both 2019 and 2020. However, P-transfer and NTA from H. rhamnoides to P. tomentosa were significantly and positively correlated with %Ndfa for H. rhamnoides and with A(ndaily) for P. tomentosa in the mixed plantation in 2020 but not in 2019. The results suggested that drought decreased both symbiotic N fixation ability and N transfer and that N transfer was also associated with the symbiotic N fixation ability of NFTs.

AB  - The Context Preexposure Facilitation Effect (CPFE) is a variant of contextual fear conditioning in which learning about the context, acquiring a context-shock association, and retrieval of this association occur separately across three phases (context preexposure, immediate-shock training, and retention). We have shown that prefrontal inactivation or muscarinic-receptor antagonism prior to any phase disrupts retention test freezing during the CPFE in adolescent rats (Heroux et al., 2017; Robinson-Drummer et al., 2017). Furthermore, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is the only region in which robust learning-related expression of the immediate early genes c-Fos, Arc, Egr-1 and Npas4 is observed during immediate-shock training in the CPFE (Asok et al., 2013; Heroux et al., 2018; Schreiber et al., 2014). However, the role of prefrontal NMDA-receptor plasticity in supporting preexposure- and training-day processes of the CPFE is not known. Therefore, the current study examined the effects of intra-mPFC infusion of the NMDA-receptor antagonist MK-801 or saline vehicle prior to context pre-exposure (Experiment 1) or immediate-shock training (Experiment 2) in adolescent Long-Evans male and female rats. This infusion given prior to context preexposure but not training abolished retention test freezing, with no difference between MK-801-infused rats and non-associative controls preexposed to an alternative context (pooled across drug). These results demonstrate a role of prefrontal NMDA-receptor plasticity in the acquisition and/or consolidation of incidental context learning (i.e., encoded in the absence of reinforcement). In contrast, this plasticity is not required for context retrieval, or acquisition, expression, or consolidation of a context-shock association during immediate-shock training in the CPFE. These experiments add to a growing body of work implicating the mPFC in Pavlovian contextual fear conditioning processes in rodents.

AB  - Simple Summary Eurasian wild boars (Sus scrofa) are species of interest to continuously study and monitor diseases due to their abundance, consumption, and their role as zoonotic disease reservoirs. To the authors' knowledge, there is a lack of health assessments in this particular area of Spain, which represented an opportunity for this assessment. This study aims to report and interpret some histopathological findings (from the lung, liver, and kidney) in wild boars from different areas of Castile and Leon (Spain) to evaluate the health status of this population. Parasitic pneumonia (34.7%) in the lungs and cellular alterations (33.3%) in the liver are some of the most common and relevant lesions found. Further research and other diagnostic tests are needed to have definitive diagnoses or to estimate zoonotic disease prevalence. Wild boars are wild ungulates with a wide distribution in Europe, with a relevant role in wildlife and public health. In Spain, high (and sometimes artificial) densities of wild boars are responsible for several health problems. Regular surveys, with hunters' collaboration, are crucial to monitor these diseases. Histological analyses were performed for lung, liver, and kidneys from 72 wild boars (58 from Zamora, 16 from Palencia). Lungs were the most affected organs, mainly revealing parasitic pneumonia (34.7%). Hydropic, vacuolar, and other cellular changes (33.3%) and congestion (16.7%) were found in the liver, and only 30.6% of the wild boars presented no alterations in this organ. Regarding the kidney, non-purulent nephritis (22.2%) was the most common lesion. This study gives an overview of the health status of wild boar populations in Castile and Leon. Other laboratory analyses are needed to obtain definitive diagnoses of these lesions, reach other conclusions, or apply any mitigation strategies to protect animals' or consumers' health.

AB  - The gross composition of milk may affect the textural, compositional and microbiological properties of yoghurt. Sahiwal, Holstein Friesian milk procured from Dairy Animal Training and Research Center, B -block University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Pattoki and Nili Ravi buffalo milk procured from Nili Ravi buffalo Research Institute (BRI), Pattoki. All other ingredients purchased from Sigma Aldrich Germany through local suppliers. Milk was standardized to 15% total solids with 3.5% fat. Skim Milk Powder (SMP) was used for the standardization of the yogurt. Milk was pasteurized at 82 o C for 5 minutes and cool down to 43 o C and at this temperature starter culture was added. Yogurt batch incubated at 43 o C for 3 to 3.5 h. During this period pH was monitored regularly and as the pH drops to 4.6, the batch was shifted to blast chilling at 1-2 o C and then stored at 4 o C. Sensory evaluation of all yogurt samples was carried out on a 9 -point hedonic scale. All the tests were carried out on day 0, 7, 14 and 21. The collected data was investigated through ANOVA technique under complete randomized design (CRD) using SAS 9.1 software. The results showed that yoghurt made from Nili Ravi buffalo milk (T o ) showed a significant ( p >= 0.5) overall acceptability as compared to other treatments. Yoghurt made from Nili Ravi buffalo milk (T o ) were followed by T 3 , T 4 , T 1 and T 5 respectively. The Nili Ravi buffalo milk showed higher acceptability to the consumers.

AB  - Subterranean termites (Family Rhinotermitidae) and drywood termites (Family Kalotermitidae) can be pest species as they have the potential to inflict damage to wooden constructions and can therefore cause a significant economic impact. Some species of these families are highly destructive and are invasive in many parts of the world. New introductions and/or the spread of termites are often caused by import of infested wood, plants or soils. The present study reports the first records of three exotic termite species in Belgium, viz. Cryptotermes brevis and Reticulitermes banyulensis in Brussels (Brussels Capital Region), and Reticulitermes flavipes in Brugelette (Hainaut province; Walloon region). The morphological identification of the specimens (N = 8) was validated by DNA-barcoding. Cryptotermes brevis and Reticulitermes banyulensis infestations are probably of little concern as local climatological conditions make it unlikely for either species to survive in the temperate climate in Belgium. In contrast, it is likely that Reticulitermes flavipes may become established and will spread to other sites in Belgium.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, serological and molecular assays in 55 pigs in Sicily were conducted in order to investigate Leptospira spp. prevalence and to carry out strain characterization. A seropositivity rate of 16.4% was determined; 3.64% of kidney samples tested positive for pathogenic Leptospiral DNA. Obtained data showed that Leptospira infection is common among pigs in southern Italy, confirming the importance of Leptospiral infection in pigs and reaffirming the potential role of these animals as a source of infection for humans (occupational risk) and other animals. Our study delivers a comprehensive overview based on up-to-date data to deepen the knowledge of swine leptospiral infections, characterize new potential emerging strains, and reinforce control measures able to reduce the infection risk in swine herds. Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonosis of worldwide significance; a wide spectrum of wild and domestic animal species act as natural or accidental hosts. Swine can act as maintenance or accidental hosts of pathogenic Leptospira spp. This study aimed at investigation of Leptospira spp. prevalence and diversity in slaughtered pigs in southern Italy (Sicily). In total, 55 samples of kidneys and blood were collected. Microscopic agglutination test and real-time PCR were performed to detect pathogenic and intermediately pathogenic Leptospira. Partial rpoB gene sequencing and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were performed to characterize Leptospira species. The analysis showed a seropositivity rate of 16.4%, with Australis representing the most frequently identified serogroup (63.64%); Pomona and Sejroe were detected with a prevalence of 27.27% and 9.09%, respectively. Pathogenic Leptospiral DNA was detected in 2 kidney samples (3.64%). Leptospira were identified through MLST as L. borgpetersenii serovar Tarassovi (serogroup Tarassovi). Obtained data confirmed the presence of Leptospira infection among pigs in southern Italy, suggesting that management of these animals may be considered an occupational risk for humans.

AB  - Bethuadahari Wildlife Sanctuary (23 degrees 35 ' N, 88 degrees 23 ' E), situated in the Nadia district of West Bengal, India, is a habitat for various herbivores, notably the spotted deer (Axis axis). However, the sanctuary faces challenges due to invasive species like Polyalthia suberosa, which diminish grazing lands by outcompeting with local vegetation. This study focused on a fungal strain isolated from P. suberosa branches within the sanctuary. The fungus sourced from P. suberosa branches was examined for its enzymatic capabilities. This strain exhibited ligninolytic and cellulolytic activities, indicating its potential impact on P. suberosa. The fungus was inoculated onto P. suberosa wood to confirm the host-pathogen interaction, resulting in a substantial 47.6% weight loss over six weeks. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the extent of damage inflicted by the fungus on the wood. Molecular analysis identified the fungus as Lasiodiplodia theobromae through ITS region sequencing, marking the first documented association between P. suberosa and this pathogen, indicating that L. theobromae could have a potential role as a biocontrol agent against P. suberosa, offering a promising solution to mitigate its impact on Bethuadahari Wildlife Sanctuary's grazing lands.

Results: There was a significant (P < 0.05) reduction of Pb, Cr, and Cd concentration observed in different animal dung such as cow, buffalo and goat dung with sewage sludge in ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 before and after vermicomposting. Cr was significantly decreased in cow dung (CD) and goat dung (GD) and Cd in cow dung (CD) and cow dung with sewage sludge (CD+ SS, 1:1) the at BDL level whereas the concentration of Pb significantly decreased by 76.470% in the combination of GD+ SS (1:1). The Cr and Cd were significantly increased in the body of E. fetida 3.384% and 11.801%, respectively, in the combination of CD+ SS (1:3) whereas Pb significantly increase by 23.018% in the combination of BD+SS (1:3). Conclusion: E. fetida is a suitable species for the accumulation of heavy metals such as Pb, Cr, and Cd in different vermibeds during vermicomposting and plays an important role in the remediation of heavy metals from animal dung with sewage sludge. Vermibiotechnology is a useful technique for the management of heavy metals.

AB  - The pig farming industry in China has undergone a transformation, shifting from the traditional decentralized breeding model to the current intensive farming model. The characteristics of large-scale, intensive and high- density pig farming impose even stricter requirements on ventilation, which not only enable a suitable thermal environment for pigs, but also efficiently and effectively remove pollutants and prevent cross-infection. Due to the inherent disadvantages of traditional tunnel ventilation such as uneven indoor temperature, low aircooling effect and cumulative effect of pollutants, an individual ventilation system referred to as targeted ventilation was proposed and numerically investigated in this study. The farrowing pen volume-averaged temperature, relative humidity and air velocity were applied to assess the thermal environment based on the recently developed Equivalent Temperature Index for Sows (ETIS). Moreover, the Discrete Phase Model (DPM) was used to simulate the indoor dynamic bioaerosol dispersion and deposition. Based on the results from this study, it was demonstrated that under the targeted ventilation the upstream flow and bioaerosols had limited impacts on the downstream pens, indicating a better micro-environment for the pigs from both environmental uniformity and bio-security perspectives. Furthermore, under the same thermal comfort of ETIS, the targeted ventilation rate could be reduced up to 77.9% compared with that of tunnel ventilation, considerably saving air supply load and the related energy consumption. This study provides new insights into the advantages of individual ventilation on improving thermal environments, minimizing airborne cross-infection and increasing ventilation efficacy in farrowing houses, thus contributing to achieving safe and sustainable production in pig farming.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe situation of microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems is becoming increasingly severe. This study developed a polyethylene (PE) microplastic-contaminated soil-Ulmus pumila-Hyphantria cunea larvae food chain model to investigate the ecotoxicological impacts of soil microplastic pollution from the perspective of pest occurrence and pest control.RESULTSAfter feeding on PE-treated U. pumila leaves, the body weight, body length, head capsule width and nutrient content of H. cunea larvae were significantly reduced, accompanied by disrupted expression levels of growth regulatory genes. PE stress significantly reduced the content of nutrients and chlorophyll in U. pumila leaves and inhibited the expression of key genes in glucose and amino acid metabolism pathways. PE treatment also significantly reduced the content of secondary metabolites (flavonoids and total phenolics) and the expression levels of key genes in the flavonoid synthesis pathway (e.g., FLS and CHS) in the leaves. The combined treatment of PE and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) significantly increased the mortality and weight inhibition rate of H. cunea larvae in a synergistic manner. The combined treatment of PE and Bt aggravated the breakdown of innate immunity in larvae, including cellular and humoral immunity. PE and Bt combined treatment significantly increased the expression of apoptosis genes in larval midgut, as well as decreased the nutrient content and energy metabolism gene expression levels of larvae compared with Bt treatment alone.CONCLUSIONMicroplastic pollution reduces the defense of U. pumila against H. cunea larvae in a self-damaging manner, and Bt proves effective for controlling H. cunea larvae in microplastic-contaminated environments.

AB  - The current study records a new distributional range for Elysia cf. leucolegnote Jensen, 1990, which was previously reported only from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. The collection was carried out in the mangroves of Kali Estuary situated in Karnataka (14 degrees 50(y)55.27 '' N, 74 degrees 9(y)44.04 '' E & 14 degrees 50(y)16.36 '' N, 74 degrees 10(y)8.81 '' E), southwest coast of India. Prior studies had documented the distribution of this species in the tropical West Pacific and East Indian Oceans; this study reports the first record of E. cf. leucolegnote in the Northwestern Indian Ocean, expanding its documentation of a wider distribution range. The species was first discovered in Hong Kong and described in 1990. It was identified by its distinctive morphological characteristics, which featured black eyes situated proximally at the base of the rhinophores and a flattened, generally green body with a distinct white border line along the rhinophores and parapodia.

AB  - Simple Summary: Oleanolic acid is an organic natural compound, abundant in olive leaves, with various beneficial health effects in humans and animals. However, its in vivo efficacy is questioned given its low solubility, which hinders its bioavailability, that is, the capacity of a molecule to reach circulation. We investigated the digestibility and plasma concentration of oleanolic acid as an estimate of bioavailability in growing pigs. Because it is important to know the effects of oleanolic acid in the animal, growth, organ weights, digestibility of nutrients and plasma biochemical profile have been reported as well. Although there is a concern in the scientific community regarding the low bioavailability of oleanolic acid, in vivo data are lacking. We have demonstrated that, while digestibility of oleanolic acid was unexpectedly elevated, the appearance of the molecule in systemic blood was weak, probably indicating hepatic metabolism. No negative effects of oleanolic acid on growth or internal organs were observed. Oleanolic acid (OLA) has beneficial health effects in animals, but in vivo efficacy in monogastric animals is questioned due to its low bioavailability. To gain further insight on the nutritional effects of OLA it was administered as part of a diet. We investigated digestibility and plasma OLA in pigs and the associated influence on growth, organs, digestibility of nutrients and plasma biochemical profile. Twenty-four crossbred barrows (23.7 +/- 1.0 kg BW) were assigned one of three treatments: Control (basal diet without OLA), OLA-1 (basal diet with 260 mg/free OLA) and OLA-2 (basal diet with 260 mg/kg cyclodextrin-OLA). Diets included chromium oxide to estimate digestibility. Blood samples were collected on day 14 for OLA analysis and feces on days 22-24 for determining digestibility. Pigs were slaughtered on day 31 (39.9 +/- 2.43 kg BW) and their blood collected for analysis. Growth and organ weights were not affected (p > 0.05). OLA-1 decreased apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of energy (p < 0.05). OLA-2 increased ATTD of dry and organic matter compared with Control pigs (p < 0.05). OLA-1 increased plasma calcium and alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.05). Ileal digestibility of OLA was not affected (0.88), although OLA ATTD increased in OLA-1 compared to Control pigs (0.75 vs. 0.82; p < 0.05). OLA-1 and OLA-2 increased plasma OLA compared to Control pigs (p < 0.05 and p = 0.083). In conclusion, although the OLA was digested and absorbed, plasma concentration was low (4.29 <mu>g/L), and pig growth, organs and plasma parameters were not affected.

AB  - Present study was focus on the pollution control aspect of gaseous mitigation and heavy metal passivation as well as their associated bacterial communities driven by apple tree branch biochar (BB) during sheep manure composting. Six treatment was performed with distinct concentration of BB from 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, and 12.5% as T1 to T6. Compared with compost without additive, biochar-based composting recorded faster thermophilic process (4thd) and longer duration (12-14d), lower gaseous emission in terms of ammonia (5.37-10.29 g), nitrous oxide (0.12-0.47 g) and methane (4.38-30.29 g). Notably highest temperature (65.3 celcius) and active thermophilic duration (14d), minimized gaseous volatilization were detected in 10%BB composting. Aspect of non-degradability and enrichment-concentration properties of heavy metals, the total copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) were increased (from initial 12.71-17.91 to final 16.36-29.36 mg/kg and 107.39-146.58-161.48-211.91 mg/ kg). In view of available diethylene triamine pentacetic acid (DTPA) extractable form, DTPA-Cu and DTPA-Zn from 4.29 to 6.57 and 31.66-39.32 mg/kg decreased to 3.75-4.82 and 23.43-40.54 mg/kg, especially the maximized passivation rate of 46.95% and 56.27% were present in 10%BB composting. Additionally, bacterial diversity of biochar-based composting was increased (1817-2310 OTUs) than control (1686 OTUs) and dominant by Firmicutes (52.75%), Bacteroidetes (28.41%) and Actinobacteriota (13.98%). Validated 10% biochar-based composting is the optimal option for effectively control environmental pollution to obtain hygienic composting.

AB  - Teressa goat is a unique goat breed in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) of India. Effects of Flaxseed oil (FSO) supplementation in body weight (BW), scrotal circumference (SC), testicular volume (TV) and testicular weight (TW), endocrinological profiles, sex behavioural profiles (SBPs), oxidative stress markers and semen production and its quality profiles in rainy and dry summer season were studied in Teressa goat. Male goats (n = 12) of 3-4 years old were equally divided into control and treated groups. Treated animals received 25 mL FSO per day. Oral drenching of FSO was done in the morning before feeding the concentrate ration. Body weight, scrotal circumference, TV and TW were measured in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Blood follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), cortisol and prolactin, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Libido score (LS), mating ability score (MAS) and sex behavioural score (SBS) were estimated at time of semen collection in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Semen samples (n = 100; 50 semen samples from each season; each 25 semen samples from control and treatment groups per season) were collected and analysed for semen quality profiles. One-way ANOVA (control rainy, control dry, treated rainy and treated dry) revealed that BW, SC, TV and TW, FSH, LH, testosterone, TSH, T3 and T4 were higher (P < 0.05) and cortisol and prolactin were lower (P < 0.05) in FSO treated bucks of rainy season followed by untreated bucks of rainy season, FSO treated bucks of dry summer season and were lower (P < 0.05) in untreated bucks of dry summer season. Similarly, TAC, CAT, SOD and GSH, LS, MAS and SBS, and volume, pH, sperm concentration, mass activity, total motility (TM), viability, acrosomal integrity (AcI), plasma membrane integrity (PMI) and nuclear integrity (NI) were higher (P < 0.05) and MDA and TSA were lower (P < 0.05) in FSO treated bucks of rainy season followed by FSO treated bucks of dry summer season, untreated bucks of rainy season and were lower (P < 0.05) in untreated bucks of dry summer season. The results of the present study indicated that the breeding bucks suffered physiological stress (higher cortisol), oxidative stress (higher MDA and deficiency of antioxidants), hormonal imbalance (higher prolactin and cortisol and deficiency of gonadotropins, gonadal hormone and thyroid hormones) and infertility due to poor libido and poor semen production and its quality profiles during dry summer season. Thus, dry summer was more stressful season compared to rainy season for the goat bucks. FSO supplementation mitigated these stresses and improved the scrotal and testicular biometrics, libido, antioxidants, hormones and semen quality profiles in Teressa goat bucks. The current study concluded that FSO effectively improved the hormones, libido, antioxidant profiles, and scrotal and testicular biometrics with cascading beneficial effects on semen quality profiles in Teressa goat bucks under humid tropical island ecosystem of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

AB  - Evolutionary expansions and contractions of gene families are often correlated with key innovations and/or ecological characteristics. In butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), expansions of gene families involved in detoxification of plant specialized metabolites are hypothesized to facilitate a polyphagous feeding style. However, analyses supporting this hypothesis are mostly based on a limited number of lepidopteran species. We applied a phylogenomics approach, using 37 lepidopteran genomes, to analyze if gene family evolution (gene gain and loss) is associated with the evolution of polyphagy. Specifically, we compared gene counts and evolutionary gene gain and loss rates of gene families involved in adaptations with plant feeding. We correlated gene evolution to host plant family range (phylogenetic diversity) and specialized metabolite content of plant families (functional metabolite diversity). We found a higher rate for gene loss than gene gain in Lepidoptera, a potential consequence of genomic rearrangements and deletions after (potentially small-scale) duplication events. Gene family expansions and contractions varied across lepidopteran families, and were associated to host plant use and specialization levels. Within the family Noctuidae, a higher expansion rate for gene families involved in detoxification can be related to the large number of polyphagous species. However, gene family expansions are observed in both polyphagous and monophagous lepidopteran species and thus seem to be species-specific in the taxa sampled. Nevertheless, a significant positive correlation of gene counts of the carboxyl- and choline esterase and glutathione-S-transferase detoxification gene families with the level of polyphagy was identified across Lepidoptera.

AB  - Dung beetles mostly feed on mammal dung. Throughout the European Alps, the dung produced by local domestic ungulates attracts many species of dung beetles, giving rise to rich and diversified communities that play an important role in the Alpine agricultural ecosystem. There is, therefore, understandable concern about the introduction of exotic livestock, such as alpacas (Vicugna pacos (Linnaeus, 1758)), into the region. This research studied dung beetle assemblages in an Alpine valley where both cattle and alpacas are raised. We used standardized pitfall traps baited with alpaca or cow dung along altitudinal transects to assess the "attractiveness" of the two resources to dung beetles. Most species entered both trap types. The average number of species per trap did not vary significantly and the nMDS trap ordination largely overlapped, but the total number of individuals and the average number of individuals per trap were higher in traps baited with alpaca dung. This difference was largely due to the preference of the dominant species Euheptaulacus carinatus (Germar, 1824) for alpaca dung-baited traps. Moreover, both the abundance and specific richness changed with altitude, being greatest in alpaca traps during July at intermediate altitudes. IndVal analyses showed that eight out of nine species (all Aphodiinae) showed a preference for alpaca traps. Since the microclimatic conditions (i.e., temperature) of the two trap types were virtually the same, it is reasonable to consider trophic preferences as the source of the observed differences. Finally, we also sampled the beetles present in the alpaca latrines and cow dung pats deposited on pastures, providing confirmation that dung beetles do indeed visit the dung of both species. Our results emphasize the usefulness of polyphagia and the trophic flexibility of dung beetles, providing evidence that the long history of pastoralism in the Alps has not led local species to adapt to the dung of domestic ungulates. The results also suggest that alpaca breeding could be a sustainable activity since, thanks to the work of dung beetles which feed upon and move the dung into their tunnels (as occurs with cattle dung), there is less need for farmers to remove the dung from pastures.

AB  - Different herbivorous species that share a host plant may interact via competition or facilitation, depending on whether the interaction partners are hindered by or benefit from the interaction. Sap-sucking insects, such as aphids, can influence each other indirectly by altering the composition of the shared phloem sap. Aphid-induced changes in the plant may affect aphid performance and lead to a shift in the balance between different co-occurring aphid species. In this study, we compared the performance of the English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) and the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) simultaneously infesting leaves or ears of wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants, which had been either previously infested by S. avenae or kept uninfested. Colonies of S. avenae were larger on ears than on leaves, while the opposite pattern was found for R. padi. Pre-infestation of ears, but not of leaves, by S. avenae led to a higher total aphid number and colony size of S. avenae at some time points. The balance between the two species was only slightly affected by previous infestation at some time points. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of plant-aphid as well as aphid-aphid interactions in agricultural fields.

AB  - Hippocampal neurogenesis, the continuous creation of new neurons in the adult brain, influences memory, regulates the expression of defensive responses to threat (fear), and cognitive processes like pattern separation and behavioral flexibility. One hypothesis proposes that neurogenesis promotes cognitive flexibility by degrading established memories and promoting relearning. Yet, empirical evidence on its role in fear discrimination tasks is scarce. In this study, male rats were initially trained to differentiate between two similar environments, one associated with a threat. Subsequently, we enhanced neurogenesis through environmental enrichment and memantine treatments. We then reversed the emotional valence of these contexts. In both cases, neurogenesis improved the rats' ability to relearn the aversive context. Interestingly, we observed increased hippocampal activity, and decreased activity in the prelimbic cortex and lateral habenula, while the infralimbic cortex remained unchanged, suggesting neurogenesis-induced plasticity changes in this brain network. Moreover, when we pharmacologically inhibited the increased neurogenesis with Methotrexate, rats struggled to relearn context discrimination, confirming the crucial role of neurogenesis in this cognitive process. Overall, our findings highlight neurogenesis's capacity to facilitate changes in fear discrimination and emphasize the involvement of a prefrontal-hippocampal-habenula mechanism in this process. This study emphasizes the intricate relationship between hippocampal neurogenesis, cognitive flexibility, and the modulation of fear-related memories.

AB  - Genomic structural variations (SVs) are widespread in plant and animal genomes and play important roles in phenotypic novelty and species adaptation. Frequent whole genome duplications followed by (re)diploidizations have resulted in high diversity of genome architecture among extant species. In this study, we identified abundant genomic SVs in the Panax genus that are hypothesized to have occurred through during the repeated polyploidizations/(re)diploidizations. Our genome-wide comparisons demonstrated that although these polyploidization-derived SVs have evolved at distinct evolutionary stages, a large number of SV-intersecting genes showed enrichment in functionally important pathways related to secondary metabolites, photosynthesis and basic cellular activities. In line with these observations, our metabolic analyses of these Panax species revealed high diversity of primary and secondary metabolites both at the tissue and interspecific levels. In particular, genomic SVs identified at ginsenoside biosynthesis genes, including copy number variation and large fragment deletion, appear to have played important roles in the evolution and diversification of ginsenosides. A further herbivore deterrence experiment demonstrated that, as major triterpenoidal saponins found exclusively in Panax, ginsenosides provide protection against insect herbivores. Our study provides new insights on how polyploidization-derived SVs have contributed to phenotypic novelty and plant adaptation.

AB  - China has implemented policies like Leading areas for Agricultural Green Development (LAGD) to mitigate livestock and poultry farming pollution while promoting industry growth. However, it remains uncertain whether LAGDs have successfully balanced emission reduction with stable development. This study examines 165 LAGDs to analyze changes in emissions, assess the decoupling of emission reduction from output value, and identify influencing factors. Findings reveal that emissions from livestock and poultry in LAGDs initially increased and then decreased between 2010 and 2019. Cattle were responsible for over 40% of fecal emissions, and pigs for more than 20%. Additionally, pigs contributed to over 61% of urine emissions. From 2010 to 2014, increases in chemical oxygen demand were mainly due to pigs and cattle. Total nitrogen levels were significantly impacted by cattle, while pigs were affected by total phosphorus. From 2014 to 2019, reductions in emissions were largely attributed to a decrease in pig-related pollutants. The decoupling status shifted from strong to weak and then back to strong between 2014 and 2019. Production efficiency played a crucial role in reducing emissions, while changes in industrial structure moved from supporting to hindering this reduction. Economic development was a primary factor in driving these changes. Standard emissions in Chinese regions showed a rising and then declining trend from 2010 to 2019. The Northeast and Northwest regions of China demonstrated emission trends that were in sync with the growth in rural income. This study offers insights into the successes and challenges of LAGDs in achieving a balance between reduced emissions and development, using quantitative analysis. The findings are instrumental in informing policies for a sustainable livestock and poultry industry. Recommendations include evaluating coordinated approaches to pollution reduction and industrial growth, setting decoupling goals, designing policies based on influential factors, conducting regional assessments of livestock and poultry demand, and implementing region-specific strategies.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus induces neuropsychiatric comorbidities at an early stage, which can be ameliorated by exercise. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this ameliorative effect remain unclear. The present study was conducted in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats, which develop diabetes with age, and aimed to investigate whether social and anxiety-like behaviors and neurobiological changes associated with these behavioral phenotypes were reversed by voluntary exercise and whether those were maintained in the later stage. We investigated the effects of exercise at different diabetic stages in OLETF rats by comparing with control rats. Three groups of OLETF rats were used: sedentary rats, rats exercising on a wheel for two weeks at 4-5 weeks of age (early voluntary exercise), and those exercising at 10-11 weeks of age (late voluntary exercise). In the elevated plus-maze test, both early and late voluntary exercises did not affect anxiety-like behavior. In the social interaction tests, both early and late voluntary exercises ameliorated impaired sociability, novel exploration deficits, and hypoactivity in OLETF rats. Both early and late voluntary exercises reversed the increases in cholecystokinin-positive neuron densities in the infralimbic cortex and hippocampal cornu ammonis area 3 in the OLETF rats, although they did not affect the area-reduction in the medial prefrontal cortex and the increase in cholecystokinin-positive neuron densities in the basolateral amygdala. These suggest that voluntary exercise has therapeutic effects on impaired sociability and novel exploration deficits associated with cholecystokinin-positive neurons in specific corticolimbic regions in OLETF rats, and those are maintained after early exercise.

AB  - Syngnathidae is a peculiar fish family in which pregnant males incubate developing embryos in a brood pouch which is functionally equivalent to the mammalian uterus. Immunological modifications in the brood pouch during gestation are vital for a successful pregnancy. Previous studies revealed the teleost-specific Toll-like receptor 22 (TLR22) could recognize viruses and bacteria. To evaluate the role of TLR22 in allograft tolerance and antibacterial (and antiviral) protection in the brood pouch, the tlr22 gene was characterized in the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus), which has evolved complex and fully enclosed brood pouches. In this study, tlr22 showed specific expression in the brood pouch. Interestingly, expression of tlr22 in the pouch decreased progressively during the course of pregnancy. In addition, the expression of downstream TLR signaling molecules was influenced by pregnancy stages, suggesting that TLR22 and downstream TLR signaling molecules might be involved in immunological tolerance and embryo rejection in the brood pouch during pregnancy. Further investigation of role of TLR22 in immunological protection in brood pouches following the injection of LPS and Poly(I:C) showed that tlr22 expression in the pouch was upregulated after the challenge. In addition, the expression of downstream TLR signaling molecules was altered, indicating that tlr22 and TLR signaling molecules are involved in antiviral and antibacterial immune responses in the brood pouch. Taken together, our results improve the understanding of immunological modifications in the brood pouch and may provide new insights into immune regulation during male pregnancy in syngnathids.

AB  - South America underwent a span of isolation in the Cenozoic, during which an endemic fauna developed, including a diverse group of native ungulates. Among them, Proterotheriidae (Litopterna, Pan-Perissodactyla) were small to medium-sized hoofed herbivores mainly documented from the Oligocene to the Pleistocene. The study of proterotheriid mammals, specifically their cranial morphology, has been challenging due to the limited availability of materials, leading to a heavy reliance on dental evidence in their descriptions. This issue is particularly evident for late Neogene records, where comprehensive cranial studies have been lacking. Herein, we study a juvenile proterotheriid individual referred to Neobrachytherium intermedium recovered from Early Pliocene outcrops of northwestern Argentina. Our research focuses on cranial morphology, particularly on the dorsal and orbitotemporal regions, mesocranium, and basicranial structures. By employing noninvasive techniques, we describe the petrosal anatomy and compare it in a broader phylogenetic context. We also provide insights into ontogenetic stages within the genus. We find singular arrangements and structures for the genus (e.g., tuberosities in the postglenoid process) as well as traits shared with other mammals that are distinct from those found in other SANUs and pan-perissodactyls, such as Notoungulata (e.g., ringlike ectotympanic, gracile tympanohyal, poorly developed epitympanic wing and medial flange, large hiatus Fallopii). Traits such as the position and shape of the m. tensor tympani fossa and the development of the jugular notch may be synapomorphies of Litopterna, but this cannot be determined without resolving the phylogenetic position of Indalecia grandensis, which has been suggested to be a basal Litopterna. Considering ontogenetic observations, features like the frontal sulcus, the supraorbital foramen, and the palate configuration exhibit age-related changes. The occlusal patterns of teeth undergo substantial changes with wear, affecting loph morphology. Variations in deciduous premolars are observed within the same individual. These findings emphasize the importance of considering ontogenetic and individual variations when analyzing cranial and dental remains for taxonomic and phylogenetic purposes. The study provides valuable information for understanding late Neogene proterotheriids and the broader context of cranial evolution within Litopterna, highlighting the necessity for more comprehensive research.

AB  - The composition and structure of antelope assemblages were analyzed by using data from wild meat markets in three distinct study stations in the southern Niger Delta, Nigeria. The relative abundance of the different species coming into the markets was analyzed, and various diversity metrics were used to describe the different antelope communities. Sex ratios of these populations as well as the effect of season on the abundance of the various species in the markets were examined. It was observed that a single recently described species (Philantomba walteri) was the dominant species in the three localities, contributing about 70% of all the antelope individuals. The relatively low number of antelope carcasses observed in this study (less than the number of carcasses of small carnivores in the same sites) suggests that the ungulate fauna is already very depleted in the eastern Niger Delta region, with these mammals being hunted more intensely in the wet season.

AB  - Goat milk is a vital component of China's dairy industry, renowned for its richness in lipids essential to human health. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3, DHA), are particularly valuable for their integration into phospholipids and triacylglycerols. While mammary cells can uptake and channel PUFAs into lipids for milk fat secretion, the broader functional effects of DHA within these cells remain unclear. This study demonstrated that DHA supplementation markedly altered levels of lipid subclasses in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs), as revealed by lipidomic analysis. DHA treatment significantly increased the levels of free DHA, alongside DHA-enriched triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine, thereby driving lipid remodeling in GMECs. Additionally, DHA modulated transcription of key fatty acid metabolism genes, such as SREBP1, FASD2, and FASN. Mechanistically, DHA supplementation activated the AMPK signaling pathway inhibiting fatty acid metabolism, and upregulated the expression of fatty acid transport gene-CD36 in GMECs. Knockdown or mutation of the fatty acid binding domain of CD36 diminished DHA-induced AMPK activation and transcriptional regulation of fatty acid metabolism genes in GMECs. In summary, DHA supplementation induces lipid remodeling in GMECs via the CD36-AMPK signaling axis, highlighting its potential to facilitate the development of DHA-enriched functional goat milk.

AB  - Structural brain alterations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are heterogeneous, with limited effect sizes overall. In this study, we aimed to identify subgroups in ASD, based on neuroanatomical profiles; we hypothesized that the effect sizes for case/control differences would be increased in the newly defined subgroups. Analyzing a large data set from the ENIGMA-ASD working group (n = 2661), we applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to seven subcortical volumes of individuals with and without ASD to uncover the underlying organization of subcortical structures. Based on earlier findings and data availability, we focused on three age groups: boys (<=14 years), male adolescents (15-22 years), and adult men (> = 22 years). The resulting factor scores were used in a community detection (CD) analysis to cluster participants into subgroups. Three factors were found in each subsample; the factor structure in adult men differed from that in boys and male adolescents. From these factors, CD uncovered four distinct communities in boys and three communities in adolescents and adult men, irrespective of ASD diagnosis. The effect sizes for case/control comparisons were more pronounced than in the combined sample, for some communities. A significant group difference in ADOS scores between communities was observed in boys and male adolescents with ASD. We succeeded in stratifying participants into more homogeneous subgroups based on subcortical brain volumes. This stratification enhanced our ability to observe case/control differences in subcortical brain volumes in ASD, and may help to explain the heterogeneity of previous findings in ASD. Lay summary Structural brain alterations in ASD are heterogeneous, with overall limited effect sizes. Here we aimed to identify subgroups in ASD based on neuroimaging measures. We tested whether the effect sizes for case/control differences would be increased in the newly defined subgroups. Based on neuroanatomical profiles, we succeeded in stratifying our participants into more homogeneous subgroups. The effect sizes of case/control differences were more pronounced in some subgroups than those in the whole sample.

AB  - Premise Flowering phenology strongly influences reproductive success in plants. Days to first flower is easy to quantify and widely used to characterize phenology, but reproductive fitness depends on the full schedule of flower production over time. We investigated flowering schedules in relation to the onset and duration of flowering and tested for latitudinal clines in schedule shape associated with rapid evolution and range expansion of an invasive plant. Methods We examined floral display traits among 13 populations of Lythrum salicaria, sampled along a 10-degree latitudinal gradient in eastern North America. We grew these collections in a common garden field experiment at a mid-latitude site and quantified variation in flowering schedule shape using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and quantitative metrics analogous to central moments of probability distributions (i.e., mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis). Results Consistent with earlier evidence for adaptation to shorter growing seasons, we found that populations from higher latitudes had earlier start and mean flowering day, on average, when compared to populations from southern latitudes. Flowering skew increased with latitude, whereas kurtosis decreased, consistent with a bet-hedging strategy in biotic environments with more herbivores and greater competition for pollinators. Conclusions Heritable clines in flowering schedules are consistent with adaptive evolution in response to a predicted shift toward weaker biotic interactions and less variable but more stressful abiotic environments at higher latitudes, potentially contributing to rapid evolution and range expansion of this invasive species.

AB  - Camera trap distance sampling (CTDS)o is a recently developed survey method to estimate animal abundance from camera trap data for unmarked populations. It requires the estimation of camera-animal observation distances, which previously was done by comparing animal positions to reference labels at predefined intervals. Here, we test a photogrammetry approach to derive camera-animal observation distances. We applied both, the reference label and photogrammetry approaches to five ungulate species varying widely in body size (Giraffa camelopardalis, Equus grevyi, Oryx dammah, Kobus megaceros and Eudorcas thomsonii) and one ground-dwelling bird species (Numida meleagris) inhabiting a large enclosure and estimated their density with CTDS. Both procedures provided highly correlated observation distances (rho = 0.99, p < 0.001). A paired t test revealed a minor but significantly higher mean of the photogrammetry approach (MD = 0.28 m, p < 0.001). This, however, seems negligible as for analyses, distances were grouped in intervals of 2 to 5 metres. In general, estimated animal abundance was close to the true number of individuals in the enclosure for both approaches, with the exception of zebra, whose density was underestimated. The photogrammetry approach offers an alternative approach for deriving camera-animal observation distances and is particularly useful for application in open habitats, with little occlusion of animals.

AB  - L & uuml;liang black goat (LBG) is a unique livestock genetic resource of great significance for the local agriculture and economic development of Shanxi, China. However, the kidding rate of LBG is relatively low, which limits efforts to improve the reproductive performance and economic benefits of this breed. Therefore, improving the kidding characteristics of LBG is crucial for increasing its economic benefits. In this study, 20 LBG does were selected for whole-genome resequencing and divided into two groups: 10 in the T group (does with three consecutive kiddings of twin kids) and 10 in the S group (does with three consecutive kiddings of single kids). Based on whole-genome resequencing data, this study comprehensively assessed the population structure and genetic diversity of LBG and explored the related genes that affect reproductive performance. Three selection signal analysis methods-Fst (Fixation Index), pi (nucleotide diversity), and XP-CLR (Cross Population Composite Likelihood Ratio)-were applied to screen a total of 838 genes, and enrichment analysis was performed to identify genes closely related to the reproductive performance of LBG, including ENPP3, APC, and GLI2. A generalized linear model was used to conduct a correlation analysis between non-synonymous mutations in the three genes and the number of kids produced. Two loci that were significantly correlated with kidding number were identified (p < 0.05): GLI2 g.63400363 C>T and GLI2 g.63417538 C>T. In general, the LBG population has high genetic diversity and good prospects for genetic improvement. The findings revealed that mining high-fecundity selection characteristics provides a basis for research on goat reproductive mechanisms.

AB  - As the use of herbicides in agriculture has increased worldwide, the importance of identifying unexpected toxic effects on non-target organisms is emerging. Bensulide is used on various agricultural crops as an organophosphate herbicide; however, it can pose a high risk to non-target organisms because of its long half-life and accumulative potential. Despite its high risk, the hazardous effects of bensulide on implantation and mechanisms in cells have not been reported. Therefore, in this study, intracellular mechanisms and potential risk of implantation failure were identified in porcine trophectoderm (pTr) and uterine luminal epithelial (pLE) cells derived from pigs with human-like molecular mechanisms in implantation. The LC50 values of bensulide were 5.21 mg/L in pTr cells and 6.49 mg/L in pLE cells. Both cell lines were exposed to bensulide at concentrations <5 mg/L in subsequent experiments. Treatment with 5 mg/L bensulide activated ERK1/2 and JNK. Disrupted mitochondrial membrane potentials of both cell types were identified. In addition, mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration increased to 261.24% and 228.04% in pTr and pLE cells, respectively, and cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations decreased by approximately 50% in both cell types. The abnormal regulation of various intracellular environments by bensulide causes cell division cycle arrest and apoptosis. Finally, 5 mg/L bensulide inhibited transcription of implantation-related genes. Collectively, our results suggest that bensulide may interrupt implantation during early pregnancy by disrupting maternal-fetal interaction.

AB  - Context. The RsaI polymorphism of the melatonin receptor MTNR1A gene affects seasonal reproduction in sheep, but its effect on ram spermatozoa and their response to melatonin is unknown. Aims. This study aims to evaluate whether RsaI polymorphism of the MTNR1A gene influences the response of ram spermatozoa to in vitro added melatonin. Methods. Spermatozoa from rams carrying different RsaI allelic variants were incubated with melatonin in a TALP medium or a capacitation-triggering medium during the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. After incubation, sperm motility, membrane integrity, mitochondria activity, oxidative damage, apoptotic markers and capacitation status were assessed. Key results. In the reproductive season, the T/T genotype was related to some adverse effects of melatonin when spermatozoa were incubated in TALP medium, whereas the C/C genotype was linked with adverse effects when the hormone was added in a capacitation-triggering medium. The decapacitating effect of melatonin on spermatozoa was also different depending on genotype. Conclusions. The melatonin effect on spermatozoa from rams carrying different RsaI genotypes differed depending on the season and the medium. Implications. The knowledge of the RsaI allelic variant of the MTNR1A gene of rams could be helpful when carrying out in vitro reproductive techniques in the ovine species.

AB  - Avian cranial anatomy is constrained by the competing (or complementary) requirements and costs of various facial, muscular, sensory, and central neural structures. However, these constraints may operate differently in flighted versus flightless birds. We investigated cranial sense organ morphology in four lineages of flightless birds: kiwi (Apteryx), the Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), and the extinct moa (Dinornithiformes) from New Zealand; and the extinct elephant birds from Madagascar (Aepyornithidae). Scleral ring and eye measurements suggest that the Upland Moa (Megalapteryx didinus) was diurnal, while measurements for the Kakapo are consistent with nocturnality. Kiwi are olfactory specialists, though here we postulate that retronasal olfaction is the dominant olfactory route in this lineage. We suggest that the Upland Moa and aepyornithids were also olfactory specialists; the former additionally displaying prominent bill tip sensory organs implicated in mechanoreception. Finally, the relative size of the endosseous cochlear duct revealed that the Upland Moa had a well-developed hearing sensitivity range, while the sensitivity of the kiwi, Kakapo, and aepyornithids was diminished. Together, our results reveal contrasting sensory strategies among extant and extinct flightless birds. More detailed characterisation of sensory capacities and cranial anatomy in extant birds may refine our ability to make accurate inferences about the sensory capacities of fossil taxa.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic gas, causing many lethal accidents in farming environment. Until now, the understanding of the interactive impact of different variables on hydrogen sulfide concentrations on swine farms has been limited. The risk of high hydrogen sulfide concentrations has not yet been assessed comprehensively. The main goal of this study is to identify and investigate the variables, which significantly influence hydrogen sulfide concentrations, and to assess the risk of exposure to toxic hydrogen sulfide concentrations on swine farms. A generalized linear model was built to show the intertwining impact of different variables, and, on the basis of this model, sensitivity analysis, stress tests and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to thoroughly assess the risk of exposure to dangerous hydrogen sulfide concentrations. Use of generalized linear models and risk assessment tools is a novelty in this context. The model results show that the most significant variables are the location of sample origin, manure disturbance, pig age, weight and diet. If hydrogen sulfide is measured outside a barn, the concentration is up to 47-times lower than inside a barn. Hydrogen sulfide concentration increases by a factor of 7 if manure is pumped during the observation period. Operations with growing pigs have the highest expected hydrogen sulfide concentrations in comparison to other pig age groups. Risk assessment analysis additionally reveals that certain combinations of variable values result in lethal hydrogen sulfide concentrations, and that the likelihood of such scenarios can reach 0.69%.

AB  - Although the interspecies hybridization of bovids, such as cattle-yak (Bos taurus x Bos grunniens), has heterosis benefits, the infertility of hybrid males affects the maintenance of dominant traits in subsequent generations. To achieve reproductive capacity, male germ cell development requires coordinated changes in gene expression, including DNA methylation and generalized histone modifications. Although gene expression-related mechanisms underlying hybrid male sterility have been investigated recently, information on the cell types and stage-specific controls remains limited. Here, we used immunohistochemistry and image analyses to evaluate the 5-methylcytosine (5MC) and acetyl-histone H3 Lys9 (AcK9) expression in all spermatogonia and testicular somatic cell types to determine their roles in cattle-yak spermatogenesis. Testicular tissues from yak (1-3 years old) and backcrossed hybrids (2 years old) were used. In yak, the AcK9 expression levels increased in all cell types during maturation, but the 5MC expression levels did not change until reaching 3 years when they increased in all testicular cell types, except spermatogonia. Cattle-yak hybrids showed higher 5MC expression levels and different AcK9 expression levels in all cell types compared to the same-aged yak. These results suggested that both gene modulation by AcK9 and constant levels of DNA methylation are required for spermatogenesis during maturation in yak. Therefore, inappropriate expression levels of both AcK9 and DNA methylation might be the major factors for disruption of normal germ cell development in cattle-yak. Additionally, various modulations occurred depending on the cell type. Further experiments are needed to identify the stage-specific gene expression modulations in each cell type in yak and cattle-yak to potentially solve the infertility issue in crossbreeding.

AB  - Leader RNAs are viral small non-coding RNAs that has been proved to play important roles in viral replication. Snakehead vesiculovirus (SHVV) is an aquatic virus that has caused huge economic loss in Chinese snakehead fish aquaculture industry. It has been proved that SHVV would generate leader RNA during the process of infection, and leader RNA could interact with viral nucleoprotein to promote viral replication. In this study, we identified that leader RNA could also interact with cellular protein Cold Shock Domain containing E1 (CSDE1) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A3 (hnRNP A3). Further investigation reveals that overexpression of CSDE1 and hnRNP A3 facilitated SHVV replication. Downregulation of CSDE1 and hnRNP A3 by siRNA inhibited SHVV replication. This study provided a new sight into understand the mechanism of SHVV replication, and a potential anti-SHVV target for drug research.

AB  - The Mazama genus is one of the more diverse genera among deer (Cervidae); its classification is controversial because of its complex phylogenetic relationships. The Central American red brocket deer (Mazama temama) is distributed from Central America to the northwest of South America. Studying the diet of mammals gives us information about the environment in which they live, considering that animals select food according to the resources available in the surrounding environment. Mesowear and microwear provide complementary data because they present direct evidence of feeding behaviour on different time scales. The use of extant animals as control samples or baselines allows for the interpretation of the results of a study performed using the archaeological record. For this reason, the aim of this paper was to study the diet of extant M. temama from Darien and to compare it with our previous results on ancient deer from Pedro Gonzalez Island archaeological site (6060-5620 cal yr BP) and extant individuals from San Jose Island (Panama). Evidence from the meso-and microwear analyses of M. temama from Darien suggests that they were browse-dominated mixed feeders during the last years of their lives and during the days before their death. There was no evidence of seasonal variation in their diets and between sexes. This paper exemplifies the potential of studying extant materials housed in museum collections as a reference to compare them to archaeological remains. The use of the same methods allows to construct baselines to better understand the archaeological record in the Neotropics.

AB  - Coastal systems encompass a range of ecotones that are important for fish species, providing diverse micro-habitats and grounds for foraging, protection from predation, reproduction and areas for recruitment. However, most of these systems face major threats from human activities. Considering the increasing levels of human disturbance in coastal ecosystems, understanding fish-habitat associations may provide important insights into patterns of species occurrence and distribution in human-impacted systems, which can support the development of effective conservation and management measures. In this context, we investigated the relationship between seahorses (Hippocampus reidi) and both habitat complexity and different holdfast species, to determine possible variation between locations and among seasons. Data were obtained from the rocky reefs of Guanabara (Urca Beach) and Sepetiba (Duas Irm & atilde;s Island) bays, in southeastern Brazil. Seahorses were counted, and the holdfast being used by each individual was recorded and identified to species or assigned to a morphofunctional group. The beaches differed in holdfast composition and morphofunctional groups, yet sharing some morphofunctional groups. Seahorses were more frequently associated with branching holdfasts at both sites, and also with foliaceous and massive. Association with algae were particularly found in Urca, while the coral Carijoa riisei in Duas Irm & atilde;s Island.

AB  - Two new species of the genus Meloidodera collected in Mexico are described here: M. ferrisi sp. n. parasitising roots of an oak tree in the State of Mexico and M. tecoacensis sp. n. parasitising roots of buffalo bur nightshade in the Tlaxcala State. Meloidodera ferrisi sp. n. is characterised by a spherical female body covered completely by a dark thick cuticular layer, length/width of the female body = 0.8-1.6, stylet = 35-43 mu m and second-stage juvenile with average body = 340 mu m and average tail length = 35.6 mu m. Meloidodera tecoacensis sp. n. is characterised by the female having a spherical body covered with a yellow transparent material, length/width of the female body = 1.1-2.8, stylet = 20-33 mu m and second-stage juvenile with average body = 340 mu m and average tail length = 29.8 mu m. These two species were molecularly characterised using the D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rRNA, ITS rRNA and COI gene sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two new species represent a separate evolutionary lineage within the subfamily Meloidoderinae. An identification key for 12 Meloidodera species is provided.

AB  - As a keystone predator within forest ecosystems, the dhole (Cuon alpinus) plays a pivotal role in shaping the population structure and dynamics of these biomes. In China, dhole populations have experienced a dramatic decline, primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and other historical factors. However, the distribution patterns of suitable habitats and the key environmental factors influencing their suitability remained unclear. In this study, we employed the MaxEnt model to assess the habitat suitability for dholes across China. The results revealed that the primary factors influencing the distribution of potential suitable habitats for dholes were the mean diurnal range (Bio2), temperature seasonality (Bio4), minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6), and elevation. Potentially suitable habitats were predominantly located in the central-western and northwestern regions, with scattered distributions in the southeastern parts of China, while areas of high suitability were mainly concentrated in the central-western region. The proportion of suitable habitats varied significantly among the nine provinces analyzed. This study clarified the distribution patterns of suitable habitats and identified the key environmental constraints affecting dhole distribution in China. The findings provide critical ecological data to support the conservation and management of dholes in the region.

AB  - Simple Summary Sulla flexuosa is a phenolic-rich legume endemic in some southern Mediterranean areas. This plant could be used as an alternative feed resource for goats, but it requires some investigation. Incorporating 35% and 70% DM hay of Sulla flexuosa into the diet did not affect either milk production or physicochemical composition. However, the higher incorporation of 70% in the diet improved the antioxidant capacity and introduced some healthier fatty acids in milk, including docosahexaenoic acid. Therefore, Sulla flexuosa can be used as interesting alternative forage in goat diets. Sulla flexuosa (Hedysarum flexuosum L.) is an endemic legume growing in some Mediterranean areas in rainfed and cold mountainous conditions. It could be used in goat diets as an alternative protein source instead of alfalfa to supplement forest rangeland. This study aimed to test the effects of incorporating Sulla flexuosa (SF) hay in the diet of Beni Arouss goats on their milk production and quality. The hay was introduced at two levels, i.e., 35 or 70% (SF70), on a DM basis; it partially or totally replaced the alfalfa hay of the control diet. Sulla flexuosa incorporation did not affect milk production or physicochemical composition. However, milk FA content varied in proportion to the percentage of SF incorporation. The SF70 diet was associated with increased milk levels in C18:1n-9, C18:2n-6, C18:3n-3, and C22:6n-3 and total monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and n-3 fatty acids. As a consequence, atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were improved. Additionally, better antioxidant capacity was observed in SF70.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the livestock industry are expected to increase. A response strategy for CO2 emission regulations is required for pig production as this industry comprises a large proportion of the livestock industry and it is projected that per capita pork consumption will rise. A CO2 emission response strategy can be established by accurately measuring the CO2 concentrations in pig facilities. Here, we compared and evaluated the performance of three different machine learning (ML) models (ElasticNet, random forest regression (RFR), and support vector regression (SVR)) designed to predict CO2 concentration and internal air temperature (T-i) values in the pig house used to regulate a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control system. For each ML model, the hyperparameter was optimised and the predictive accuracy was evaluated. The order of predictive accuracy for the ML models was ElasticNet < SVR < RFR. Hence, random forest regression provided superior prediction performance. Based on the test dataset, for T-i prediction by RFR, R-2 >= 0.848 and the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.235 degrees C and 0.160 degrees C, respectively, whilst for CO2 concentration prediction by RFR, R-2 >= 0.885 and the RMSE and MAE were 64.39 ppm and <= 46.17 ppm, respectively.

AB  - The cost-effectiveness of different attractants during camera trapping surveys has been seldom evaluated. To contribute in filling this knowledge gap we (1) compare the effectiveness of a suite of attractants in detecting widely distributed mammals in Europe and (2) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these attractants, by calculating the costs associated to reach a specific monitoring objective. We conducted a large-scale field experiment across four study areas in central and northern Italy, encompassing a variety of environments, from lowland forest to alpine beech forest. We focused on comparing the following low cost and readily available attractants: sardines, peanut butter, a commercial lure and we used a camera with no attractant as control, collecting data on a suite of small to large mammals. We found that for seven of our 13 target species detectability varied with the type of attractant used. Specifically, sardines proved to be the most effective attractant for canids and the porcupine, peanut butter was most effective for mustelids but was avoided by the roe deer, whereas the commercial lure was the most effective with red deer. Through a power analysis combined with a cost function analysis we were able to show striking differences in the cost-effectiveness of the different methods, sometimes in the order of magnitude of tens of thousands of euros, which strongly emphasizes the critical importance played by the choice of whether to use an attractant or not and the type of attractant to be used.

AB  - Although the number of marinas along shorelines has significantly increased during the last years, there is a lack of studies on mobile epifauna associated to floating pontoons or infauna inhabiting soft bottoms of marinas. Artificial hard substrate (lateral surface of pontoons) and soft substrate (sediment) were sampled in 42 marinas along the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa and 48 different species of molluscs were found. Species richness and Shannon diversity values were higher in sediments than in hard substrates; multivariate analyses also revealed differences in species composition and trophic guilds between these two habitats. The most abundant species on the hard substrate were Mytilus galloprovincialis and Musculus subpictus, and Corbula gibba and Parvi-cardium exiguum in sediments. Although filter feeders were dominant in both habitats, herbivorous species were only found on the hard substrate while deposit feeders were restricted to sediments. As diversity, abundance and trophic patterns were not always consistent for all localities, a local scale effect must be considered in envi-ronmental programs for marinas. None exotic mollusc was detected, so this study provides baseline information necessary as a first step in monitoring programmes for early detection of new incoming exotic species. Faunistic knowledge is mandatory to provide local governments, policy makers and authorities with readily accessible species datasets and ecological information. This should be a priority to address an integrated and sustainable management of marinas.

AB  - Global land resources are over-exploited and natural habitats are declining, often driven by expanding livestock production. In Ireland, pastureland for grazing cattle and sheep account for circa 60% of terrestrial land use. The agriculture, forestry and other land use sector (AFOLU) is responsible for 44% of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A new Grassland Animal response Model (GLAM) was developed to relate livestock-cohort grass and feed requirements to farm-grassland system areas, enhancing environmental assessment of prospective AFOLU configurations. Although land conversion targets are often well-defined, they tend to lack a clear definition of where land sparing can occur. Through analyses of 10 scenarios of milk and beef production and management strategies, we found that displacing beef cows with dairy cows can increase national protein output while sparing up to 0.75 million ha (18%) of grassland (albeit with a minor increase in overseas land requirement for additional concentrate feed). Reducing slaughter age, increasing exports of male dairy calves and increasing grassland use efficiency on beef farms each achieved between 0.19 and 0.32 million ha of land sparing. Sexed semen to achieve more favourable male-female birth ratios had a minor impact. GHG emissions, ammonia emissions and nutrient leaching were only reduced substantially when overall cattle numbers declined, confirming the need for cattle reductions to achieve environmental objectives. Nonetheless, application of GLAM shows potential for improved grass and cattle management to spare good quality land suitable for productive forestry and wetland restoration. This change is urgently needed to generate scalable carbon dioxide removals from the land sector in Ireland, and globally.

AB  - Indirect species interactions are ubiquitous in nature, often outnumbering direct species interactions. Yet despite evidence that indirect interactions have strong ecological effects, relatively little is known about whether they can shape adaptive evolution by altering the strength and/or direction of natural selection. We tested whether indirect interactions affect the strength and direction of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits of the bumble-bee pollinated wildflower Lobelia siphilitica. We estimated the indirect effects of two pollinator predators with contrasting hunting modes: dragonflies (Aeshnidae and Corduliidae) and ambush bugs (Phymata americana, Reduviidae). Because dragonflies are active pursuit predators, we hypothesized that they would strengthen pollinator-mediated selection by weakening plant-pollinator interactions (i.e., a density-mediated indirect effect). In contrast, because ambush bugs are sit-and-wait predators, we hypothesized that they would weaken or reverse the direction of pollinator-mediated selection by altering pollinator foraging behavior (i.e., a trait-mediated indirect effect). Specifically, if ambush bugs hunt from plants with traits that attract pollinators (i.e., prey), then pollinators will spend less time visiting those plants, weakening or reversing the direction of selection on attractive floral traits. We did not find evidence that high dragonfly abundance strengthened selection on floral traits via a density-mediated indirect effect: neither pollen limitation (a proxy for the strength of plant-pollinator interactions) nor directional selection on floral traits of L. siphilitica differed significantly between high- and low-dragonfly abundance treatments. In contrast, we did find evidence that ambush bug presence affected selection on floral traits via a trait-mediated indirect effect: ambush bugs hunted from L. siphilitica plants with larger daily floral displays, reversing the direction of pollinator-mediated selection on daily display size. These results suggest that indirect species interactions have the potential to shape adaptive evolution by altering natural selection.

AB  - Salinity is one of the abiotic stressors affecting both upland and wetland ecosystems, yet its influence on invasive plant species and their herbivores in these environments remains poorly understood. Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi, BP) is a problematic tropical and subtropical shrub, widely invasive in parts of the United States (Florida, Texas, and Hawaii), Cuba, Australia, South Africa, and other subtropical regions of the world. The plant is known for its adaptability to various environments, including lower-lying and brackish areas. In 2019, Pseudophilothrips ichini (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae), commonly known as BP thrips, was introduced in Florida as a biological control agent for this invasive weed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of BP grown in brackish habitats on adult emergence, development time, fecundity, and adult longevity of the BP thrips. Brazilian peppertree plants were subjected to varying salinity conditions for two months (control: 0 ppt, low: 10 ppt, medium: 15 ppt, and high: 20 ppt). Twelve first-instar BP thrips were introduced to each BP plant treatment to complete their development into adults. Subsequently, adult thrips were transferred to new plants grown at the same salinity level to assess fecundity and adult longevity. Results indicate that different salinity levels had no significant effect on adult emergence, time of development, or longevity of P. ichini. A negative correlation was observed between increased salinity and average fecundity. A stochastic simulation model predicts, however, that BP thrips have a strong chance of surviving in brackish environments.

AB  - Dietary analyses are particularly useful for developing conservation programmes for species threatened by resource depletion, poisoning and environmental pollution. Gyps vultures in South Asia represent one such case, having undergone a population collapse caused by feeding on carcasses of cattle treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. Following a ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, populations of vultures remain low and mostly concentrated near protected areas. Understanding the role of protected areas in the recovery of these critically endangered species requires analyses of spatial variation in their diet. We used faecal metabarcoding to investigate the spatial variation in the diet of Gyps vultures across four landscapes from sites located inside and outside protected areas. We collected faecal 642 samples, of which 419 yielded adequate molecular data to identify the vulture species and 30 molecular operational taxonomic units corresponding to at least 28 diet species. The diet was dominated by large ungulates and varied across landscapes, protection status and vulture species, with the observed variation largely explained by differential intake of wild and domestic species. Domestic livestock was present in >95 % of the samples from Central, West and North India, but 77 % of the samples had only wild species in South India. This variation was explained by livestock density within 100 km radius of the sampling site. Our results imply that protected areas may not offer a respite from possibility of diclofenac-poisoning across most parts of the country and efforts should continue unabated to remove nephrotoxic drugs from veterinary use.

AB  - Societies have always been occupied with securing food supply and ensure environmental and human health. Scientific knowledge and technical level have, together with habitat and management patterns, shaped sanitation arrangements and recycling of resources. Because it is the same urban problems that are addressed by societies in different historical contexts, a longitudinal study may allow for novel ways to conjure food security and sanitation management issues in the present century. We trace the historical transition over two centuries away from a circular economy to a more linear one in two Swedish cities, the capital Stockholm and the industrial city Norrko & BULL;ping, and show that big but rather slow changes occurred more or less constantly in these two urban settings. The driving forces have changed from only improving local conditions of sanitation and food production over to global and regional driving forces in this century affecting what local communities can or could do. The ongoing globalization positions the subjects of environmental and human health, recycling and food security in a new global perspective, where climate change and global resource boundaries will play a central role. We cannot continue to rely on trade that causes rainforest destruction elsewhere or harmful chemical consumer products that lead to loss of biodiversity and human health risks. We need to put urban sanitation and food issues into this wider perspective with available remedial measures such as dietary changes, food waste reduction, soil less food production and building of new circular infrastructure. All urban areas in the world, including Stockholm and Norrko & BULL;ping in Sweden, need to adopt new strategies that again engage residents as well as public sectors and industry, including agriculture.

AB  - A recent palaeontological excavation in Muierilor Cave, southern Carpathians (Romania), has recovered one of the largest populations of Late Pleistocene wolves ( Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758; MNI = 25) documented in Eurasian cave deposits. Many individual nests with wolf bones, including fully articulated skeletons, were found in a remote passage of the cave suggesting a communal behavior similar to that of modern conspecifics. Radiocarbon dates indicate constant use of the cave by these canids throughout the Marine Isotopic Stages 3 (MIS 3; 59-29 cal ka BP). This deposit affords an opportunity to study the extraordinary resilience and adaptability of C. lupus following the extinction of other large carnivores at the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Using taphonomic, stable isotope and radiocarbon data, we make a case that these canids preyed/scavenged upon the cave bears ( Ursus spelaeus Rosenm & uuml;ller, 1794; MNI = 82) that used the same cave for hibernation, along with other Ice Age megafauna such as cave lions ( Panthera spelaea Goldfuss, 1810; MNI = 4) and cave hyenas ( Crocuta spelaea Goldfuss, 1823; MNI = 3), which were also found in the same bone assemblage.

AB  - Intensive commercial production of burbot fingerlings will depend on consistent supply of eggs and larvae at multiple times during the year; however, no information on out-of-season spawning of burbot exists. The current study was designed to shift sexual maturation of burbot broodstock by six months from the natural spawning season through temperature and photoperiod manipulation. Results demonstrated that out-of-season spawning of burbot was successful. Broodstock, egg quality, and larval condition data were compared between out-of-season and in-season groups. For both production regimes, broodstock were sampled for condition factor and egg production, and embryos were monitored for development, viability, and survival. Larvae were reared to 35 days post hatch (dph) for growth and survival comparison. There was no significant difference in pre-spawn condition factor between in-season and out-of-season males or females. Post-spawn condition factor for out-of-season females was not statistically different from in-season females, 0.83 (+/- 0.06) and 0.66 (+/- 0.07) respectively. However, post-spawn condition factor for out-of-season male broodstock was significantly higher, 0.82 (+/- 0.04), than in-season fish, 0.64 (+/- 0.02). Eggs produced relative to weight of pre-spawn female did not differ significantly between in-season and out-of-season production, 328.5 (+/- 22.95) and 213 (+/- 38.04) eggs/g, respectively. Fertilization did not differ significantly between treatments, averaging 90% for both in and out-of-season production. Egg survival was higher, 61.18% (+/- 9.3), in the final week of incubation for out-of-season groups compare to eggs from in-season broodstock, 20.59% (+/- 10.6). However, no difference in larval growth or survival was observed out to the 35dph termination point. Overall, egg quality and larval survival was not negatively impacted for broodstock spawned out-of-season. This is the first report demonstrating that burbot eggs can be produced outside the natural spawning season by altering photoperiod and temperature. As commercial production of this species develops, this will be an important tool to mitigate the risk of relying on a single annual spawning season and can ensure a consistent supply of burbot fingerlings throughout the year.

AB  - Concerns over environmental impacts resulting from the use of zinc oxide containing medicines for weaning piglets led to the withdrawal of the authorisations for these products in the EU. In order to better understand these issues more detailed assessments were conducted for the UK, taking account of the fate of zinc in the environment and its bioavailability to ecological receptors. Four regional scenarios covered the main pig farming areas in the UK and the emission scenario was based on current agricultural practices in the UK. The fate and transport of zinc in the environment was modelled using the Intermediate Dynamic Model for Metals, and the toxicity of zinc in the environment was assessed based on current UK regulatory practices. The model takes account of historic additions of metals to the soils to calculate current and future metal levels in the environment. Whilst three of the four regional scenarios predicted a marginal risk, or no risk, to soils after 50 years of use one of the scenarios indicated a risk to surface waters prior to the use of zinc oxide medicated treatments for weaning piglets, and risks to local soils within 10 years of use. Further site-specific assessments were conducted for this region and one of the other regions, based on site specific emission scenarios, soil and surface waters characteristics. These two site-specific assessments revealed that the modelling results were accurate or conservative depending on the assumptions made about historic inputs of metals to agricultural soils from manure spreading, and that the regional scenario that resulted in significant predicted risks to surface waters did not reflect the actual conditions at the local pig farming sites considered. Comparisons between measured concentrations of copper and zinc at pig farming sites suggest that historic agricultural inputs have been an important source of these metals to agricultural soils at some sites. The limited data available for validation suggest that the IDMM is able to provide accurate predictions of metal levels in both soils and surface waters, but that there is significant uncertainty associated with historic inputs of metals to the soils.
   The risks to the environment from the use of zinc based veterinary medicines were evaluated for the UK using the Intermediate Dynamic Model for Metals to predict fate and taking account of bioavailability in evaluating risks to ecological receptors.

AB  - The presence of horns in domestic ruminants, such as cattle, sheep and goats, has financial and welfare implications. The genetic interactions that lead to horn development are not known. Hornless, or polled, cattle occur naturally. The known causative DNA variants (Celtic, Friesian, Mongolian and Guarani) are in intergenic regions on bovine chromosome 1, but their functions are not known. It is thought that horns may be derived from cranial neural crest stem cells and the POLLED variants disrupt the migration or proliferation of these cells. Relaxin family peptide receptor 2 ( RXFP2 ) is more highly expressed in developing horns in cattle compared to nearby skin and has been shown to play a role in horn development in sheep. However, the role of RXFP2 in horn formation is not understood. Histological analyses of cranial tissues from homozygous horned and polled cattle fetuses at day 58 of development was carried out to determine the differences in the structure of the horn bud region. Condensed cells were only observed in the horn bud mesenchyme of horned fetuses and could be the progenitor horn cells. The distribution of neural crest markers (SOX10 and NGFR) and RXFP2 between horned and polled tissues by immunohistochemistry was also analysed. However, SOX10 and NGFR were not detected in the condensed cells, and therefore, these cells are either not derived from the neural crest, or have differentiated and no longer express neural crest markers. SOX10 and NGFR were detected in the peripheral nerves, while RXFP2 was detected in peripheral nerves and in the horn bud epidermis. Previous research has shown that RXFP2 variants are associated with horn phenotypes in cattle an sheep. Therefore, the RXFP2 variants may affect the development of the epidermis or peripheral nerves in the horn bud.

AB  - The Pacific longnose parrotfish, Hipposcarus longiceps, is a medium- to large-bodied scarine labrid that is among the most commonly harvested species in mixed reef fisheries across the Indo-Pacific. Despite its ecological and fisheries importance, assessments of stock status and development of appropriate management strategies for the species have been limited by an absence of biological information. To date, the only detailed studies of the biology of H. longiceps have occurred in tropical regions. This study examined the biology of H. longiceps in southern New Caledonia, towards the southernmost extent of the species' distribution. In addition, resulting estimates of longevity and asymptotic length were compared against those derived for the species elsewhere in the Pacific, and regional patterns in these parameters were explored for correlation with sea surface temperature (SST). A total of 212 H. longiceps were collected from commercial fishers or fish markets between September 2015 and March 2017. Sampled individuals ranged from 28.2 cm fork length (L-F) to 57.3 cm L-F, and from 424 g to 3773 g. Examination of sectioned otoliths showed a clear pattern in increment formation, with opaque zones forming annually in most individuals between July and August (i.e., austral winter). Estimated longevities were similar between sexes, at similar to 18 years for females and similar to 19 years for males. These estimates extend the reported longevity of H. longiceps by at least 5 years. Despite this species being a diandric protogynous hermaphrodite, sex ratios were only slightly female biased, with 1 female:0.6 males. Primary males (i.e., those individuals that are male at first sexual maturity) constituted 30% of all sampled individuals and 79% of all males. A clearly defined, yet protracted, spawning season was evident, with peak spawning occurring from December-February, extending from November to April in some individuals. The estimated median length (L-50) and age (A(50)) at female maturity were 38.9 cm L(F )and 5.7 years, respectively, while the estimated length at which females changed sex to secondary males was 52.5 cm L-F. Reported longevity and asymptotic length were found to exhibit considerable regional variation, and both were negatively associated with SST. The results highlight the importance of geographically disparate studies into the species' biology, inform future assessments for the species, provide key baseline information for comparative work and improve understanding of spatial patterns of the life history of parrotfish species.

AB  - This study estimated the length-weight relationships (LWRs) and length-length relationships (LLRs) for 6 fish species in the middle Yangtze River basin and its adjacent lakes (Ochetobius elongatus (Kner 1867), Rhinogobio cylindricus (G & uuml;nther 1888), Hemibagrus macropterus (Bleeker 1870), Pseudobagrus albomarginatus (Rendahl 1928), Siniperca knerii (Garman 1912), and Coreosiniperca roulei (Wu 1930)). All fish specimens were seasonally collected through scientific research monitoring of fishery resources from May 2020 to June 2023. A triple gillnet (with a mesh size of 20-30 mm, a height of 2.0-4.0 m, and a length of 30-50 m) was employed for the capture. The LWRs and LLRs of all specimens were highly significant (p < 0.05), featuring high correlation coefficients (r(2) >= 0.9511). These findings not only enriched the data in FishBase but also offered supplementary references for the management of the Yangtze River during its fishing ban period.

AB  - Hepato-somatic index (HSI) is widely used to indicate fish body condition and level of energy reserves related to feeding/physiology and reproduction. HSI is traditionally obtained by dissection and measurement of liver mass versus body mass, but ultrasound technology may provide a minor invasive method to obtain liver dimensions to estimate the HSI of live fish. Images of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) livers (n = 37) were obtained using ultrasonography, then subsequently dissected, weighed and measured using conventional methods. Four liver measurements (width n = 1 and depth n = 3) were obtained from ultrasound images and compared with corresponding physical width/depth measurements. The relationship between the derived ultrasound width/depth metrics and liver mass was then used to estimate total liver mass (LMU) and LMU values divided by the total body weight of each fish to derive the HSI values (HSIU). The LMU and HSIU values were not significantly different from the original liver mass and associated HSI values. Ultrasound liver depth was the most accurate metric for estimating HSIU values, but a degree of variability was observed. Derived HSIU values varied between maturity stages matching predictions but did not vary by sex or capture location. This non-invasive method can be conducted quickly with minimal stress to fish, with applications to studies measuring HSI in commercially important to endangered species. The framework presented for measuring and estimating ultrasound-derived HSI in live fish provides a baseline that can be improved with further validation work.

AB  - The responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis to stressors is crucial for wild animals to survive and adapt to environmental changes without compromising individual welfare. We analysed the influence of prior weather conditions, seasonality, the influx of ecotourism, and nutrition on stress levels in a wild population of red deer in a Mediterranean hunting reserve in the Pre-Pyrenees, Spain. We used faecal cortisol metabolites as a proxy for physiological and psychological stress, and faecal triiodothyronine metabolites as an indicator of nutritional stress. Faecal analyses were chosen because it is a non-invasive technique that does not alter an individual's behaviour, and it is easy to conduct in a wild population, something which presents added challenges due to the lack of a controlled environment. Our results indicate that prior weather conditions, rather than just seasonality, best explained the variations in these hormones within seasons and among years. On the contrary, the results showed that high levels of the cortisol hormone did not necessarily correspond to low levels of the triiodothyronine hormone. This could be a sign of acute nutritional stress in this population. Finally, we did not find an effect of the ecotourism influx on cortisol levels, suggesting that this deer population tolerates the presence of tourists.
   La capacidad de respuesta del eje hipotalamico-pituitario-adrenal a los factores de estres es crucial para sobrevivir y adaptarse a nuevos cambios ambientales sin comprometer el bienestar individual. Analizamos la influencia de las condiciones climaticas previas, la estacionalidad, la afluencia del ecoturismo y la nutricion sobre los niveles de estres en una poblacion salvaje de ciervo de una reserva nacional de caza mediterranea en el Prepirineo, Espana. Utilizamos metabolitos fecales de cortisol como indicadores del estres fisiologico y psicologico, y metabolitos fecales de T3 como indicadores del estres nutricional. Se eligieron los analisis fecales porque son una tecnica no invasiva que no altera el comportamiento de los individuos y son faciles de realizar en una poblacion salvaje, lo que presenta desafios adicionales debido a la falta de un ambiente controlado. Nuestros resultados indican que las condiciones climaticas anteriores, y no solo la estacionalidad, explicaron mejor las variaciones en estas hormonas dentro de las estaciones y entre anos. Por otro lado, los resultados mostraron que niveles altos de la hormona cortisol no necesariamente se correspondian con niveles bajos de la hormona T3. Esto podria ser un signo de estres nutricional agudo en esta poblacion. Finalmente, no encontramos un efecto de la afluencia de ecoturismo sobre los niveles de cortisol, lo que sugiere que esta poblacion tolera bien la presencia de turistas.

AB  - Herbivores assess predation risk in their environment by identifying visual, chemical, and tactile predator cues. Detection of predator cues can induce risk-avoidance behaviors in herbivores that affect feeding, dispersal, and host selection in ways that minimize mortality and reproductive costs. For herbivores that transmit plant pathogens, including many aphids, changes in herbivore behavior in response to predator cues may also affect pathogen spread. However, few studies have assessed how aphid behavioral responses to different types of predator cues affect pathogen transmission. Here, we conducted greenhouse experiments to assess whether responses of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) to predation risk and alarm pheromone (E-beta-Farnesene), an aphid alarm signal released in response to predation risk, affected transmission of Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV). We exposed A. pisum individuals to risk cues, and quantified viral titer in aphids and pea (Pisum sativum) host plants across several time periods. We also assessed how A. pisum responses to risk cues affected aphid nutrition, reproduction, and host selection. We show that exposure to predator cues and alarm pheromone significantly reduced PEMV acquisition and inoculation. Although vectors avoided hosts with predator cues, predator cues did not alter vector reproduction or reduce nutrient acquisition. Overall, these results suggest that non-consumptive effects of predators may indirectly decrease the spread of plant pathogens by altering vector behavior in ways that reduce vector competence and pathogen transmission efficiency.

AB  - Ladybirds (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are a significant predator group that plays a role in agricultural contexts. They serve as important biocontrol agents against several agricultural pests. However, there is limited information available about how ladybirds' populations are regulated by their natural enemies and habitat perturbation. In this study, we evaluated ladybird communities associated with natural and managed areas during the agricultural cycle of 2018 (June-September). We identified seven ladybird species; the most abundant species were Hippodamia convergens (70% individuals) and Cycloneda sanguinea (20% individuals), followed by the exotic species Harmonia axyridis (3.33% individuals), while Paranaemia vittigera, Coleomegilla maculata, Brachiacantha sp., and Olla v-nigrum represented less than 3% each. Ladybirds were more abundant in agricultural fields than in natural habitats. We identified several natural enemies associated with the collected ladybirds, including parasitoids (Dinocampus coccinellae, Hymenoptera: Braconidae), ectoparasitic Acari (Coccipolipus sp., Podapolipidae), and nematodes (Mermithidae). However, none of the natural enemies affected more than 10% of the ladybirds, so natural enemies do not appear to be exerting substantial control over their populations. Our results corroborated that ladybirds can efficiently thrive in anthropogenic habitats in Mexico and therefore may represent good biocontrol agents for agriculture. It is important to consider the ecology of agriculturally important ladybirds in programs for integrated pest management. This includes factors contributing to the mortality of ladybirds, including their natural enemies.

AB  - The relationship between hydrological variation and the habitat use of waterbirds in wetland complexes is a significant field of ecological research. Quantification of the relationships between wetland hydrological attributes and waterbirds distribution is critical for the success of waterbird conservation. In this study, flood duration (FD) derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was combined with geese GPS tracking data to quantify the optimal FD thresholds for identifying geese habitats. Based on the thresholds, we defined the suitable habitats of wintering geese and investigated the difference in the spatial distribution pattern of habitat from 2018 to 2020 in Poyang Lake, China. We also considered the role of sub-lakes in habitat protection. The results showed that the area of suitable habitats for wintering geese decreased in both dry and wet years, and the range of optimal FD threshold was wider in normal years than in both dry and wet years. The proportion of suitable habitats per unit area was greater in the sub-lakes than in the whole Poyang Lake. We concluded that FD indices extracted from SAR data are valuable for reflecting the influence of the pattern of hydrological variation on waterbird distribution and for the protection and rational use of wetland ecosystems.

AB  - The sustainability of food production systems requires accurate assessments of the combined impacts of climate change and soil fertility on crop yield. However, a knowledge gap remains regarding the interactions of climate and soil fertility for the determination of crop yield and sustainability. For this study, we investigated how climate and soil fertility affected maize yield and its sustainability over a 30-year experiment on red soil. Seven fertilization treatments were selected (CK (no fertilizer), N (chemical nitrogen), NP (chemical nitrogen and phosphorus), NK (chemical nitrogen and potassium), NPK, M (pig manure), and NPKM (NPK and M)). The link between grain yield and the sustainability yield index (SYI) increased exponentially (p < 0.001). Manure (M and NPKM) improved the concentrations of soil nutrients considerably compared to chemical fertilizer treatments (N, NP, NK, and NPK). The explanatory rates of selected climatic and soil parameters for grain yield and its SYI varied from 56.6% to 66.9%. Soil available nutrients (AP and AK) and total nutrients (TN and TP) regulated grain yield and the SYI at low and high soil fertility, respectively. Redundancy analysis showed a negative correlation between temperature throughout the maize growing season, grain yield, and the SYI, excluding the NPKM treatment. Correlations between temperature, grain yield, and the SYI were reduced as soil fertility increased. Climate (44.0%) and nutrient inputs (40.2%) under chemical and manure fertilization contributed the most to the observed yield. Path analysis explained 68% and 77% of the variations in grain yield under chemical fertilizers and manure treatments, respectively. Additionally, the results suggested that as air temperatures are predicted to rise early maize should be planted earlier and late maize should be planted later to optimize grain yield. Together, this study emphasized that improving soil quality and adjusting planting schedules in agricultural management practices can attenuate the negative impact of climate warming on grain yield sustainable production in the global subtropical regions.

AB  - Domestication reduces genetic population variation and changes resource allocation from defense to growth. As an indirect effect of plant domestication, the intraspecific variability of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV) has changed, modifying the odor of cultivated individuals compared to their wild relatives. Inter-individual variation in HIPV may constrain the use of chemical information for host location for insect herbivores or prey for insect predators. As HIPV are frequently considered a non-expensive indirect defense, domestication would probably not affect the correlation between constitutive and induced volatile emission. We tested the hypothesis that plant status, either cultivated or wild, determines the inter-individual variation of HIPV and the correlation between the constitutive and induced emissions amount. We used a before and after experimental approach to control for variation among individuals in constitutive emissions. We analyzed the variability of the induced response (the fold-change in concentration) and the variability in the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitutive and the induced emissions (before and after damage emission) of wild and cultivated tomato accessions (Solanum lycopersicum L.) attacked by nymphs of a tomato pest, the psyllid Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc.) (Hemiptera); we examined the variability of VOCs emission (odor intensity) and odor aroma (the VOCs blend's composition). The volatile constitutive emissions of cultivated accessions were more diverse and had higher inter-individual variation than wild accessions, while the induced emission variation was the same for wild and cultivated plants. We hypothesized that such variability is not a quality signal for herbivores and their natural enemies. The possible causes and ecological consequences of variation of volatile emission due to wild or cultivated status are discussed.

AB  - Unequivocal evidence on the antagonistic effects of endophytic fungi associated with woody plants against insect herbivores has been documented in only a few cases so far. Experimental evidence of the significance of needle endophytes to coniferous trees has remained scant because it is difficult to obtain trees with needles free of endophytes that could be used as comparable controls for trees infected with endophytes. Previously we reported a new methodology to get Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) saplings without needle endophytes and to inoculate them with a needle endophyte Lophodermium piceae (Fuckel) Hohn. Here we describe the first trial where spruce saplings with and without needle endophytes were provided as substrate for insect larvae. We transferred larvae of two sawfly species, Neodiprion sertifer Geoffroy and Gilpina pallida Klug, to the seedlings. Even though the main host of these sawfly species is not Norway spruce, but Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), they are also known to occasionally feed on spruce. In this experiment the larvae did not develop to pupae with the provided spruce substrate but consumed measurable amounts of needles. No significant difference was found between the extent of needles consumed by either of the two sawfly species in inoculated and uninoculated saplings.

AB  - Herbivorous fish are generally considered to be diurnal feeders, but the disappearance of seaweeds at night has been observed in Japan. We conducted field experiments using an infra-red time-lapse camera to identify fish browsing on seaweed at night at two sites on Fukue Island, western Japan. At both sites, brown chub (Kyphosus bigibbus) were photographed around transplanted seaweed from sunset to sunrise, and the seaweed declined after the appearance of K. bigibbus. This study is the first report of nocturnal browsing in a purely herbivorous fish.

AB  - Introduction: Multiple herbicide-resistant Avena fatua L. is common in the Northern Great Plains, USA. This prevalence and the ecological impacts of tillage in this semi-arid agricultural region have created a need for integrated weed management, with a specific knowledge gap in using annual forage crops and targeted grazing for A. fatua suppression. Materials and Methods: A 2-year study in central Montana, USA, assessed A. fatua performance (aboveground biomass, stem density and seed production) in response to seven cropping treatments: (1-4) tall and short spring wheat cultivars crossed with high and low seeding rates, (5-6) annual forage mixture terminated using sheep grazing and simulated haying and (7) tilled fallow. Avena fatua's competitive intensity in wheat and the annual forage mixture was determined using a relative competition intensity index. Results: Avena fatua performance was lowest in tilled fallow, although stem density and seed production did not differ from the grazed annual forage treatment. Response variables were lower in the forage treatments compared with the wheat treatments, and there were no differences among the four fully crossed wheat treatments. Separate analysis of the wheat treatments indicated lower A. fatua biomass and stem density when wheat was sown at a higher rate with no impact of wheat height. Avena fatua competition impacted wheat and forage crops but was more intense for wheat. Conclusion: Tillage was the most effective treatment at reducing A. fatua performance, but annual forage mixtures can be used to resist A. fatua invasion (reduced A. fatua competitive intensity) and limit its performance after invasion. We conclude that crop sequences that combine higher cash crop (wheat) seeding rates and competitive annual forage mixtures may be utilized to manage A. fatua invaded systems, thereby reducing heavy reliance on tillage in the US Northern Great Plains and similar semi-arid regions.

AB  - Of the many features that make frogs and toads unique, vocal sacs are among the most remarkable. Vocal sacs are inflatable, elastic chambers present in adult males of most anurans and are key elements in their social interactions. Traditionally vocal sacs have been associated primarily with acoustic communication, but their functions are currently being reinterpreted, and there is increasing evidence that they play a wider role in anuran biology. We surveyed the anatomical and histological structure of vocal sacs in all major clades of frogs by examining 777 specimens representing 605 species. Herein we characterize the morphological diversity of the three elements that compose the vocal sac: the gular skin, the superficial submandibular musculature, and the internal mucosa. We describe major anatomical patterns and define characters that we optimize on a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis of Anura. Integrating this anatomical information with images and videos of vocalizing frogs, we produce an updated morphological classification that includes 20 patterns of vocal sac morphology, each of which can be diagnosed by internal and external structures. Applying this classification to 4358 species, we discuss major evolutionary trends, taking ontogeny, homology, and multimodal communication into consideration. A single, spherical vocal sac is the most widely distributed vocal sac shape (present in 63% of known species), but some degree of lateralization (bilobate or paired sacs) has evolved in almost all anuran families. Some groups, such as Hylidae and Ranidae, are particularly diverse and contain more than 10 different vocal sac morphologies. Vocal sacs are absent in 18% of anurans and have been lost between 146 and 196 times, an astounding number considering their biological importance. Lastly, we review the morphological diversity and taxonomic relevance of vocal sac structures for each of the 58 families of recent anurans.

AB  - Aquaculture provides approximately 78% of the fish consumed by humans in China. However, the characters of fish cultivars have different deficiencies, and degradation is serious. Less improved varieties of fish are still an important factor restricting the development of aquaculture in China. Interspecific hybridization is an effective method for producing hybrid varieties with desirable traits. In this study, diploid hybrids (BM, 2n = 48) of blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala female, 2n = 48, BSB) x Mongolian culter (Culter mongolicus male, MC, 2n = 48) were obtained by intergeneric crossing. To investigate whether these hybrids have heterobeltiosis, the growth performance, pharyngeal teeth and intestinal traits of BM hybrids were compared with those of their parents (BSB and MC). The average weight of BM hybrids (97.01 +/- 27.52 g) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that of MC (68.04 +/- 12.64 g) and similar to that of BSB (99.33 +/- 16.72 g) at 1 year of age; the average weight of BM hybrids (990.49 +/- 149.21 g) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that of both BSB (895.12 +/- 135.38 g) and MC (625.81 +/- 81.83 g) at 2 years of age. The pharyngeal tooth structure and intestinal traits of BM hybrids were similar to those of BSB, indicating that BM hybrids were biased toward herbivory. This is the first report of a diploid hybrid with a growth advantage and herbivory produced by crossing female BSB and male MC. The new hybrid offspring have great significance in aquatic applications.

AB  - Generating evidence from both successes and failures of conservation interventions is critical for improving our capacity to learn how to design, deliver, evaluate and improve such initiatives. This is particularly imperative for highly-threatened and highly-valued species such as Critically Endangered black rhinoceros, which attract large investments of resources and present a high risk of extinction. The systematic generation and assessment of evidence on what methods and mechanisms work, which do not, and under what circumstances is often poorly described and implemented. We present a synthesis of learnings from more than a decade of designing, delivering, evaluating and improving community-based ranger programs in north-west Namibia. We illustrate how adopting an iterative process tracing methodology to generate evidence that enables teams to track and improve their performance over time can provide a foundation for a collective knowledge bank, an enhanced learning process, and tangible conservation outcomes. We illustrate how harnessing the values of key local participant groups in program design can lead to delivering measurable intermediate results along pathways for engaging local leadership, empowering rangers, and creating income-generating opportunities that, in our case, contributed to a more than 90% reduction in illegal hunting of black rhinoceros. These results manifest with minimal use of conventional militarized law enforcement anti-poaching mechanisms suggesting that, at least in our situation, investing resources into improving the alignment between the value local people attach to protecting rhinoceros and the ways in, and degree to, which a protection programme manifests these values, is an effective, ethical, cost-efficient and socially just strategy. We offer lessons learned synthesized as a mnemonic to "LIVEN" up ranger program to be more locally inclusive and collaborative. Employing fit-for-purpose evaluation methodologies that are focused first and foremost upon internal team learning has become our guiding principle.

AB  - If periodically outbreaking forest insects are a generic source of forest decline, then why do outbreaks recur more periodically than decline episodes? Do standard field survey data and proxy data systematically underestimate the complexity in herbivore population dynamics? We examine three sources of previously un-analyzed time-series data (population, defoliation, and tree-ring radial growth) for the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria Hubner (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) feeding on trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides Michx. (Salicaceae), in Minnesota, in order to answer these questions. Spatial pattern analysis of defoliation data indicated not only that outbreaks are roughly periodic, with a 10-13-y cycle, but also that important deviations from periodic led to large-scale episodes of aspen decline starting in the 1950s and 1960s, near Duluth and International Falls, respectively. By using additional data from Alberta, Canada we identify critical population and defoliation thresholds where defoliation becomes aerially detectable and impactful on tree growth. The threshold where defoliation becomes aerially detectable was found to be similar to 50% defoliation, corresponding to a population density of similar to 12 egg bands per 20 cm DBH tree (or similar to 20 cocoons per 3 min of collection time, or similar to 10 male moths per pheromone trap), and which implies a radial growth reduction on the order of 40%. We found that not all moth population peaks occur above the threshold level where defoliation is aerially detectable. Asynchronous pulses of defoliation-which are difficult to detect-produce asynchronous signatures of outbreak in tree-ring data. When these pulses occur in close conjunction with regular cycling, it can lead to outbreaks of prolonged duration that result in anomalously high tree mortality.

AB  - The relative contribution of aquatic animals to phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) cycles of water bodies can be substantial. Excretion rates can be affected by seasonal environmental conditions, physiology, and body size. Determining the importance of particular species or size classes to total fauna-driven internal recycling of nutrients requires measurements of seasonal mass-specific excretion rates (MSER). We used short-term incubation experiments to estimate the contribution of excretion and egestion by eight species of fish and one macroinvertebrate to water column P and N in Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) used to retain P from water flowing to the Everglades in Florida, U.S.A. To account for environmental conditions and fish physiology, excretion was estimated during day and night in the wet and dry seasons for nine of the most abundant fish and invertebrates found in the STAs. To yield measurable contributions of analytes in short-duration incubations, large-fish species were incubated individually, whereas small-fish species and invertebrates were incubated in single-species groups. For large-fish species, total excreted nutrients were positively correlated with the mass of individual fish, but MSER decreased with increased individual size. All four small species, three fish and invertebrate, excreted P and N at greater MSERs than all five large-fish species. Most MSERs were not correlated with incubated mass (stocked density) of small animals (80%), indicating that there were no density-dependent effects on excretion rates. Most species excreted more N and less P during the South Florida wet season (May to October) though this was not the case for one or more analytes for three of the large species. Most species excreted more during the day, except large herbivores that excreted more at night. Small species excreted higher proportions of particulate P and N, while the larger species had higher proportions of dissolved nutrients. Using measured MSERs and areal biomass estimates for the nine species, we estimated mass of P and N excreted annually. Based on known inflow P and N loads for four STAs, a preliminary and conservative estimate is that fish excretion can recycle between 50% to 92% of the annual total P entering the system and 15% to 29% of the annual total N entering the system. These preliminary results underestimate the actual amounts because they do not account for STA cells that were not sampled, nor known under-estimation of large-fish biomass, as well as other animal effects on nutrient cycles such as bioturbation. Though preliminary, our results suggest that altering aquatic animal abundance or species composition could improve the efficiency of STAs to remove and retain nutrients from inflowing waters.

AB  - Freshwater megafauna populations, which are declining worldwide, are well known but often overlooked and understudied compared with marine and terrestrial megafauna. One species of freshwater megafauna is the Suwannee alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys suwanniensis), which is endemic to the Suwannee River drainage in Georgia and Florida. Several trapping studies have examined M. suwanniensis distribution, body size, and population structure, but little information exists regarding its population status. The objectives of our study were to 1) estimate population size, 2) estimate apparent survival, and 3) model population growth rates (lambda) by conducting a capture-mark-recapture study of M. suwanniensis in the Suwannee River in Florida. From 2011 to 2013, we repeatedly sampled 12 randomly selected 5-km sites along the Suwannee River for M. suwanniensis using baited hoop-net traps. We captured 126 individuals and had 29 recaptures. Both adult males and adult females had very high apparent survival (0.99), whereas juveniles had lower apparent survival (0.32). We estimated a population density of 6.6 turtles/river km, indicating a population of 1709 (95% CI, 1205-2694) M. suwanniensis from the town of White Springs to the upper limit of the estuary in the main stem of the Suwannee River (approximately 259 river km). We constructed 2 postbreeding census matrix population models for M. suwanniensis and incorporated parameters from this study and from the literature. Both matrix population models suggested a slightly decreasing population (lambda = 0.99), but because of the uncertainty around our estimates, we consider the population trend to be unclear. Elasticity analysis revealed that lambda was most sensitive to changes in adult survival compared with other model components. This is a conservation concern because adult M. suwanniensis may be incidentally killed by fishing gear. Our study was short-term, and our analyses had limitations; therefore, we recommend future areas of research, including long-term population monitoring.

AB  - Natural mortality is a population process that commonly varies over time for marine species but is notoriously difficult to estimate within stock assessment models. Starvation-induced mortality rates for temperate fish may be identifiable via tracking fluctuations in body condition, which is a proxy of energy reserves. Here, we investigate if starvation mortality is an important part of the recent, elevated natural mortality rates for the American plaice population on the Newfoundland Grand Banks. Using a spatiotemporal weight-at-length model, we found that American plaice body condition has varied across lengths, space, years, and months. This model identified that declines in condition have been large enough to produce important starvationinduced mortality. The estimated starvation-induced mortality index was correlated with independent estimates of juvenile natural mortality and accounted for much of the process error when integrated into a state-space age-structured assessment model. If the sustained high natural mortality rates that we estimated in recent years persist in the short- to medium-term future, then recovery of American plaice on the Newfoundland Grand Banks during this time-period is unlikely.

AB  - While irradiation with red LED light has been reported to modulate sperm function in different mammalian species, the mechanisms underlying their response are poorly understood. This work sought to provide new insights into whether this effect relies on a direct action upon mitochondrial electron chain and/or on PKC-linked mechanisms such as those related to opsins. For this purpose, pig semen was light-stimulated for 1, 5 or 10 min in the presence/ absence of antimycin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron chain, or PKC 20-28 (R) (PKCi), a PKC inhibitor. Antimycin A completely blocked the effects of light at all the performed irradiation patterns. This effect was linked to a complete immobility of sperm, which was accompanied with a significant (p < 0.05) drop in several markers of mitochondrial activity, such as JC-1 staining and O-2 consumption rate. Antimycin A, however, did not affect intracellular ATP levels, intramitochondrial calcium, total ROS, superoxides or cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) activity. In the case of PKCi, it did also counteract the effects of light on motility, O-2 consumption rate and CCO activity, but not to the same extent than that observed for antimycin A. Finally, the effects observed when sperm were co-incubated with antimycin A and PKCi were similar to those observed with antimycin A alone. In conclusion, red LED light acts on sperm function via a direct effect on mitochondrial electron chain. Additionally, light-activated PKC pathways have a supplementary effect to that observed in the electron chain, thereby modulating sperm parameters such as motility and CCO activity.

AB  - Salinization is a significant global issue causes irreversible damage to plants by reducing osmotic potential, inhibiting seed germination, and impeding water uptake. Seed germination, a crucial step towards the seedling stage is regulated by several hormones and genes, with the balance between abscisic acid and gibberellin being the key mechanism that either promotes or inhibits this process. Additionally, mucilage, a gelatinous substance, is known to provide protection against drought, herbivory, soil adhesion, and seed sinking. However, limited information is available on the structure and thickness of seed mucilage in halophytes under different salinity conditions. In this study, the mucilage structure of the extreme halophyte Schrenkiella parvula was compared with the glycophyte Arabidopsis thaliana in response to salinity. We found differences in the expression levels of genes such as ABI5, RGL2, DOG1, ENO2, and DHAR2, which are involved in seed germination and antioxidant activity, as well as in the mucilage structure of seeds of S. parvula and A. thaliana seeds at different salt concentrations. The responses of seed germination of S. parvula to salinity indicate that it is more salt-tolerant than A. thaliana. Additionally, it was found that S. parvula mucilage decreased under salt conditions but not under mannitol conditions, whereas in A. thaliana mucilage did not change under both conditions, which is one of the adaptation strategies of S. parvula to salt conditions. We believe that these fundamental analyzes will provide a foundation for future molecular and biochemical studies comparing the responses of crops and halophytes to salinity stress.

AB  - High-resolution bioclimatic data are crucial to providing fine-scaled insights into biodiversity assessment, forestry, and agricultural management. Existing global bioclimatic datasets often exhibit kilometer-level coarse resolution or have miss the data in recent decades, potentially resulting in the issues of lower spatial accuracy, limited information, and restricted applicability in fine-scaled studies. Hubei Province in Yangtze River Middle Reaches has sparse meteorological stations in high-altitude mountainous areas to map the high-resolution bioclimatic variables directly. This study developed a 30-year averaged bioclimatic dataset for Hubei Province during 1991-2020 at a 30-m spatial resolution, utilizing monthly temperatures and precipitation derived from a downscaling-calibration framework. The downscaling of 1-km resolution climate variables was achieved by using a random forest model with 30-m resolution terrain and spatial covariates. Then, the geographical differential analysis was applied to improve the accuracy of downscaled products by including additional ground data. The mean absolute errors of calibrated monthly maximum, mean, minimum temperatures, and precipitation based on ordinary kriging decreased from 0.74(degrees)C, 0.47 C-degrees, 0.47 C-degrees, and 28.27 mm to 0.43 C-degrees, 0.28 C-degrees, 0.36 C-degrees, and 21.43 mm, respectively. Finally, calibrated climate variables were employed to calculate 19 annual bioclimatic variables, which were subsequently averaged over the 30-year period. The constructed bioclimatic dataset exhibits high overall consistency with the WorldClim dataset according to pixel-based comparison (Spearman correlation coefficients >0.6), with differences mainly attributed to the superior local accuracy of our dataset and climate changes. The dataset will provide fine-scaled, updated, and reliable data supports for local-related studies and decision making.

AB  - We investigated reproductive behavior and sexual patterns in two odacid fish-Rainbow cale Heteroscarus acroptilus and Herring cale Olisthops cyanomelas-inhabiting temperate reefs in Australia on the basis of underwater observations and histological studies. The males of both species established a territory and continuously courted females they encountered in the territory. The males and females went up in the water column to release gametes in pairs. We found ovarian cavities in the gonadal tissue of H. acroptilus males, suggesting that protogynous sex change occurred in this species. Dichromatism is reported in O. cyanomelas, with males having a dark blue body color while females have a brown body color; however, we found small mature males also included among brown individuals. Furthermore, we diagnosed O. cyanomelas with gonochorism, which is rare in closely related labrids. We compared the similarities and differences in reproductive behavior and sexual patterns between the two species and with labrids.

AB  - From December 2012 to June 2014, 796 Pacific guitarfish were caught in 183 fishing sets in northern Peru. Catch occurred in 86.3% of sets. Most individuals caught were mature with a bias toward males. The mean total length for females and males was 83.4 cm, and 91.1 cm, respectively. The capture per unit effort (CPUE) was 12.6 +/- 3.4 guitarfish (km.12 h)(-1). The length-weight relationships showed that this species presents a sexual dimorphism in growth. These results support the importance of Sechura Bay as a key area for this species. This study represents the first species-specific fishery data for the Pacific guitarfish.

AB  - Simple Summary The Analysis of genomic data is an important resource for the effective management of small and endangered populations. The aim of this work was to study the genomic structure of a local goat named Mascaruna. Overall, the results indicate moderate genetic variability and a defined population structure and represent a starting point for the creation of monitoring and conservation plans. Italy contains a large number of local goat populations, some of which do not have a recognized genetic structure. The "Mascaruna" is a goat population reared for milk production in Sicily. In this study, a total of 72 individuals were genotyped with the Illumina Goat_IGGC_65K_v2 BeadChip with the aim to characterize the genetic diversity, population structure and relatedness with another 31 Italian goat populations. The results displayed a moderate level of genetic variability for Mascaruna, in concordance with the estimated values for Italian goats. Runs of homozygosity islands are linked to genes involved in milk production, immune response and local adaptation. Population structure analyses separated Mascaruna from the other goat populations, indicating a clear genetic differentiation. Although they are not conclusive, our current results represent a starting point for the creation of monitoring and conservation plans. Additional analyses and a wider sampling would contribute to refine and validate these results. Finally, our study describing the diversity and structure of Mascaruna confirms the usefulness of applied genomic analyses as valid tools for the study of the local uncharacterized genetic resources.

AB  - Animal production generates gas emissions. It is imperative to reduce them as projections suggest that emissions will continue to increase with rising temperatures, alongside the intensification of agriculture to meet global food demand. Slurry acidification in-house can reduce these emissions. In this study, an acidification technology was installed in a pig-fattening barn to evaluate the influence of the addition of a mixture of organic acids, mainly lactic acid and glycolic acid, on NH3 and GHG emissions. A total of 384 pigs were allocated to four experimental rooms, two with additive applied to the slurry pits by a spraying system and two as a control. In high-temperature conditions, the spraying system discharged additive over the slurry which, in contrast with other systems, was stored inside the rooms during the whole trial. The concentration of NH3 and GHG, the temperature, and the air extraction rate were measured continuously. A significant reduction in the emissions of the gases evaluated was achieved. NH3 emissions were reduced by 26.8%, CH4 by 23.6%, N2O by 25.0%, and CO2 by 28.7%. The role of the dynamic spraying system is considered essential to prevent the acidification effect being reversed by the buffering effect of the slurry itself.

AB  - A number of invasive plant species, such as Alternanthera philoxeroides, have been documented to be able to accumulate trace metal elements in their tissues. Since metal accumulation in plants can serve as a defence against herbivores, we hypothesized that metal pollution will increase herbivore resistance of metal-accumulating invasive plant species and such a benefit will grant them a competitive advantage over local co-occurring plants. In this study, we compared the differences in plant growth and herbivore feeding preference between A. philoxeroides and its native congener Alternanthera sessilis in single and mixed cultures with and without soil cadmium (Cd) pollution. The results showed that A. philoxeroides plants were more tolerant to Cd stress and accumulated more Cd in the leaves than A. sessilis. Cd exposure increased the resistance of A. philoxeroides against a specialist and a generalist herbivore compared with A. sessilis. Competition experiments indicated that Cd stress largely increased the competitive advantage of A. philoxeroides over A. sessilis with or without herbivore pressures. The differences in herbivore resistance between the two plant species under soil Cd stress are most likely due to the deterring effect of Cd accumulation and Cd-enhanced mechanical defences rather than changes in leaf specialized metabolites.
   Soil cadmium pollution largely increased the resistance of the invasive weed A. philoxeroides against both a generalist and a specialist herbivore, giving it a competitive advantage over the local competitor A. sessilis regardless of the presence or absence of herbivore pressure.

AB  - Simple Summary Given the high economic and qualitative values of local-breed meat products, it is not uncommon that substitution or mislabeling (either fraudulent or accidental) occurs at the market level. Therefore, to protect the interests of both producers and consumers, a reliable traceability tool should be developed. Nowadays, traceability usually relies on physical labeling systems (e.g., ear tags, tattoos, or electronic transponders). These systems do not, however, have good performances when dealing with carcasses or processed meat products. Molecular markers (i.e., based on the DNA sequence) can be a solution, since DNA is easily extracted from a wide variety of animal products and parts, and is not degraded during processing, even at the high temperatures involved. The aim of this study was to identify a small number of DNA mutations for breed-traceability purposes, in particular of the Italian Nero Siciliano pig and its derived products. A small panel of 12 DNA mutations was enough to discriminate Nero Siciliano pigs from other pig breeds and from wild boars. Food authentication in local breeds has important implications from both an economic and a qualitative point of view. Meat products from autochthonous breeds are of premium value, but can easily incur fraudulent or accidental substitution or mislabeling. The aim of this study was to identify a small number of SNPs using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip for breed traceability, in particular of the Italian Nero Siciliano pig and its derived products. A panel of 12 SNPs was sufficient to discriminate Nero Siciliano pig from cosmopolitan breeds and wild boars. After adding 8 SNPs, the final panel of 20 SNPs allowed us to discriminate all the breeds involved in the study, to correctly assign each individual to its breed, and, moreover, to discriminate Nero Siciliano from first-generation hybrids. Almost all livestock breeds are being genotyped with medium- or high-density SNP panels, providing a large amount of information for many applications. Here, we proposed a method to select a reduced SNP panel to be used for the traceability of pig breeds.

AB  - Nestboxes have been deployed for parrots and cockatoos (Psittaciformes) worldwide, but there is limited evidence of their efficacy for these species. We examined the use of nestboxes by endangered South Australian Glossy Black Cockatoos Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus, a habitat specialist that feeds almost solely on the seeds of Drooping Sheoak Allocasuarina verticillata trees, and investigated the factors that influenced nestbox use. Between 1998 and 2017, the mean annual proportion of nesting attempts that successfully fledged a chick was similar in nestboxes (52%, n = 547) and natural hollows (53%, n = 627). Nestbox use increased over time, which may reflect changes in the size and extent of the Glossy Black Cockatoo population over the study period. Nestboxes were more likely to be used by Glossy Black Cockatoos if they were close to the nest of another breeding pair and were not occupied by Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos Zanda funerea early in the breeding season. Nestboxes were also more likely to be used if they had been used in the previous breeding season, indicating nest-site fidelity. The amount of A. verticillata feeding habitat in a 1-km and 5-km radius did not significantly influence nestbox use. Our study provides further evidence of the value of nestboxes to cockatoo conservation programmes, but also suggests that multiple factors other than local food availability influence uptake by a target species. Given that Glossy Black Cockatoos prefer to aggregate their nests, nestboxes for this species are most likely to be beneficial when they are used to expand the capacity of existing breeding areas or are clustered in the landscape. Our study demonstrates that well-designed nestbox deployments should consider the preferred social groupings of cockatoos during the breeding season, and the location of competitor species, in order to maximize nestbox uptake.

AB  - In central Europe, wolves Canis lupus prey on wild ungulates -main game species and occasionally kill livestock. The recovery of wolf population across the continent coincides with an increasing incidence of illegal killing, which level remains unknown. We analysed the illegal killing of wolves in Poland, where the species is strictly protected since 1998. We opportunistically collected data on wolves illegally shot and snared from 2002 to 2020, revealing their geographical extent and sex and age structure. Furthermore, we estimated their mortality rate due to illegal shooting on the basis of 16 GPS/GSM collared individuals between 2014 and 2020. We recorded 54 illegally shot and 37 snared wolves. The majority (63.7%) were killed between 2017 and 2020, mostly in Western Poland. The sex structure was similar between shot and snared individuals. In both groups, the wolves over one-year old prevailed, although there were 18 pups among shot wolves. We identified 6 shot and 3 snared breeders. Out of 16 GPS/GSM collared individuals, six were shot giving the mortality rate of 0.33 per year. Simulations revealed that the pooled number of wolves illegally shot in Poland annually, is between 147 and 1134 (99% highest density interval) or 216 and 1000 (95%). In six out of seven cases, in which the person who shot a wolf was eventually sentenced, hunters were responsible. We conclude that the present regulations concerning the prevention of illegal killing, pursuing and punishing the perpetrators of the illegal killing of wolves, require urgent improvements in order to effectively mitigate the problem.

AB  - Cocaine use disorder is a serious, chronic and relapsing disease of the nervous system, for which effective treatments do not yet exist. Recently, the role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit GluN2B has been highlighted in cocaine abstinence followed by extinction training. Since the GluN2B subunit is stabilized at synaptic level by the interaction with its scaffolding protein PSD95, in this study we aimed at investigating efficacy of Tat-NR2B9c peptide, a PSD95 inhibitor, which disrupts the interaction of PSD95 with GluN2B, in the attenuation of cocaine seeking-behavior or cue-induced reinstatement. We found that Tat-NR2B9c, administered intravenously, attenuated the reinstatement of active lever presses induced by a priming dose of cocaine or by drug-associated conditioned stimuli. At the same time, the GluN2B/PSD95 complex levels were decreased in the ventral hippocampus of rats that previously self-administered cocaine injected with Tat-NR2B9c during cocaine or cue-induced reinstatement. In conclusion, we here provide the first evidence showing that the disruption of the GluN2B/PSD95 complexes during cocaine abstinence followed by extinction training may represent a useful strategy to reduce reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior.

AB  - Composting is a nature-based method used to stabilize organic matter and to transform nitrogen from animal farm manure or solid fraction of slurry (SFS). The use of composted material as source of nutrients for agriculture is limited by its potential to facilitate the propagation of biological hazards like pathogens and antibioticresistant bacteria and their associated antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG). We show here an experimental onfarm composting (one single batch) of pig SFS, performed under realistic conditions (under dry continental Mediterranean climate) for 280 days, and using two different bulking agents (maize straw and tree pruning residues) for the initial mixtures. The observed reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria (80-90%) and of ARG loads (60-100%) appeared to be linked to variations in the microbiome composition occurring during the first 4 months of composting, and concurrent with the reduction of water-soluble ammonium and organic matter loads. Nitrification during the composting has also been observed for both composting piles. Similar patterns have been demonstrated at small scale and the present study stresses the fact that the removal can also occur at full scale. The results suggest that adequate composition of the starting material may accelerate the composting process and improve its global performance. While the results confirm the sanitization potential of composting, they also issue a warning to limit ARG loads in soils and in animal and human gut microbiomes, as the only way to limit their presence in foodstuffs and, therefore, to reduce consumers' exposure.

AB  - Ecological breakdowns are posing many serious threats to the lives of both humans and wild animals in the spaces where those lives are shared. Today the intensification of conservation-related conflict is one of the main ecological challenges faced in the Western Ghats of India. This article explores some of the complex interactions between different groups of people, such as wealthy farmers, small-scale farmers, and Adivasi (indigenous) people, and Asian elephants and suggests potentially non-conflictual approaches to sharing spaces with these elephants. The study used a multispecies ethnographic approach as a primary research method and focused on detailed stories and anecdotes narrated by the inhabitants of the study area who had long experience of living with these elephants and who frequently encountered them. Based on insights offered by the stories and anecdotes, the article argues that the lives of elephants and those of people are deeply and intimately interconnected and co-constructed in the study area; such 'naturecultures' of elephants and humans constitute a complex whole. The stories highlight that most people in the study area know that elephants have agency and are intelligent, emotional beings, and can subvert human attempts to control them. According to local people, each individual elephant possesses a distinct personality: some are good, some are quarrelsome, and some are bad. People believe that, just as human beings do, elephants also perceive and respond to individual humans differently; such beliefs, and the stories created out of them, are non-anthropocentric in nature. Overall, this article explores how understanding, and treating seriously, the concepts, beliefs, and experiences of multidimensional elephant agency can be beneficial for envisioning possible new ways for human-elephant coexistence.

AB  - Kidney-type glutaminase, encoded by the gls1 gene, plays a critical role in glutamate production and improvement of meat flavor. In this study, a gls1 gene encoding 595 amino acids was cloned from triploid crucian carp (Carassius auratus) (TCC) and showed a high similarity with the gls1 gene found in Cyprinus carpio, Sinocyclocheilus rhinocerous and Puntigrus tetrazona. Comparing the abundance of gls1 in different tissues, we found its expression level in the brain and liver were significantly higher than that in heart, gut, kidney, spleen and muscle. gls1 expression in the brain reached the highest value. In addition, the expression levels of gls1 also appeared different in diurnal variation, with the highest expression seen at 9:00, while it was low at 3:00, 6:00, 15:00 and 24:00. Furthermore, dietary regulation of gls1 expression was investigated in our study. In each feeding trial, each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate tanks. Fish were fed one of the tested diets up to satiation twice daily. The results showed that gls1 expression increased in 32% protein group and decreased in 35-41% protein group. The results of different protein source experiments showed that the expression of gls1 gene in the mixed protein group (the control group) was significantly higher than that in the fish meal and soybean meal groups. Glutamate treatment revealed that appropriate concentrations (0.10 mg/mL in vivo and 2.00% in vitro) of glutamate remarkably improved the expression of gls1. Besides, diets supplemented with 0.80-1.60% lysine-glutamate dipeptide exhibited a down regulatory impact on gls1 expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the expression of gls1 in TCC was increased by 32% protein diet, mixed protein source diet and diet with 2.00% glutamate concentration, while decreased by 0.80-1.60% lysine-glutamate dipeptide. The findings of this study provide a reference for the regulation of gls1 and have a potential application in the optimization of dietary formula in aquaculture.

AB  - The innate immune system plays an important role in the immune responses of fish, particularly in immunodeficient seahorses, which are vulnerable to infection. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary adaptation of the Toll-like receptor 5 signaling in the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) and the physiological and molecular responses of seahorse to bacterial and parasitic tapeworm infections. Four sites under positive selection among three genes, hsp70, tlr5, and tak1, showed Bayes Empirical Bayes values >0.95. The respiratory rate of H. erectus increased after being challenged with Vibrio and Scalithrium. Stress-induced expression of hsp60 and hsp70, which can bind PAMP molecules and modulate PAMP-induced Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, was significantly upregulated in immune organs such as the gill, intestine, kidney, and liver. Additionally, the MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathway of H. erectus was activated in response to both bacterial and parasitic infections. The expression profiles of TLR signaling molecules revealed that these molecules mediate immune processes and act against various pathogens. These results improve our understanding of the functional role of key genes involved in PAMP-mediated signaling and provide theoretical support for the prevention and control of diseases in cultured seahorses.

AB  - Simple Summary Fat metabolism is an important research topic in sheep, and tail fat tissue is usually used as the study material in the fat metabolism of sheep. The liver is also a major fat metabolism organ, and there are many studies on fat metabolism in the livers of chickens, ducks, pigs, and cattle, but studies on the livers of sheep are still fairly rudimentary. In this study, we investigated the liver transcriptome difference between Hu sheep and Tibetan sheep. We reported the differentially expressed genes in the livers of two sheep breeds using RNA-seq technology and identified fat-metabolism-related genes, including ACSLs, CPT1s, and FGF21. We further verified the relative expression levels of genes that are significant and stably expressed on liver fat metabolism at the mRNA and protein levels; then, we described the details of how these genes regulate fat metabolism. The results revealed the difference in fat metabolism between the two sheep breeds. Hu sheep and Tibetan sheep are two commonly raised local sheep breeds in China, and they have different morphological characteristics, such as tail type and adaptability to extreme environments. A fat tail in sheep is the main adipose depot in sheep, whereas the liver is an important organ for fat metabolism, with the uptake, esterification, oxidation, and secretion of fatty acids (FAs). Meanwhile, adaptations to high-altitude and arid environments also affect liver metabolism. Therefore, in this study, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology was used to characterize the difference in liver fat metabolism between Hu sheep and Tibetan sheep. We identified 1179 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Q-value < 0.05) between the two sheep breeds, including 25 fat-metabolism-related genes. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, 16 pathways were significantly enriched (Q-value < 0.05), such as the proteasome, glutamatergic synapse, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. In particular, one of these pathways was enriched to be associated with fat metabolism, namely the thermogenesis pathway, to which fat-metabolism-related genes such as ACSL1, ACSL4, ACSL5, CPT1A, CPT1C, SLC25A20, and FGF21 were enriched. Then, the expression levels of ACSL1, CPT1A, and FGF21 were verified in mRNA and protein levels via qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis between the two sheep breeds. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of these three genes were higher in the livers of Tibetan sheep than those of Hu sheep. The above genes are mainly related to FAs oxidation, involved in regulating the oxidation of liver FAs. So, this study suggested that Tibetan sheep liver has a greater FAs oxidation level than Hu sheep liver. In addition, the significant enrichment of fat-metabolism-related genes in the thermogenesis pathway appears to be related to plateau-adaptive thermogenesis in Tibetan sheep, which may indicate that liver- and fat-metabolism-related genes have an impact on adaptive thermogenesis.

AB  - Introduction Renewal of extinguished responses is associated with higher activity in specific extinction-relevant brain regions, i.e., hippocampus (HC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC). HC is involved in processing of context information, while IFG and vmPFC use such context information for selecting and deciding among competing response options. However, it is as yet unknown to what extent trials with changed versus unchanged outcome, or extinction trials that evoke renewal (i.e., extinction context differs from acquisition and test context: ABA trials) and trials that do not (i.e., same context in all phases: AAA trials) are represented differentially in extinction-relevant brain regions.Methods In this study, we applied representational similarity analysis (RSA) to determine differences in neural representations of these trial types and their relationship to extinction error rates and renewal level.Results Overall, individuals with renewal (REN) and those without (NoREN) did not differ significantly in their discrimination levels between ABA and AAA extinction trials, with the exception of right posterior HC, where REN exhibited more pronounced context-related discrimination. In addition, higher dissimilarity of representations in bilateral posterior HC, as well as in several IFG regions, during extinction learning was linked to lower ABA renewal rates. Both REN and NoREN benefitted from prediction error feedback from ABA extinction errors for context- and outcome-related discrimination of trials in IFG, vmPFC, and HC, but only the NoREN group also benefitted from error feedback from AAA extinction errors.Discussion Thus, while in both groups the presence of a novel context supported formation of distinct representations, only in NoREN the expectancy violation of the surprising change of outcome alone had a similar effect. In addition, only in NoREN context-related discrimination was linked to error feedback in vmPFC. In summary, the findings show that context- and outcome-related discrimination of trials in HC, vmPFC, and IFG is linked to extinction learning errors, regardless of renewal propensity, and at the same time point towards differential context processing strategies in REN and NoREN. Moreover, better discrimination of context-related trials during extinction learning promotes less renewal during extinction recall, suggesting that renewal may be related to suboptimal context-related trial discrimination.

AB  - Aim of the study
   In the years 1995-1999, at 21 sites within the broadly understood center of Poznan, research on the development of chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum L. was carried out. As part of this research, selected environmental factors were analysed. The aim was to become familiar with the conditions of tree development in the urban and industrial agglomeration of Poznan.
   Material and methods
   Knowledge of tree development limiting factors in urban conditions allows to take actions that will eliminate them or limit their negative impact on the development of trees, including their biometric parameters. The implementation of such actions will neutralise or compensate for undesirable processes in the urban environment. As a consequence, it will allow for unlimited environment-generating functions by trees such as: CO2 assimilation, oxygen release, water vapour transpiration, dust retention, phytoncide production or noise suppression.
   Results and conclusions
   Research on the development of 35 chestnut trees at 21 streets included: seasonal periodicity of trees, recording air temperature and humidity, physico-chemical analysis of the substrate, biometric measurements and, at eight sites, selected physiological parameters, such as photosynthesis and transpiration. In total, over 17,000 numerical data about the environment were collected. The graphs in this paper present mainly the relationship between environmental parameters and biometric measurements at a highly significant level in terms of statistics, i.e. for p = 0.01.

AB  - Grass carp, a globally important aquaculture species, is known for its rapid growth. To explore the genetic basis of this trait, we generated a population through gynogenesis and hybridization with a wild population, resulting in diverse growth traits. To identify genetic variants associated with growth, we performed whole-genome resequencing and transcriptome profiling of 28 individuals from this population. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed 538 SNPs linked to growth traits. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified shared regulatory modules in liver and muscle tissues, highlighting the coordinated regulation of growth across these tissues. Interestingly, we observed that genes within the same module, such as igf1, wnt1, and wnt9b in the liver, and igf1ra, igf1rb, fzd1, and fzd9b in the muscle, are expressed in extracellular and cell membrane compartments, respectively. This suggests a potential coordinated regulation of growth traits between liver and muscle tissues. To further dissect the regulatory mechanisms, we conducted expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. This analysis identified both cis- and trans-eQTLs for numerous growthrelated genes in both liver and muscle tissues. Our findings provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture of growth in grass carp, shedding light on the potential interplay between digestion and growth in herbivorous fish. These insights have significant implications for the development of strategies to improve growth performance and enhance aquaculture practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND Meeting the energy and nitrogen (N) requirements of high-performing ruminants at the same time as avoiding digestive disturbances (i.e. rumen acidosis) is a key priority in ruminant nutrition. The present study evaluated the effect of a cereal ammoniation treatment, in which barley grains are combined with urea and enzymes that catalyze the conversion of urea to ammonia to optimize rumen function. Twelve rumen cannulated sheep were randomly divided into two groups and fed a diet containing 60% of ammoniated barley (AMM) or untreated barley supplemented with urea (CTL) to investigate the impact on rumen fermentation and feed utilization.
   RESULTS AMM had higher total N content and effective rumen degradable N than untreated barely. AMM sheep had a consistently higher rumen pH throughout the day (6.31 versus 6.03) and tended to have a lower post-prandial ammonia peak and higher acetate molar proportion (+5.1%) than CTL sheep. The rumen environment in AMM sheep favored the colonization and utilization of agro-industrial by-products (i.e. orange pulp) by the rumen microbes leading to a higher feed degradability. AMM sheep also had higher total tract apparent N digestibility (+21.7%) and urinary excretion of purine derivatives (+34%), suggesting a higher N uptake and microbial protein synthesis than CTL sheep.
   CONCLUSION The inclusion of AMM in the diet of ruminants represents a valid strategy for maintaining rumen pH within a physiological range and improving N utilization by the rumen microbes, which could have positive effects on the health and productivity of animals in intensive production systems. These findings warrant further studies under conventional farm conditions. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Sustainable agricultural development is a topic of global concern aiming at satisfying food demand of the growing population while reducing impact on environment. Circular agriculture has become a promising development pattern with the advantages of complementing environmental resources, replacing feedback from outside system, and processing waste of bottom of system, etc. This study combined economic analysis, life cycle assessment and emergy accounting to evaluate sustainability of an integrated maize-pig system (IS) driven by indigenous microbes in Northeast China, compared with separated maize and pig system (SS). IS reduced input of concentrate feed, coal, vaccines, disinfectants, fertilizer and labor by 14.35%, 100%, 46.11%, 100%, 60.1% and 60.8% driven by indigenous microbes. Economic analysis results showed that IS has 82.88% higher profit than that of SS. The sum of potential environmental impacts of IS was lower than SS for 80.65% according to lifecycle assessment. The emergy results revealed that IS performed better sustainability. Internal feedback emergy for fertilizer and local resources for maize straw increasing of IS significantly improved emergy efficiency. The reduction resulted in nonrenewable resources decreased 33.01% than that of SS, and increased renewable resources by 67.81%, which reduced environmental load ratio of IS by 60.08% of IS. Meanwhile, these factors were the primary factors generating higher sustainability of IS. Overall, the integrated maize-pig system driven by indigenous microbes in this study can effectively alleviate the problems caused by agricultural waste and promote sustainable agricultural development.

AB  - Macrocystis pyrifera reaches distant areas after detachment, accumulate heavy metals, and serve as trophic subsidy. In this context, effects on both adults and larvae of Tetrapygus niger fed with polluted kelps were determined by assessing growth, fertility, and early larval development. Results revealed that sea urchins fed with polluted kelps from highly impacted zone (HIZ) showed a lower growth (3.6% gained weight) and gamete release (358 cells mL-1) than those fed with non-impacted kelps (NIZ) (19.3% and 945 cells mL-1). The HIZ treatment showed a developmental delay in comparison to NIZ, accounted mainly by the abundance of malformed 2-arm pluteus larvae (10-15%) during most of the culture. Malformed 4-arm pluteus larvae showed a constant increase, reaching 37% at the end of the culture. Thus, the pollutants ingested by sea urchins can be transferred to their offspring and cause negative effects in their early development, categorizing M. pyrifera as a pollutant carrier.

AB  - BackgroundThe invasion of apple snails (Pomacea spp.) has a serious negative impact on the yield of aquatic crops, including rice, which is a vital food source for more than half of the global population and irreplaceable in maintaining the global food security of human society. So far, it has been unclear whether jasmonic acid (JA) application can enhance the effects of silicon addition on the defense of crops like rice against the invasion of apple snails. Rice plants were grown in a greenhouse and subjected to treatments involving the addition of silicon (sodium silicate) and JA (methyl jasmonate). Then, in an indoor experiment, apple snails were fed with the leaves of the rice plants that had undergone the treatments. Growth and growth-related traits for rice plants and apple snails and defense-related mechanic characters for rice plants were measured.ResultsSilicon addition significantly increased rice growth, leading to improved biomass and relative chlorophyll content. JA application did not affect the growth of rice plants but increased their foliar nitrogen and carbon content disproportionally, leading to a reduced C/N ratio. JA application increased the levels of tannins, total phenolics, and flavonoids in rice leaves. Silicon addition increased the tannin, total phenolic, and flavonoid content in rice leaves, particularly when supplied with JA. Silicon addition could also enhance the force of fracture in rice leaves. In addition, the foliar sulfur and silicon content increased with the addition of silicon, and the combination of silicon addition and JA application resulted in the highest foliar silicon content. Both silicon addition and JA application significantly decreased weight gain, leaf consumption, relative growth rate, and cellulase activity of apple snails, indicating a strong interaction.ConclusionsOverall, these findings indicated that both silicon addition and JA application enhanced the defense of rice against apple snails and impeded the growth of these snails. JA application amplified the impact of silicon addition on rice's defense mechanism. This study provides new insights into controlling biological invasions and their impact on crop yield.

AB  - Harvest data have the potential to be used as an abundance index due to its widespread availability and long-term collection across large geographical areas. However, challenges such as the lack of hunting effort information, varying data resolutions and reporting biases hinder its direct use as an abundance proxy. Here, we present the game target-group, a statistical approach based on a thinned inhomogeneous Poisson point process, to estimate animal abundance at fine-scale resolution from hunting data. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical framework to borrow information from harvest data on related species to overcome issues due to the lack of hunting management information. We conducted a simulation study to explore model performance and parameter identifiability under different scenarios (sample size, species catchability/abundance and unmodelled heterogeneity) and assessed the method on a real case study with four species in central Spain. The simulation study confirmed that with a large enough sample size (n > 5000), high catchability and lack of unmodelled heterogeneity in the abundance process, the model was able to obtain unbiased estimations for total abundance parameters. In the case study, our model successfully captured species-habitat relationships and produced reliable estimates of total abundance at regional scale. Internal validation with independent test data and external validation with fieldwork data confirmed the model's ability to predict hunting yields and estimate species total abundance accurately. Our approach provides a flexible and valuable tool for large-scale monitoring programs relying on harvest data with potential applications in wildlife management and conservation. However, the method should be applied with caution when there is unmodelled heterogeneity, low catchability or the sample size is small (<5000).

AB  - The geographic mosaic model of plant-herbivore coevolution asserts that interactions between a plant species and an herbivore species vary in intensity among populations across the plant's geographic range. Despite this model's intuitive appeal, data to investigate its implications for the type of complex, multiple-herbivore communities that occur in nature are scant. This paper reports on the results of 2 years of field surveys of damage by five leaf herbivores and one stem herbivore in four Solanum carolinense (horsenettle) populations, combined with results of a common-garden study quantifying the mean resistance levels of the plants from each field against each of the six herbivores. The relative amounts of damage caused by each species (representing the "herbivore-community structure") differed significantly among the four fields. The plants were much more heavily damaged in the 2nd year than in the first, but the herbivore-community structure remained stable within each field between years. Overall, the amount of damage by species of herbivores in a field tended to be positively correlated with the plants' levels of resistance that were measured in the common garden (r = 0.40, P = 0.05). Specifically, for five of the six herbivores, greater damage in the field was associated with greater plant resistance. This result suggests that horsenettle's evolution of resistance against specific herbivores can occur rather quickly within fields, creating a local-scale mosaic of populations specifically adapted to the particular structure of the herbivore community that they are facing, but that herbivore-community structure is not strongly determined by plant resistance.

AB  - There is a continuous threat of wildlife in the African tropical rainforest as a result of anthropogenic activities, yet there is lack of baseline data on the sustainability of these activities. This study provides basic data on income from bushmeat, anthropogenic activities, and the abundance of large mammals in Douala-Edea National Park (DENP) Littoral Region, Cameroon. Questionnaires were administered to 336 respondents in 57 villages and 13 2-km transects were surveyed in July covering a total of 29 km. Bushmeat hunting provided income for 12.64% of respondents with more than half of the respondents selling their bushmeat in local markets. Royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus) (14,250 +/- 1173) was the species of mammals sold at a higher price and the least price (2400 +/- 9447) sold was tree pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis). Among the anthropogenic activities observed (N = 138 signs), illegal logging (23.26 signs/km) was the most common, followed by hunting (10.18 signs/km) and habitat degradation (9.29 signs/km) and the least activity was the gathering of Non-Timber Forest Products (0.92 signs/km). A total of eight mammal species were identified. The highest encounter rate (ER) was Atherurus africanus (23.36 sign/km) and the least was Philantomba monticola (0.05 signs/km). Signs of anthropogenic activities and wildlife were mostly found in the same area indicating that wildlife is threatened. For such threats to be reversed and to recover a high population of wildlife species, an alternative source of income should be introduced to hunters, and strict law enforcement should be put in place to curb defaulters.

AB  - New strategies are required to enhance the efficient assimilation and bioconversion of plant-based ingredients in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) diets, especially relating to the essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3). Our study investigated nutritional programming and specifically evaluated the optimal duration of dietary 'stimulus' and whether it could be reduced compared to a previous study using a three- week 'stimulus'. Fish were fed an experimental 'stimulus' vegetable-based diet (VS, 5% marine meals [MM]/0% fish oil [FO]) or a standard marine-based control (MS, 82% MM/4% FO) for either one (V1) or two weeks (V2 and M) from first exogenous feeding. All groups were then fed a standard marine based formulation, for an 'intermediate' grow-out phase to the end of 16 weeks postfirst feeding, prior to a 'challenge' phase of six weeks when all fish were fed a vegetable-based diet (VC, 10% MM/0% FO). Compared to M, fish from both V1 and V2 groups were significantly smaller at the end of the 'stimulus' phase, but there were no statistical differences in overall growth, proximate or fatty acid compositions at the end of the trial. However, hepatosomatic and viscerosomatic indices were significantly lower in V1 compared to V2 fish and there was an overall trend of improved performance in V1 fish throughout the 'intermediate' and 'challenge' phases. During the 'challenge' phase, M fish displayed a greater net gain of DHA than V1 fish, whilst V2 was a net consumer of all n-3 LC-PUFA over the same period. Compared to M, n-3 LC-PUFA biosynthesis genes in pyloric caeca were downregulated in both experimental groups indicating possible posttranscriptional modification of this pathway in either V1 or V2, considering the differences in DHA retention levels between groups. Taken together, the results suggested that nutritional programming was not initiated by a one- or two- week 'stimulus'. However, more studies are required to elucidate the mechanism behind enhanced performance of V1 fish.

AB  - We investigated the digestive biology of two prevalent leiognathid species in Pranburi River estuary, Thailand: the decorated ponyfish (Nuchequula gerreoides) and the splendid polyfish (Eubleekeria splendens). A total of 632 samples collected from February to April and September to November 2017 were analysed using morphological and histological approaches. The overall structures were similar between the species: a short mucous-cell-rich oesophagus region, a well-developed gastric gland uniformly present across the stomach's mucosal layer, and three finger-like pyloric caeca between the stomach and intestine. However, there were marked differences in the mouth, gill raker, and intestinal coefficient (IC). N. gerreoides had a relatively longer mouth, smoother gill rakers, and an IC of 1.08 +/- 0.01, similar to those of other carnivorous fish. In contrast, the gill raker of E. splendens had more villiform teeth that can filter-feed better, and their IC was 2.16 +/- 0.02 (i.e., longer intestine). Although digestive structures were generally similar between the ponyfishes, these differences suggest that N. gerreoides is relatively carnivorous with stronger suction, whereas E. splendens may be an omnivorous or herbivorous filter-feeder.

AB  - Aphids are important herbivores in natural and managed environments. We studied the response of aphids and their associated microbiota to the presence of the fungal endophyte Epichlo & euml; sp. LpTG-3 strain AR37, and the AR37-derived alkaloids in plants. We hypothesized that AR37 and/or AR37-derived alkaloids would reduce the aphid performance, and that this reduction would be associated with endophyte-mediated changes in the abundance, composition, and diversity of beneficial bacterial endosymbionts of aphids (e.g., Buchnera). Plants of Lolium perenne associated with AR37 variants able (wild type and triangle idtA) and unable (triangle idtM) to produce indole diterpene alkaloids were challenged with Rhopalosiphum padi aphids. We measured aphid population size, plant biomass, and the abundance, composition and diversity of the aphid's bacterial microbiota. The presence of AR37 increased the resistance of plants against R. padi aphids via the production of indole diterpene alkaloids, and this effect was independent of the plant biomass. The endophyte-mediated reduction in aphid performance was not associated with changes in the abundance, composition and diversity of the insect's bacterial microbiota. However, we cannot rule out that the reduction in aphid performance could be associated with a putative endophyte effect on the bacterial provision of benefits to aphids. Our study highlighted the protective role of endophyte-derived indole diterpene alkaloids against aphids. Further investigations will be needed to determine if there is a link between the endophyte-mediated aphid resistance and the integrity of the insect's bacterial microbiota.

AB  - In rodents, exposure to electrical shock and creating a strong fear memory using fear-conditioning model can induce PTSD-like behavior. In this study, we induced a fear-conditioning model in rats and investigated freezing (PTSD-like) behavior, 21 days after three shocks exposure (0.6 mA, 3 s, 30 seconds interval) in both male and female rats. Lithium was injected intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg) in three protocols: (1) 1 h after fear-conditioning (2) 1 h, 24 h, and 48 h after fear-conditioning (3), 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after fear-conditioning. Extinction training (20 sounds without shocks, 75 dB, 3 s, 30 seconds interval) was performed in three protocols: (1) 1 h after fear-conditioning (one session), (2) 1 h, 24 h, and 48 h after fear-conditioning (three sessions), (3), 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after fear-conditioning (five sessions). Forced swim test (FST) and hot plate were used to assess behavior. Results showed that lithium in all protocols had no effect on freezing behavior, FST, and pain subthreshold in all rats. Extinction training decreased freezing behavior, with more efficacy in females. In males, only 5-session training was effective, while in females all protocols were effective. Extinction training also altered pain perception and the results of FST, depending on the sessions and was different in males and females. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA level was increased in females following 3 and 5 sessions, and in males following 5 sessions extinction training. In conclusion, we suggested that there is a sex difference for the effect of extinction training on freezing behavior and BDNF mRNA level in a rat model of fear-conditioning.

AB  - Driven by population growth and rising incomes, the demand for animal source foods in low and middle-income countries is increasing rapidly. Pork is one of the most commonly consumed animal-based food, with the highest demand being in China due to its largest population and changing dietary habits linked to increasing wealth. Here, we show the changes in pig production systems in terms of farms capacity, productivity and production at the national and provincial levels by analyzing several censuses of China. In addition, we used a downscaling methodology to provide a recent and highly detailed map of the distribution of pigs in China. Between 2007 and 2017, pork production in China increased by 26.6%, up to 55 million tons and the number of large-scale farms with a yearly production of over 10 000 heads increased by 145%. Much of the production has changed from extensive backyard subsistence farming to intensive corporate farming. Moreover, the pig distribution has shifted from watercourse-intense southeast to northeast and southwest of China due to environmental policy in 2015. These policy-driven transitions primarily aimed to increase pig production efficiency and reduce environmental impacts and resulted in a profound transformation of geographic production patterns.

AB  - Simple Summary Small ruminant lentiviruses are a group of viruses characterized by a high genetic and antigenic variability. In the absence of control measures, they are characterized by high prevalence in goat and sheep farms. In Greece, a country characterized by one of the highest small ruminant populations in Europe, SRLVs are well-known pathogens, but so far, few studies have investigated the circulating viral strains and their prevalence in the islands and mainland. The results of this research highlighted the presence of both A and B subtypes as well as the predominance of a novel A viral cluster. In many cases, the combined serological-molecular approach allowed us to identify more than one viral subtype in a single farm.Abstract Small ruminant lentiviruses are a group of viruses infecting goat and sheep worldwide. These viruses exhibit an extraordinary degree of genetic and antigenic variability that severely influence in vivo and in vitro features, as well as diagnostic test results. Small ruminant farming is the most important animal farming business in Greece, with a high impact on the Greek primary economy. Although SRLV infection and its impact on animal production are well established in the country, little is known about the circulating SRLV strains and their prevalence. The aim of this study was to characterize SRLVs circulating in Greece with a combined serological and molecular approach, using the bulk milk matrix collected from 60 farms in different municipalities. This study allowed us to estimate a seroprevalence of around 52% at the herd level. The B1, B2 and A3 subtypes and a novel A viral cluster were identified. Moreover, the amplicon sequencing method allowed us to identify more than one viral subtype in a sample. These results again confirm the high variability of these viruses and highlight the importance of the constant monitoring of viral evolution, in particular in antigens of diagnostic interest.

AB  - Despite the notoriety of the corallivorous crown of thorns starfish (COTS, Acanthaster sp.), with population outbreaks that decimate reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific, the physiology of the juvenile stage remains poorly understood. We determined the feeding rate and metabolic rate of juvenile COTS during their initial algae-eating stage. The metabolic rate of juveniles after their ontogenetic diet transition from a diet of coralline algae to coral was also investigated. We found that the weight-specific metabolic rate of both the herbivorous (mean = 0.052 mg O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) and corallivorous (mean = 0.034 mg O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) juveniles increased exponentially with juvenile size. Juveniles consumed similar to 4 mm(2) of algae (Amphiroa sp.) in 1 day, and consumption rate also increased with juvenile size. Juveniles may impact the distribution of coralline algae for other herbivores on coral reefs and the settlement habitat for many invertebrate larvae. Increased metabolism of both herbivorous and corallivorous juveniles with size is indicative of their increasing ecological impact as they grow, highlighting the importance of understanding the juvenile physiology of influential species such as COTS.

AB  - Plants respond to complex blends of above- and below-ground volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by neighboring plants. These responses often involve priming (i.e., preparation) or induction (i.e., increase) of defenses by "receiver" plants upon exposure to VOCs released by herbivore-damaged neighboring "emitters." However, recent work has shown that induction of VOC emissions by herbivory is modulated by abiotic factors, potentially affecting plant-plant signaling. We tested the effect of soil salinization on the induction of VOC emissions in wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) due to leaf damage and its consequences for the induction of defenses in neighboring plants. To this end, we performed a greenhouse factorial experiment where emitter plants were subjected to augmented soil salinity (vs. ambient salinity) and within each group emitter plants were subsequently exposed to simulated caterpillar damage (mechanical leaf damage treated with Spodoptera frugiperda oral secretion) or no damage (control). After 48 h of exposure, we collected VOCs released by emitter plants and then damaged the receivers and collected their leaves to measure levels of chemical defenses (terpenoid aldehydes of known insecticidal effects). We found an interaction between leaf damage and salinization for two groups of VOCs released by emitters (sesquiterpenes and other aromatic compounds), whereby damaged receivers had higher emissions than control plants under ambient but not salinized soil conditions. We also found that, upon being damaged, receiver plants exposed to damaged emitters exhibited a significantly higher concentration of heliocides (but not gossypol) than control plants. However, salinization did not alter this VOC exposure effect on receiver induced responses to damage. Overall, we show that exposure to induced VOC emissions from damaged plants magnifies the induction of chemical defenses due to leaf damage in neighboring individuals and that this is not contingent on the level of soil salinity despite the latter's effect on VOC induction.

AB  - Fluctuations in the chemical composition of invasive species can identify windows where grazing implementation can be maximised for improved weed management. Our goal was to determine the chemical composition of Nassella trichotoma (Nees) Hack. ex Arechav., an aggressive invasive grass species, after being subjected to either high or low defoliation across a defoliation intensity gradient and leaves were harvested over the growing season. All samples were analysed for protein content (PC) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) content. PC was generally higher, and NDF and ADF were higher in defoliated compared with undefoliated plants. An induced anti-herbivore defence may explain the increase in fibre content in response to defoliation, which would accentuate the low nutritional quality of N. trichotoma and, thus, its avoidance by cattle. Therefore, efforts should focus on preventing N. trichotoma leaf tissues from losing nutritional quality by integrating control measures, such as grazing regrowing shoots after disturbances that cause severe defoliation (e.g. burning) from early autumn to early spring. This approach could effectively reduce N. trichotoma competitiveness, preventing its persistence and spread.

AB  - Animal health and welfare are crucial aspects of livestock production, impacting animal well-being and productivity, as well as farm sustainability. Currently, several health and welfare indicators have been proposed for assessing the health and welfare status of goats. However, their applicability across different farming systems, as well as their role in daily milk yield, have been insufficiently studied. The objective here was to determine the most prevalent health and welfare issues and quantify their impact on the daily milk yield of Skopelos dairy goats that shared the same genetic background but were reared under different farming systems, intensive or extensive. In intensively reared goats, health and welfare issues were related to housing conditions, hygiene standards, and dietary practices. However, in extensively reared goats, grazing activity, parasitism, and lack of systematic health monitoring were the dominant factors of health and welfare issues observed. Among the studied health and welfare issues, lameness, mouth lesions, udder fibrosis, and udder asymmetry were associated with decreased milk production. The results suggest that tailored management practices and preventive measures should be implemented based on evidence and the specific demands of each farming system to optimize animal health, welfare, and productivity. Health and welfare are fundamental to goat production; however, their impact on milk yield in goats reared under different farming systems remains insufficiently studied. The objective was to examine the frequency of various health issues in dairy goats reared under two different farming systems and to assess their effects on daily milk yield (DMY). A total of 286 Skopelos goats from an intensive (N-A = 153) and an extensive (N-B = 133) farm, all with the same genetic background, were prospectively monitored for two consecutive lactation periods. Each goat was clinically examined for animal-based health indicators every 50 days, while individual DMY was also recorded. Morbidity frequency measures (cumulative incidence, point, and period prevalence) were calculated for each one of the studied health issues, and mixed linear regression models were developed to assess the effect of each one of the studied health issues on DMY. The results indicated that overgrown hooves were more common in intensively reared goats, while anemia and nasal discharge prevailed in extensively reared goats. Udder asymmetry, udder fibrosis, body abscesses, poor hair coat quality, and swollen lymph nodes were common in both farms, albeit more prevalent in extensively reared goats, except for udder asymmetry. Among the studied health issues, lameness (18.5%, p < 0.05), mouth lesions (14.1%, p < 0.05), udder asymmetry (6.6%, p < 0.001), and udder fibrosis (9.5%, p < 0.001), were significantly associated with reductions in DMY. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing herd health management practices in dairy goats based on evidence and farming system requirements.

AB  - This study used gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) to determine three kinds of halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) in the edible muscles of nine fish species in the Laibin section of the Hongshui River of Xijiang River in the Pearl River system. The results showed that the sum of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in fish muscle was 8.94 similar to 43.32 ng/g ww, 1.22 similar to 4.09 ng/g ww, and ND similar to 0.13 ng/g ww, respectively. Evaluation indicators include analysis of the composition of homologous compounds, residues in different diets and habitats, and estimated daily intake (EDI) calculations. The analysis of the composition characteristics of homologous compounds showed that endrin was the most dominant in OCPs; hexachlorobenzene was the most dominant in PCBs; and BDE 154 was the most dominant PBDEs. Calculations of the levels of the HOPs in fish of different diets and habitats showed that OCPs and PCBs had the highest residues in carnivorous fish, and PBDEs had the highest residues in herbivorous fish. The residual OCPs, PCBs, and PBDEs in demersal fishes were the most. The estimated daily intake (EDI) results showed that daily fish consumption in the Laibin section of the Hongshui River would not cause HOPs health risks to the local residents. However, there is still a need for continuous monitoring of HOPs to reduce pollutant emissions and prevent pollution conditions from arising.

AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widespread, persistent in the environment, and classified as global pollutants. Their presence has been confirmed in various types of food which adversely affect human health when consumed in sufficient amounts. Although milk has advantageous nutritional qualities and there are health benefits associated with its consumption, it could also contain toxic PBDEs. The aim of the study was the determination of the concentrations of ten congeners (BDE -28, -47, -49, -99, -100, -138, -153, -154, -183, and 209) in cow's, sheep's, and goat's milk obtained from Polish farms and their determination in infant formula. A total of 103 samples of raw milk and infant formula were tested using an accredited high-resolution gas chromatographyehigh-resolution mass spectrometry method. PBDEs were detected in all analyzed samples, the highest concentration being found in sheep's milk (11.9 ng g(-1) fat), and cow's milk containing the least contamination. BDE-209 makes the predominant contribution to the sum of the ten congeners, constituting at least 38%. The profiles of PBDEs were dependent on the milk type and the differences between its varieties are discussed. The highest median concentration of the sum of ten PBDEs (0.473 ng g(-1) fat) was determined in infant formula, which was identified as an important source of infants' exposure (5.48 ng kg(-1) b.w. day(-1) calculated based on P95 concentration). Milk is a source of PBDE in the diet; however, considered in isolation its consumption does not pose a risk to either adults' or children's health. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low-temperature preservation of yak semen during transportation and conservation is crucial to accelerate yak breeding. The effects of low-temperature cooling on yak semen quality, however, are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the dose-dependent effect of mitochondriatargeted antioxidant "MitoQ" on the motility, oxidative status, and mitochondrial function of yak semen during low-temperature preservation. Semen samples were collected from six adult healthy Maiwa yaks and preserved at 4 degrees C in semen extender containing 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 nM MitoQ, respectively. Firstly, the motility, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and abnormity index of yak spermatozoa were evaluated to determine the optimal MitoQ concentration. Next, the effect of MitoQ at the optimal concentration on spermatozoa antioxidant capacity, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and superoxide dismutase content (SOD) levels, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed. Up to 96 h of low-temperature storage, 200 nM MitoQ showed the most optimal effect on motility, membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity (P < 0.05) but not on sperm morphology (P > 0.05). Also, 200 nM MitoQ markedly reduced yak spermatozoa ROS and MDA contents for up to 48 h of low-temperature storage (P < 0.05). Finally, 200 nM MitoQ significantly improved T-AOC, SOD, and mitochondrial membrane potential for up to 24, 48, and 72 h of low-temperature storage, respectively (P < 0.05). In summary, semen extender supplementation with 200 nM MitoQ is beneficial for low-temperature yak semen preservation via improving the oxidative status.

AB  - Xenophyophores are large, agglutinated foraminifera that dominate the benthic megafauna in some parts of the deep sea. Here, we describe an assemblage of largely fragmentary specimens from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), an area of the eastern abyssal Pacific hosting large, commercially significant deposits of polymetallic nodules. We recognised 18 morphospecies of which eight yielded DNA sequences. These include two new genera and three new species, Claraclippia seminuda gen. & sp. nov., Stereodiktyoma mollis gen. & sp. nov., and Aschemonella tani sp. nov., three that are assigned to known species, Abyssalia foliformis, Aschemonella monilis and Shinkaiya contorta, and two assigned to open nomenclature forms Abyssalia aff. foliformis and Stannophyllum aff. granularium. An additional ten forms are represented only by morphology. The following seven are placed in known genera, species and open-nomenclature forms: Aschemonella? sp., Homogammina sp., Psammina multiloculata, P. aff. multiloculata, P. aff. limbata form 1 sensu Gooday et al., 2018, P. aff. limbata form 2 sensu Gooday et al., 2018, and Stannophyllum spp. The other three could not be identified to genus level. This new collection brings the total of described and undescribed species and morphotypes from the CCZ to 27 and 70, respectively, reinforcing the already high diversity of xenophyophores known from this part of the Pacific.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the operation statuses of on-site swine wastewater treatment facilities through surveys and field surveys on pig farms and to propose effective operation models. Field analyses and surveys of pig farms indicate that technical and financial support systems are required for both farms and on-site swine wastewater treatment facilities. Public environmental services have been proposed as an effective support system, in which private sewage treatment facilities are entrusted to professional environmental management agencies, and the costs are shared by local governments and facility owners. However, securing a stable budget represents a challenge to implementing public environmental services. Thus, this study proposes a collaborative manure management model composed of individual farms, professional environmental management agencies, and local governments to address the shortcomings of public environmental services. To effectively manage pig manure, the flexible application of discharge standards, diversification of pollutant reduction management techniques (e.g., feed management), and periodic review of permits must be considered. Additionally, the reinforcement of discharge standards for individual purification facilities, control of the livestock density and number, and impacts of livestock manure discharge on riverine ecosystems must be considered.

AB  - 1. In recent years, researchers have increasingly recognized the need to bridge Western and Indigenous knowledge systems to strengthen research in wildlife conservation. Historically, this arena has not made space for Indigenous knowledge holders to share components of their knowledge systems with agency and to support their own self-determination as equal partners.
   2. Since time immemorial, Indigenous Peoples have been developing, maintaining and refining their own knowledge systems, based on intimate knowledge and relationships with the lands, airs, and waterways. There remains enormous potential for Western scientists to engage in equitable knowledge exchange and co-production with Indigenous Peoples. This applies to species such as boreal caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou, known by the Dene name, todzi; which hold ecological value and cultural importance for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the boreal region of Canada.
   3. To gain an overarching perspective of this species, we will create a systematic literature map that will examine peer-reviewed and grey literature involving spatial mapping of all species of caribou Rangifer tarandus based on Indigenous knowledge. This map will (a) characterize available data and previously engaged knowledge holders and (b) identify positive experiences that exemplify best practices for knowledge co-production.
   4. Searches will be conducted in English in selected databases. Search strings will be tested against a collection of benchmark papers of documents previously chosen to determine strings with maximum sensitivity and specificity. Results will be reviewed through the: (1) title and abstract; and (2) full text.
   5. All screening decisions will be recorded in a database, with 10% of full-text screening decisions validated. Items retained for inclusion in the systematic map will be coded using a list of coding questions. Ten percent of coding outcomes will be validated by a second reviewer.
   6. The systematic map will employ a narrative synthesis approach that will compare retained studies against a list of best practices from the current proposal. It will examine case studies that performed well according to the list and contribute to a repository of previously documented Indigenous knowledge about caribou to support projects involving Indigenous and Western knowledge co-production.

AB  - A greater understanding of mite biodiversity and ecology can explain their preference for microhabitats within host bodies, i.e., as ecto-, meso-, and endoparasites. Similarly, learning about the patterns formed by mite communities in wild animals can shed light on the mechanisms of parasitosis development in their domesticated counterparts. Hence, the present study examined the acarofauna of the mouflon, introduced to Poland in the early 20th century from a region of endemic occurrence. Forty-one individuals were examined for the presence of ectoparasites between 2010 and 2013; later, skin fragments were analysed for the presence of skin mites. A new species of Demodecidae, Demodex musimonis sp. nov., was discovered in the skin of the pasterns of 14.6% mouflons, as well as the ectoparasitic tick Ixodes ricinus (prevalence 29.3%) and ungulate-typical fly Lipoptena cervi (34.1%). However, no mites typical for ovine Ovis (Psorergatidae, Psoroptidae) were noted, nor any colonisation of microhabitats by species from local ungulates, resulting from the loss of original parasites during the introduction. A comparison of the acarofauna of the mouflon and domestic sheep Ovis aries aries suggests that a mite community with a complex structure and the co-occurrence of different families may be formed. However, it is not known whether the acarofauna of domestic sheep is derived from wild ancestors or the process of domestication. Even so, the peculiar Demodecidae must have been part of the natural parasitofauna of wild sheep, of which only D. musimonis sp. nov. has been recognised so far.

AB  - Crepidiastrum grandicollum is a critically endangered insular endemic herb found only on two oceanic islands of the Bonin Islands in Japan, namely Chichijima Island and Anijima Island. It is explicitly threatened by herbivory pressure from introduced animals. In 2009, a conservation program for C. grandicollum was begun to ensure its future persistence. To provide further information for conservation planning, we investigated the genetic diversity of C. grandicollum using 13 novel microsatellite markers in 55 individuals from four wild populations and an ex situ living collection. Two closely related woody species were also included for interspecific comparison: seven individuals of Crepidiastrum ameristophyllum and 13 of Crepidiastrum linguifolium. The 13 markers were applicable to all three species and identified 129 alleles in total. We found a clear genetic differentiation between C. grandicollum from Anijima Island and Chichijima Island. Crepidiastrum grandicollum also had low expected heterozygosity and allelic richness in populations compared to the two closely related species. Reconstructed divergence history suggested that differentiation between the islands had occurred several thousand generations ago. We suggest separate conservation units for C. grandicollum on Anijima Island and Chichijima Island given the clear (and putatively historical) genetic differentiation, which may result in speciation in the future.

AB  - Many studies have found that volatile cues from damaged plants can induce resistance to herbivores in undamaged neighbors. However, fewer studies have examined the effects of soilborne cues. Furthermore, there are few studies that have considered the effects of plant-plant communication on plant reproduction. We conducted experiments with tomato seedlings exposing them to airborne and soilborne cues from experimentally damaged neighbors. These plants were then transplanted to the field and the level of damage by chewing and sucking herbivores was observed in the field. We also recorded the time before flowering was initiated by these plants. We found that both airborne and soilborne cues trend to reduce the proportion of leaves that were damaged for plants exposed to cues relative to controls that were near undamaged neighbors. Furthermore, these two cues were found to interact synergistically. Plants that had been exposed to soilborne cues flowered sooner than controls, those exposed to airborne cues, and both cues. These results suggested that soilborne and airborne cues induce different responses in plants.

AB  - Ivermectin, an anthelmintic used in livestock, is excreted in faeces and can therefore affect non-target organisms. While its effects on coprophagous insects have been well studied, recent research suggests that it can be taken up by plants, raising the possibility that it may affect a much wider range of invertebrates than previously known. Our study investigated the effects of ivermectin on insects from different feeding guilds. First, we tested its effects on the larvae of the noctuid moths Spodoptera frugiperda and Helicoverpa armigera (chewing herbivores) using an artificial diet. Secondly, we investigated the effects of its presence in the soil of pea plants Pisum sativum on the pea-feeding aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (phloem-feeding herbivore). Thirdly, we tested ivermectin in an artificial diet for Drosophila melanogaster used as a host for the parasitoid Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae. Our results showed that ivermectin reduced pupal weight and survival in moth larvae, inhibited aphid colony establishment and reduced parasitoid emergence rates from ivermectin-exposed Drosophila pupae. These results highlight the potential of ivermectin to affect multiple trophic levels and emphasise the need for sustainable veterinary practices in the use of anthelmintics in free-ranging livestock and companion animals.

AB  - Mesotheriidae (Panperissodactyla, Notoungulata) are an extinct clade (early Oligocene-Pleistocene) of small to medium-sized herbivorous mammals that were widely distributed in South America. Although two subfamilies traditionally have been recognized (Trachytheriinae and Mesotheriinae), recent cladistic analyses based on discrete characters have indicated that "Trachytheriinae" is a paraphyletic assemblage. Given the availability of a large number of specimens and the fact that dental characters are the most common characters used in mesotheriid phylogenies, we performed specimen-level cladistic analyses combining discrete, continuous and geometric morphometrics-based dental characters. The aim was to: (1) include new scored morphological characters to solve the phylogenetic relationships of Mesotheriidae; (2) compare the results of the upper and lower dentition analyses as different character partitions and in combination, to establish phylogenetic hypotheses; and (3) trace the evolution of dental traits. Phylogenetic analyses employing characters of associated upper and lower dentitions recovered one most parsimonious tree with Archaeohyracidae (outgroup) as the sister group of Pan-Mesotheriidae (= Mesotheriidae; converted clade name), this latter composed of trachytheriines (stem-mesotheriine) + Mesotheriinae (converted clade name). Within Mesotheriinae, we recovered two main lineages phylogenetically defined here as Bolivarini and Pampaini (new clade names). Analyses of isolated upper and lower dentition sub-datasets each resulted in one most parsimonious tree congruent with the associated dentition. Our study emphasizes the use of geometric morphometrics characters to resolve additional clades in phylogenetic analyses, provides information on the evolution of size and morphology of teeth, and exposes specimen assignment issues at a taxonomic level. The integration of osteological characters might be crucial to further understanding the evolution of Mesotheriidae. (c) 2023 The Willi Hennig Society.

AB  - BackgroundRestrictive soils, soils characterised by nutrient deficiencies, often form as isolated patches across the landscape, creating conditions for an ecological filter that potentially limits dispersal and establishment of species.AimsWe predicted that filtering occurs on restrictive soils, which will be identified as disproportionate representation of dispersal syndrome within edaphic flora communities and lead to decreased dispersion of endemic species.MethodsWe compared the proportion of dispersal syndromes among edaphic floral communities associated with gypsum outcrops to paired sites of non-gypsum communities to determine whether dispersal syndromes are occurring at different frequencies on gypsum compared to the surrounding dominant soil matrix. We ran a phylogenetic generalised least-squares analysis to estimate the relationship between dispersal syndrome and gypsum affinity to species dispersion.ResultsAnemochory was significantly more common on gypsum sites, while epizoochory and endozoochory were conversely less common. Dispersal syndrome and its interaction with gypsum affinity influenced the dispersion of gypsum-affiliated species.ConclusionAs gypsum communities assemble, they pass through an ecological filter in which wind dispersed species are favoured and become more prevalent, while animal dispersed species are less frequent, resulting in decreased dispersion of endemic wind dispersed edaphic-specialist species.

AB  - Herbivores shape plant invasions through impacts on demography and dispersal, yet only demographic mechanisms are well understood. Although herbivores negatively impact demography by definition, they can affect dispersal either negatively (e.g., seed consumption), or positively (e.g., caching). Exploring the nuances of how herbivores influence spatial spread will improve the forecasting of plant movement on the landscape. Here, we aim to understand how herbivores impact how fast plant populations spread through varying impacts on plant demography and dispersal. We strive to determine whether, and under what conditions, we see net positive effects of herbivores, in order to find scenarios where herbivores can help to promote spread. We draw on classic invasion theory to develop a stage-structured integrodifference equation model that incorporates herbivore impacts on plant demography and dispersal. We simulate seven herbivore "syndromes" (combinations of demographic and/or dispersal effects) drawn from the literature to understand how increasing herbivore pressure alters plant spreading speed. We find that herbivores with solely negative effects on plant demography or dispersal always slow plant spreading speed, and that the speed slows monotonically as herbivore pressure increases. However, we also find that plant spreading speed can be hump shaped with respect to herbivore pressure: plants spread faster in the presence of herbivores (for low herbivore pressure) and then slower (for high herbivore pressure). This result is robust, occurring across all syndromes in which herbivores have a positive effect on plant dispersal, and is a sign that the positive effects of herbivores on dispersal can outweigh their negative effects on demography. For all syndromes we find that sufficiently high herbivore pressure results in population collapse. Thus, our findings show that herbivores can speed up or slow down plant spread. These insights allow for a greater understanding of how to slow invasions, facilitate native species recolonization, and shape range shifts with global change.

AB  - Elasmobranchs in the Gulf of California have been found with malformations, probably originated during embryonic development or caused by environmental anomalies and pollution associated with intense mining activity in the region. Clasper malformations are reported for the first time in two specimens of Pseudobatos buthi, a species recently described from the Gulf of California. The function of the claspers was not affected by the size difference, because specimens presented the distinctive characteristics of an adult individual. The reproductive system did not show any malformation, with symmetrical testes. Histological analysis of the testes revealed a normal spermatogenic development. To elucidate the causes and to detect a possible effect of the morphological malformations due to high levels of heavy metals, trace concentration values (cadmium, copper, iron, manganese, silver, lead and zinc) were determined in muscle and liver. Cadmium and lead concentrations in the muscle of the two specimens were below the permissible limit for human consumption (<0.05 mg kg(-1)); however, iron and zinc presented high values (0.455, 4.024 mg kg(-1) in muscle and 21.931, 3.694 mg kg(-1) in liver respectively). Mining activity and heavy metal pollution in the sampling area may have caused the malformations, which might be attributed to the high values of iron and zinc discovered in the muscle and liver.

AB  - Following its eradication from the USA, the cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini), a vector of bovine babesiosis, has made episodic incursions into, and sometimes beyond, an established barrier zone separating tick-free from endemic areas. In large part the incursions involve hosting and transport by wild ungulates, particularly deer and antelope. One approach to disinfest ticks from wild hosts is with food baits medicated to stop parasites. The approach has had mixed success due to factors that have been previously identified with supplemental feeding of wildlife especially competition for the bait, social dominance behavior, and the availability of alternative food sources. Given that not all of the target hosts will intake a therapeutic dose of the medication (ivermectin) at all seasons of the year, an open question is whether the approach is efficacious as a stand-alone treatment or even as part of an integrated program. As detailed in the present study an intensive effort was successful in eradicating a local outbreak of fever ticks.

AB  - Pakistan is facing a severe energy crisis due to its heavy dependency on the import of costly fossil fuels, which ultimately leads to expansive electricity generation, a low power supply, and interruptive load shedding. In this regard, the utilization of available renewable energy resources within the country for production of electricity can lessen this energy crisis. Livestock waste/manure is considered the most renewable and abundant material for biogas generation. Pakistan is primarily an agricultural country, and livestock is widely kept by the farming community, in order to meet their needs. According to the 2016-2018 data on the livestock population, poultry held the largest share at 45.8%, followed by buffaloes (20.6%), cattle (12.7%), goats (10.8%), sheep (8.4%), asses (1.3%), camels (0.25%), horses (0.1%), and mules (0.05%). Different animals produce different amounts of manure, based upon their size, weight, age, feed, and type. The most manure is produced by cattle (10-20 kg/day), while poultry produce the least (0.08-0.1 kg/day). Large quantities of livestock manure are produced from each province of Pakistan; Punjab province was the highest contributor (51%) of livestock manure in 2018. The potential livestock manure production in Pakistan was 417.3 million tons (Mt) in 2018, from which 26,871.35 million m(3) of biogas could be generated-with a production potential of 492.6 petajoules (PJ) of heat energy and 5521.5 MW of electricity. Due to its favorable conditions for biodigester technologies, and through the appropriate development of anaerobic digestion, the currently prevailing energy crises in Pakistan could be eliminated.

AB  - Class 1 integrons (CL1s) are one of the major contributors to the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, our knowledge of CL1 in the environment is still very limited due to the limitations of the current PCR primers and the sequencing methods adopted. This study developed a new primer coupled with PacBio sequencing to investigate the underrepresented diversity of CL1s in a mixed environmental sample (i.e. activated sludge from wastewater treatment plant and pig feces from animal farm). The new primer successfully uncovered 20 extra ARGs subtypes and 57% (422/739) more unique integron array structures than the previous primers. Compared to the whole genome database, CL1s revealed in the environment in this study were of much greater diversity, having 93% (900/967) novel array structures. Antibiotic resistance is the predominant function (78.3% genes) carried by CL1, and a vast majority (98.6% genes) of them confer resistance to aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, trimethoprim, or chloramphenicol. Additionally, 78.5% unique CL1 arrays carried more than one ARGs, and 25.9% of them carried ARGs of clinical relevance with high transferability potential posing threat to the general public. Our results indicated the importance of CL1s in the spread of ARGs. Overall, combining PacBio sequencing with the new primer designed in this study largely broadened our knowledge of CL1s in the environment and their significance in the environmental proliferation of ARGs.

AB  - Plant metabolic pathways and gene networks involved in the response to herbivory are well-established, but the impact of epigenetic factors as modulators of those responses is less understood. Here, we use the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine to uncover the role of DNA cytosine methylation on phenotypic responses after short-term herbivory in Thlaspi arvense plants that came from two European populations with contrasting flowering phenotypes expected to differ in the response to experimental demethylation. The experimental design followed a 2 x 3 factorial design, that was replicated for each flowering-type. First, half the seeds were submerged in a water solution of 5-azacytidine and the other half only in water, as controls. Then, we assigned control and demethylated plants to three herbivory categories (i) insect herbivory, (ii) artificial herbivory, and (iii) undamaged plants. The effects of the demethylation and herbivory treatments were assessed by quantifying genome-wide global DNA cytosine methylation, concentration of leaf glucosinolates, final stem biomass, fruit and seed production, and seed size. For most of the plant traits analysed, individuals from the two flowering-types responded differently. In late-flowering plants, global DNA methylation did not differ between control and demethylated plants but it was significantly reduced by herbivory. Conversely, in early-flowering plants, demethylation at seed stage was still evident in leaf DNA of reproductive individuals whereas herbivory did not affect their global DNA methylation. In late-flowering plants, artificial herbivory imposed a stronger reduction than insect herbivory in global DNA methylation and final stem biomass, and induced higher concentration of aliphatic glucosinolates. In early-flowering plants, the effects of herbivory were non-significant for the same traits. Finally, the effect of herbivory on reproductive parameters varied with the level of demethylation and the plant flowering-type. Although further investigations with more populations and families are required to confirm our results, they suggest that the genetic background of experimental plants and timing of damage can affect the response to herbivory and point towards multifaceted genetic-epigenetic interactions in determining herbivory-induced phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - This is the first field study to evaluate lead exposure in dogs fed game meat and offal and, to our knowledge, the first study exploring associations between game consumption and dog health status. We quantified lead concentrations in blood and hair and haematological parameters of 31 dogs fed game meat and offal from wild boar (Sus scrofa) and axis deer (Axis axis) culled with lead ammunition in El Palmar National Park, Argentina. Despite variable weekly frequency in game consumption, dogs had detectable blood and hair lead levels, demonstrating recent and chronic exposure. Lead geometric mean and SD were 18.91 +/- 346.85 mu g/dL w.w. in blood (range = 0.53-216.58), and 0.721 +/- 6.444 mu g/gr d.w. in hair (range = 0.007-34.800). Hair lead levels were relatively low in most samples, except for the oldest dog which had an atypically high value concurrent with anaemia, a common outcome of chronic lead exposure. Dog's owner was significantly predictive of both blood and hair lead levels, which reflects the same feeding patterns for all dogs owned by the same person. Body condition was associated with hair lead, with dogs in good condition presenting higher lead levels. This could be related to greater game consumption by those dogs, resulting in higher lead ingestion. Dogs fed game meat and offal at very low or low frequency (<= 4 times per week) showed higher blood lead levels, suggesting there might not be a risk-free frequency for game provision to dogs. Considering the risks of dietary lead exposure, avoiding feeding dogs lead-killed game and replacing lead ammunition with non-toxic alternatives are recommended. This would allow using hunted game as a valuable food resource without unnecessary risk for the health of consumers and the environment.

AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula is a region of the world where drastic impacts of climate change have been observed over the past few years, leading the communities inhabiting this area to adapt to new conditions. This is reflected in changes to the composition and abundance of pelagic species, especially zooplankton, which constitute the main food source for the trophic web supporting the ecosystem in this region. In this study, we compared the composition, abundance, and spatial distribution of meso-and macro-zooplankton and how they relate to the oceanographic conditions of the Bransfield Strait and the area surrounding Elephant Island, Antarctic Peninsula, during the 2019-2020 austral summer. The community was represented by three groups: small-sized copepods such as Oithona similis and Ctenocalanus citer, salps such as Salpa thompsoni, and the Euphausiacea. Euphausiacea showed an important decrease in composition and abundance and was only represented by Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura. An increase in the abundance and distribution of S. thompsoni was observed over the entire study area, as well as positive SST anomalies, which possibly favored the increase in the S. thompsoni population, as well as the decrease and displacement of Euphausiacea adults and juveniles. If, as climate models predict, increases in temperatures keep occurring, our results reflect the scenario that will prevail for zooplankton in the Antarctic Peninsula, with effects on distribution and abundance that will lead to the dominance of species that are more successful in warmer conditions.

AB  - To understand the potential of forests to adapt to wildfire, we studied the genetic architecture of fire-related structural, damage and recovery traits in a globally important Australian forest tree species, Eucalyptus globulus. Fourteen traits were evaluated in an outcrossed F-2 population in a field trial in Tasmania, Australia, which was burnt by a wildfire 14 years after planting. The trial also included open-pollinated families of the grandparental dwarf and tall ecotypes used to produce the F-2 population. We studied the phenotypic correlations within the F-2 population and performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses using a linkage map comprised of 472 markers. Ecotype comparisons revealed that almost all traits were under genetic control, with trees of the dwarf ecotype significantly more damaged and mainly recovering from lignotubers, whereas tall ecotype trees mainly recovered from epicormic resprouts extending for a variable height up the stem. Within the F-2, tree size was negatively correlated with fire damage and positively correlated with recovery. Genetic control of fire-related traits was confirmed by the detection of 38 QTL in the F-2 population. These QTL accounted for 4 to 43% of the phenotypic variation in these traits. Several QTL co-located and likely reflect pleiotropic effects. However, many independent QTL were detected, including QTL for crown consumption and trunk scorch, epicormic resprouting, resprout herbivory, and seedling establishment. The QTL detected argue that many genetically controlled mechanisms are responsible for variation in fire damage and recovery.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) has shown the potential to reduce the numbers and types of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) present in animal manures. However, the variability of the results has limited the ability to draw solid conclusions. To address this issue, we performed a series of meta-analyses to evaluate how AD of pig, cattle, and dairy manures affects ARG levels and how different parameters, such as temperature, pH, digestion times, and the addition of other substances (e.g., solids, antibiotics) influence ARG changes. Twenty studies with enough details on changes in ARG levels during the AD process were identified and used for the meta-analyses. The results suggested that AD could significantly reduce ARG levels regardless of the conditions of the process. Also, thermophilic AD was more effective than mesophilic AD at reducing ARGs, although this difference was only significant for pig manures. The results also suggested that long digestion times (>50 days) yielded better ARG reduction rates, and that the addition of solids from an external source (co-digestion) negatively affected the efficiency of ARG reduction. In general, the results suggested that ARG changes during AD could be linked to the abundance and activity of hydrolytic communities.

AB  - The heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina is an essential microzooplankton in coastal waters, linking the energy transfer from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels. It is of general significance to investigate how it responds and acclimates to ocean acidification (OA), especially under varied availabilities of food. Here, O. marina was exposed and acclimated to three pCO(2 )levels (LC: 415, MC:1000, HC:1500 mu atm) for 60 days, and then was further grown under the CO2 levels with different levels of food (the microalgae Dunaliella salina) availability for about 8 generations. The OA treatments did not significantly hamper its growth and ingestion rates even under the reduced food availability and starvation (deprived of the microalgae), which significantly reduced its growth rate. While the impacts of OA on the growth and ingestion rates of O. marina were insignificant, the OA treatments appeared to have resulted in a faster decline of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate cells during the starvation period. Nevertheless, the acidic stress under the elevated pCO(2) of 1000 or 1500 mu atm decreased its respiration by about 53% or 59% with the high and by about 26% or 23% with the low food availability, respectively. Such OA-repressed respiration was also significant during the starvation period. On the other hand, the OA treatments and deprivation of the microalgae synergistically reduced the cellular quota of particulate organic C, N and P, resulting in a reduction of food value of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate as prey. In conclusion, our results show that O. marina is highly resilient to future ocean acidification by reducing its respiration and sustaining its ingestion of microalgae.

AB  - In weed biocontrol, the release of multiple candidates has been proposed as a way to increase herbivore load and thus impact on the target weed. However, the use of multiple herbivorous species may reduce overall herbivore load due to interspecific interactions. We assessed whether a combined application of two Pyropteron spp. (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) with root-boring larvae can increase larval infestation rate and impact on two Rumex weeds (Caryophyllales: Polygonaceae). In a laboratory assay ('behavioural experiment'), interference competition was assessed by comparing the survival of a single larva (no competition), of four conspecific larvae (intraspecific competition) and of two larvae of each species (interspecific competition). In a common garden study ('infestation and impact experiment'), the outcomes of competitive interactions were assessed on potted plants with single and mixed species applications of the two Pyropteron species using a replacement design. In the behavioural experiment, larval survival was similarly reduced under intra- and interspecific competition compared to no competition, suggesting strong interference competition among larvae independent of the Pyropteron species. In the infestation and impact experiment, mixed application did only scarcely increase herbivore load. Increased herbivore load was found to increase root decay when applied in an inundative approach by placing eggs directly on Rumex plants. However, a joint application of two Pyropteron species did not increase the impact. We propose that detailed behavioural and impact studies be conducted to assess the likely outcome of using multiple candidates in biocontrol programs to minimize associated risks with multiple species introductions.

AB  - Using a model of artificial radioactive particles, the effectiveness of the use of a saline laxative, Glauber's salt, as an antidote therapy agent was studied. Internal irradiation of laboratory animals (guinea pigs) and sheep was carried out under laboratory conditions with oral intake of particles simulating the radiation characteristics of young nuclear fission products, at doses that cause medium, severe, and extremely severe forms of radiation ulcerative gastroenterocolitis. During the first four days after radiation exposure, Glauber's salt was administered to each animal once a day either as 3 mL of 20% aqueous solution (for guinea pigs) or as a 0.5 L of 12% aqueous solution (for sheep). In all animals, the drug demonstrated a statistically significant antidote effect. Glauber's salt decreased the severity of radiation-induced ulcerative damage to the gastrointestinal tract, enhanced the speed of healing of radiation ulcers, and increased the survival of animals. The approach applied can be used in the search for new antiradiation antidotes.

AB  - Heat stress has been recognized as a major environmental factor affecting reproductive performance in livestock. However, the underlying mechanisms through which high temperature impairs testicular function remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the effects of high temperature on morphology, oxidative stress levels, and testosterone synthesis in porcine testicular tissue in vitro. Testicular tissue samples from boars were subjected to different temperature conditions: control (37 C) and heat stress (39 C) for 4 h. The morphology of the testicular tissue was assessed using histological analysis, while oxidative stress levels were evaluated by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant enzyme activities. Additionally, the expression of key enzymes involved in testosterone synthesis was examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our results revealed that exposure to high temperatures significantly altered testicular tissue morphology. Histological analysis demonstrated degeneration and disorganization of seminiferous tubules, reduction in germ cell populations, and disruption of the blood-testis barrier. Moreover, hightemperature exposure significantly increased ROS production and decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (p < 0.05), indicating elevated oxidative stress levels in the testicular tissue. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis showed that high-temperature exposure suppressed the expression of key enzymes involved in testosterone synthesis, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamilies A member 1. These findings suggest high temperature impairs testicular function by disrupting testicular morphology, inducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting testosterone synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that high-temperature exposure adversely affects morphology, oxidative stress levels, and testosterone synthesis in porcine testicular tissue. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms underlying heat-induced reproductive dysfunction in male pigs and highlight the importance of heat stress management in swine production to maintain optimal reproductive performance. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise molecular pathways involved in the heat-induced testicular impairments observed in this study.

AB  - This study presents a spatially explicit optimization framework to support subnational climate policy in Vietnam's livestock sector. By integrating a genetic algorithm with district-level emissions modeling, we have identified cost-effective allocations of eight mitigation options in Quang Binh province to help meet the national methane reduction target of 12.39% by 2030. Drawing on livestock census data, IPCC emission factors, and region-specific marginal abatement costs (MACs), the model generates scenarios that achieve reductions of 13.9-29.3% in provincial GHG emissions. The most effective measures, which are biochar supplementation for cattle and silage feeding for buffaloes, not only deliver the greatest emission reductions at the lowest MACs, but also improve livestock productivity, offering strong economic co-benefits. Other interventions such as manure separation and expanded biogas systems also yield high mitigation potential, particularly when supported by carbon revenues or external incentives. With a net abatement cost of - 7.268 million USD and economic gains of 7.627 million USD under a carbon price of 5 USD/tCO(2)eq, our approach demonstrates how targeted, locally grounded strategies can align economic development with national climate goals. While simplified in terms of its behavioral assumptions, the model offers a practical, scalable tool for low-emission planning in data-constrained contexts and is transferable to other provinces under Vietnam's climate commitments.

AB  - ABS T R A C T The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes in human activity via extensive lockdowns worldwide. Large-scale shifts in human activities bestowed both positive and negative impacts on wildlife. Unforeseen reduction in the activities of people allowed wildlife to venture outside of forested areas to exploit newfound habitats and increase their diurnal activities. While on a negative note, a reduction in forest-related law enforcement led to sub-stantial increase in illegal activities such as poaching. We conducted mammal surveys in forested and nearby farmland of a fragmented landscape under two distinct scenarios: pre-lockdown and lockdown. An increase in poaching activi-ties observed during the lockdown period in our study area provided us an opportunity to investigate the impact of the lockdown on wildlife. Camera trapping data of four highly poached mammalian species, namely black-naped hare Lepus nigricollis, wild pig Sus scrofa, four-horned antelope Tetracerus quadricornis and leopard Panthera pardus were con-sidered to investigate activity patterns and habitat use, to understand the effect of lockdown. The pre-lockdown period was used as a baseline to compare any changes in trends of activity patterns, habitat use and detection probabilities of targeted species. Species-specific changes in activity patterns of study species were observed, with an increment in day-time activity during lockdown. The results showed species-specific increase in the habitat use of study species during lockdown. Reduction in the detection probability of all study species was witnessed. This is the first study to highlight the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the responses of wildlife by considering the changes in their temporal and spa-tial use before and during lockdown. The knowledge gained on wildlife during reduced human mobility because of the pandemic aid in understanding the effect of human disturbances and developing future conservation strategies in the shared space, to manage both wildlife and humans.

AB  - Herbivory can impact gas exchange, but the causes of interspecific variation in response remain poorly understood. We aimed to determine (1) what effects does experimental herbivory damage to leaf midveins have on leaf gas exchange and, (2) whether changes in leaf gas exchange after damage was predicted by leaf mechanical or venation traits. We hypothesized that herbivory-driven impacts on leaf gas exchange would be mediated by (1a/1b) venation networks, either by more vein resistance, or possibly trading off with other structural defenses; (2a/2b) or more reticulation (resilience, providing more alternate flow pathways after damage) or less reticulation (sectoriality, preventing spread of reduced functionality after damage). We simulated herbivory by damaging the midveins of four leaves from each of nine Sonoran Desert species. We then measured the percent change in photosynthesis (Delta An%), transpiration (Delta Et%) and stomatal conductance (Delta gsw%) between treated and control leaves. We assessed the relationship of each with leaf venation traits and other mechanical traits. Delta An% varied between +10 % and -55%, similar to Delta Et% (+27%, -54%) and Delta gsw% (+36%, -53%). There was no tradeoff between venation and other structural defenses. Increased damage resilience (reduced Delta An%, Delta Et%, Delta gsw%) was marginally associated with lower force-to-tear (P < 0.05), and higher minor vein density (P < 0.10) but not major vein density or reticulation. Leaf venation networks may thus partially mitigate the response of gas exchange to herbivory and other types of vein damage through either resistance or resilience.
   How do vein networks influence plant resistance or resilience to herbivory? While vein networks are widely understood to influence rates of resource transport in undamaged leaves, they may also promote resistance to damage or resilience of resource transport after damage. We tested this hypothesis via experimental herbivory and gas exchange measurements on nine Sonoran Desert plant species. We found that vein network architecture and mechanical traits do have an effect on gas exchange responses to experimental herbivory. Leaf venation networks thus partially mitigate the response of gas exchange to vein damage through either resistance or resilience.

AB  - Forage intake by grazing ruminants cannot be measured directly, which requires specific methodologies for its estimation, that generally involve the use of markers. The purpose of this study was to test methodologies for estimating dry matter intake (DMI) in supplemented grazing goats in dry tropical agroforestry (Caatinga). It was used eight esophagus-fistulated animals grazing in the semi-arid region, and receiving concentrate-based supplementation (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% based on body weight, BW). The methods used to estimate intake were: ingestive behavior (IB), in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and indigestible acid detergent fiber (iADF). The data was subjected to joint analysis of variance, analysis of variance and regression (regression analysis only for the effect of supplementation). The average DMI values obtained using the estimation methods were subjected to mean comparison tests. The estimates of total DMI in relation to BW using IB, IVDMD and iADF methods were 1.47, 3.21 and 2.96% of BW, respectively. Forage intake obtained through IB and IVDMD methods was not affected by the increase in supplementation levels, showing average values of 143.5 and 513.6 g DM/day, respectively. Method IB underestimated DMI in comparison to IVDMD. in vitro dry matter digestibility and indigestible acid detergent fiber methods are suitable for estimating DM intake of goats in dry tropical agroforestry.

AB  - Trichomes, epidermal appendages found on plant surfaces, are known to accumulate zinc (Zn) and cadmium in heavy metal-tolerant plants. This study investigates whether excessive heavy metal stress induces an increase in the number of leaf trichomes in such plants. Utilizing the Zn hyperaccumulator plant Arabidopsis kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana, we conducted field surveys and cultivation experiments to test this hypothesis. The field survey revealed a positive effect of soil Zn levels on the number of trichomes per leaf. Consistently, results from the cultivation experiments demonstrated a significant effect in three out of four accessions studied. Our findings suggest that an excess supply of Zn stimulates the formation of leaf trichomes in A. k. subsp. kawasakiana, potentially aiding in physiological stress alleviation. Our results introduce a novel observation of a plastic response, wherein soil Zn levels influence the development of leaf trichomes. The adaptive significance and specific developmental mechanisms underlying this response await further elucidation.

AB  - Camel production is under climatic stress, where it plays a significant role in the livelihood and food security of camel herders in the Borana areas. Camel herders' perceptions of climate change and variability are essential in response to climatic challenges and maintaining sustainable camel production. The aim of this study was to assess perceptions of camel herders about climate change and variability in relation to camel production in Borana Zone. A total of 260 respondents were selected based on systematic random and purposive sampling targeting camel herders. Over 34 years (from 1990 to 2023) of meteorological data were taken from the Ethiopian National Meteorology Institute. The study showed that 86.92% of the respondents perceived an increase in temperature trends, while 74.23% and 73.08% of them perceived a decrease in the amount and intensity of rainfall, respectively. Among respondents, 67.69%, 86.54%, and 73.38% of the respondents perceived high variability, late onset, and short duration of rainfall in the last three decades, respectively. Similarly, meteorological data confirmed that both mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures increased significantly (P < 0.01). Meteorological data showed 25% and 32%-66% of medium annual and high seasonal rainfall variations, respectively. Respondents observed, besides the high number of cattle deaths, reduced productivity and reproductive performance of camels as causes of recent climate change and variability. Under this climatic stress, respondents preferred the production of camels, followed by goats, and they used different adaptation mechanisms to cope with climate change effects. This findings confirmed respondents perceived the variations of rainfall and increased temperature consistent with meteorological data. Therefore, considering the perception of camel herders, systematic prediction and adaptation of climate change and variability are needed to reduce the impact of climate threats and thereby improve the resilience of camel owners in the study areas.

AB  - Simple Summary In modern livestock, using calves as embryo donors is already a reality; thus, animal genetics can be transmitted before these animals have reached sexual maturity, considerably reducing the interval between generations. This fact becomes more relevant in buffalo species, as they present great inconsistency in the results of in vitro embryo production. This study is the first to describe a safe and effective surgical procedure for obtaining oocytes by laparoscopy in a farm environment using three surgical ports and transabdominal needle aspiration. The technique of laparoscopic oocyte aspiration has been increasingly used in animals; however, there are few records of its use in buffaloes. To describe this technique, six suckling Murrah buffaloes aged between 3 and 5 months were used. Three laparoscopic ovum pick-ups were performed in each animal, with intervals of 15 days between surgeries, completing a total of 18 procedures. The technique used three surgical ports with optics and a high-definition video camera. The introduction of the first portal and insufflation of the abdomen was performed through the open technique, with aspiration using a 20 G needle transabdominally and a vacuum pump calibrated at 50 mmHg. The mean complete surgical time from anesthesia to the removal of the animal from the litter was 49 +/- 9.8 min. There were 27.8% cases of insufflation on the wrong side of the omentum. The oocyte recovery rate of 60.3% remained within the normal range. However, the rate of viable oocytes recovered was low, with only 40.8% of those recovered undergoing in vitro embryo production (IVEP). These data demonstrate that this simple, minimally invasive technique is an excellent reproductive tool for the genetic improvement of buffalo species.

AB  - Managers use morphometric data collected from harvested animals as indicators of nutritional condition. Antler or horn size often are considered in ungulates, but there are problems associated with biased and limited harvest data available from male animals in many populations. Adult female body mass also may be collected, but little information exists on how male antler size scales with female body mass. We evaluated the relationship between property-specific mature male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) antler size and adult female body mass from harvest data collected at 2 spatial scales. Regression predicted a 4.4-cm increase in average mature male antler size for every 1-kg increase in female body mass from 31 properties across the eastern United States, 2015-2023. Adult female mass explained 64% of the variation in mature antler size, and including latitude as a covariate did not improve model fit. When we considered data from 174 properties in Mississippi, USA, 1991-1994, we predicted a 4.7-cm increase in average mature male antler size for every 1-kg increase in adult female body mass. Including soil resource region in the Mississippi model explained 48% of the variation in mature male antler size by accounting for differences in average sizes across regions. Our results indicate average female body mass correlates with mature male antler size at multiple spatial scales. We recommend managers collect body mass and age from harvested female deer, as female mass represents a useful metric to track management progress and predict changes in antler size.

AB  - Several steps in the abattoir can influence the presence of microbes and associated resistance genes (ARGs) on the animal carcasses used for further meat processing. We investigated how these processes influence the resistomemicrobiome of groups of pigs with different on-farm antimicrobial exposure status, from the moment they entered the abattoir until the end of carcass processing. Using a targeted enrichment metagenomic approach, we identified 672 unique ARGs conferring resistance to 43 distinct AMR classes from pooled skin (N = 42) and carcass swabs (N = 63) collected sequentially before, during, and after the slaughter process and food safety interventions. We observed significant variations in the resistome and microbial profiles of pigs before and after slaughter, as well as a significant decline in ARG counts, diversity, and microbial DNA load during slaughter and carcass processing, irrespective of prior antimicrobial treatments on the farm. These results suggest that existing interventions in the abattoir are effective in reducing not only the pathogen load but also the overall bacterial burden, including ARGs on pork carcasses. Concomitant with reductions in microbial and ARG counts, we observed an increase in the relative abundance of non-drug-specific ARGs, such as those conferring resistance to metals and biocides, and in particular mercury. Using a strict colocalization procedure, we found that most mercury ARGs were associated with genomes from the Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that slaughter and processing practices within the abattoir can shape the microbial and ARG profiles of pork carcasses during the transition from living muscle to meat.

AB  - Recent statutory changes have increased the pressure on the German livestock sector to adapt. This paper aims to ascertain the factors affecting German pig farmers' willingness to join a pig farming exit scheme similar to the Dutch 'warm restructuring' programme. The analysis is based on a discrete choice experiment with 346 pig farmers. The results indicate great interest of the respondents in a government-run decommissioning scheme. Differences in the perception of scheme attributes (compensation offered, demolition requirements, restrictions on future barn construction and slurry intake) are highlighted by the results of a latent-class estimation.

AB  - Wild species living in captivity are subject to loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and differentiation among populations. Only very few species have been under human care for centuries but have not been selectively bred, have free-ranging movements most of the time, and retain porous barriers to gene flow between wild and captive populations. Such captive populations are expected to retain high levels of genetic diversity and anthropogenic factors should result in a limited genetic differentiation from wild populations. Asian elephants have been trained and used by humans for at least 4000 years as war animals, mounts of kings and draught animals. In Myanmar and Laos, elephants are still being used for hauling timber in the forest while retaining traditional management practices including seasonal release, free mating and movement. However, habitat fragmentation, isolation and reduced gene flows are threatening both semi-captive and wild pools. We genotyped 167 semi-captive elephants from Laos and Myanmar using a panel of 11 microsatellite loci to estimate the genetic diversity and population structure. We found that elephants of both countries presented high levels of genetic diversity and a low degree of inbreeding, if any. This agrees with the expected high level of genetic diversity in semi-captive populations. We found a weak differentiation along a geographical gradient from southern Laos to northern Myanmar but no differentiation between wild-caught and captive-born pools. The potential value for conservation of a large population of semi-captive elephants has been recognized but the conservation community has yet to fully explore the potential role semi-captive elephants could play in maintaining gene flows.

AB  - Better understanding of ecology is crucial for the success of endangered species conservation programmes. Little information is available on space use, conspecific interactions and recursions by one such species, the red panda Ailurus fulgens. To address this deficiency, we used GPS telemetry to examine their home range, core area, home-range overlap, dynamic interactions and recursive movement, and investigated the effect of sex, age and body mass on these behaviours across seasons. The median annual home range size was 1.41 km(2), with nearly a quarter of this range being used as the core area. Sex and reproductive status were the key determinants of space use patterns on a seasonal scale, while body mass and age remained significant correlates for the core area. The home range of males was nearly double that of females, likely because of the polygynous mating system in red pandas. Females avoided overlapping home ranges, while males overlapped home range with up to 4 females, and neighbouring males overlapped nearly half of their ranges. We found rare interactions between males and females outside the mating season. Red pandas showed site fidelity within their territory, with seasonal variation across sex classes. We also observed high individual variation in patterns of both space use and recursive movement. Taken together, these results suggest that differences in biological requirements across seasons determine red panda space use patterns, conspecific interactions and recursion. However, forage availability and quality, climatic factors, disturbances and habitat fragmentation are also likely to influence these behaviours, and these factors need to be investigated.

AB  - Tea plants are widely planted in tropical and subtropical regions globally, especially in southern China. The high leaching and strong soil acidity in these areas, in addition to human factors (e.g., tea picking and inappropriate fertilization methods) aggravate the lack of nutrients in tea garden soil. Therefore, improving degraded tea-growing soil is urgently required. Although the influence of biological factors (e.g., tea plant variety) on soil nutrients has been explored in the existing literature, there are few studies on the inhibition of soil nutrient degradation using different tea plant varieties. In this study, two tea plant varieties with different nutrient efficiencies (high-nutrient-efficiency variety: Longjing43 (LJ43); low-nutrient-efficiency variety: Liyou002 (LY002)) were studied. Under a one-side fertilization mode of two rows and two plants, the tea plant growth status, soil pH, and available nutrients in the soil profiles were analyzed, aiming to reveal the improvement of degraded soil using different tea varieties. The results showed that (1) differences in the phenotypic features of growth (such as dry tea yield, chlorophyll, leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) content) between the fertilization belts in LJ43 (LJ43-near and LJ43-far) were lower than those in LY002. (2) RDA results showed that the crucial soil nutrient factors which determine the features of tea plants included available P, slowly available K, and available K. Moreover, acidification was more serious near the fertilization belt. The pH of the soil near LJ43 was higher than that near LY002, indicating an improvement in soil acidification. (3) Soil nutrient heterogeneity between fertilization belts in LJ43 (LJ43-near and LJ43-far) was lower than in LY002. In conclusion, the long-term one-side fertilization mode of two rows and two plants usually causes spatial heterogeneities in soil nutrients and aggravates soil acidification. However, LJ43 can reduce the nutrient heterogeneities and soil acidification, which is probably due to the preferential development of secondary roots. These results are helpful in understanding the influence of tea plant variety on improving soil nutrients and provide a relevant scientific reference for breeding high-quality tea varieties, improving the state of degraded soil and maintaining soil health.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a progressively prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with substantial clinical heterogeneity. Despite the considerable interest in dietary interventions, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal nutritional therapy. The present study aimed to investigate the possible positive effect of goat's milk (GM) compared to cow's milk (CM) on ASD autistic features in a valproic acid (VPA; 600 mg/kg)-induced white albino rat model of autism. All tests were conducted on rats that were divided into four groups (n = 15/group): control with goat milk (GM) treatment, control with cow milk (CM) treatment, autistic with goat milk (GM) treatment, and autistic with cow milk treatment. The casein levels were also measured in GM and CM. Social behavior was assessed by three-chambered sociability to test social interaction after the intervention. After 15 days of intervention, selected biomarkers, such as glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), neurotransmitter dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), and glutamate (GLU), were measured in blood serum and brain homogenates. The results showed a significant positive effect on social interaction in the VPA rat ASD model fed GM. Blood serum and brain samples showed a positive increase in TBARS in the VPA rat model fed GM, but brain and serum serotonin levels were lower in both VPA-GM and VPA-CM groups. Dopamine in serum was also lower in the VPA-CM group than in the VPA-GM group. IL-6 levels were slightly lower in the VPA-GM group than in the VPA-CM group. In comparison with cow's milk, goat's milk was effective in ameliorating the neurotoxic effects of VPA. Goat's milk may be considered a suitable source of dairy for children diagnosed with ASD. Autistic children with allergies to cow's milk could possibly convert to goat's milk. Nevertheless, more in-depth studies and clinical trials are recommended.

AB  - After increases following restoration efforts, the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) population appeared to decline during the early 2000s in many areas of the species' range. The 2014 status assessment indicated that estimated population size, harvest, and hunter numbers had declined since at least 2009. Several studies concurrently detailed regional declines in productivity of wild turkey populations. During 2019, we continued to monitor status of wild turkey populations in the United States by surveying state agency biologists charged with overseeing wild turkey management programs. We asked biologists to provide estimates of population abundance and distribution within their state. We also requested that each biologist provide data on turkey hunter numbers and harvest for both spring and fall hunting seasons, if those data were available. Based on agency biologist responses, wild turkey population size declined by similar to 3% across states that contributed data to both the 2014 and 2019 status updates. However, during our 2019 survey, abundance data were unavailable for 12 states that reported estimates for the 2014 assessment. We estimated that the number of wild turkey hunters declined by 18% between the 2014 and 2019 assessments, but note the 2019 estimate was confounded by missing data from 8 states that provided data during 2014. Across all reporting states, fall and spring harvests decreased by 31 and 12%, respectively, between the 2014 and 2019 assessments. Despite widespread recognition that standardization of monitoring methods across states would facilitate more consistent inferences about wild turkey abundance, further progress towards regional or national standardization is needed. Furthermore, the approach of converting harvest data to a population estimate by dividing harvest estimates by a constant percentage of estimated take should be revisited to ensure accuracy, especially given known spatial and temporal variation in harvest pressure, hunting activity, and hunter behavior. We encourage continued development of improved techniques to estimate wild turkey abundance and distribution, and recommend that all states and provinces consider standardized methods to accurately monitor and report harvest and hunter effort.

AB  - The goal of this study was to characterize and evaluate the main markers of macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and plasmocytes in the testis of juvenile and adult yaks by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Within the same age group, the mRNA expression of CD68 was always highest, followed by that of CD3 epsilon, CD79 alpha, IgG and IgA. Moreover, CD68, CD3, CD79 alpha, IgA and IgG positive cells were all located in the testicular interstitial tissues of juvenile and adult yaks. In the same age group, the frequency of CD68 positive macrophages was higher than that of CD3 positive T lymphocytes, which was followed by that of CD79 alpha positive B lymphocytes and IgA and IgG positive plasmocytes. No significant difference was observed between the B lymphocyte and plasmocyte frequencies in yak testes. Furthermore, CD68, CD3 epsilon, CD79 alpha, IgA and IgG mRNA expression levels and the frequencies of CD68, CD3, CD79 alpha, IgA and IgG positive cells increased from juveniles to adults. Similarly, the frequencies of CD68, CD3, CD79 alpha, IgA and IgG positive cells also increased with age. These results suggest that in the yak testis, the immune defence system against pathogens might primarily comprise macrophages and T lymphocytes in the testicular interstitial tissue. Moreover, the testicular immune environment may mature and expand to a fully functional state in adult yaks. The low frequencies of B lymphocyte and plasmocyte in yaks, differing from those in rodents and humans, might be related to the fact that yaks live in low-oxygen plateaus.

AB  - As one of the four most important woody oil-tree in the world, Camellia oleifera has significant economic value. Rapid and accurate acquisition of C. oleifera tree-crown information is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of C. oleifera tree management and accurately predicting fruit yield. This study is the first of its kind to explore training the ResU-Net model with UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) images containing elevation information for automatically detecting tree crowns and estimating crown width (CW) and crown projection area (CPA) to rapidly extract tree-crown information. A Phantom 4 RTK UAV was utilized to acquire high-resolution images of the research site. Using UAV imagery, the tree crown was manually delineated. ResU-Net model's training dataset was compiled using six distinct band combinations of UAV imagery containing elevation information [RGB (red, green, and blue), RGB-CHM (canopy height model), RGB-DSM (digital surface model), EXG (excess green index), EXG-CHM, and EXG-DSM]. As a test set, images with UAV-based CW and CPA reference values were used to assess model performance. With the RGB-CHM combination, ResU-Net achieved superior performance. Individual tree-crown detection was remarkably accurate (Precision = 88.73%, Recall = 80.43%, and F1score = 84.68%). The estimated CW (R-2 = 0.9271, RMSE = 0.1282 m, rRMSE = 6.47%) and CPA (R-2 = 0.9498, RMSE = 0.2675 m(2), rRMSE = 9.39%) values were highly correlated with the UAV-based reference values. The results demonstrate that the input image containing a CHM achieves more accurate crown delineation than an image containing a DSM. The accuracy and efficacy of ResU-Net in extracting C. oleifera tree-crown information have great potential for application in non-wood forests precision management.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from hog operations contributes to noxious odors in the surrounding environment and can be life-threatening. There is, however, limited understanding of what influences H2S emissions from these farms. Emissions of H2S were measured periodically over the course of two years at hog finisher farms in humid mesothermal (North Carolina, NC, USA) and semi-arid (Oklahoma, OK, USA) climates. Emissions were determined using an inverse dispersion backward Lagrangian stochastic model in conjunction with line-sampled H2S concentrations and measured turbulence. Daily emissions at the two lagoons were characterized by low emissions on most days with occasional days of high emissions. Mean annual area-specific emissions were much lower for the NC lagoon (1.32 mu g H2S m(-2) s(-1) +/- 0.07 mu g H2S m(-2) s(-1)) than the OK lagoon (6.88 mu g H2S m(-2) s(-1) +/- 0.13 mu g H2S m(-2) s(-1)). Mean annual hog-specific emissions for the NC lagoon were 0.75 g H2S hd(-1) d(-1) while those for the OK lagoon were 1.92 g H2S hd(-1) d(-1). Emissions tended to be higher during the afternoon, likely due to higher mean winds. Daily H2S emissions from both lagoons were greatest during the first half of the year and decreased as the year progressed and a reddish color (indicating high populations of purple sulfur bacteria (PSB)) appeared in the lagoon. The generally low emissions at the NC lagoon and higher emissions at the OK lagoon were likely a result of the influence of wind on mixing the lagoon and not the presence of PSB.

AB  - The study describes the ultrastructure of the tongue in the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum) using light and scanning electron microscopy. Histochemical methods were used for evaluation of lingual salivary glands. The tongue is divided into a small and rounded apex, a narrow corpus, and a significantly wider radix, with a well-developed lingual prominence. The tip of the apex is free of papillae. The caudal part of the apex and the corpus are covered by filiform papillae. Round fungiform papillae are scattered among them. Papillae on the narrow stalk are conical. The radix contains caudally bent papillae forming wide flat prominences, slender, hook shaped filiform papillae, foliate papillae, and two oval vallate papillae. Taste buds were found on the lateral sides of the foliate and vallate papillae. Purely serous salivary glands are beneath the vallate and foliate papillae. Serous acini and mucous tubules are in the lingual radix. The Patagonian mara is the only hystricomorph rodent with described hyaline cartilage strengthening the lingual radix. Some typical signs of adaptation to herbivorous diet were found. The structure of the tongue is adapted to grass-feeding, as grasses form the main component of their diet.

AB  - Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) play a pivotal role in the Southern Ocean as wide-ranging marine predators and major prey consumers within Southern Ocean marine ecosystems. Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness of their habitat, large uncertainties remain about their total population sizes. This is especially true for elephant seal populations in the French Southern Territories in the southern Indian Ocean (i.e. Crozet and Kerguelen Archipelagos) as many breeding sites are inaccessible for ground censuses. Here, we present a simple and efficient approach for estimating the total elephant seal populations of the Kerguelen and Crozet Archipelagos by using very high-resolution satellite imagery (<1m resolution). Twenty-eight satellite images taken during the breeding season to count female elephant seals in inaccessible areas were used and complemented the traditional annual ground counts in accessible areas. For Kerguelen Island sectors likely to host colonies and where no satellite images were available for the breeding season, a statistical predictive model was built to estimate the most likely number of breeding females to be present on a given beach according to its physiographic characteristics. Our results show the reliability of using very high-resolution satellite images, a relatively low-cost platform, to count pinniped populations and provide the first estimation of the total southern elephant seal population for both the Kerguelen 347,995 (s e = 4,950) and Crozet 13,065 (s e = 169) Archipelagos. The combined total represents over 35% of the global elephant seal population with the Kerguelen stock being numerically equivalent to the South Georgia stock. In addition, we re-examined the population trends since the last mid-century for Kerguelen and over the last five decades for Crozet. The demographic trends of the southern Indian Ocean populations show marked growth over the last decade (5.1% and 1.6% annual growth rate for Crozet and Kerguelen respectively), particularly on Crozet where the elephant seal population has more than tripled.

AB  - Congeneric species often share ecological niche space resulting in competitive interactions that either limit co-occurrence or lead to niche partitioning. Differences in fundamental nutritional niches mediated through character displacement or isolation during evolution are potential mechanisms that could explain overlapping distribution patterns of congenerics. We directly compared nutritional requirements and tolerances that influence the fundamental niche of mule (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), which occur in allopatry and sympatry in similar realized ecological niches across their ranges in North America. Digestible energy and protein requirements and tolerances for plant fiber and plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) of both deer species were quantified using in vivo digestion and intake tolerance trials with six diets ranging in content of fiber, protein, and PSMs using tractable deer raised under identical conditions in captivity. We found that compared with white-tailed deer, mule deer required 54% less digestible protein and 21% less digestible energy intake per day to maintain body mass and nitrogen balance. In addition, they had higher fiber, energy, and dry matter digestibility and produced glucuronic acid (a byproduct of PSM detoxification) at a slower rate when consuming the monoterpene alpha-pinene. The mule deers' enhanced physiological abilities to cope with low-quality, chemically defended forages relative to white-tailed deer might minimize potential competitive interactions in shared landscapes and provide a modest advantage to mule deer in habitats dominated by low-quality forages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of DNA metabarcoding has become an increasingly popular technique to infer feeding relationships in polyphagous herbivores and predators. Understanding host plant preference of native and invasive herbivore insects can be helpful in establishing effective integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. The invasive Halyomorpha halys and native Pentatoma rufipes are piercing-sucking stink bug pests that are known to cause economic damage in commercial fruit orchards. RESULTS: In this study, we performed molecular gut content analysis (MGCA) on field-collected specimens of these two herbivorous pentatomids using next-generation amplicon sequencing (NGAS) of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) barcode region. Additionally, a laboratory experiment was set up where H. halys was switched from a mixed diet to a monotypic diet, allowing us to determine the detectability of the initial diet in a time series of <= 3 days after the diet switch. We detected 68 unique plant species from 54 genera in the diet of two stink bug species, with fewer genera found per sample and a smaller diet breadth for P. rufipes than for H. halys. Both stink bug species generally prefer deciduous trees over gymnosperms and herbaceous plants. Landscape type significantly impacted the observed genera in the diet of both stink bug species, whereas season only had a significant effect on the diet of H. halys. CONCLUSION: This study provides further insights into the dietary composition of two polyphagous pentatomid pests and illustrates that metabarcoding can deliver a relevant species-level resolution of host plant preference.

AB  - Simple Summary Licury cake is a by-product used to replace conventional ingredients in ruminant diets to reduce production costs. Some studies in sheep and in beef and dairy cattle showed promising results with the inclusion of licury cake in the diets of feedlot ruminants. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the productive performance and metabolic behavior of dairy goats subjected to increasing inclusion levels of licury cake in the diet. Our main results showed that the inclusion of licury cake in the diet did not promote negative effects on the nutrient intake, digestibility, metabolism, and performance of feedlot lactating goats. We additionally observed that, through feeding behavior, the inclusion of licury cake promoted greater efficiency in the intake and rumination of fiber. Moreover, through the metabolism, we found that the inclusion of licury cake promoted higher recycling of nitrogen; however, more studies are needed to elucidate these facts. Our results showed that the inclusion of licury cake of up to 200 g kg(-1) of dry matter in the diets of lactating goats can be recommended without affecting productive performance. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of licury cake (LC) inclusion in the diets of lactating goats on productive and metabolic performance. Twelve lactating goats, eight Saanen and four Anglo-Nubian, were distributed in a triplicate 4 x 4 Latin square design, with four treatments (0, 66.7, 133.3, and 200 g kg(-1) of dry matter-DM). On the one hand, the LC inclusion increased neutral detergent fiber, indigestible neutral detergent fiber, and potentially digestible neutral detergent fiber (p < 0.001) intake. On the other hand, LC inclusion reduced ether extract and non-fibrous carbohydrate (p < 0.001) intake. There was a reduction in dry matter digestibility (p = 0.018) and an increase in neutral detergent fiber digestibility (p = 0.036). Feeding (p = 0.005) and rumination (p < 0.001) efficiencies increased with LC inclusion. The nitrogen balance was similar for all tested diets; however, we observed recycling metabolism. Based on the studied parameters, mainly milk production and composition, we recommend the LC inclusion of up to 200 g kg(-1) DM in diets for lactating goats.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on different functions of the central nervous system in several mammal species, being used to improve behavior and cell damage in various neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, little has been investigated on the effect of EE in healthy ani-mals, particularly regarding its impact on memory persistence and the brain structures involved. Therefore, here we verified in male Wistar rats that contextual fear conditioning (CFC) memory persistence, tested 28 days after the CFC training session, was facilitated by 5 weeks of exposure to EE, with no effect in groups tested 7 or 14 days after CFC training. However, a two-week exposure to EE did not affect memory persistence. Moreover, we investigated the role of specific brain regions in mediating the effect of EE on memory persistence. We conducted inactivation experiments using the GABAergic agonist Muscimol to target the basolateral amygdala (BLA), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and CA1 region of the hippocampus (CA1). Inactivation of the BLA immedi-ately and 12 h after CFC training impaired the effect of EE on memory persistence. Similarly, inactivation of the CA1 region and mPFC 12 h after training, but not immediately, also impaired the effect of EE on memory persistence. These results have important scientific implications as they shed new light on the effect of an enriched environment on memory persistence and the brain structures involved, thereby helping elucidate how an environment rich in experiences can modify the persistence of learned information.

AB  - A crucial component of small ruminant production, particularly where intensive systems are becoming more prevalent, is determining the forage-to-concentrate (F:C) ratio in their daily diets. The effects of the F:C ratio in lambs and goat kids' daily diets on growth, stereotypical behavior, and blood biochemical parameters were investigated. Eighteen Tahirova sheep lambs and 18 Turkish Saanen goat kids were used, divided into three groups using the following F:C ratios: 20:80, 60:40, and 80:20. Growth rates, weight gains, and feed conversion ratios were determined. Urea nitrogen, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, creatine kinase, and cortisol hormones were measured in blood samples. In lambs, growth remained consistent across F:C groups. In goat kids, however, the 20:80 group showed superior growth and weight gain. Based on the F:C ratios, behavioral differences were found in forage feeding, rumination, water consumption, and standing activities. Similarly, the 20:80 group displayed higher rates of bar biting, crib biting, and wool biting in lambs, as well as bar biting, crib biting, bucket biting, and chain chewing in goat kids. Cortisol levels were significantly higher in the 80:20 group than in the 20:80 group for both species. Insufficient forage can cause abnormal stereotypical behaviors, which negatively impact animal welfare.

AB  - In recent decades, the integration of horses (Equus ferus) in European rewilding initiatives has gained widespread popularity due to their potential for regulating vegetation and restoring natural ecosystems. However, employing horses in conservation efforts presents important challenges, which we here explore and discuss. These challenges encompass the lack of consensus on key terms inherent to conservation and rewilding, the entrenched culture and strong emotions associated with horses, low genetic diversity and high susceptibility to hereditary diseases in animals under human selection, as well as insufficient consideration for the social behaviour of horses in wild-living populations. In addition, management of wild-living horses involves intricate welfare, ethics and legislative dimensions. Anthropocentric population-control initiatives may be detrimental to horse group structures since they tend to prioritise individual welfare over the health of populations and ecosystems. To overcome these challenges, we provide comprehensive recommendations. These involve a systematic acquisition of genetic information, a focus on genetic diversity rather than breed purity and minimal veterinary intervention in wild-living populations. Further, we advise allowing for natural top-down and bottom-up control - or, if impossible, simulating this by culling or non-lethal removal of horses - instead of using fertility control for population management. We advocate for intensified collaboration between conservation biologists and practitioners and enhanced communication with the general public. Decision-making should be informed by a thorough understanding of the genetic makeup, common health issues and dynamics, and social behaviour in wild-living horse populations. Such a holistic approach is essential to reconcile human emotions associated with horses with the implementation of conservation practices that are not only effective but also sustainable for the long-term viability of functional, biodiverse ecosystems, while rehabilitating the horse as a widespread wild-living species in Europe.

AB  - Current political focus on promoting circular economy in the European Union drives great interest in developing and using more biobased fertilizers (BBFs, most often waste or residue-derived). Many studies have been pubolished on environmental emissions, including ammonia (NH3) volatilization from manures, but there have only been a few such studies on BBFs. Ammonia volatilization from agriculture poses a risk to the environment and human health, causing pollution in natural ecosystems when deposited and formation of fine particulate matter (PMx). Furthermore, NH3 volatilization results in removal of plant-available N from agricultural systems, constituting an economic loss for farmers. The aim of this laboratory study was to determine the potential NH3 volatilization from 39 different BBFs commercially available on the European market. In addition, this study aimed to investigate the effect of incorporation, application rate, soil type, and soil moisture content on potential NH3 volatilization in order to derive suggestions for the optimal field application conditions. Results showed a great variation between BBFs in potential NH3 volatilization, both in terms of their temporal pattern of volatilization and amount of NH3 volaotilized. The potential NH3 volatilization varied from 0% of applied total N (olive oil compost) to 64% of applied total N (manure and crop digestate) during a 27- or 44-day incubation period. Characteristics of BBFs (pH, NH4+N, NO3 (-) N, DM, C:N) and their interaction with time could explain 89% of the variation in accumulated potential NH3 volatilization. Incorporation of BBFs into an acidic sandy soil effectively reduced potential NH3 volatiliozation by 37%-96% compared to surface application of BBFs. Potential NH3 volatilization was not significantly affected by differences in application rate or soil moisture content, but varied between five different soils (with different clay and organic matter content), with the highest NH3 volatilization potential from the acidic sandy soil.

AB  - Context-dependence in mutualisms is a fundamental aspect of ecological interactions. Within plant-ant mutualisms, particularly in terms of biotic protection and pollination, research has predominantly focused on elucidating the benefits while largely overlooking potential costs. This notable gap underscores the need for investigations into the drawbacks and trade-offs associated with such mutualistic relationships. Here, we evaluated the role of pericarpial nectaries (PNs) in shaping the dynamics of ant-pollinator mutualisms. Specifically, we investigated whether ants visiting the PN of Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae) could deter hummingbirds and disrupt pollination, ultimately influencing fruit production. Our research involved manipulative experiments and observation of ant-pollinator interactions on P. rigida plants in the Brazilian savannah. We found that visiting ants can deter hummingbirds and/or disrupt pollination in P. rigida, directly influencing fruit set. However, these results are species-specific. The presence of very aggressive, large predatory ants, such as E. tuberculatum, had a negative impact on hummingbird behavior, whereas aggressive mid-sized ants, such as C. crassus, showed no effects. Our study illuminates the multifaceted aspects of ant-plant mutualisms and underscores the importance of evaluating costs and unexpected outcomes within these ecological relationships.

AB  - According to the theory of optimal foraging and preference-performance hypothesis, herbivores usually select plant hosts that benefit themselves or their offspring. We investigated the hypothesis that gravid females of the cucurbit beetle Diabrotica speciosa use volatiles derived from non-infested maize plants and herbivore-infested plants under attack by their conspecific immatures and adults in selecting a host for oviposition. The response of D. speciosa females to volatiles was quantified for the following treatments: (i) non-infested plants; (ii) plants infested by larvae (root-infested); (iii) plants infested by adults (leaf-infested); and (iv) plants infested by larvae and adults (leaf + root-infested). We also assessed if females were able to identify conditions of competition and host adequacy for offspring by means of chemical cues emitted by these plants. The results indicated that the presence of D. speciosa conspecifics on maize plants triggered the emission of volatiles, which influenced host selection for oviposition. Gravid females avoided both plants infested by larvae and plants infested by larvae and adults. Leaf-infested plants did not affect the host-selection behavior of females. Weight gain was higher in larvae kept on non-infested and leaf-infested plants than on root-infested or root + leaf-infested plants, indicating that female preference is related to its offspring performance.

AB  - Individual dietary variation has important ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, it has been overlooked in many taxa that are thought to have homogeneous diets. This is the case of vultures, considered merely as 'carrion eaters'. Given their high degree of sociality, vultures are an excellent model to investigate how inter-individual transmissible behaviours drive individual dietary variation. Here, we combine GPS-tracking and accelerometers with an exhaustive fieldwork campaign to identify the individual diet of 55 griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) from two Spanish populations that partially overlap in their foraging areas. We found that individuals from the more humanized population consumed more anthropic resources (e.g. stabled livestock or rubbish), resulting in more homogeneous diets. By contrast, individuals from the wilder population consumed more wild ungulates, increasing their dietary variability. Between sexes, we found that males consumed anthropic resources more than females did. Interestingly, in the shared foraging area, vultures retained the dietary preference of their original population, highlighting a strong cultural component. Overall, these results expand the role of cultural traits in shaping key behaviours and call for the need of including cultural traits in Optimal Foraging models, especially in those species that strongly rely on social information while foraging.

AB  - Duckweed is a plant with high phytoremediation abilities, which is why it is used in the process of cleaning the aquatic environment. The present study aimed to determine the effect of various concentrations of pig slurry added to the growth media used to produce duckweed (Lemna minor) (laboratory Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW) (experimental groups 1-9, pig slurry concentration (%): 1-2.00, 2-1.50, 3-1.00, 4-0.75, 5-0.50, 6-0.25, 7-0.12, 8-0.06, 9-0.03, control group 0-0.00). The contents of nutrients in the growth media could be classified as high (gr. 1-3), optimal (gr. 4-6), and deficient (gr. 7-9). Analyses were conducted for duckweed yield and growth medium parameters (pig slurry concentration, pH, salinity, temperature, TDS, and EC) on days 0, 10, 20, and 30 of the experiment. No growth or poor growth of duckweed were noted in groups 1, 6-9, and 0. In turn, satisfactory yields of duckweed green mass were recorded in groups 3-5, which allowed choosing them for further observations and analyses, including proximate composition (including protein content); contents of Ca, Mg, K, Na, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Al, Cr, and & alpha;-tocopherol; and carotenoids-& beta;-carotene, & alpha;-carotene, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, amino acids, fatty acids as well as N-NH4 and N-NO3. The plant material had an acceptable proximate composition and nutritionally safe analyzed component contents. Appropriate, stable growth medium conditions allowed the production of satisfactory duckweed yields. The study results allowed us to conclude that it is feasible to obtain feed material meeting basic quality standards by maintaining a closed circuit of duckweed culture, and use in the agricultural environment is possible through harnessing pig slurry for its production and ensuring its optimal growth conditions.

AB  - Heat waves are becoming more frequent across the globe and may impose severe thermoregulatory challenges for endotherms. Heat stress can induce both behavioral and physiological responses, which may result in energy deficits with potential fitness consequences. We studied the responses of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), a cold-adapted ungulate, to a record-breaking heat wave in northern Finland. Activity, heart rate, subcutaneous body temperature, and body mass data were collected for 14 adult females. The post-heat wave autumn body masses were then analyzed against longitudinal body mass records for the herd from 1990 to 2021. With increasing air temperature during the day, reindeer became less active and had reduced heart rate and increased body temperature, reflecting both behavioral and physiological responses to heat stress. Although they increased activity in the late afternoon, they failed to compensate for lost foraging time on the hottest days (daily mean temperature >= 20 degrees C), and total time active was reduced by 9%. After the heat wave, the mean September body mass of herd females (69.7 +/- 6.6 kg, n=52) was on average 16.4% +/- 4.8% lower than predicted (83.4 +/- 6.0 kg). Among focal females, individuals with the lowest levels of activity during the heat wave had the greatest mass loss during summer. We show how heat waves impose a thermoregulatory challenge on endotherms, resulting in mass loss, potentially as a result of the loss of foraging time. While it is well known that environmental conditions affect large herbivore fitness indirectly through decreased forage quality and limited water supply, direct effects of heat may be increasingly common in a warming climate.

AB  - The BISON fuel performance analysis code has been used to study FeCrAl and Zircaloy cladding perfor-mance to better understand cladding deformation behavior in boiling water reactors during conditions caused by anticipated operational occurrences (AOOs) or by anticipated transients without scram (ATWS). BISON models of novel separate effects tests simulating ATWS events predicted mechanical responses to thermal cycling boundary conditions. We assessed FeCrAl and Zircaloy deformation and burst models to determine those best suited for cyclic dryout event analysis. In addition, we compared diametral strain profiles of the post-experiment claddings to simulation results. The capability of the BISON code for mod-eling BWR AOO or ATWS events is promising.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The Ashanti Dwarf pig (ADP), also sometimes referred as the Ashanti Black Forest pig, is the predominant domestic pig breed found in Ghana, West Africa. Although the breed has been traditionally used for subsistence farming and for cultural ceremonies, its potential for commercial farming is gaining attention. There is little information on the genetics of this pig breed which is considered a small breed with an average adult weight of 25-50 kg. In this study, we conducted a population genomic diversity analysis of the Ashanti Dwarf pig and other pig populations within the different regional and ecological zones of Ghana, to ascertain their genetic architecture. The results from this study suggest genetic diversity among the ADP populations found within the different regional and ecological zones of Ghana.Abstract There is still limited information on the genomic structure and genetic diversity of African pigs. Genetic diversity studies can contribute significantly to the genetic improvement and conservation of African pigs. This study presents a genetic diversity analysis and population structure of pig breeds in Ghana, with a focus on the Ashanti Dwarf pig (ADP), an indigenous pig breed of Ghana. A total of 167 pigs sampled in Ghana and populations consisting of Ashanti Dwarf pigs (n = 106), exotics (mostly European pigs) (n = 11), crosses (between indigenous and exotic breeds) (n = 44), and unknown breeds (nondescript) (n = 6) were genotyped using Porcine SNP60K BeadChip. Moderate heterozygosity levels, ranging from 0.28 for Ashanti Dwarf pigs to 0.31 for exotic pigs (mostly European pigs), were observed. Principal component analysis of the pig populations within Ghana resulted in two distinct clusters of pigs: (i) Northern and (ii) Southern regional clusters. The PCA based on breed also resulted in four clusters: (i) ADPs; (ii) exotics (iii) crossbreeds between ADP and exotics; (iv) unknown breed types. The PCA demonstrated that the clustering was influenced by genetics, geographical location, production systems, and practices. ADMIXTURE-based analysis also showed that the populations within Ghana are admixed. FST analysis revealed SNPs associated with QTLs for traits such as disease resilience and growth among ADP populations within the different regional and ecological zones of Ghana.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) are among the world's most significant economic tree species. Tissue culture serves as a crucial method in commercial breeding by facilitating the rapid propagation of valuable genotypes and the generation of disease-free clones. However, callus browning represents a prevalent challenge in tea plant tissue culture, and may adversely affect explant growth and development. Our research demonstrates that although anti-browning agents can effectively suppress browning, they induce distinct color changes in the callus. These color variations could significantly influence callus induction and subsequent growth patterns. In this study, callus tissues from C. sinensis var. Assamica cv. Mengku were employed as experimental materials and treated with three commonly used anti-browning agents: ascorbic acid (VC), activated carbon (AC), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The results demonstrated that while these three reagents effectively inhibited browning, they also induced distinct color changes in the explants, which appeared red, green, and white, respectively. Furthermore, this study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying callus color changes using transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches. Based on transcriptome analysis, it was revealed that photosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were significantly enriched. Metabolome analysis identified 14 phenolic acids, which exhibited significant variation in accumulation across calluses of different colors. The differential expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, coupled with the distinct accumulation patterns of metabolites, can effectively alleviate photooxidative damage and enhance the resistance of callus to browning. AC activates the photosynthesis of callus by regulating carbon source allocation and upregulating the expression of key genes in the psa, psb, and pet families within the photosynthetic system. This process promotes chlorophyll biosynthesis, thereby enabling the callus to grow green, while VC activates the expression of key genes such as CHS, F3H, C4H, CYP75B1, and ANR in the flavonoid pathway, which are involved in the regulation of pigment synthesis in red callus. This study elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of anti-browning agents on color variations in C. sinensis callus, thereby providing a robust theoretical foundation for optimization, the establishment of tea plant tissue culture systems, and enhancing cultivar quality.

AB  - Drought associated with climate change is undoubtedly one of the most prodigious challenges facing agricultural production and human food security throughout the world. Regarding the increasing incidence and potency of drought under ongoing global warming, determining the potential impacts of water-deficit tension on insect demographic attributes is a key element in success of any management program. By subjecting the western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis, to well-watered and water-stressed cherry tomato plants, the impacts of this stressor on thrips performance were assessed. The key life-history parameters of WFT on fully-irrigated plants (FIT), 80% and 60% FIT were compared. WFT performed worse on drought-stress plants. Thrips specimens developed faster on 60% FIT and the female individuals were less fecund. When reared on plants grown under 60% full irrigation treatment (FIT), WFT displayed lower net reproductive rates and intrinsic and finite rates of increase compared to those reared on stress-free plants. Moreover, with increasing water stress intensity, the sex ratio became more male-biased which might in turn cause mate shortages and consequently a reduction in population growth. Our analysis showed that activities of the enzymes CAT and POD are elevated under WS conditions, and this might be correlated with reduced WFT fitness. In total, 60% FIT drought stress could have the capacity to lessen the abundance and upsurge risk of this destructive pest species under future climate change scenarios. The knowledge gained in this study will aid tomato producers understand how drought stress impact WFT demographic traits, and to foresee if pesticide treatments will be required to manage this infamous pest.

AB  - Drought can seriously affect the yield and quality of tea. The interaction between rhizosphere microorganisms and tea plants could enhance the drought resistance of tea plants. However, there are few studies on the effects of abundant and rare microorganisms on tea plants. In this study, the contributions of abundant and rare bacteria in the rhizosphere microorganisms of 'FudingDabaicha' and 'Baiye No.1' to the resistance of tea plants to drought stress were studied using 16SrRNA sequencing, co-occurrence network analysis, and PLS-PM modeling analysis. By measuring the contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, soluble sugar and soluble protein, it was found that the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the content of osmotic substances increased significantly after drought stress (p < 0.001). In the co-occurrence network of the two varieties, the average degree, clustering coefficient, and modularity index of the rare bacteria were greater than those of the abundant bacteria, and the path coefficient of the rare bacteria to drought was greater than that of the abundant bacteria. The contribution of rare microorganisms in 'FudingDabaicha' to drought stress was greater than that in 'Baiye No.1'. The rare bacteria of the two varieties were positively correlated with amino acids and negatively correlated with lipids. The results of this study will provide new insights for the use of rhizosphere microorganisms in improving the drought resistance of tea plants.

AB  - Plant-Lepidoptera interactions are often studied using the pollination or herbivore networks only. Lepidoptera species are involved in two types of plant-insect interactions because they are herbivores as larvae and pollinators as adults. The study of entangled networks is critical, since the interaction of different networks can affect the overall network and community stability. Here, we studied the interaction of plants and Lepidoptera on the Yongxing Island, South China Sea. A plant-lepidopteran pollination network and a plant-lepidopteran herbivore network were built by using data from flower-pollinator and leaf-herbivore interactions. We then combined the two networks into a single network. We measured plant composition similarity within each sub-network and across sub-networks for Lepidoptera species. Our findings indicate that the plant-Lepidoptera pollination network and the herbivory network share significant proportions of Lepidoptera but small proportions of plant assemblages. The pollination network had higher nestedness and connectance than the herbivore network. Agrius convolvuli was the most specialized species, while Zizina otis had the highest species strength in the pollination network. Most Lepidoptera species were highly specialized in the herbivore network and their importance positively correlated across the two networks. Furthermore, there was no dietary composition similarity between the two networks for most Lepidoptera species. Our findings highlight the visible structural difference between the pollination and the herbivore networks. Adult Lepidoptera selects different plants for oviposition and feeding, a strategy that may benefit their reproduction and survival by sustaining adequate resources for their two life stages and the diversity of both plants and insects in oceanic island communities.

AB  - The yak (Bos grunniens) is a valuable livestock animal endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China with low reproductive rates. Cryptorchidism is one of the primary causes of infertility in male yaks. Compared with normal testes, the tight junctions (TJs) of Sertoli cells (SCs) and the integrity of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) in cryptorchidism are both disrupted. MicroRNAs are hairpin-derived RNAs of about 19-25 nucleotides in length and are involved in a variety of biological processes. Numerous studies have shown the involvement of microRNAs in the reproductive physiology of yak. In this study, we executed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to describe the expression profiles of mRNAs and microRNAs in yaks with normal testes and cryptorchidism to identify differentially expressed genes. GO and KEGG analyses were used to identify the biological processes and signaling pathways which the target genes of the differentially expressed microRNAs primarily engaged. It was found that novel-m0230-3p is an important miRNA that significantly differentiates between cryptorchidism and normal testes, and it is down-regulated in cryptorchidism with p < 0.05. Novel-m0230-3p and its target gene CSF1 both significantly contribute to the regulation of cell adhesion and tight junctions. The binding sites of novel-m0230-3p with CSF1 were validated by a dual luciferase reporter system. Then, mimics and inhibitors of novel-m0230-3p were transfected in vitro into SCs, respectively. A further analysis using qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence (IF), and Western blotting confirmed that the expression of cell adhesion and tight-junction-related proteins Occludin and ZO-1 both showed changes. Specifically, both the mRNA and protein expression levels of Occludin and ZO-1 in SCs decreased after transfection with the novel-m0230-3p mimics, while they increased after transfection with the inhibitors, with p < 0.05. These were achieved via the CSF1/CSF1R/Ras signaling pathway. In summary, our findings indicate a negative miRNA-mRNA regulatory network involving the CSF1/CSF1R/Ras signaling pathway in yak SCs. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of CSF1 and suggest that novel-m0230-3p and its target protein CSF1 could be used as potential therapeutic targets for yak cryptorchidism.

AB  - CircRNAs play an important role in fat deposition, and testosterone-deficient boars exhibit significantly increased fat deposition; however, the mechanism by which testosterone regulates fat deposition through circRNAs remains unclear. In this study, circRNA-seq of backfat and abdominal fat from castrated and intact full-sib Yorkshire pigs was performed. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the host genes of the dorsal DE circRNAs were mainly involved in fatty acid transport, while in abdominal tissues, these genes were mainly involved in adipogenesis and inflammation. The interaction among sus_circPAPPA2, ssc-miR-2366 and GK was verified by dual fluorescence experiments and in porcine preadipocytes. The overexpression of sus_circPAPPA2 significantly inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes. The expression of sus circPAPPA2 was increased after adding 100 nM of testosterone, and preadipocyte differentiation was significantly inhibited. Testosterone can affect preadipocyte differentiation by upregulating the expression of sus_circPAPPA2, sponging miR-2366 and regulating the expression of genes, such as GK. These results indicate that testosterone can regulate the expression of adipocyte differentiation- and lipid metabolism-related genes by regulating the expression of circRNA, and ceRNA networks are different in the testosterone regulation of adipose deposition in different parts. This study provides basic data enhancing the understanding of the interaction between the hormone environment and mir-2366/GK to regulate trait performance in pigs.

AB  - Inaccessibility of veterinary and livestock extension services, and shortages of labour and forage could potentially impact the welfare of yaks (Bos grunniens) in Bhutan. The objective of this study was to assess practices relating to the welfare and management of free-ranging yaks in Bhutan and explore variations between different yak-farming regions. We interviewed herders and observed the behaviour and health status of their animals, using an adaptation of the Welfare Quality (R) protocol, in three yak-farming regions (east, central and west) of Bhutan between October 2018 and January 2019. In total, for 567 cows and 549 calves, integumentary condition, body cleanliness, ocular and nasal discharge, diarrhoea, signs of damage, and gait were scored. In addition, we assessed 324 cows and 272 calves for avoidance distance and examined 324 cows for subclinical mastitis. The behaviour of the herds was observed in six consecutive 20-min blocks with each block divided into two stages. The first stage (5 min) consisted of counting the number of animals eating, lying down, standing idle and walking. The second stage (15 min) consisted of counting the number of events of agonistic, allogrooming, flehming, self-licking, rubbing/scratching and playing behaviour. Avoidance distance differed between regions for calves, but not for lactating cows. Integumentary lesions, dirty body areas, nasal discharge, ocular discharge, signs of diarrhoea, subclinical mastitis and lameness were virtually absent. A few instances of agonistic behaviour (6% of all counted behavioural events) and flehming behaviour (5% of all counted behavioural events) were observed. Yaks in the central and western regions exhibited more scratching and rubbing behaviour than those in the eastern region. Herders perform a variety of painful management practices (castration, ear tagging, nasal septum piercing) without analgesia, which is a prominent welfare issue. Furthermore, mortality among yaks is relatively high and water sources often dirty, creating a health risk. Nevertheless, the welfare status of yaks living in various regions of Bhutan was assessed as good at the time of visit.

AB  - This study investigated the dietary effect of incorporating different levels of olive cake (OC) on the metabolic responses, growth performance, and carcass characteristics of black goat male kids. Thirty kids (body weight = 17.3 +/- 0.40 kg) were randomly distributed into one of three equally sized dietary groups: a control diet (CON), OC at 75 g/kg (OC75), and OC at 150 g/kg (OC150) of dietary dry matter (DM). The results revealed that the intake of DM, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) was similar (p >= 0.11) among the three treatment groups. However, the OC150 group had the greatest (p < 0.0001) ether extract (EE) intake compared to the OC75 and CON groups. The growth measurements were similar (p >= 0.13) among the three groups. Feed efficiency was not affected by the inclusion of OC. In contrast to the CON diet, the cost of gain was, however, reduced (p = 0.004) in the OC diets. All three treatment groups' digestibility of DM, CP, and ADF was similar. However, when compared to the OC75 and CON groups, the digestibility of NDF was better (p < 0.05) in the OC150 group. The N intake did not differ among the three experimental groups. Nitrogen retained as g/d was higher (p = 0.04) in the OC150 and OC75 groups compared to the CON group, while retention as a percentage (g/100 g) was similar among the three groups. Except for intermuscular fat, total fat, leg fat depth, and tissue depth, the inclusion of OC did not result in any discernible treatment effects on the carcass and meat quality parameters. Only alanine aminotransferase enzyme activity was lower (p < 0.0001) in OC-treated groups compared to the CON group. In summary, incorporating OC at 75 g/kg and 150 g/kg levels into the diets of black goat kids had positive comparable effects on some parameters related to growth performance, carcass attributes, and meat quality. Importantly, utilizing olive cake led to cost savings in production and may serve as a viable alternative feed source in goat nutrition.

AB  - The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) plays an important role in mediating the transcytosis of poly-meric immunoglobulins (pIgs) to protect organisms against pathogen invasion. Here, a polyclonal antibody against grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) recombinant pIgR was developed by immunizing New Zealand white rabbit, and the responses of pIgR, IgM and IgZ were analyzed after bath immunization and intraperitoneal administration with Flavobacterium columnare. The results showed that pIgR transcription level was similar to IgM and IgZ, but pIgR rose much faster and peaked earlier than IgM and IgZ; the pIgR mRNA levels were higher in the skin and spleen for both immunized groups, while IgM and IgZ mRNA expression were higher in skin, gills, and intestines in bath immersion group, or spleen and head kidney in intraperitoneal immunization group. ELISA revealed that the IgM, IgZ and pIgR protein levels were up-regulated in skin mucus, gill mucus, gut mucus and bile, reaching a higher peak level earlier in skin mucus and gill mucus in bath immersion group, but a higher peak level in bile in injection group. Moreover, secretory component molecules were detected in grass carp's skin, gill and intestine mucus and bile, but not in serum, which molecular mass was near the theoretical mass obtained from the sequence of grass carp pIgR. These results demonstrated that bath and intraperitoneal im-munization up-regulated pIgR and secretory Ig expression in secretions, which provided more insights into the role of pIgR in immunity and offer insight into ways of protecting teleost against pathogen invasion.

AB  - Comparatively little is known about paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) accumulation by marine grazers, yet recurrent blooms of Alexandrium catenella have caused repeated closures of wild fisheries and require ongoing monitoring. To determine if the commercially harvested periwinkle Lunella undulata is at risk of PST uptake, a laboratory experiment was conducted exposing the herbivorous/detritovorous marine snails to either live or senescent Alexandrium catenella microalgae. After 21 days of exposure, the highest PST concentrations were observed in the viscera of animals in the senescent and live algal treatments (0.55+0.08 and 0.82+0.12 mg STX.2HCl eq./kg, respectively). No quantifiable PST was observed in the foot of animals from either exposure treatment. The PST profile in the viscera closely matched that of the microalgal source, suggesting PST uptake through direct grazing of L. undulata on vegetative A. catenella cells. Grazing activity remained unchanged throughout the exposure period across all treatments. However, periwinkles exposed to A. catenella were significantly slower to retract their foot in response to touch than those animals in the control treatment (first observed on days 7 and 11 in the dead and live algae treatments, respectively). This effect became more pronounced over time and coincided with higher PST concentrations. While righting speed did not differ between animals exposed to live microalgae and the control, those exposed to senescent algae were generally slower to right (observed from day 4 onwards). The implications of these findings for biotoxin management in periwinkles and related marine grazers are discussed.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is well known to be the primary causal agent of clinical or subclinical mastitis in dairy sheep. The production of virulence factors allows S. aureus strains to cause mastitis. In the present study, 96 strains isolated from dairy sheep farms used for the production of autologous vaccines were tested for enterotoxin and hemolysin genes by PCR. In addition, 14 strains isolated from half udders of ewes with subclinical mastitis belonging to a single farm were also tested for the same genes. The phylogenetic trees were constructed, and spatial analysis was performed. Overall, 20 gene patterns were identified, but 43.64% of the tested strains showed the same profile (sec+, sel+, hla+, hld+, hlgAC+). Considering only the enterotoxin genes, four profiles were identified while the evaluation of the hemolysin genes revealed the presence of 12 gene patterns. In the farm with subclinical mastitis, six gene profiles were found. Spatial analysis of the isolated strains and their virulence genes did not show a specific pattern. The present study highlights the importance of identifying and analyzing virulence genes of S. aureus strains involved in dairy sheep mastitis, and the presence of different strains in the same farm.

AB  - Water limitations will pose significant challenges to forest ecosystems across Europe. To gain a deeper understanding of the potential impacts, we investigated the response of the common shrub Crataegus monogyna to two summer droughts, each followed by rewatering. The experimental design consisted of a common garden with potted saplings from a local Belgian (n = 48), a Swedish (n = 47), and a Spanish-Pyrenean provenance (n = 48). We quantified the effects on growth and leaf phenology, focusing on the legacies in the year following the droughts. Responses were influenced by the severity of the drought and by its timing. Most strikingly, height increment was enhanced by 24% (p = 0.046) in comparison to the controls in the year following the droughts in the group of plants that endured the two drought treatments, each time without developing visible stress symptoms. Only one such mild drought, whether early or late summer, did not lead to this response, suggesting stress memory acting as a growth promoter. A late summer drought that resulted in visible drought symptoms led to a reduced diameter increment in the year following the droughts, independent of the preceding treatment (severe, mild, or no drought), whereas this was not the case for a similar drought in early summer. Minor leaf phenological responses were detected in the year following the droughts. Finally, the non-local provenances did not respond in a deviating way to the droughts compared to the local provenance. Our findings contribute to the prediction of carbon sequestration in forests and other woody vegetations in the temperate regions of Europe.

AB  - Simple Summary Photobioreactor systems based on consortia of microalgae and bacteria are a promising, efficient and sustainable alternative for treatment of wastewaters with high nitrogen content, such as piggery wastewater. In these biological systems, microorganisms play a key role in wastewater treatment by degradation of organic matter and accumulation of nutrients into the generated biomass. However, these wastewaters often contain high concentrations of zinc, copper and arsenic, which can severely affect the activity and growth of microorganisms, and so, the wastewater treatment performance. This article studies the effect of high concentrations of zinc, copper and arsenic on microbial communities, specifically microalgae and bacteria, in photobioreactors treating piggery wastewater, with the aim of elucidating their impact on wastewater treatment performance. For this purpose, the growth of microalgae and the composition and structure of bacterial communities exposed to these pollutants were studied. The performance of the reactors was also evaluated by determining the removal of nutrients, zinc, copper and arsenic. The results showed that high concentrations of zinc, copper and arsenic in piggery wastewater significantly affect the microbiome of the reactors without recovery after exposure to these contaminants, resulting in poorer performance of the reactors and compromising the environmental and health impact of treated effluents. The treatment of pig manure is a major environmental issue, and photobioreactors containing consortia of microalgae and bacteria have proven to be a promising and sustainable treatment alternative. This work studies the effect of Cu, Zn and As, three toxic elements frequently present in piggery wastewater, on the performance and microbiome of photobioreactors. After dopage with Zn (100 mg/L), Cu (100 mg/L), and As (500 mu g/L), the high biomass uptake of Zn (69-81%) and Cu (81-83%) decreased the carbon removal in the photobioreactors, inhibited the growth of Chlorella sp., and affected heterotrophic bacterial populations. The biomass As uptake result was low (19%) and actually promoted microalgae growth. The presence of Cu and As decreased nitrogen removal, reducing the abundance of denitrifying bacterial populations. The results showed that metal(loid)s significantly affected 24 bacterial genera and that they did not recover after exposure. Therefore, this study makes an important contribution on the impact of the presence of metal(loid)s in piggery wastewater that compromises the overall performance of PBRs, and so, the environmental and health impact of treated effluents.

AB  - The undertaking of distant hybridization holds paramount significance for the innovation of tea germplasm resources and the cultivation of superior, specialized tea varieties. However, challenges manifest during the process of tea plant distant hybridization breeding, with reproductive barriers impeding the successful acquisition of hybrid progeny; the precise stages at which these barriers occur remain unclear. In this study, utilizing Camellia sinensis cv. Jinxuan as the maternal parent, as well as C. gymnogyna Chang and C. sinensis cv. Yinghong No.9 as the paternal parents, interspecific distant hybridization (DH) and intraspecific hybridization (IH) were conducted. The investigation involved the observation of pollen germination and pollen tube behavior on the stigma, the scrutiny of the developmental dynamics of the ovary post-hybridization, and the examination of the stages and reasons for reproductive disorders during tea tree distant hybridization. The findings indicate that both IH and DH exhibit pre-fertilization barriers. The pre-embryonic development of hybrids obtained from DH is normal, but there is a significant fruit drop during the stage of fruit development. The germination rate of mature seeds obtained from DH is low, and there are pronounced post-fertilization disorders, which are the primary reasons for the difficulty in achieving successful tea plant distant hybridization. An analysis of the genetic variation in phenotypes and chemical components in the progeny after distant hybridization revealed widespread variation and rich genetic diversity. The identification of progeny with a high amino acid and caffeine content holds promise for future production and breeding, providing valuable theoretical references for the selection of parents in the creation of low-caffeine-content tea germplasm resources.

AB  - Electrocauterization causes foul smells and surgical smoke that affect operating room (OR) air quality. This study analyzed the concentration distribution of 87 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in surgical smoke generated during head and neck surgeries and evaluated their size and concentration using pig skin and pork tissues. Surgical smoke from 22 head and neck surgeries were collected; VOC concentrations were analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In vitro experiments utilized an electrosurgical model to burn pig skin and pork tissues; thereafter, the particle size and concentration of surgical smoke in different sampling areas were analyzed. High methanol and carcinogen levels were observed in the surgical smoke generated by head and neck surgeries. The concentrations of 87 identified VOCs in surgical smoke were affected by human tissues and electrosurgical units. Moreover, the median concentrations of particulate matter from the electrical burning of pig skin measured in the breathing area of simulated surgical personnel were significantly higher than those in pork tissue. High VOC levels in surgical smoke from head and neck surgeries were affected by human tissues and electrosurgical units. Ultrafine aerosols primarily existed in surgical smoke from the smoke generation area. Human oral mucosa tissues treated with carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers produced higher VOC concentrations than craniofacial adipose tissues that were treated using conventional electrosurgical knives. Medical staff in ORs should be informed of the hazards of exposure to VOCs and ultrafine aerosols in surgical smoke.

AB  - Groundwater recharge reduces due to high transpiration from shallow-rooted to deep-rooted afforestation. However, reaching a steady state in recharge process is challenging and no methods are available for assessing potential ground-water recharge under unsteady state. Hence, this study developed a new method to quantify groundwater recharge in the unsteady state by (1) calculating the water age (A2) at maximum root depth (D2) for deep-rooted afforestation using the chloride accumulative age method; (2) determining the soil depth (D1) corresponding to A2 under shallow-rooted vegetation using the multi-year average pore water velocity multiplied by A2; (3) calculating the reduc-tion in groundwater recharge (Delta R) from shallow-to deep-rooted afforestation as the depth difference multiplied by the average water content between D1 and D2, divided by stand age. The average groundwater recharge for deep-rooted afforestation is equal to the average annual groundwater recharge under shallow-rooted vegetation minus Delta R. Soil cores with >25 m soil profiles below four land-use types of Hippophae rhamnoides Linn. (H. rhamnoides), Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco (P. orientalis), Robinia pseudoacacia L. (R. pseudoacacia), and grassland were collected to measure soil water content, root distribution, and chloride and tritium contents. The results revealed that: (1) maximum root depths were 11.0 +/- 0.5, 20.2 +/- 1.2, and 22.6 +/- 0.8 m, with soil water deficits of 373.48, 823.65, and 1847.92 mm under H. rhamnoides, P. orientalis, and R. pseudoacacia, respectively; (2) groundwater recharge following land-use change has not reached a steady state; (3) an average annual groundwater recharge was 89.12 mm yr-1

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are a main host for the adult life stages of tick species of medical and veterinary importance. Since white-tailed deer play a vital role in tick ecology, research has been conducted to understand this tick-host relationship. To date, research involving captive white-tailed deer and artificial infestation of these animals with ticks has focused on host suitability, the role of white-tailed deer in tick-borne diseases, and anti-tick vaccine research. The methodology reported for these studies was at times not descriptive and inconsistent regarding how and what region of the white-tailed deer was infested with ticks. Here, we propose a standardized method to artificially infest captive white-tailed deer with ticks for research purposes. The protocol describes a method proven effective to experimentally infest captive white-tailed deer with blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) to study tick-host interactions. The methods can be reliably transferred for experimental infestation of white-tailed deer by other multi-host and one-host tick species.

Since then, the article has suggested some solutions to improve people's participation in agricultural value chain development of wild pigs and wild pork. Thom, BT., & Huy, D.T.N (2021) stated Feeding wild pigs and managing wild pork meat quality is meaningful in Vietnam, esp. In Thai Nguyen province as pork products can offer variety of tastes due to food processing and suitable for Vietnamese tastes and can export to the world widely. Feeding wild board in different environment also affect quality of wild pork meat, for example in US, Brazil or In Vietnam It is in the study we will make comparison to wild pork meat in China and Thailand and suggest to enhance vale chain linkage of wild pork and wild pigs to enhance exporting markets. Last but not least, better value chain linkage can be enhanced through reducing transaction costs from wild pig farming to factories and producing wild pork meat following European standards or GlobalGAP or VIETGAP.

AB  - This study explores the application of small, commercially available drones to determine morphometric the measurements and record key demographic parameters of reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) in Raja Ampat, Indonesia. DJI Mavic 2 Pro drones were used to obtain videos of surface-feeding M. alfredi with a floating, known-length PVC pipe as a reference scale-thus avoiding the need to utilize altitude readings, which are known to be unreliable in small drones, in our photogrammetry approach. Three dimensions (disc length (DL), disc width (DW), and cranial width (CW)) from 86 different individuals were measured. A hierarchical multivariate model was used to estimate the true measurements of these three dimensions and their population-level multivariate distributions. The estimated true measurements of these dimensions were highly accurate and precise, with the measurement of CW more accurate than that of DL and, especially, of DW. Each pairing of these dimensions exhibited strong linear relationships, with estimated correlation coefficients ranging from 0.98-0.99. Given these, our model allows us to accurately calculate DW (as the standard measure of body size for mobulid rays) using the more accurate CW and DL measurements. We estimate that the smallest mature M. alfredi of each sex we measured were 274.8 cm (males, n = 30) and 323.5 cm DW (females, n = 8). We conclude that small drones are useful for providing an accurate "snapshot" of the size distribution of surface-feeding M. alfredi aggregations and for determining the sex and maturity of larger individuals, all with minimal impact on this vulnerable species.

AB  - This meta-study uses phylogenetic scaling models across more than 30 species, spanning five orders of magnitude in body mass, to show that cardiac capillary numerical density and mitochondrial volume density decrease with body mass raised to the -0.07 +/- 0.03 and -0.04 +/- 0.01 exponents, respectively. Thus, while an average 10 g mammal has a cardiac capillary density of approximately 4150 mm(-2) and a mitochondrial density of 33%, a 1 t mammal has considerably lower corresponding values of 1850 mm(-2) and 21%. These similar scaling trajectories suggest quantitative matching for the primary oxygen supply and oxygen consuming structures of the heart, supporting economic design at the cellular level of the oxygen cascade in this aerobic organ. These scaling trajectories are nonetheless somewhat shallower than the exponent of -0.11 calculated for the maximum external mechanical power of the cardiac tissue, under conditions of heavy exercise, when oxygen flow between capillaries and mitochondria is probably fully exploited. This mismatch, if substantiated, implies a declining external mechanical efficiency of the heart with increasing body mass, whereby larger individuals put more energy in but get less energy out, a scenario with implications for cardiovascular design, aerobic capacity and limits of body size.

AB  - Governments around the world invest considerable resources to reduce damages caused by large carnivores on human property. To use these investments more efficiently and effectively, we need to understand which interventions successfully prevent such damages and which do not. In the European Union, the LIFE program represents by far the largest financial instrument to help EU Member States with the implementation of conservation activities, including mitigation of damages caused by large carnivores. However, we currently lack information about the effectiveness of this funding program in reducing carnivore damages. We reviewed 135 LIFE projects dealing with large carnivores between 1992 and 2019 to provide an overview of the use of damage prevention methods and evaluate their functional and perceived effectiveness. Methods evaluated ranged from non-lethal and lethal interventions, to information dissemination and compensation schemes. The largest number of the projects was focused on grey wolf (Canis lupus) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) in the Mediterranean countries and in Romania. Electric fences were reported as the most successful method for reducing damages by large carnivores, and most of the non-lethal methods used showed at least moderate effectiveness. However, standards of measuring and reporting effectiveness were in general relatively low, which limits our ability to measure actual impact.

AB  - During the Miocene (ca. 23.0-5.3 Ma), North America's Great Plains were a broad mosaic of savanna-woodlands inhabited by a diverse ungulate fauna. We investigated resource partitioning among ungulates at Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park (henceforth "Ashfall") in north-central Nebraska to establish how taxa shared the landscape. This mid-Miocene (11.86 +/- 0.13 Ma) site preserves a watering-hole filled with volcanic ash that entombed hundreds of skeletons of medium- and large-bodied ungulates. We analyzed carbon (513C), oxygen (518O), and strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopes in enamel from seven species: the rhinoceros Teleoceras major (n = 13); three horses (Cormohipparion occidentale, Pliohippus pernix, and Pseudhipparion gratum; n = 3 each); two camels (Procamelus grandis and Protolabis heterodontus; n = 1 each); and one small ruminant artiodactyl (Longirostromeryx wellsi; n = 3). Carbon isotope data indicate that all seven ungulates foraged in open habitats dominated by C3 plants (enamel 513CVPDB range from -9.6%o to - 6.9%o) with little to no evidence of C4 plant consumption. The overall range in 518OVPDB values is ca. 6%o (-7.6%o to - 1.3%o), while the range for 87Sr/86Sr is narrow (0.70864-0.70898). Horses have significantly higher 518O and 87Sr/86Sr than T. major, which we suggest indicates horses foraged in relatively dry habitats, while T. major inhabited wet habitats with different strontium sources. Both camels isotopically resemble horses, and Longirostromeryx wellsi has intermediate 87Sr/86Sr and wide-ranging 518O values. Plotting Teleoceras and co-occurring ungulates in a model that tests for semi-aquatic behavior using 518O suggests that T. major from Ashfall was semi-aquatic; ecology and behavior may have varied among Teleoceras species living in different places at different times. This study exemplifies how 87Sr/86Sr data complement 513C and 518O analyses when reconstructing ancient environments; they can provide nuanced ecological information even in landscapes with homogeneous bedrock.

AB  - Ejaculates present their own microbiota, and a link between ejaculates' microbiota and sperm quality and fertility exists. With the development of artificial insemination in animal breeding, ejaculates must be manipulated by diluting them with extenders and storing them at temperatures below body temperature. The effects that these processes have on the original semen microbiota have never been studied. This study explores the effects of the protocol for preparing refrigerated goat buck semen doses and storing on seminal microbiota. Semen from six adult goat bucks of the Murciano-Granadina breed (24 ejaculates) was used, cooled to 4 & DEG;C in a skimmed milk-based extender, and stored at this temperature for 24 h. Samples were taken in different steps: in the raw ejaculates (ejaculates), after dilution with the refrigeration extender (diluted), immediately after reaching 4 & DEG;C (chilled 0 h) and the samples refrigerated at 4 & DEG;C and stored at this temperature for 24 h (chilled 24 h). Sperm quality (motility and integrity of plasma and acrosomal membrane, and mitochondrial functionality) was also evaluated. Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing was used to study the seminal microbiota. Our results indicated that both refrigeration and storage at 4 & DEG;C negatively affected sperm quality parameters. Preparing semen doses and their subsequent conservation caused a significant change in the bacterial community structure. Raw ejaculates showed a lower Pielou's evenness index than the other samples (diluted, chilled 0 h and chilled 24 h). Ejaculates also had a lower Shannon's diversity index (3.44) than the diluted semen (4.17) and the semen chilled for 24 h (4.43). Regarding beta diversity, significant differences were detected between ejaculates and the other treatments. Differences were also found in unweighted UniFrac distances between the semen chilled for 0 h and that chilled for 24 h. At the genus level, marked effects of preparing doses and their subsequent conservation were also evident: 199 genera that were absent in ejaculates were found in the semen chilled and stored for 24 h; 177 genera that were present in ejaculates disappeared after 24-h refrigeration. In conclusion, the extender and protocol for preparing refrigerated goat buck semen doses considerably modify microbial ejaculate composition.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of manure-based fertilisers (MBFs) is considered an important practice for achieving agricultural sustainability. However, the potential losses of nutrients to the environment need to be thoroughly evaluated. This study aimed to assess nutrients' potential leachability from a sandy soil, fertilised with MBFs produced by mixing manure from one single animal species with N- or P-mineral fertilisers, to achieve target N:P ratios (1:1, 2:1 and 0.5:1). MBFs were prepared by combining pig slurry, cattle slurry or poultry manure with N- and P-mineral fertilisers, or slurry-derived materials, obtained by solid-liquid separation. A leaching experiment was set-up in soil columns treated with MBFs, for 59 days, with seven leaching events. Poultry manure application to soil led to higher potential N leaching, while pig slurry induced higher P leaching. All 2:1 MBFs decreased P leaching, relative to the original manure, with the higher reduction (52%) being observed for pig slurry with urea. The addition of urea to poultry manure also diminished its potential for N leaching. The behaviour of P-enriched materials, pig slurry solid fraction and both 0.5:1 MBFs obtained with phosphoric acid addition showed a higher risk of P leaching, while the use of superphosphate as a P-mineral source decreased the risk of P leaching. Concluding, it is possible to use specific MBFs, enriched with N and P from mineral sources, and have lower N and P leaching potential, reducing the risks associated with manure soil application, while increasing their interest as alternative fertilisers.

AB  - During pregnancy and lactation, maternal nutrition is linked to the full development of offspring and may have long-term or lifelong effects. However, the influence of the doe's diet on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of young kids remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the effects of doe roughage sources (alfalfa hay, AH, or corn straw, CS) during pregnancy and lactation on kid growth, GI morphology, barrier function, metabolism, immunity, and microbiome composition. The results indicate that, compared with the CS group, does fed an AH diet had significantly higher feed intake (p < 0.01). However, CS-fed does exhibited higher neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in animal (doe or kid) weight among the groups (p > 0.05). In the rumen of goat kids, the AH group exhibited a higher papillae width and increased levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) compared with the CS group (p < 0.05). In the jejunum of goat kids, the AH group showed a higher villus-height-to-crypt-depth (VH/CD) ratio, as well as elevated levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), IL-10, acetate, and total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs), when compared with the CS group (p < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis revealed that the source of roughage in does was associated with changes in the GI transcriptome of the kids. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the rumen were mainly associated with tissue development and immune regulation, while the DEGs in the jejunum were mainly associated with the regulation of transferase activity. Spearman correlation analyses indicated significant associations between GI DEGs and phenotypic indicators related to GI development, immunity, and metabolism. LEfSe analysis identified 14 rumen microbial biomarkers and 6 jejunum microbial biomarkers. Notably, these microorganisms were also enriched in the rumen or day 28 milk of the does. Further microbial composition analysis revealed significant correlations between the rumen and milk microbiomes of does and the rumen or jejunum microbiomes of kids. Association analyses indicated that microbial biomarkers interact with host genes, thereby affecting the development and function of the GI system. Additionally, correlation analyses revealed significant association between milk metabolites and the rumen and jejunum microbiomes of kids. This study demonstrated that maternal diet significantly influences the development of microbial ecosystems in offspring by modulating microbial communities and metabolite composition. The early colonization of GI microorganisms is crucial for the structural development, barrier function, immune capacity, and microbial metabolic activity of the GI system.

AB  - Solving geospatial tasks generally requires multiple geospatial tools and steps, i.e., tool-use chains. Automating the geospatial task solving process can effectively enhance the efficiency of GIS users. Traditionally, researchers tend to design rule-based systems to autonomously solve similar geospatial tasks, which is inflexible and difficult to adapt to different tasks. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), some research suggests that LLMs have the potential for intelligent task solving with their tool-use ability, which means LLMs can invoke externally provided tools for specific tasks. However, most studies rely on closed-source commercial LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4, whose limited API accessibility restricts their deployment on local private devices. Some researchers in the general domain proposed using instruction tuning to improve the tool-use ability of open-source LLMs. However, the requirement of tool-use chains to solve geospatial tasks, including multiple data input and output processes, poses challenges for collecting effective instruction tuning data. To solve these challenges, we propose a framework for training a Geospatial large language model to generate Tool-use Chains autonomously (GTChain). Specifically, we design a seed task-guided self-instruct strategy to generate a geospatial tool-use instruction tuning dataset within a simulated environment, encompassing diverse geospatial task production and corresponding tool-use chain generation. Subsequently, an open-source general- domain LLM, LLaMA-2-7B, is fine-tuned on the collected instruction data to understand geospatial tasks and learn how to generate geospatial tool-use chains. Finally, we also collect an evaluation dataset to serve as a benchmark for assessing the geospatial tool-use ability of LLMs. Experimental results on the evaluation dataset demonstrate that the fine-tuned GTChain can effectively solve geospatial tasks using the provided tools, achieving 32.5% and 27.5% higher accuracy in the percentage of correctly solved tasks compared to GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro, respectively.

AB  - When the fitness costs and benefits of sons and daughters differ, offspring sex ratio manipulation could be an important reproductive tactic. We explored the effects of environment and maternal caring ability on offspring sex to test four adaptive sex ratio modification hypotheses: the extrinsic modification hypothesis (EMH), carrying capacity hypothesis (CCH), Trivers-Willard hypothesis (TWH), and cost-of-reproduction hypothesis (CRH). The EMH and CCH propose that environmental conditions shape offspring sex ratios, directly or in interaction with maternal condition. The TWH and CRH predict a positive relationship between maternal condition and production of the costlier sex. The TWH predicts that mothers with superior caring ability should produce more of the sex that can provide the greatest fitness returns from additional maternal allocation, and the CRH proposes that females with limited caring ability should reduce fitness costs by producing the cheaper sex. Repeated measures on 83 known-age eastern gray kangaroos, polygynous marsupials with strong sexual dimorphism, revealed that offspring sex ratio was independent of per capita forage, supporting neither the EMH nor CCH, but was dependent on maternal mass, consistent with the TWH and CCH. Our results, however, cannot clearly identify the ultimate cause of the relationship between maternal mass and greater production of sons. One of the three assumptions of the TWH could not be verified, and mothers of sons suffered only marginal additional fitness costs. Sex ratios in higher vertebrates are likely not solely explained by factors dependent on maternal control.

However, during the storage of PS, the NH3 emissions cause a large loss of nitrogen (N), which reduces the fertilizer value of stored PS and cause environmental pollution. To reduce N loss during PS storage, we added different amounts of wheat straw powder (WSP) and wheat straw segments (WSSs) to the PS. The wheat straw cover was used for biochar production, and then, the biochar was used for N adsorption from the PS. The results showed that the N loss of PS was significantly decreased by use of the wheat straw covering. The N losses in treatments of WSP covering and WSSs covering were reduced by 4.8-53.1 and 0.8-14.2 percentage points compared with that in the control, respectively. Ammonia adsorption is an important reason for the reduction in N loss by straw covering during PS storage. After covering for 180 days in storage, the NH4+-N content in both the WSP covering and WSSs covering increased greatly, and the cover was reused for biochar production. The biochar yield was inversely proportional to the pyrolysis temperature, and the specific surface area and pore volume of the biochar were proportional to the pyrolysis temperature. We achieved the highest amount of NH4+-N adsorption (1.9 mg/g) with a biochar dosage of 0.2 g/L (treatment Y-400). This study provides a new straw-covered PS storage method to achieve straw recycling and low N loss during PS storage.

AB  - Simple Summary Probiotics can be used in pigs fattening as a partial or full alternative to antibiotic growth promoters. Their composition and the dosage used in the feed must not impair the nutritional value of the meat raw materials obtained from them. The use of the probiotic preparation Bokashi (containing specific strains of Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast) as a feed additive in fattening pigs resulted in significant changes in meat and backfat fatty acid profiles and the lipid indexes calculated from them. The changes in the fatty acid profile of backfat appeared to be more beneficial to consumer health due to the increased proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). From a technological point of view, there is a more favorable Saturation Index (SI) value in backfat.Abstract The study aimed to assess the effect of supplementation of pig diet with the Bokashi probiotic on the fatty acid profile of longissimus lumborum (LL) muscles and backfat. The research involved 120 hybrid pigs deriving from Naima sows and P-76 boars. The experimental group's pigs received probiotics in their feed (containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus plantarum). To analyze the fatty acid profile in intramuscular fat (IMF) of LL and backfat, 24 pig carcasses from the control group and 26 from the probiotic-supplemented group were randomly selected. Probiotic supplementation increased the Atherogenic Index, reduced the proportion of C20:4, and increased C12:0 and C18:2 n-6 in IMF LL, without affecting sigma SFA, sigma MUFA, and sigma PUFA. In backfat, probiotic supplementation decreased C18:1 and C18:2 n-6 proportion and increased C18:3 n-3, C20:3 n-6, and C20:4 n-6. These changes resulted in significantly higher sigma MUFA, sigma PUFA, PUFA sigma n-3/sigma n-6, and lower Saturation Index (SI). From a consumer health and technological point of view, probiotic supplementation improved the lipid profile of backfat to a greater extent than LL muscle. Bokashi, at a dose of 3 g/kg of feed in the last stage of pig production, had no significant effect on the fatty acid profile of the meat.

AB  - Major disturbances can temporarily remove factors that otherwise constrain population abundance and distribution. During such windows of relaxed top-down and/or bottom-up control, ungulate populations can grow rapidly, eventually leading to resource depletion and density-dependent expansion into less-preferred habitats. Although many studies have explored the demographic outcomes and ecological impacts of these processes, fewer have examined the individual-level mechanisms by which they occur. We investigated these mechanisms in Gorongosa National Park, where the Mozambican Civil War devastated large-mammal populations between 1977 and 1992. Gorongosa's recovery has been marked by proliferation of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), an historically marginal 200-kg antelope species, which is now roughly 20-fold more abundant than before the war. We show that after years of unrestricted population growth, waterbuck have depleted food availability in their historically preferred floodplain habitat and have increasingly expanded into historically avoided savanna habitat. This expansion was demographically skewed: mixed-sex groups of prime-age individuals remained more common in the floodplain, while bachelors, loners, and subadults populated the savanna. By coupling DNA metabarcoding and forage analysis, we show that waterbuck in these two habitats ate radically different diets, which were more digestible and protein-rich in the floodplain than in savanna; thus, although individuals in both habitats achieved positive net energy balance, energetic performance was higher in the floodplain. Analysis of daily activity patterns from high-resolution GPS-telemetry, accelerometry, and animal-borne video revealed that savanna waterbuck spent less time eating, perhaps to accommodate their tougher, lower-quality diets. Waterbuck in savanna also had more ectoparasites than those in the floodplain. Thus, plasticity in foraging behavior and diet selection enabled savanna waterbuck to tolerate the costs of density-dependent spillover, at least in the short term; however, the already poorer energetic performance of these individuals implies that savanna occupancy may become prohibitively costly as heterospecific competitors and predators continue to recover in Gorongosa. Our results suggest that behavior can provide a leading indicator of the onset of density-dependent limitation and the likelihood of subsequent population decline, but that reliable inference hinges on understanding the mechanistic basis of observed behavioral shifts.

AB  - Melatonin affects sperm physiology, possibly through membrane receptors. Effects were tested at low concentrations (1 pM, 100 pM, 10 nM and 1 mu M) in red deer epididymal spermatozoa as a model for high-seasonality species. Samples were incubated with melatonin as uncapacitated or capacitating conditions (heparin) and evaluated for motility and physiology (flow cytometry). Most effects occurred at low concentrations (nM-pM), mainly protecting from apoptosis and maintaining acrosomal integrity, suggesting a role for membrane receptors rather than a direct antioxidant effect. Intracellular calcium was not affected, differing from other studies and perhaps because of the epididymal origin. This study supports the relevance of melatonin on sperm physiology and could contribute to the application of reproductive technologies in wild ruminants.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed factors involved in pig manure fertilization systems for arable lands (30,000 ha) and five Polish pig farms, that produced approximately 240,000 t/year pig manure. Fertilizing component demands for N, P, K and Mg on Agrifarm Company farms and liquid manure doses were estimated, based on determination in soils N, P, K. Crops yields obtained were also presented. Finally, pig manure transfer and injection costs were assessed in terms of transport distances and soil demands for nutrients. Calculated manure doses were on average 46 m(3)/ha. Natural fertilizers covered on average 70% of the N demand, 77% of the P demand, and 102% of the K demand in tested soils. On average, 122,029 t/year of pig manure (51% of manure produced) was utilized for fertilization purposes, but only for cases when the distance between fertilized fields and pig farms was up to 10 km. Practically pig manure is stored six months per year, but having sufficiently large areas of arable fields, it is possible to use the whole amount of pig manure produced in whole year and stored six months, but these areas should be located nearby pig farms. The costs of pig manure transfer and injection into lands were assessed in terms of manure transport distances, and soil demands for nutrients. Results showed that manure fertilization at the transport distance of 29 km pig manure fertilization costs should be most advantageous and most real to implementation in agricultural practice and 52 km was maximum cut-off pig manure transport distance.

AB  - The environmental, health, and animal welfare challenges associated with meat consumption underscore the urgent need to reduce meat intake, particularly in high-income countries. This study investigated the impact of animal-related labels with varying emotional valences (negative, neutral, and positive) on reducing meat selection, focusing on their effects on dissociation, emotional responses, and moral licensing. In an online experiment with the four between-subjects conditions negative, neutral, positive, and no label, participants selected products from a simulated grocery store where labels with animal imagery of chicken, pigs, and cattle were displayed alongside meat products. Negative labels were found to be the most effective in reducing meat consumption as compared to the no label condition, primarily by disrupting state dissociation and eliciting empathy, disgust, and guilt. Compared to the no label condition, neutral labels had limited effects, whereas positive labels led to moral licensing, making meat consumption appear more acceptable. These findings shed light on the psychological processes that shape dietary behavior, highlighting the potential of animal-related labels to reduce dissociation and evoke emotional responses.

Functional food additives, such as herbs and spices, may enhance the immune system of animals and render them more resistant to pathogens. Furthermore, they may also increase animal productivity and positively modify milk properties. Goat milk is considered a healthy food for humans. Raising goats in accordance with strict organic farming principles may even further improve their quality. Therefore, it is crucial to develop and implement animal feeding systems that positively affect their productivity and reduce the need for the use of antibiotics. We hypothesize that adding herbs and spices or selenized yeast may enhance the resistance of the mammary gland to infections with pathogenic microorganisms by increasing the level of defensins in milk. Moreover, we investigate the effect of such functional food additives on the composition of goat milk. The present study examines the effects of diet supplementation with an organic selenium or herb-spice mixture on beta-defensin1 (GBD-1) and beta-defensin2 (GBD-2) concentrations in goat milk. Herd-I, consisting of Polish White (PWI) and Fawn Improved (PFI) goats, received supplementation with organic or inorganic selenium (controls). All goats were free from parasites, mastitis, and small ruminant lentivirus infection. Herd-II, consisting of PWI goats, either received a turmeric-rosemary mixture (experimental) or not (controls). The Herd I control group demonstrated higher fat, free fatty acid, and somatic cell levels and lower protein and lactose contents than Herd II controls. The GBD-1 concentration was below the detection limit in both herds. Herd I controls demonstrated higher GBD-2 concentrations in milk than Herd II controls. In addition, lower GBD-2 concentrations were noted in PWI goat milk. Organic selenium or rosemary-turmeric mixture supplementation had no effect on the GBD-2 content in the milk of healthy goats. The higher GBD-2 concentration observed in Herd Ic than in Herd IIc may suggest that the type of basal diet affects defensin secretion.

AB  - Measuring and comparing activity patterns provide key insights into the behavioral trade-offs that result in animal activity and their extrinsic and intrinsic drivers. Camera traps are a recently emerged source of data for sampling animal activity used to estimate activity patterns. However, nearly 70% of studies using such data to estimate activity patterns apply a time-to-independence data filter to discard appreciable periods of sampling effort. This treatment of activity as a discrete event emerged from the use of camera trap data to estimate animal abundances, but does not reflect the continuous nature of behavior, and may bias resulting estimates of activity patterns. We used a large, freely available camera trap dataset to test the effects of time to independence on the estimated activity of eight medium- to large-sized African mammals. We show that discarding data through the use of time-to-independence filters causes substantial losses in sample sizes and differences in the estimated activity of species. Activity patterns estimated for herbivore species were more affected by the application of time-to-independence data filters than carnivores, this extending to estimates of potential interactions (activity overlap) between herbivore species. We hypothesize that this pattern could reflect the typically more abundant, social, and patch-specific foraging patterns of herbivores and suggest that this effect may bias estimates of predator-prey interactions. Activity estimates of rare species, with less data available, may be particularly vulnerable to loss of data through the application of time-to-independence data filters. We conclude that the application of time-to-independence data filters in camera trap-based estimates of activity patterns is not valid and should not be used.

AB  - Simple Summary PPP3CA is one of the candidate genes for goat reproduction, but no studies have been carried out yet. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the associations between copy number variations in the goat PPP3CA gene and litter size and semen quality in goats, including Shaanbei white cashmere goats (SBWC) (n = 353) and Guizhou Heima (GZHM) goats (n = 64). Based on the association analysis, the results showed that only CNV1 (copy number variation 1) and CNV2 (copy number variation 2) were distinctly related to the first-birth litter size in female goats (p = 7.6802 x 10(-11); p = 5.0895 x 10(-9)), and they were also significantly associated with the semen quality of SBWC goats (p < 0.05). These findings prove that the PPP3CA gene plays an important role in reproduction traits in goats. Copy number variations (CNVs) have many forms of variation structure, and they play an important role in the research of variety diversity, biological evolution and disease correlation. Since CNVs have a greater impact on gene regulation and expression, more studies are being finalized on CNVs in important livestock and poultry species. The protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit alpha (PPP3CA) is a key candidate gene involved in the goat fecundity trait, and has important effects on precocious puberty, estrogen signal transduction pathways and oocyte meiosis. Additionally, PPP3CA also has a dephosphorylation effect in the process of spermatogonial stem cell meiosis and spermatogenesis. So far, there is no research on the relationship between the copy number variations of the PPP3CA gene and reproduction traits. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the association between copy number variations in the goat PPP3CA gene and litter size and semen quality in Shaanbei white cashmere goats (SBWC) (n = 353) and Guizhou Heima goats (n = 64). Based on the association analysis, the results showed that only CNV1 and CNV2 within the PPP3CA gene were distinctly related to the first-birth litter size in female goats (p = 7.6802 x 10(-11); p = 5.0895 x 10(-9), respectively) and they were also significantly associated with the semen quality of SBWC goats (p < 0.05). In addition, individuals with Loss genotypes demonstrated better phenotypic performance compared to those with other types. Therefore, CNV1 and CNV2 of the PPP3CA gene are potentially useful for breeding, as they are linked to important goat reproduction traits.

AB  - Saprophagous macroarthropods are important actors in litter decomposition as they process large amounts of litter and transform it into fecal pellets that differ in chemical and physical properties compared to ingested litter. When having a choice among several litter types, saprophagous macroarthropods exhibit feeding preferences depending on their nutritional requirements and body size. However, how these preferences affect feces properties is not well known. We compared the feeding preferences, production of fecal pellets and their properties for six widespread saprophagous macroarthropods species feeding on a litter mix of four common tree species from Mediterranean forests. The six animal species showed different feeding preferences that were not correlated to litter nutritional quality. Instead, we suggest that the use as microhabitat of the leaves of one litter species with tubular shape by macroarthropods induced its higher consumption despite having the lowest nutritional value. Larger species consumed less litter per unit of body mass and had a more diverse diet composition. Furthermore, feces properties could not be linked to the diet composition, but always had higher nutritional value and water holding capacity compared to the leaf litter. The three woodlice species consistently produced feces with higher tannin concentration, higher specific area, and lower water holding capacity than that of the three millipede species. Our study calls for the consideration of other leaf litter properties than the generally studied physical and chemical ones, as well as quantifying the difference between millipede and woodlice feces properties that may have functional implication for nutrient cycling.

AB  - The Longnan goat (LN) is a local breed discovered during the third census of China's livestock and poultry genetic resources. In order to thoroughly comprehend the population traits, this research examined a total of 70 animals from three different goat populations, namely the LN goat, Nanjiang Brown goat (NJ), and Boer goat (Boer). Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing was employed to analyze genetic diversity, population structure, and selective sweep patterns. Additionally, individual DNA fingerprints were generated to provide detailed genetic profiles for each subject. A total of 643,868 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, with a majority located in intergenic and intronic regions. Genetic diversity analysis uncovered lower diversity within the LN population compared to the other two populations. The analysis of population structure unveiled significant genetic distance between LN and both NJ and Boer populations, with distinct clustering patterns observed. Moreover, genetic differentiation coefficients (F-ST) of 0.1019 and 0.0854 were determined between LN and Boer, as well as LN and NJ, respectively, indicating substantial genetic differentiation. Selective sweep analysis, combining F-ST and pi ratio, identified several genes associated with growth and development, reproduction, hair color, and immunity that may serve as valuable candidates for marker-assisted breeding. Furthermore, identification of 47,541 runs of homozygosity (ROHs) revealed non-uniform distribution across chromosomes, with the highest frequency on chromosome 1 and the lowest on chromosome 27. Correlations between different inbreeding coefficients varied, with the highest observed between F-HOM and F-GRM, and the lowest between F-ROH >1.5Mb and F-ROH <500kb. A total of 46 candidate genes were annotated within high-frequency ROH islands, primarily associated with biological processes such as reproduction, growth and development, and immunity. Finally, a DNA fingerprint, consisting of 371 highly polymorphic SNPs, was generated and presented in the form of a two-dimensional code for convenient access. Based on the population structure analysis, LN goats have been found to have a distant genetic distance and a higher degree of differentiation from both the Boer and NJ populations. Evaluation of genetic diversity parameters and ROH analysis indicates that the LN population exhibits lower genetic diversity and shows signs of inbreeding. Our findings offer theoretical support for the identification of genetic resources within this population.

AB  - When herbivore abundance is controlled by predators there may be an indirect positive effect on primary producers due to reduced grazing pressure, but the potential of predation refuges to modify such trophic cascades has rarely been studied. By experimentally manipulating substrate particle size and fish predation regime, we assessed the outcome of invertebrate grazer-biofilm interactions in streams. Locations at the center of larger substrate particles were predicted to pose a higher predation risk, and therefore be subjected to a lower grazing pressure. In our 52-day experiment in a New Zealand stream, small-sized substrates (terracotta tiles) remained virtually free of periphyton across their entire upper surface, whereas a thick periphyton mat was formed across large tiles with only edges remaining free. In channels containing fish (either native Galaxias vulgaris or exotic Salmo trutta), grazing on tiles was lower than in the absence of fish. A preference for grazing near to the edge of tiles was clearest in fish channels but was also evident even in the absence of fish, probably reflecting fish presence and/or fish kairomones in the stream from where the colonizing invertebrates had been derived. Total grazer density was similar across treatments with or without fish, suggesting that our results can be explained mostly by changes in the behavior of grazers. We suggest that refuge availability, interacting with grazer predator-avoidance behavior, may produce a context-dependent patchwork of trophic cascades in streams and other ecosystems.

AB  - The Agulhas Long-billed Lark Certhilauda brevirostris is restricted to the Agulhas Plain, South Africa, a region extensively transformed for crop production and sheep grazing. We present data on nest and egg characteristics, clutch and brood size, parental care and breeding success previously undescribed for this species. During field surveys in 2020 and 2021, 29 nests were located. Of these, 16 were monitored by camera traps. Laying started in late winter (July) and continued until early summer (late November). Most nests (66%) were in Renosterveld, a unique vegetation component of the Fynbos Biome, with the remainder in human-modified landscapes. Female larks were responsible for nest construction and incubation. Both sexes provisioned nestlings, with provisioning rate related to nestling age and time of day but not brood size. Breeding success was low, with only 14% of nests fledging any young. Only one repeat nesting attempt following a predation event was observed, but the attempt was abandoned. Nest predation was the main cause of nest failure, with eight species of nest predators identified. An apparent preference for nesting in Renosterveld highlights the need for protection of this endangered habitat type. As a ground-nesting species in an agriculturally transformed landscape, this lark faces numerous threats associated with habitat loss, altered predation pressure, exposure to pesticides and disturbance at nest sites.
   Die Brutokologie der Agulhas-Langschnabellerche: ein endemischer Vogel, der auf das verbliebene Renosterveld des Westkaps, Sudafrika, angewiesen ist.Die Aghulhas-Langschnabellerche Certhilauda brevirostris ist auf die Agulhas-Ebene in Sudafrika beschrankt, eine Region, die extensiv fur den Ackerbau und die Schafbeweidung verandert wurde. Wir prasentieren Daten zu Nest- und Eimerkmalen, Gelege- und Brutgrosse, elterlichen Pflege und Bruterfolg, die bisher fur diese Art nicht beschreiben wurden. Bei den Kartierungen im Feld in den Jahren 2020 und 2021 wurden 29 Nester lokalisiert. Davon wurden 16 Nester mit Kamerafallen uberwacht. Das Eierlegen begann im Spatwinter (Juli) und hielt bis in den Fruhsommer (Ende November) an. Die meisten Nester (66%) befanden sich im Renosterveld, ein einzigartiger Vegetationstyp des Fynbos, dessen Restbestand in der vom Menschen veranderten Landschaft liegt. Die Weibchen der Langschnabellerche waren fur den Nestbau und die Bebrutung der Eier zustandig. Beide Geschlechter versorgten die Nestlinge, wobei die Versorgungsrate mit dem Nestlingsalter und der Tageszeit, nicht jedoch mit der Brutgrosse zusammenhing. Der Bruterfolg war gering. Nur 14% der Nester brachten flugge Jungvogel hervor. Nur in einem Fall wurde ein erneuter Brutversuch nach einem Pradationsvorfall beobachtet, der jedoch aufgegeben wurde. Nestpradation war die Hauptursache fur den Brutverlust, wobei acht Arten als Nestpradatoren identifiziert werden konnten. Eine offensichtliche Praferenz fur das Nisten im Renosterveld unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit des Schutzes dieses gefahrdeten Lebensraumtyps. Als bodenbrutende Art in einer agrarwirtschaftlich genutzten Landschaft ist die Aghulhas-Langschnabellerche zahlreichen Bedrohungen ausgesetzt, die mit dem Habitatverlust, dem veranderten Pradationsdruck, der Belastung durch Pestizide und der Storung am Nest einhergehen.

AB  - Sperm cryopreservation often leads to physical cell damage through ice crystal formation. This study evaluates the improvements to freezing extender cryoprotective activity due to antifreeze protein (AFP) addition, which primarily acts on ice crystal formation, through investigating the post-thaw sperm properties of Okinawan native Agu pig. Six individual boar sperm samples were diluted with the freezing extender supplemented with 1 mu g/mL of AFP I or AFP III and then subjected to cryopreservation. Treatment with AFP I during the freezing procedure had no improvement for any characteristics after thawing compared to untreated sperm. In contrast, the addition of AFP III to the freezing extender strongly increased sperm motility, mitochondria and cell membrane integrity, and the acrosomal proteolytic activity of frozen-thawed sperm in 5 of 6 individuals (P < 0.05). Furthermore, cryoinjury prevention by AFP III significantly enhanced sperm viability (by ATP content), and maintained DNA quality and in vitro sperm penetrability compared with AFP I treatment (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that AFP III addition to the freezing extender of boar sperm is more effective in maintaining sperm characteristics than the extender without AFP III or AFP I, despite individual differences in response.

AB  - PurposeAnaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease which is caused by different Anaplasma species. Among Anaplasma species, A. ovis which can infect sheep and goats cause ovine anaplasmosis. In this study, the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. was investigated in 31 different breeds of sheep from different regions of T & uuml;rkiye.MethodAnaplasma spp. was investigated by PCR targeting MSP-4 gene in blood samples of sheep breeds (n = 366) collected from different regions of T & uuml;rkiye. Also, some Anaplasma spp. positive samples were sequenced for species identification and sub-cluster analyses.ResultsThe molecular prevalence of Anaplasma spp. was 43.9% (161/366). In Anatolian Merino (n = 10) and Akkaraman (n = 11) breeds, the molecular prevalence of Anaplasma spp. reached to 100%. Also, the highest molecular prevalence was detected in Black Sea region by 70% (28/40) and the lowest molecular prevalence was detected in Marmara region by 32% (16/50). While the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. was 59.7% in sheep produced in the extensive system, it was found as 39.2% and 9.8% in sheep produced in semi-extensive and intensive systems, respectively. Accordingly, these findings suggest that the production of sheep in the intensive system protects them from tick-borne diseases, which are of great economic importance. According to BLAST results, all sequenced Anaplasma spp. positive samples (n = 29) were identified as A. ovis. Also, mixed infections were detected in 6 positive samples. The phylogenetic tree constructed by 38 sequence data showed the presence of three different sub-clusters for A. ovis (Sub-cluster 1, 2, and 3). Sub-cluster 2 was found as the most prevalent sub-cluster with 42.1% frequency compared to the other sub-clusters.ConclusionThis study showed that sheep grown in different regions of T & uuml;rkiye have a high molecular prevalence value for Anaplasma spp.

AB  - Public opinion about environmental aspects is generating a widespread concern, which contributes to lead consumers to choose sustainable products. Livestock systems are responsible for the emissions of different pollutants and, as a consequence, this is reflected in the environmental sustainability of animal-based products.This study was aimed at evaluating the environmental impacts of buffalo mozzarella cheese with a cradle-to grave life cycle assessment approach from the primary production of milk to the end-of-life of buffalo mozzarella cheese. The functional units were 1 kg of buffalo Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) evaluated at farm gate and 1 kg of consumed buffalo mozzarella cheese evaluated at consumers' home.The study enrolled 9 buffalo dairy farms, 2 dairy plants and 4 markets where 243 customers were surveyed. Processes of raw milk production, mozzarella cheese making, transports, retail and home consumption were considered. The accounted environmental impacts were: climate change (CC), terrestrial acidification (TA), freshwater eutrophication (FE), marine eutrophication (ME), ozone depletion (OD), ecotoxicity (EC), human toxicity (HT), land use (LU) and fossil depletion (FD). Buffalo farming was the primary hotspot accounting for more than 50% throughout all impact categories and having a major role in CC, TA, FE, ME, OD and LU. The energy consumption of cheese making had a contribution of 29% in HT, whereas the use of high-emitting vehicles by consumers accounted for 23% and 17% in EC and FD, respectively. To reduce several sources of pollution and mitigate the environmental impacts of buffalo mozzarella cheese, the LCA hotspots identification can lead to the development of specific mitigating strategies to improve sustainability along the supply chain. The development of farm-based models may better assess environmental impacts, the mitigation achieved by the implemented best practices and the "pollution swapping" effect to evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy.

AB  - RF amide-related peptide 3 (RFRP-3), a mammalian ortholog of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), is identified to be a novel inhibitory endogenous neurohormonal peptide that regulates mammalian reproduction by binding with specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) in various species. Herein, our objectives were to explore the biological functions of exogenous RFRP-3 on the apoptosis and steroidogenesis of yak cumulus cells (CCs) and the developmental potential of yak oocytes. The spatiotemporal expression pattern and localization of GnIH/RFRP-3 and its receptor GPR147 were determined in follicles and CCs. The effects of RFRP-3 on the proliferation and apoptosis of yak CCs were initially estimated by EdU assay and TUNEL staining. We confirmed that high-dose (10(-6) mol/L) RFRP-3 suppressed viability and increased the apoptotic rates, implying that RFRP-3 could repress proliferation and induce apoptosis. Subsequently, the concentrations of E-2 and P-4 were significantly lower with 10(-6) mol/L RFRP-3 treatment than that of the control counterparts, which indicated that the steroidogenesis of CCs was impaired after RFRP-3 treatment. Compared with the control group, 10(-6) mol/L RFRP-3 treatment decreased the maturation of yak oocytes efficiently and subsequent developmental potential. We sought to explore the potential mechanism of RFRP-3-induced apoptosis and steroidogenesis, so we observed the levels of apoptotic regulatory factors and hormone synthesis-related factors in yak CCs after RFRP-3 treatment. Our results indicated that RFRP-3 dose-dependently elevated the expression of apoptosis markers (Caspase and Bax), whereas the expression levels of steroidogenesis-related factors (LHR, StAR, 3 beta-HSD) were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. However, all these effects were moderated by cotreatment with inhibitory RF9 of GPR147. These results demonstrated that RFRP-3 adjusted the expression of apoptotic and steroidogenic regulatory factors to induce apoptosis of CCs, probably through binding with its receptor GPR147, as well as compromised oocyte maturation and developmental potential. This research revealed the expression profiles of GnIH/RFRP-3 and GPR147 in yak CCs and supported a conserved inhibitory action on oocyte developmental competence.

AB  - Anaerobic cellulolytic microbes in the gastrointestinal tract (GT) of ruminants have been well-documented; however, knowledge of aerobic microbes with cellulolytic activities in the ruminant GT is comparably limited. Here, we unraveled aerobic cultivable cellulolytic microbes in the GT of Ujimqin sheep (Ovis aries) and evaluated the cellulolytic potential of the promising isolates. Twenty-two strains were found to possess cellulose-degrading potential by Congo-red staining and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA/ITS sequence revealed that all strains belonged to nine genera, i.e., Bacillus, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, Brachybacterium, Sangulbacter, Rhizobfum, Fusarium, and Aspergillus. Strains with high cellulolytic activity were selected to further evaluate the activities of various enzymes in lignocellulosic alfalfa hay (Medicago saliva). Among them, isolate Bacillus subtilis RE2510 showed the highest potential for cellulose degradation, considering the high endoglucanase (0.1478 +/- 0.0014 IU mL(-1)), exoglucanase (0.1735 = 0.0012 IU mL(-1)), and beta-glucosidase (0.3817 +/- 0.0031 IU mL(-)1) after 10-day incubation with alfalfa hay. A significant destruction effect of the cellulose structure and the attachment of B. subtilis RE2510 to the hay were also revealed using a scanning electron microscope. This study expands our knowledge of aerobic cellulolytic isolates from the GT of sheep and highlights their potential application as a microbial additive in the aerobic process of cellulose bioconversion.

AB  - Salmonella is an important foodborne pathogen that can cause a range of illnesses in humans; it has also been a key focus for monitoring in the field of public health, including gastroenteritis, sepsis, and arthritis, and can also cause a decline in egg production in poultry and diarrhea and abortion in livestock, leading to death in severe cases, resulting in huge economic losses. This study aimed to investigate the isolation rate, antimicrobial resistance, serotypes, and genetic diversity of Salmonella isolated from yak feces in various regions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. A total of 1222 samples of yak dung were collected from major cities in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area, and the sensitivity of the isolated bacteria to 10 major classes of antibiotics was determined using the K-B paper disk diffusion method for drug susceptibility. Meanwhile, the serotypes of the isolated bacteria were analyzed using the plate agglutination test for serum antigens, and their carriage of drug resistance and virulence genes was determined using PCR and gel electrophoresis experiments. The isolated bacteria were also classified using MLST (Multi-Locus Sequence Typing). The overall isolation rate for Salmonella was 18.25% (223/1222), and the results of the antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that 98.65% (220/223) of the isolated bacteria were resistant to multiple antibiotics. In the 223 isolates of Salmonella, eight classes of 20 different resistance genes, 30 serotypes, and 15 different types of virulence genes were detected. The MLST analysis identified 45 distinct sequence types (STs), including five clonal complexes, of which ST34, ST11, and ST19 were the most common. These findings contribute valuable information about strain resources, genetic profiles, and typing data for Salmonella in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area, facilitating improved bacterial surveillance, identification, and control in yak populations. They also provide certain data supplements for animal Salmonella infections globally, filling research gaps.

AB  - Pestalotiopsis sensu lato, commonly referred to as pestalotiopsis-like fungi, exhibit a broad distribution and are frequently found as endophytes, saprobes and pathogens across various plant hosts. The taxa within pestalotiopsis-like fungi are classified into three genera viz. Pestalotiopsis, Pseudopestalotiopsis and Neopestalotiopsis, based on the conidial colour of their median cells and multi -locus molecular phylogenies. In the course of a biodiversity investigation focusing on pestalotiopsis-like fungi, a total of 12 fungal strains were identified. These strains were found to be associated with stromata of Beauveria, Ophiocordyceps and Tolypocladium in various regions of Taiwan from 2018 to 2021. These strains were evaluated morphologically and multi -locus phylogenetic analyses of the ITS (internal transcribed spacer), tef1-alpha (translation elongation factor 1-alpha) and tub2 (beta-tubulin) gene regions were conducted for genotyping. The results revealed seven well -classified taxa and one tentative clade in Pestalotiopsis and Neopestalotiopsis. One novel species, Pestalotiopsis manyueyuanani and four new records, N. camelliae-oleiferae, N. haikouensis, P. chamaeropis and P. hispanica, were reported for the first time in Taiwan. In addition, P. formosana and an unclassified strain of Neopestalotiopsis were identified, based on similarities of phylogeny and morphology. However, the data obtained in the present study suggest that the currently recommended loci for species delimitation of pestalotiopsis-like fungi do not deliver reliable or adequate resolution of tree topologies. The in -vitro mycelial growth rates of selected strains from these taxa had an optimum temperature of 25 degrees C, but growth ceased at 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C, while all the strains grew faster under alkaline than acidic or neutral pH conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary: Under heat stress, the aerobic metabolic activity of the body is significantly accelerated, which easily leads to hypoxia of high-oxygen consumption tissues, such as the mammary gland. In dairy cattle growing in the high-temperature and high-humidity environment in Guangxi, especially those in the peak period of lactation with strong metabolism, the lack of oxygen in the mammary cells is more obvious, and the milk volume and composition are greatly affected, and even lead to metabolic disorders. Nitidine chloride (NC) is a natural alkaloid with antioxidant properties that can remove excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, there is limited information on the effect of NC on BMECs hypoxic injury and its molecular mechanism. In this study, molecular biological methods combined with non-targeted metabolomics were used to study the protective effect of NC on BMECs induced by hypoxic stress. Based on the results obtained, we found that NC has a protective effect on hypoxic mitochondria and regulates amino acid metabolism in response to hypoxic stress. Hypoxia in the mammary gland epithelial cells of milk buffalo (BMECs) can affect milk yield and composition, and it can even cause metabolic diseases. Nitidine chloride (NC) is a natural alkaloid with antioxidant properties that can scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the effect of NC on the hypoxic injury of BMECs and its molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Here, an immunofluorescence assay, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and flow cytometry, combined with untargeted metabolomics, were used to investigate the protective effect of NC on hypoxic stress injury in BMECs. It was found that NC can significantly reduce cell activity (p < 0.05) and inhibit cellular oxidative stress (p < 0.05) and cell apoptosis (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in mitophagy mediated by the PINK1-Parkin pathway was observed after NC pretreatment (p < 0.05). In addition, a metabolic pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the mechanisms of NC against hypoxic stress may be related to the downregulation of pathways involving aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis; arginine and proline metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; and phenylalanine metabolism. Thus, NC has a protective effect on hypoxic mitochondria, and it can regulate amino acid metabolism in response to hypoxic stress. The present study provides a reference for the application of nitidine chloride to regulate the mammary lactation function of milk buffalo.

AB  - Simple Summary The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has a unique ecological environment, involving high altitude, low oxygen levels, strong ultraviolet rays, and severe imbalances in seasonal forage supply, which poses a serious threat to the livestock that feeds on natural pastures to maintain their survival. We have carried out a long-term follow-up study on rumen fermentation characteristics, the microbiota, and rumen epithelial gene expression of local Tibetan sheep. Correlation analysis showed that there were interactions among rumen fermentation characteristics, the microbiota, and host gene expression, mainly by adjusting the amino acid metabolism pathway and energy metabolism pathway to improve energy utilization. At the same time, we adjusted the balance of the rumen "core microbiota", which was regulated to promote the development of rumen and maintain the homeostasis of rumen environment (which relies Tibetan sheep can better adapt to the harsh environment in different periods of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau). This provides a theoretical basis for the breeding and management of Tibetan sheep on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. As an important ruminant on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Tibetan sheep can maintain their population reproduction rate in the harsh high-altitude environment of low temperature and low oxygen, which relies on their special plateau adaptations mechanism that they have formed for a long time. Microbiomes (known as "second genomes") are closely related to the nutrient absorption, adaptability, and health of the host. In this study, rumen fermentation characteristics, the microbiota, and rumen epithelial gene expression of Tibetan sheep in various months were analyzed. The results show that the rumen fermentation characteristics of Tibetan sheep differed in different months. The total SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids), acetate, propionate, and butyrate concentrations were highest in October and lowest in June. The CL (cellulase) activity was highest in February, while the ACX (acid xylanase) activity was highest in April. In addition, the diversity and abundance of rumen microbes differed in different months. Bacteroidetes (53.4%) and Firmicutes (27.4%) were the dominant phyla. Prevotella_1 and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group were the dominant genera. The abundance of Prevotella_1 was highest in June (27.8%) and lowest in December (17.8%). In addition, the expression of CLAUDIN4 (Claudin-4) and ZO1 (Zonula occludens 1) was significantly higher in April than in August and December, while the expression of SGLT1 (Sodium glucose linked transporter 1) was highest in August. Correlation analysis showed that there were interactions among rumen fermentation characteristics, the microbiota, and host gene expression, mainly by adjusting the amino acid metabolism pathway and energy metabolism pathway to improve energy utilization. At the same time, we adjusted the balance of the rumen "core microbiota" to promote the development of rumen and maintain the homeostasis of rumen environment, which makes Tibetan sheep better able to adapt to the harsh environment in different periods of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) emit pollutants that can cause negative impacts on human health. The concentration of hog production in North Carolina raises concerns regarding the disproportionate exposure of vulnerable communities to air pollution from CAFOs.OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether exposure to gaseous ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (in 2019) differs between subpopulations by examining demographics, including race/ethnicity, age, educational attainment, language proficiency, and socioeconomic status.METHODS: We used an Air Monitoring Station (AMS)/Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulatory Model (AERMOD)-based Human Exposure Model (version 3) to estimate ambient concentrations of NH3 and H2S from hog farms in Duplin County and its surrounding counties in North Carolina and estimate subsequent exposures of communities within 50 km of Duplin County, North Carolina, or the Duplin County Region. We combined estimated exposures with 2016 American Community Summary Census data, at the block group level, using spatial analysis to investigate whether exposures to these pollutants differ by race and ethnicity, age, income, education, and language proficiency. Based on these estimations, we assessed associated exposure risks to the impacted communities and used multivariable regression modeling to evaluate the relationship between average ammonia exposures from Duplin regional hog farms and the presence of vulnerable populations. RESULTS: The average [ +/- standard deviation & eth;SD & THORN;] annual estimated concentration of NH3 and H2S in the Duplin County Region is 1.75 +/- 2.81 mu g/m(3 )and 0.0087 +/- 0.014 mu g/m(3), respectively. The maximum average annual ambient concentrations are estimated at 54.2 7 +/- 4.12 mu g/m(3) and 0.54 +/- 0.041 mu g/(3 )or NH3 and H2S, respectively. Our descriptive analysis reveals that people of low income, people of color, people with low educational attainment, and the linguistically isolated in the Duplin Region are disproportionately exposed to higher levels of pollutants than the average exposure for residents. Alternatively, our statistical results suggests that after adjusting for covariates, communities of color are associated with 1.70% (95% CI: -3.79, 0.44) lower NH3 concentrations per 1-SD increase. One-standard deviation increases in the adults with low educational attainment and children <19 years of age is associated with 1.26% (95% CI: -0.77, 3.33) and 1.20% (95% CI: -0.62, 3.05) higher NH3 exposure per 1-SD increase, respectively. DISCUSSION: Exposures to NH3 and H2S differed by race and ethnicity, educational attainment, language proficiency, and socioeconomic status. The observed associations between exposure to CAFO-generated pollutants and sociodemographic indicators differed among demographics. The disproportionate distribution of hog facilities and resulting pollutant exposures among communities may have adverse environmental and human health impacts, raising environmental justice concerns. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11344

AB  - Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is a heritable disorder caused by defects of the Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), leading to deficiencies in coagulation and also angiogenesis. Women affected by VWD frequently show bleeding concerning the reproductive tract and may present with increased rates of miscarriages. We used a porcine model representing VWD type 1 and type 3 as well as the wildtype. Samples were obtained from the reproductive tract of non-pregnant sows and sows pregnant at time of placentation. Relative expression of the genes CALR, CCN2, CXCL8, ECE1, EDN1, F8, IGFBP7, and LGALS3 was analyzed. CCN2 and FVIII proteins were additionally analyzed using immunohistochemistry. In uterus and ovary significant upregulation of CCN2 was seen in non-pregnant pigs affected by VWD. This might be caused by the higher VEGFA-levels in these pigs and could have an in-fluence angiogenesis. During pregnancy, CCN2 expression increased in wildtype pig uteri but hardly changed in those of pregnant pigs affected by VWD, presumably because the expression level in the latter pigs already was significantly increased before pregnancy. F8 expression was significantly reduced in uterus and ovary of VWD-affected pigs. VWF is known to protect FVIII from decomposition and a lack of VWF leads to lower levels of FVIII. Our results suggest that a reduced F8 expression primarily might contribute to those reduced FVIII levels in VWD-affected pigs. Additional significant results involving the pregnant pigs were detected for CALR, EDN1, and LGALS3. These genes are promising candidates for more detailed future studies.

AB  - Production of acceptable quality ejaculates in boars is dependent upon the Sertoli cell population established before puberty and how effectively these cells function after sexual maturity. In general, factors affecting Sertoli cell mitosis tend to have a two-fold greater effect on sperm production compared with those affecting spermatogenesis. Birthweight is a reliable indicator of in utero testicular development and prepubertal growth rates are positively correlated with testis size and sperm production after sexual maturity. Colostrum intake and pre-weaning nutrition account for much of the variation associated with quality and quantity of ejaculates and represent opportunities to further enhance lifetime sperm production. Interactions between young boars and humans, shortly after weaning, have important effects on spermatogenesis after sexual maturity and need to be studied further. The seasonal effect on depression in semen quality is the most significant factor affecting production of acceptable quality ejaculates after puberty. Ambient temperatures, greater than those of the thermoneutral zone, have both acute and chronic effects that compromise all aspects of the male reproductive axis. Identification of genes asso-ciated with heat-tolerant phenotypes holds promise for addressing this challenge, especially in light of the current trend in global warming. Supplementation of vitamins, minerals and other compounds have positive effects on sperm production during periods in which other stressors, especially heat stress, are present and is an important mitigation strategy. Recent information on housing conditions and boar usage patterns indicate these cause relatively minor changes in sperm production, overall, but for some males can have significant, long-term effects.

AB  - Numerical-simulation studies of transport and flow in porous media are essential in many practical fields of research. Including the coupling of different physical processes allows accurate modelling of the effects of fluid flow and temperature changes on the subsurface reservoir structure, and conversely, the effects of reservoir-structure changes on fluids and heat. In this study, we introduce the development of a physics module for non-isothermal, multicomponent, multiphase flow in porous media, as part of the open-source, multiphysics simulation framework MOOSE.
   Through tight interfaces with existing physics modules for solid mechanics and aqueous geochemistry, massively parallel, fully implicit, fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical simulations are possible. MOOSE and the porous flow module are freely available under an open-source license, making MOOSE a plat-form for collaborative efforts in this field of research.

AB  - Land application of livestock manure may reduce the use of mineral fertilizers and alleviate the environmental degradation associated with mineral fertilizers application. However, how to optimize utilization of livestock manure value is not well understood and documentation regarding the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer replacement values (NFRV and PFRV, respectively) needs further scrutiny. Therefore, three representative livestock manures, i.e., pig, chicken, and cattle manure, were applied at different usages to assess their N and P availability in comparison to reference mineral fertilizers over summer maize growing seasons. The results show that the average NFRVs of pig, chicken, and cattle manures were 41.7-58.4%, 27.5-44.4%, and -3.6-36.1%, respectively, when based on different references (grain yield, total dry matter yield, grain N uptake, total N uptake), at different N application levels. The NFRV increased with the elevated N application rate for cattle manure treatment. In the P trials, livestock manure had a higher PFRV at a low P application level, and the average PFRVs of pig, chicken, and cattle manures were 80.3-164.8%, 77.9-143.7%, and 94.1-168.0%, respectively, at different P application levels. We conclude that livestock manure produced the lowest NFRV and highest PFRV at a low fertilizer application rate; pig manure had the highest N availability; and cattle manure had the highest P availability.

AB  - The hippopotamus population along the Runde River in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, attained a density in the late 1970s which threatened vegetation resources of this semi-arid park. A sample of 105 hippopotami taken in 1978 was used to determine the population's age and sex structure, and reproductive characteristics. An average school consisted of 11.4 individuals, comprising 2.2 adult bulls, 4.6 adult cows, 2.2 and 1.4 immature males and females, respectively, and 0.8 calves. Females constituted 54% of the population, and 58% of foetuses; neither differed from parity. Testes mass and seminiferous tubule diameter increased with age according to a logistic function. Puberty commenced at about 4 years, and sexual maturity at 8-8.3 years, respectively at 47% (655 kg) and 65% (1070 kg) of mean adult male mass. Males were physically mature by 17.5 years. Based on the development of ovary mass, uterus mass, and uterine horn length of non-pregnant or pregnant females, the pubertal interval was 24 months commencing at 7 years when body mass reached 71% of mean adult female mass (964 kg), and sexual maturity commenced when body mass reached 78% of mean adult female mass (1050 kg). Females attained physical maturity at 13 years. Conceptions occurred in seven of eight sampled months, with most occurring in June and peak parturition estimated to occur in February. The pregnancy rate of sexually mature females was 36.8%, the incidence of pregnancy was 0.56 calves/female/year, anoestrus was 13.7 months, post-partum oestrus was 5.7 months, and the calving interval was 21.7 months. Calf mortality (<2 years) was 42%. Female births per female of reproductive age was 0.092. Reproductive characteristics of hippopotamus across Africa illustrate their plasticity in relation to climatic variation and population density, suggesting populations may be regulated without any need for management intervention.

AB  - Because of water crises, the cultivation of forage plants is greatly important in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. In order to study the effect of different organic fertilizers and irrigation regimes on the growth and biochemical responses of different Atriplex species, this experiment was performed as a factorial split with three replications in the city of Bandar Abbas in 2017-2018. The main factor included three irrigation regimes (irrigation at 80, 60, and 40% of field capacity) and the sub-factor were different sources of fertilizer (poultry manure and sheep manure about 5 tons per hectare, and chemical fertilizer) and different species of Atriplex (A. canascens, A. leucoclada, and A. lelentiformis). Based on the results, increasing drought stress increased sodium (Na) and proline of the leaf and decreased the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and soluble carbohydrates. In irrigation of 40% of field capacity, the highest amount of leaf nitrogen was observed in sheep manure (1.47%), representing a significant increase compared to the chemical fertilizer. In irrigation of 80% of field capacity, the highest amount of leaf phosphorus (0.222%) was observed in chemical fertilizer. The highest levels of catalase and peroxides were obtained in poultry and sheep manure. Also, in the irrigation of 40% of field capacity, poultry manure and then sheep manure could show higher levels of soluble protein in the leaf, respectively. In general, this study showed the successful effects of organic fertilizers on increasing nutrient uptake and physiological traits and improving the biological yield of Atriplex.

AB  - The influence of environmental factors on the distribution and persistence of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) is pertinent to policy makers and managers to formulate balanced plans for different land-use types. The study focuses on movement of elephants and how they utilize foraging areas in Sioma Ngwezi landscape in Zambia by answering the following questions: (1) Which environmental variables and land-cover class predict the movement of elephants during the wet season in Sioma Ngwezi landscape? (2) What is the wet season suitable habitat for elephants in Sioma Ngwezi landscape? (3) What are the major wet season movement corridors for elephants in Sioma Ngwezi landscape? We used GPS telemetry data from the collared elephants to assess habitat connectivity. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and linkage mapper were the tools used to predict habitat suitability, movement corridors, and barriers in the landscape during the wet season. The study identified elevation, land cover, and NDVI as the most important environmental predictors that modify the dispersal of elephants in the landscape during the wet season. Additionally, a total of 36 potential wet season corridors were identified connecting 15 core areas mainly used for foraging and protection from poachers in the landscape. Of these, 24 corridors were highly utilized and are suggested as priority corridors for elephant movement in the landscape. The identified wet season habitats and functional corridors may help to combat elephant poaching by patrolling areas with high relative probability of elephant presence. The findings may also help abate human-elephant conflict such as crop-raiding by managing identified corridors that run into agriculture zones in the game management area.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates the role of cation channel sperm associated 2 (CATSPER2) and sperm flagella 2 (SPEF2) genes in boar spermatogenesis, focusing on their association with sperm quality traits in boars. Methods Utilizing targeted next-generation sequencing, we identified and genotyped two polymorphisms in CATSPER2 (rs341636020G > A, rs326912346G > T) and three variants in SPEF2 (rs320839956A > G, rs334209514C > A, rs325319860C > T) across three boar breeds (Duroc, n = 181; Landrace, n = 87; Large White, n = 52). Results Our results confirmed the presence of the specified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), adhering to association study criteria. In CATSPER2, significant associations were detected between rs341636020G > A and sperm curvilinear velocity (VCL) in Duroc and Landrace boars, and between rs326912346G > T and straight velocity (VSL) in Duroc and Large White boars. For SPEF2, rs320839956A > G was significantly linked to sperm viability in Duroc and Landrace and to sperm concentration (SCON) in Large White boars. Additionally, rs334209514C > A and rs325319860C > T showed significant associations with SCON and VCL respectively, in Doruc and Landrace boars. Conclusions Overall, our findings suggest that CATSPER2 and SPEF2 SNPs significantly impact boar sperm quality traits. These genetic markers have the potential to enhance boar fertility through selective breeding programs, contributing to the optimization of reproductive performance in pigs.

AB  - Rising temperatures due to climate change are predicted to accelerate the life cycle of arthropod herbivores thereby exacerbating pest formation. Notorious pests like spider mites thrive in areas with high temperatures (32-35 degrees C), and it is predicted that the size and number of such areas will expand in the coming decades. Higher temperatures can directly accelerate population growth, but also indirectly affect them through changes in the plant's defensive mechanisms. Spider mites have been shown to adapt to plant defences, with natural selection favouring defence-suppressing traits. However, it is not known to what extent suppression is affected by rising temperatures and how this might tie into the rate of adaptation and pest damage. In this study, we investigated the effect of two temperatures (25 degrees C and 32 degrees C), on the spider mite-tomato interaction, predicting the influence of rising temperatures on favouring defence-adapted mites. We found that all mite strains caused more plant damage at 32 degrees C, but temperature did not affect the overall patterns of induction and suppression of defence genes. Although fecundity was higher for all strains at 32 degrees C, juvenile and adult survival was lower, especially for inducer mites. With these data, we parametrized population models for the two strains over three months, indicating that suppressor mites might displace inducers at the higher temperature, either when it is constant or in the form of heat waves. Our models predict that in areas with higher temperatures, defence-suppressing mites are favoured, which will accelerate and consequently spur pest formation.

KW  - IMPACTS
AB  - The range and density of one of North America's most destructive and invasive mammalian species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa), has expanded rapidly over the past several decades. Alongside this growth, their fecal contamination of surface waters has impaired water quality through significantly increased levels of pathogenic bacteria, raising concerns over the potential for zoonotic disease transmission. Significant remediation of these water quality impacts has been shown as a result of reductions in wild pig populations due to control efforts; however, the duration of these remediation effects as populations rebound remains unclear. Our study sought to determine the longevity of water quality remediation resulting from wild pig population control efforts. We found that median concentrations of Escherichia coli and fecal coliform (CFU/100 mL) increased by 746% and 159% in the year following the conclusion of removal efforts, resulting in median concentrations of 79% and 159% greater than those observed prior. We also found increased public health risk, with samples exceeding E. coli and fecal coliform guidelines 10% and 12% more often than pre-removal, respectively. While further research into wild pig population dynamics and fecal contamination is necessary, we conclude that ongoing population control efforts may be necessary to remediate water quality impacts and public health risks associated with invasive wild pigs.

AB  - Repeated intermittent exposure to psychostimulants, such as amphetamine, leads to a progressive enhancement of the drug's ability to increase both behavioral and brain neurochemical responses. The expression of these enhancements, known as sensitization, can be regulated by Pavlovian conditioned stimuli. Cues that are associated with drug experience can facilitate sensitization so that it only occurs in the presence of these stimuli (context-specific sensitization). In contrast, cues that are explicitly related to the absence of drugs (conditioned inhibitors) can prevent the expression of sensitization. We hypothesized that disrupting conditioned inhibition would enable amphetamine sensitization in new contexts. Using male Sprague Dawley rats and a two-context amphetamine conditioning procedure, we found that extinguishing amphetamine experience in one environment led to the loss of conditioned inhibition in a separate context. Thus, amphetamine-induced sensitized locomotion, as well as both enhanced dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens, were observed in a context where the drug was never experienced before. A similar loss of contextual control of sensitization was seen after using baclofen/muscimol microinjections to transiently inhibit the medial prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, or ventral subiculum of the hippocampus. In other words, compared to control infusions, these intracranial injections of GABA-receptor agonists were able to block conditioned inhibitors from preventing the expression of sensitized locomotion. Together, these findings reveal the importance of conditioned inhibitors for regulating addiction-like behavior. The results suggest that dopaminergic and glutamatergic brain circuitry controls the context-specific expression of amphetamine sensitization.

AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is the most important species in marine aquaculture in terms of production volume, and it is regarded as a remarkable example of the industry's development. Yet, its importance is expected to grow manifolds in the future, and to ensure its expansion in a sustainable way, alternative feed ingredients are needed. In this study, we used systematic literature reviews as a research method to identify recent potential alternative protein sources for Atlantic salmon aquaculture and to determine the hotspots of the carbon footprint of these proteins. The findings according to the volumes of papers reviewed in the literature, revealed a strong interest in the recent literature on insect and single-cell proteins, both in their effects on Atlantic salmon aquaculture and their carbon footprint analysis. Both protein groups have emerged in the literature as suitable replacements for more traditional diets. Furthermore, studies assessing their carbon footprint revealed that activities such as the production of the substrates/feed/fertilizer used in cultivation/rearing, as well as the energy required for production or processing stages, are the most significant contributors to the carbon footprint. Other types of protein sources studied in the literature included marine proteins, terrestrial animal by-products, and plant-based proteins. For each protein type and its identified alternatives, we analysed the implications of their carbon footprint performance findings and discussed future opportunities and prospects.

AB  - ObjectivesBurned bone coloration has been used for decades to help in the bioanthropological analysis of burned human bones. However, there is a variety of factors that can interfere with the coloration manifested by bones exposed to heat, resulting in colors that differ from the usual black to white gradient. In this study, we evaluated possible causes of unusual coloration changes and hues in burned bone.Materials and MethodsFor that purpose, defleshed fresh pig (Sus scrofa) ribs as well as fresh and dry human clavicles were burned at four different temperatures (500, 700, 900 and 1100 degrees C) in contact with different materials (CaO, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, and polyester cloth). Observable color changes were assessed through naked eye observation and description, Munsell color charts, and reflectance spectrophotometry. Additionally, chemical changes in bone were assessed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF).ResultsOur results showed that some materials did affect usual burned bone coloration (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn) and correspondent FTIR-ATR and XRF spectra. As for other materials, although no effect on visual bone coloration was observed, they still affected FTIR-ATR and XRF spectra (CaO and cloth).DiscussionThis study can contribute to the anthropological analysis of burned human remains, providing some answers to what can cause unusual types of heat-induced colorations.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an invariably fatal prion disease affecting cervid species worldwide. Prions can manifest as distinct strains that can influence disease pathology and transmission. CWD is profoundly lymphotropic, and most infected cervids likely shed peripheral prions replicated in lymphoid organs. However, CWD is a neurodegenerative disease, and most research on prion strains has focused on neurogenic prions. Thus, a knowledge gap exists comparing neurogenic prions to lymphogenic prions. In this study, we compared prions from the obex and lymph nodes of naturally exposed white-tailed deer to identify potential biochemical strain differences. Here, we report biochemical evidence of strain differences between the brain and lymph node from these animals. Conformational stability assays, glycoform ratio analyses, and immunoreactivity scanning across the structured domain of the prion protein that refolds into the amyloid aggregate of the infectious prion reveal significantly more structural and glycoform variation in lymphogenic prions than neurogenic prions. Surprisingly, we observed greater biochemical differences among neurogenic prions than lymphogenic prions across individuals. We propose that the lymphoreticular system propagates a diverse array of prions from which the brain selects a more restricted pool of prions that may be quite different than those from another individual of the same species. Future work should examine the biological and zoonotic impact of these biochemical differences and examine more cervids from multiple locations to determine if these differences are conserved across species and locations.

AB  - Elucidating the mechanism by which oligophagous herbivores adapt to host plants is crucial in determining the co-evolution and interactions between insects and plants. Throughout a co-evolutionary process, the oligophagous herbivore Chrysomela populi L. relied on Populus trees to develop and form specialized larval glandular chemical defenses. However, the current understanding of the growth, development, and chemical defense of C. populi on different Populus trees remains insufficient. Here, the effects of Populus canadensis and Populus tomentosa on the development and chemical defense of C. populi were examined. The larvae develop well on P. canadensis achieving higher pupation and improved survival. In contrast, they only survive up to 2nd instar after feeding on P. tomentosa. Meanwhile, the synthetic salicylaldehyde content in C. populi larvae after feeding on P. canadensis leaves was higher than after feeding on P. tomentosa. Finally, transcriptome sequencing found insufficient synthesis but excessive metabolism of trehalose in C. populi larvae after feeding on P. tomentosa. After analyzing the genes involved in salicylaldehyde synthesis in the larvae, the CpMRP gene was upregulated when C. populi fed on P. tomentosa, while the (3-glucosidase and salicyl alcohol oxidase (SAO) were not upregulated. The results preliminarily revealed the divergent response and possible molecular basis underlying the biological fitness and chemical defense of C. populi to different poplars varieties and also provided a multidimensional perspective to understand the interaction between Chrysomela leaf beetles and salicin-containing plants.

AB  - Dwelling intensity of horse-chestnut miner (Cameraria ohridella) larvae in various leaves insolation and temperature was measured to determine whether this pest's development follows a predictable pattern or depends more on local microenvironment conditions. Mines growing on leaves of mature host plants (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) in their natural conditions were photographed for two consecutive generations of the pest and in two separated vegetation periods. Apart from meteorological data obtained from the nearest station, the temperature of intact and mined parts of sun-exposed and shaded leaf blades was measured at various daytimes throughout the experiment. Obtained sets of digital data were analysed and combined to model mine area growth as a function of degree-days sum by adopting of Verhulst logistic equation. We showed the predictive potential of our model based on experimental data, and it may be useful in the scheduling of pest control measures in natural conditions. Our analyses also revealed that despite significant differences in microenvironment conditions depending on mines' insolation, the horse-chestnut miner larvae could partially compensate for them and complete their development at similar endpoints expressed as the cumulative sum of degree-days. We conclude that computer-aided analysis of photographic documentation of leaf-miner larval growth followed by mathematical modelling offers a noninvasive, reliable, and inexpensive alternative for monitoring local leaf-miners populations.

AB  - Simple Summary The liver is the principal organ involved in animal metabolism. A healthy liver is critical to proper protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism. In contrast, liver damage results in a deterioration of animal health and, thereby, their well-being. In this study, liver damage was monitored in all animals reared on Czech farms and slaughtered in slaughterhouses in the Czech Republic for a period of 12 years (2010 to 2021). The results show the highest prevalence of liver damage in cattle, followed by pigs, sheep, and then goats, both in adults and in fattening animals. Chronic lesions were significantly more frequent than acute or parasitic lesions in the majority of species and categories of animal species, with the exception of piglets and ducks, in which acute lesions were most frequent, and ewes and lambs, in which parasitic lesions were most frequent. We monitored liver damage in cattle (cows, heifers, fattening bulls, and calves culled from the herd), pigs (sows, finishing pigs, and piglets culled from the farm), sheep (ewes and lambs), goats (does and kids), rabbits, and poultry (end-of-lay hens, broiler chickens, turkeys, domestic ducks, and domestic geese) in the period from 2010 to 2021. All animals (n = 1,425,710,143) reared on Czech farms and slaughtered at slaughterhouses in the Czech Republic were included in the analysis. We determined the total number of damaged livers for individual categories of animals and also analyzed separately the incidence of damage of acute, chronic, parasitic, and other origin. The overall incidence of liver damage was higher in adult animals compared to fattening animals in all species. In cattle and pigs, the incidence was also higher in young animals culled from the herd compared to fattening animals. When comparing adult animals by species, the incidence of liver damage was highest in cows (46.38%), followed by sows (17.51%), ewes (12.97%), and does (4.26%). When comparing fattening animals by species, the incidence was highest in heifers (14.17%) and fattening bulls (7.97 %), followed by finishing pigs (11.26%), lambs (4.73%), and kids (0.59%). When comparing young culled from the herd by species, it was higher in piglets (32.39%) than in calves (17.6 %), and when poultry and rabbits were compared, the incidence was highest in turkeys (3.38%), followed by ducks (2.20%), geese (1.09%), broiler chickens (0.08%), and rabbits (0.04%). The results indicate that fattening animals have a better liver condition than mature animals and that culled young have a worse liver condition than older fattening animals. Chronic lesions represented the dominant proportion of pathological findings. Parasitic lesions occurred, first and foremost, in animals grazed on meadows with likely parasitic invasion, i.e., in ewes (7.51%), lambs (3.51%), and heifers (1.31%), and in animals in which antiparasitic protection is limited in view of the protection of meat from antiparasitic residues, i.e., finishing pigs (3.68%). Parasitic damage to the liver was rarely detected in rabbits and poultry. The results obtained represent a body of knowledge for measures to improve the health and condition of the liver in food animals.

AB  - This study investigates arthropod assemblage in cowpea, hemp, and watermelon grown both as monocrops and intercrops using three sampling techniques: direct visual counts, sticky cards, and pan traps. A total of 31,774 arthropods were collected, spanning two classes [Arachnida (0.07%) and Insecta (99.93%)], 11 orders, and 82 families representing diverse functional groups. Arachnids were represented by a single family (Araneae). Among insects, the composition included Diptera (36.81%), Thysanoptera (24.64%), Hemiptera (19.43%), Hymenoptera (11.58%), Coleoptera (6.84%), Lepidoptera (0.076%) and Blattodea, Odonata, Orthoptera, Psocodea (<= 0.005%). Roughly 10% of the total arthropods were pollinators, while the remainder were primarily herbivores and predators. Apidae were abundant in all treatments except for watermelon monocrops. Intercropping supported more pollinators, particularly Apidae, Halictidae, and Sarcophagidae. However, herbivores dominated (>50%) in each system, largely due to high presence of thrips and cicadellids. Predators accounted for approximately 30%, with dolichopodids (Diptera) being the most dominant. Watermelon yield increased by 30-60% in the intercrop systems. While intercropping increases overall arthropod abundance, it also creates a more balanced community where beneficial organisms are not heavily outnumbered by pests and contributes to enhanced ecological resilience and crop performance.

AB  - Simple Summary: The Liangshan semi-fine-wool sheep is a composite breed, developed in Southwest China by crossing local coarse-wool sheep (Liangshan native sheep), fine-wool sheep (e.g., Xinjiang Merino sheep), and semi-fine-wool sheep (e.g., Border Leicester and Romney sheep). This breed not only has soft wool with a spinning count from 48 to 50s but also exhibits excellent adaptability to the local cold and humid environment. Nevertheless, recent declines in wool market demand and the lack of continuous genetic improvement initiatives have resulted in a reduction in its population size. In this study, we systematically investigated the genetic composition of this breed through comparative genomic analyses. Compared to Chinese sheep populations (e.g., Yunnan sheep), our findings unveiled a shorter genetic distance between Liangshan semi-fine-wool sheep and non-Chinese breeds like Border Leicester and Romney sheep. Additionally, we identified many plausible candidate genes and signaling pathways associated with wool traits specific to Liangshan semi-fine-wool sheep. These results provide important references and genomic resources that can be harnessed for future genetic breeding improvements for Liangshan semi-fine-wool sheep. Understanding the genetic makeup of local sheep breeds is essential for their scientific conservation and sustainable utilization. The Liangshan semi-fine-wool sheep (LSS), a Chinese semi-fine-wool breed renowned for its soft wool, was analyzed using whole-genome sequencing data including 35 LSS, 84 sheep from other domestic breeds, and 20 Asiatic mouflons. We investigated the genetic composition of LSS by conducting analyses of the population structure, runs of homozygosity, genomic inbreeding coefficients, and selection signature. Our findings indicated that LSS shares greater genetic similarity with Border Leicester and Romney sheep than with Tibetan (TIB), Yunnan (YNS), and Chinese Merino sheep. Genomic analysis indicated low to moderate inbreeding coefficients, ranging from 0.014 to 0.154. In identifying selection signals across the LSS genome, we pinpointed 195 candidate regions housing 74 annotated genes (e.g., IRF2BP2, BVES, and ALOX5). We also found the overlaps between the candidate regions and several known quantitative trait loci related to wool traits, such as the wool staple length and wool fiber diameter. A selective sweep region, marked by the highest value of cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity, encompassed IRF2BP2-an influential candidate gene affecting fleece fiber traits. Furthermore, notable differences in genotype frequency at a mutation site (c.1051 + 46T > C, Chr25: 6,784,190 bp) within IRF2BP2 were observed between LSS and TIB and YNS sheep (Fisher's exact test, p < 2.2 x 10(-16)). Taken together, these findings offer insights crucial for the conservation and breeding enhancement of LSS.

AB  - The balance between energetic costs and acquisition in free-ranging species is essential for survival, and provides important insights regarding the physiological impact of anthropogenic disturbances on wild animals. For marine mammals such as beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), the first step in modeling this bioenergetic balance requires an examination of resting and active metabolic demands. Here, we used open-flow respirometry to measure oxygen consumption during surface rest and submerged swimming by trained beluga whales, and compared these measurements with those of a commonly studied odontocete, the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Both resting metabolic rate (3012 +/- 126.0 kJ h(-1)) and total cost of transport (1.4 +/- 0.1 J kg(-1) m(-1)) of beluga whales were consistent with predicted values for moderately sized marine mammals in temperate to cold-water environments, including dolphins measured in the present study. By coupling the rate of oxygen consumption during submerged swimming with locomotor metrics from animal-borne accelerometer tags, we developed predictive relationships for assessing energetic costs from swim speed, stroke rate and partial dynamic acceleration. Combining these energetic data with calculated aerobic dive limits for beluga whales (8.8 min), we found that high-speed responses to disturbance markedly reduce the whale's capacity for prolonged submergence, pushing the cetaceans to costly anaerobic performances that require prolonged recovery periods. Together, these species-specific energetic measurements for beluga whales provide two important metrics, gait-related locomotor costs and aerobic capacity limits, for identifying relative levels of physiological vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances that have become increasingly pervasive in their Arctic habitats.

AB  - Relationships between sea urchins and noncrustose macroalgae are typically nonlinear, and an abrupt phase shift from a barren to a macroalgae-dominated state and vice versa happens when the sea urchin abundance exceeds a critical threshold. Here, we have used two mass mortality events as a natural experiment to study progressive changes and dynamics between these stable states. In 2009-2010 and 2018, two mass mortalities decimated the populations of the sea urchin Diadema africanum in the Canary Islands (Eastern Subtropical Atlantic). In these islands, this sea urchin is a key-herbivore controlling the growth of macroalgae, and sea urchin barrens have persisted for more 60 yr. Mass mortality events differed in intensity both in space and time, and two phase shifts from sea urchin barrens to macroalgal beds were detected in both when sea urchin density declined below a critical threshold of 4 indv. center dot m(-2). The first mass mortality was greater in La Palma Island, consequently in this island a long-lasting alternative state dominated by noncrustose macroalgae has been established. Subsequently, a recurrent mass mortality also favored the transition from the sea urchin barrens to noncrustose macroalgal beds in Tenerife Island. After mass mortalities, D. africanum populations were reduced by 94-98% in both islands. No signs of recovery of these populations have been identified after phase shifts; ecosystem feedbacks may be the cause of the low population density of D. africanum.

AB  - Intraspecific phytochemical variation across a landscape can cascade up trophic levels, potentially mediating the composition of entire insect communities. Surprisingly, we have little understanding of the processes that regulate and maintain phytochemical variation within species, likely because these processes are complex and operate simultaneously both temporally and spatially. To assess how phytochemistry varies within species, we tested the degree to which resource availability, contrasting soil type, and herbivory generate intraspecific chemical variation in growth and defense of the tropical shrub, Piper imperiale (Piperaceae). We quantified changes in both growth (e.g., nutritional protein, above- and below-ground biomass) and defense (e.g., imide chemicals) of individual plants using a well-replicated fully factorial shade-house experiment in Costa Rica. We found that plants grown in high light, nutrient- and richer old alluvial soil had increased biomass. High light was also important for increasing foliar protein. Thus, investment into growth was determined by resource availability and soil composition. Surprisingly, we found that chemical defenses decreased in response to herbivory. We also found that changes in plant protein were more plastic compared to plant defense, indicating that constitutive defenses may be relatively fixed, and thus an adaptation to chronic herbivory that is common in tropical forests. We demonstrate that intraspecific phytochemical variation of P. imperiale is shaped by resource availability from light and soil type. Because environmental heterogeneity occurs over small spatial scales (tens of meters), herbivores may be faced with a complex phytochemical landscape that may regulate how much damage any individual plant sustains.

AB  - Excessive chemical fertilizers degrade soil and increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Organic substitution of nitrogen fertilizers is recognized as a sustainable agricultural-management practice, yet its dual role in carbon sequestration and emissions renders the net GHG balance (NGHGB) uncertain. To assess the GHG mitigation potential of organic substitution strategies, this study analyzed GHG fluxes, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, indirect GHG emissions, and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) based on a long-term field positioning experiment initiated in 2016. Six fertilizer regimes were systematically compared: no fertilizer control (CK); only phosphorus and potassium fertilizer (PK); total chemical fertilizer (NPK); 1/3 chemical N substituted with sheep manure (OF1); dual substitution protocol with 1/6 chemical N substituted by sheep manure and 1/6 substituted by straw-derived N (OF2); complete chemical N substitution with sheep manure (OF3). The results showed that OF1 and OF2 maintained crop yields similar to those under NPK, whereas OF3 reduced yield by over 10%; relative to NPK, OF1, OF2, and OF3 significantly increased SOC sequestration rates by 50.70-149.20%, reduced CH4 uptake by 7.9-70.63%, increased CO2 emissions by 1.4-23.9%, decreased N2O fluxes by 3.6-56.2%, and mitigated indirect GHG emissions from farm inputs by 24.02-63.95%. The NGHGB was highest under OF1, 9.44-23.99% greater than under NPK. These findings demonstrate that partial organic substitution increased carbon sequestration, maintained crop yields, whereas high substitution rates increase the risk of carbon emissions. The study results indicate that substituting 1/3 of chemical nitrogen with sheep manure in maize cropping systems represents an effective fertilizer management approach to simultaneously balance productivity and ecological sustainability.

AB  - Stable isotope studies have revolutionised our understanding of food webs, subsistence, mobility and their change through time. In the Andes, dietary stable isotopic studies have often focused on timing the adoption of maize as a staple food and identifying camelid pastoralism in selected valleys of the Pacific coast. Few studies have focused on highland societies and understanding pastoralist communities in particular, but the underlying assumption has been that camelid herders had essentially narrow and specialised diets. To evaluate this assertion, we analyzed dietary carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of 27 human and 23 faunal specimens from nine archaeological sites located in the Central Altiplano of Bolivia supported by 27 radiocarbon dates. Our results suggest important diversity characterised both human and animal isotopic ecology between 1300 BCE and 1200 CE. The collected data also demonstrates that maize was not regularly consumed, suggesting interregional food exchange between this region of the Altiplano and its neighboring lowland inter-Andean valleys likely postdated 1100 CE. Consistent with reliance on cultivated crops such as chenopods and tubers and wild fauna including rodents, birds and fish, early camelid herders in the Andean Central Altiplano relied on a generalised form of pastoralism.

AB  - High atmospheric temperatures can reduce maize production in different parts of Asia. Heat stress is the major driving force behind the need for varietal development that confers a heat tolerance trait (drought + heat tolerant) to maize hybrids. CIMMYT has developed heat-tolerant maize hybrids and deployed them in the market in collaboration with NARS partners. This study was conducted to estimate farmers' willingness to pay for heat-tolerant maize hybrids in the Terai region of Nepal. A socioeconomic survey of 404 randomly selected maize-growing households was conducted to estimate farmers' willingness to pay using the contingent valuation method. Given the economic importance of heat-tolerant maize hybrids in maize cultivation, the survey showed that the average WTP for heat-tolerant maize hybrids was 71% more than that for the current varieties in the market, including overall seed sources and subsidized seed. Without a subsidy, the farmers' WTP price was at a 19% premium compared to the average price paid for conventional hybrids. Factors such as education, owning land, the interaction of hybrid adopters and owning land, soil depth, the number of goats/sheep, and the semi-pucca homes of households influenced the WTP for heat-tolerant maize hybrids. Heterogeneous demand was observed with respect to years of hybrid maize cultivation, farmers' association with the network group, and the gender of the head of the household. In the context of climate change and global warming scenarios, Nepal's agriculture policy should prioritize increasing domestic seed production and the distribution of heat-tolerant maize hybrids through a public-private partnership model.

AB  - Climate changes the geographic range of both species as well as pathogens, causing a potential increase in the vulnerability of populations or species with limited genetic diversity. With advances in high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, we can now define functional expressed genetic diversity of wild species at a larger scale and identify populations at risk. Previous studies have used genomic DNA to define major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II diversity in reindeer. Varying numbers of expressed genes found in many ungulates strongly argues for using cDNA in MHC typing strategies to ensure that diversity estimates relate to functional genes. We have used available reindeer genomes to identify candidate genes and established an HTS approach to define expressed MHC class I and class II diversity. To capture a broad diversity we included samples from wild reindeer from Southern Norway, semi-domesticated reindeer from Northern Norway and reindeer from the high Artic archipelago Svalbard. Our data show a medium MHC diversity in semi-domesticated and wild Norwegian mainland reindeer, and low MHC diversity reindeer in Svalbard reindeer. The low immune diversity in Svalbard reindeer provides a potential risk if the pathogenic pressure changes in response to altered environmental conditions due to climate change, or increased human-related activity.

AB  - Research on grassland carrying capacity (GCC) and forage-livestock balance is of great significance for promoting the harmonious development of human and grassland. However, the lack of understanding of GCC and forage-livestock balance in the agro-pastoral transition zone of northern China has limited the grassland sustainable development. Here, the spatial and temporal characteristics of GCC and forage-livestock balance in the grassland of agro-pastoral transition zone of northern China from 2000 to 2022 were analyzed using meteorological data and remote sensing data. Geographical detectors and geographically weighted regression were also used to identify the driving factors and their interactions with GCC changes. Moreover, future GCC trends were predicted using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 dataset. Results revealed that: (1) GCC showed an overall upward trend from 2000 to 2022 but with significant inter-annual fluctuations. Its spatial distribution decreased gradually from north to south and from east to west. Precipitation, temperature, and cumulative solar radiation were the main drivers of the inter-annual variation of GCC, and the interaction between precipitation and temperature was the main influencing factor of the spatial distribution of GCC; (2) the forage-livestock balance was in an overloaded state in most years, but its index remained basically stable. Spatially, grazing overloading was mainly distributed in northeastern area and the severe overloading was mainly distributed in northwestern area; and (3) future projections indicated a downward trend in potential GCC. Under shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP)2-4.5 scenario, the potential GCC had a ranged of 1.38x107-1.86x107 standard sheep unit (SHU) and a mean of 1.60x107 SHU. Meanwhile, the potential GCC under SSP5-8.5 scenario had a range of 1.18x107-1.69x107 SHU and a mean of 1.49x107 SHU. These results indicated that although GCC of the agro-pastoral transition zone of northern China showed an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2022, the forage-livestock balance index remained basically stable. The GCC was predicted to show a decreasing trend in the future. The findings provide a scientific basis for the sustainable development of grassland and the optimization of grazing management policies in this area.

AB  - Simple Summary: Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive technology that is of interest both for diagnosing mastitis and describing possible interactions between milking machine liners and teat tissue in cows. Very little was known about these applications in dairy goats, although this species is increasingly affected by mastitis, which is not only of infectious origin. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the thermal responses of teats to the milking machine in goats with different levels of udder inflammation. IRT fails to detect mastitis early in goats and cannot be used for prophylactic purposes in goats. IRT measurements were influenced by milking, and the results differed between unbalanced glands and different teat shapes, indicating differences in the interaction of the machine with the teat tissue. The IRT, therefore, appears to be a good instrument for measuring the effects of the milking machine. In the future, it could help to better adapt the machine equipment and settings to the animals and improve the efficiency and well-being of the animals. There is a need to develop tools for mastitis management in goats and to measure the effects of milking machines on teats. Infrared thermography (IRT), as shown in cows, was a good candidate for early mastitis detection and focusing on milking equipment and settings implicated in potential problems. The aim of this study was to test IRT to detect udder inflammation and the effects of mechanical milking on teats in relation to inflammation status, udder balance, and teat shape in Alpine goats. IRT spectra were compared before and after milking in 551 goats from three commercial herds compared to their individual SCC (somatic cell count). We found no regression or trend between logSCC and IRT measurement or response to milking, even in highly inflamed goat udders. The effect of milking was significant (p < 0.05) with global temperature reduction after milking, but differences were seen between teat parts and unbalanced half udders. The highest reduction in skin temperature was observed at the teat orifice (-1.06 +/- 0.05) and the lowest at the teat barrel (-0.37 +/- 0.05). The teats with long barrels showed more IRT reactions, which clearly indicates poor adaptation to the liners used. In conclusion, the IRT was not able to detect mastitis, but it is a good tool to diagnose the effects of the milking machine in order to adapt milking equipment and settings to the goats and improve their welfare.

AB  - Natural wildlife habitats are regularly encroached by humans for different purposes, which are heading the biodiversity towards dramatic falls. The presence of several endangered species in many areas remains unveiled due to the lack of faunal inventories. In such situations, it is imperative to make proper records of the existing fauna on local scales to strengthen the conservation practices. Twentyone species representing 18 genera, 12 families and six orders of mammals were recorded in Nowshera district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (KP), Pakistan from an inventory conducted from November 2018 to July 2019. Selected locations were scanned by walking and grey literature was used. Five of the recorded species were found in captive breeding facilities while rest of the species were recorded exclusively from the wild. Order Artiodactyla was the most diverse group represented by 7 species from 5 genera in 3 families. Critically endangered Common leopard Panthera pardus an imperceptible resident species of the area was revealed for the first time by using grey literature. Wild boar Sus scrofa was the most dominant and frequently occurring species of the area. Based on the regional conservation status of the recorded species, 3 species are near threatened, 2 species are vulnerable, one endangered and one species is critically endangered. Four species are protected under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife and Biodiversity (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Act, 2015. Threats being faced by the reported mammalian fauna from human activities are emphasized.

AB  - The vomeronasal organ (VNO) plays a key role in mammals, since it detects pheromones thus enabling social interactions between congeners. VNO inflammatory changes have been shown to severely impact animal life, leading to impaired social interactions in groups, such as in pigs. Environmental air is known to be strongly modified in farms, and it is suspected to be one of the causes of this alteration. This study aimed to compare via histology the VNOs of pigs housed in intensive conditions (n = 38) to those of pigs housed in free-range farming conditions (n = 35). VNO sections were stained in hematoxylin and eosin to assess the presence of nonsensory and sensory epithelium alterations and collagenolysis. The nonsensory epithelium was significantly more inflamed in animals in free-range farming conditions than those in intensive conditions (p < 0.0001) and was more strongly affected by signs of collagenolysis (p < 0.0001). The sensory epithelium seemed to be less altered by the different environmental conditions (p = 0.7267). These results suggest that species-typical pig behaviors, such as digging and rooting for food, could facilitate the presence of microparticles in the oral cavity and their entrance into the vomeronasal canals, leading to changes to the VNO.

AB  - BACKGROUNDTrapping is commonly used as the primary management tool in attempts to reduce invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa), but traditional trapping techniques are often ineffective. However, recently developed traps permit the capture of entire social groups (sounders) of wild pigs, and the strategy of whole-sounder removal may achieve more effective control. Our objective was to experimentally compare traditional control (TC; primarily traditional trapping, but including hunting with dogs, and opportunistic shooting) and whole-sounder removal (WSR) strategies by assessing density reduction and removal rate after 1 and 2 years of treatment. RESULTSAfter 1 year of trapping, average wild pig density on WSR units declined 53% and remained stable after the second year, whereas on TC units, pig density did not differ after trapping, although it declined 33% and remained stable after the second year of trapping. The median removal rate (percentage of uniquely marked pigs present at the beginning of each year that were removed) was 42.5% for WSR units and 0.0% for TC units during 2018 and were 29.6% from WSR units and 5.3% from TC units during 2019. CONCLUSIONSWSR removal was more effective at reducing wild pig density than TC, but factors such as previous exposure of this population to traditional traps and the lack of barriers to recolonization from surrounding areas may have reduced WSR efficacy. WSR can effectively reduce wild pig density to a greater extent than TC, but managers should recognize the additional time and expense necessary for implementation. Published 2023.

AB  - Humans are biased in their preferences for animals, and this may impact the composition of zoological collections. We assessed which kinds of animals the public and zoo professionals want to preserve in zoos for the future and analyzed these lists for previously identified biases and agreement across surveyed groups. We also characterized agreement among the surveyed groups on the roles of zoos and the composition of animal collections. We surveyed people who live in the United States, members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and AZA zoo and aquarium directors. There was agreement among surveyed groups on the roles of zoos, though some differences existed. Zoo professionals and the public generally agreed on the emphasis on various categories of animals for zoo collections, though some differences were noted. We found evidence of bias towards mammals, charismatic megafauna, and felids across all surveyed groups. Agreement was high between AZA members and directors and moderate between zoo professionals and the public. These results indicate that these groups are generally in agreement about the roles of zoos, how they should compose their animal collections, and what animal species, in particular, should be kept in zoos for the future, allowing zoos to compose their collections to maximize delivery on their mission goals as well as address the preferences of the public.

AB  - 1. Plants harbour a wide range of leaf-feeding insects whose survival and fitness are influenced by both energy-rich molecules and phytochemicals in the host foliage. Yet, how leaf host chemical diversity and insect microbiota-key factors in ecological and physiological processes-impact insect nutrition and fitness are still poorly understood.
   2. To study the effects of leaf metabolic composition on insect herbivory resistance and performance, we fed the larvae of the specialist herbivory Tortrix viridana with leaves of susceptible and resistant Quercus robur trees that are characterized by contrasting metabolomes. We analysed the larval performance and mortality, the metabolomes in plant leaves, and in the insects' saliva and faeces by non-targeted metabolomics. Using chemometrics, mass difference network analysis and metabarcoding, we show the metabolome changes and chemical reactions associated with the different diets as well as their impact on insect fitness and gut microbiota.
   3. In the saliva and faeces of larvae, plant secondary metabolites (e.g. flavonoids) persisted more the insect digestion while compounds from primary metabolism were more depleted. In addition, metabolic reactions within the larvae indicated different degradation pathways used on the two plant metabolic types (syn. metabotypes), including sulfation and sulfonation. We show that feeding insects with resistant oak leaves, enriched in secondary metabolites and depleted in primary metabolites, impaired insect performance and mortality. Although the insects' gut microbiota was slightly different upon the contrasting diets, overall, it was fairly stable. Despite the impact of host chemicals on herbivores, larvae were generally highly efficient in nutrient assimilation (feed conversion ratios of 3.3-3.6) and able to minimize plant defences (78% of secondary metabolites were converted, broken down or sequestrated).
   4. The comparison of the oak metabotypes showed how the foliar composition of resistant oaks affected insect fitness by influencing their digestion. Herbivores feeding on resistant oaks were less efficient due to their lower ability to metabolize and detoxify higher levels of host phytochemicals, whereas those on susceptible oaks were more efficient as they could degrade the host metabolome. This study highlights the importance of the oak leaf chemical composition to insect digestion and fitness of a specialized herbivore.

AB  - A reactivity-initiated accident (RIA) is a postulated design basis accident in light water reactors (LWRs) in which a rapid reactivity insertion induces a fission rate increase and a fuel pellet temperature rise. During RIA, the fuel pellet thermally expands and may cause pellet-cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI). Separate effects PCMI tests were performed on C26M FeCrAl cladding tube samples, introducing biaxial stress via a well understood modified burst test (MBT) system. A high-speed camera in the MBT system captured the projections, covering a 360 degrees view of the cladding deformation and enabling a digital image correlation (DIC) method to quantify the surface strains with high fidelity. Representative hot zero-power RIA mechanical loading conditions were applied to the sample, and the test duration ranged from 20 to 500 ms at an average temperature of 573 K. BISON finite element-based fuel performance code modeling was performed against the high-fidelity DIC data produced from the MBTs. Validation calculations were conducted with 2D models and systematically compared with test data of the burst time, burst pressure, burst hoop strains, and hoop strain rates. Based on the behaviors from the separate effects test, BISON calculations satisfactorily predicted the cladding deformation behaviors. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify highly influential mechanical properties responsible for the cladding failure behavior during the MBT experiments. The results highlight the significance of the cladding's mechanical strength in governing cladding strain, followed by the significance of the mechanical interactions between the pellet and the cladding.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon emission is the main cause of carbon loss during composting. This study investigated the effect of bamboo biochar addition to compost on carbon dioxide (CO2) release and fixation through metagenomics sequencing. The results showed that the addition of biochar enriched the relative abundance of ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) gene by 13.22%, improving the diversity of carbon-fixing microbiota. In addition, biochar also inhibited the relative abundances of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (A_KGD) at the late stage of composting, thereby reducing the CO2 release by 16.77%. Bamboo biochar also decreased the abundance of Methyl coenzyme-M reductase (MCR), which in turn reduced methane (CH4) release. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the compost system during the cooling and maturity periods, which dominated the release of CO2 and was positively correlated with PDH, IDH, and A_KGD (p < 0.01). In addition, RubisCO was negatively correlated with organic matter (OM), CO2, CH4 (p < 0.01). Taken together, biochar can inhibit the activity of CO2-releasing microorganisms, thereby reducing carbon loss in composting.

AB  - Herbivory is among the most well -studied biotic interactions, yet most studies do not incorporate effects on both sexual and clonal plant reproduction or the consequences of different amounts of tissue lost, i.e., herbivory severity. We address both of these gaps using a novel extension of an Integral Projection Model of Asclepias syriaca that uses both plant size and herbivory severity as continuous predictors of ramet population growth rate. Herbivory severity was a significant predictor of survival, growth, as well as sexual and clonal reproduction. We saw these effects using both observational data from across seven sites and five years as well as an experimental approach where we removed plant tissue. Increases in all three aspects of herbivory (probability of herbivory, and the mean and the variation among individuals in herbivory severity) led to decreases in population growth. Population growth rate decreased with herbivory largely due to negative effects of herbivory on clonal reproduction. Our approach to IPMs offers a powerful way to understand the individual -level effects of several aspects of herbivory on plant population growth.

AB  - The SWine IMputation (SWIM) haplotype reference panel and web server offer a vast public resource to improve sequence-level imputation and genetic discoveries in pigs.
   Genetic mapping to identify genes and alleles associated with or causing economically important quantitative trait variation in livestock animals such as pigs is a major goal in animal genetic improvement. Despite recent advances in high-throughput genotyping technologies, the resolution of genetic mapping in pigs remains poor due in part to the low density of genotyped variant sites. In this study, we overcame this limitation by developing a reference haplotype panel for pigs based on 2259 whole genome-sequenced animals representing 44 pig breeds. We evaluated software combinations and breed composition to optimize the imputation procedure and achieved an average concordance rate in excess of 96%, a non-reference concordance rate of 88%, and an r(2) of 0.85. We demonstrated in two case studies that genotype imputation using this resource can dramatically improve the resolution of genetic mapping. A public web server has been developed to allow the pig genetics community to fully utilize this resource. We expect this resource to facilitate genetic mapping and accelerate genetic improvement in pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Livestock herding is an essential and time-honored practice in Balochistan, playing a pivotal role in the region's economy, culture, and way of life. The livestock sector is of utmost important in the province, catering to nearly 20% of the national stock. Over centuries, large predators and their prey species, including livestock, have coexisted in these mountainous landscapes. Consequently, large carnivores are more likely to interact with humans due to their extensive home ranges. This research aims to explore the impact of livestock depredation by large predators on livelihoods and conservation efforts in two districts of Balochistan, Pakistan. A human-carnivore conflict survey was conducted from July to September 2019, gathering data from 311 residents in the selected study area. Large predators in the region preyed on a total of 876 livestock over a year, comprising 560 goats, 292 sheep, 19 cows, and 5 donkeys. The gray wolf emerged as the primary predator, accounting for 66.3% of livestock depredation, which was followed by the caracal (24.3%), Asiatic jackal (8.9%), and striped hyena (0.6%). The economic loss totaled USD 78,694. Notably, 80% of respondents held negative perceptions toward wolves compared to 24.4% for caracals. Only 20.6% of respondents were aware of the importance of conserving carnivores. Livestock depredation by carnivores has fostered negative perceptions among locals toward these animals. There exists a lack of awareness regarding the significance of conserving carnivore species and their ecological roles. It is crucial to raise awareness among communities about the ecological importance of predators like the gray wolf, caracal, Asiatic jackal, striped hyena, and Balochistan black bear through community meetings and educational seminars. Furthermore, providing basic education to herders on effective livestock guarding practices is recommended to mitigate human-carnivore conflicts and promote coexistence between wildlife and local communities in Balochistan.Abstract Livestock herding is a vital practice in Balochistan, contributing to the economy and culture. The livestock sector is significant in Balochistan, providing 20% of the national stock. Large predators and their prey species, including livestock, have coexisted in these mountainous landscapes for centuries. The aim of the present research is to investigate the impacts of livestock depredation by large predators on livelihoods and predator conservation in two districts of Balochistan, Pakistan. A human-carnivore conflict survey was conducted from July to September 2019, collecting data from 311 residents in a selected study area. Large predators in the study area preyed on a total of 876 livestock during a one-year period, including 560 goats, 292 sheep, 19 cows, and 5 donkeys. The gray wolf is the leading predator, responsible for 66.3% of livestock depredation, followed by the caracal (24.3%), Asiatic jackal (8.9%), and striped hyena (0.6%). The total economic loss was USD 78,694. Overall, 80% of respondents had a negative perception of wolves compared to 24.4% for caracals. Only 20.6% of respondents knew about the importance of conserving carnivores. Livestock depredation by carnivores in the study area created a negative perception of these animals among people. There is a lack of awareness about the importance of conserving carnivore species and their role in the ecosystem. This lack of understanding has ultimately led to detrimental effects on predator populations.
   It is imperative to raise awareness among people about the ecological significance of carnivores through community meetings, seminars in educational institutions, and providing basic education to herders about effective livestock guarding practices.

AB  - Pig slurry (PS) applications affect soil aggregation and carbon and nitrogen contents in aggregates. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes caused by successive applications of PS and mineral fertilizer on soil aggregation and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in aggregates of a clayey Typic Hapludox cultivated with Cynodon dactylon cv. Tifton-85 in southern Brazil. The treatments consisted of six annual applications of PS (100, 200, 300, and 400 kg N ha(-1)) and urea (200 kg N ha(-1)), and a control with no fertilizer application. Soil samples were collected in March 2019 and evaluated for aggregate stability, through the geometric mean diameter of aggregates (GMD), and GMD sensitivity index (SIGMD), and mass of macro-, meso-, and microaggregates. Total organic carbon and nitrogen contents were determined in macroaggregates and microaggregates. Applications of PS to pasture soils increase dry matter production of Tifton-85 and can increase soil aggregation by increasing the mass of macroaggregates. The highest PS rates decreased aggregate stability, resulting in lower macroaggregate mass, GMD, and SIGMD, and higher microaggregate mass. PS applications to pasture soils can increase C and N contents in macro and microaggregates, and improve soil aggregation when using the rates of 100 or 200 kg N ha(-1), mainly in subsurface layers.

AB  - Antlers are a costly trait that require skeletal reserves to grow to a large size. Thus, insight into variation in antler size requires understanding the connection between antler and body size, which can be summarized through ontogenetic and static scaling relationships. Both types of scaling relationships are also needed to examine the influence of factors besides body mass on antler growth at different ages and whether the effects of these factors diminish with age. Dietary and maternal effects might decline with age as individuals attempt to mitigate size deficits. We examined the potential effects of diet and maternal attributes of dam (mother) age at birth and litter size on body-antler mass relationships throughout ontogeny and at discrete ages. Data on age, maternal characteristics, body mass, and antler mass were gathered from captive, pen-raised White-tailed Deer (n = 168) that consumed either a low-energy (1.77 kcal/g) or standard-energy diet (2.65 kcal/g) from the time they were weaned until they perished by 5.5 years of age. Both types of scaling relationships were estimated with linear mixed-effects models to account for repeated measurements of males, dams, and sires. Diet affected ontogenetic scaling relationships. Males eating the low-energy diet had faster antler growth when young and lighter in body mass than when they were older and heavier-whereas males fed the standard-energy diet had a similar rate of antler growth across the range of body masses. A Bayesian Information Criterion model selection analysis indicated that diet and litter size (singleton, multiple births), but not dam age at birth influenced static scaling relationships. Static scalar coefficients up to 3.5 years of age were positively allometric (>1.0), but isometric (1.0) in 4.5- and 5.5-year-old males. Furthermore, diet and litter size influenced both intercepts and slopes in only the youngest males (1.5 years) indicating that dietary and maternal effects can diminish with age. Body-antler mass relationships are complex. Young males that are small because of maternal effects, for example, might still be able to mitigate smaller body and antler sizes at older ages.

AB  - Context Dama wallabies (Notamacropus eugenii) were introduced into the Bay of Plenty Region, New Zealand, in the early 1900s. They subsequently became an invasive pest, damaging pasture, silviculture, and native vegetation. One key management strategy is the eradication of isolated populations. Aims First, we empirically determined the detection probabilities of detection dogs and handlers searching for faecal pellet groups of dama wallaby in pasture and forested habitats. Second, we used detection probabilities to derive surveillance system sensitivity (SSe) and estimate the cost per hectare required to have a high confidence (95%) that a targeted wallaby population has been eradicated. Methods We collected and deployed faecal pellet groups in an area with no naturally occurring wallabies. Following faecal pellet surveys by detection dogs and handlers, we estimated the probability of a dog-handler team detecting a pellet group and derived SSe. We derived SSe for a single faecal pellet group and, using simulation, upscaled this estimate to multiple pellet groups voided by a single surviving individual. Key results The detection probability of dogs searching for a single faecal pellet group that was within the detection swathe was relatively high (minimum of 45%). Scaling this instantaneous probability of detection for a single pellet group to the multiple pellet groups voided by a single wallaby around its home range resulted in 30-33-fold increases in SSe compared to the sensitivity of searching for a single faecal pellet group. The costs of surveillance for confirming eradication using detection dogs and handlers are NZ$54-NZ$72 for a 100-ha area. Conclusions Detection dogs and handlers are an efficacious and cost-effective surveillance method for confirming eradication of dama wallaby in open and forested habitats. Implications Detection dogs and handlers are an important surveillance tool for the management of wallabies in New Zealand. The data from this study enable managers to determine the required surveillance effort to have high confidence (e.g. 0.95) that a wallaby population has been eradicated, or that a suspected new population is actually absent if no wallabies are detected. Additionally, it enables per hectare costs of surveillance to be estimated and compared to alternative methods.

AB  - Ranitidine is widely concerned due to it is mainly related to the transformation into highly toxic carcinogenic products and non-readily biodegradable characteristics in aquatic environment. In this study, biodegradation of ranitidine during rural human feces (HF) aerobic composting was investigated. Results show that both levels of ranitidine are quickly removed in the first-3-day composting. The microorganisms play a vital role in the ranitidine degradation, especially for Firmicutes at the thermophilic period. The effect of ranitidine on the aerobic composting was further analyzed under the normal content (10 mg/kg) and high content (100 mg/kg). The 10 mg/kg ranitidine quickens temperature rise and organic matter degradation of the composting, while the 100 mg/kg ranitidine produces inhibiting effects. However, the effects only occur in the early stage of composting, and then tend to disappear with the removal of ranitidine. Fluorescence spectra confirm that humification and aromatization of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) in the substrates are fastened in 10 mg/kg group, while delayed in 100 mg/kg group. Metagenomic analysis reveals that relative abundances of Firmicutes and sequences related to carbohydrates metabolism increase in the groups mixed with the ranitidine at the early period. The

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii (TG) is a protozoan tissue cyst forming parasite, with the potential to infect all warm-blooded animals including humans. Its importance in behaviour manipulation has been studied extensively in rodent models. There is however limited literature of TG effects on behaviour in other species. TG readily disseminates and forms cysts in muscle and neural tissue of sheep, and Australia's estimated national prevalence of TG in lambs and sheep sits at 16% and 32%, respectively, posing a potential risk to human health, and food safety. Further, an outbreak of TG may result in large economic impacts on the Australian sheep industry. This study had two aims: To identify seroprevalence of TG within a commercial sheep flock in Southern New South Wales, Australia and to investigate the relationship between TG infection and sheep behaviour. Fifty crossbred ewes of varying ages were selected at random from a flock of non pregnant ewes. Blood samples from each sheep were tested for presence of TG antibodies using a modified agglutination test. Each sheep was subjected individually to spatial maze and a novel object/unfamiliar human approach tests over a five-week period. Modified aggluti-nation testing revealed prevalence of antibodies in 24% of the tested sheep, with titre levels between 1/16-1/ 256. TG positive sheep were slower to solve a spatial maze than test negative sheep in the first week of testing. A significant decline in the number of "errors' made while solving the maze in subsequent trials indicated that sheep readily learnt to solve the maze. Sheep showed more avoidance of a human than a novel object or dog bark, but avoidance was not related to TG infection. In conclusion, this study provided evidence of a relationship between TG infection and problem-solving behaviour in sheep. Fear response appear to be unrelated to effects of infection. Studies such as these allow us to observe how TG effects incidental hosts and if a variation in behaviour changes occurs between species.

AB  - Insect colouration mediated by melanization can assist in dealing with environmental temperatures. However, melanin synthesis can be costly and depends on the ability of insects to acquire enough energy and nutrients from their diets. Due to the increased plant C:N ratio associated with elevated CO2 concentrations, insect herbivores' melanization could be limited by the amount of nitrogen they acquire from their host plants. To investigate how diet C:N impacts the potential colour response to temperature, we used Manduca sexta caterpillars reared at different combinations of temperatures and diet C:N ratios, and measured pupal mass and development time (performance metrics) and colour morphology. The high-temperature treatment (27 degrees C) had a positive impact on larval performance, whereas a nitrogen-poor diet was related to lower performance. Using a fitness metric that considers both pupal mass and development time, we found a positive effect of both high temperature and nitrogen-rich diet treatments on larval fitness. We found that diet and temperature affected the colouration of larvae, in which larvae reared at the low-temperature treatment (18 degrees C) and fed a nitrogen-rich diet were darker than their counterparts. Our results provide experimental evidence of the impact of diet on melanization and suggest that CO2-related changes in plant quality could be associated with changes in insect herbivore performance and colouration.

AB  - Bats exhibit a variety of life-history traits that can serve as valuable surrogate metrics of terrestrial ecosystem health. Here, we investigate how sonotype activity of hipposiderid bats covaries with habitat structure at finer spatial scales. We recorded passive echolocation calls and measured key habitat attributes in six rainforests in the Lomami and Yangambi landscapes, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Using bat passes as a measure of sonotype activity, we clustered echolocation calls based on call structure similarity to control for within-sonotype variation in activity. Over 432 h of recording, we detected 370 passes matching a hipposiderid sonotype in three subgroups, recovering eight potential species. Open habitats negatively affected sonotype activity in the Hipposideros subgroup, which was associated with higher echolocation frequencies. Indeed, activity peaked in the early evening when mean post-sunset temperature was above the nocturnal average and declined until early morning when mean temperatures dropped below the nightly average. All habitat variables were marginally correlated with the activity of the Doryrhina subgroup, whereas Macronycteris was more active in open habitats. Our findings indicate a probable flexibility of habitat use in lower echolocating bats and point to three possible foraging guilds that modulate hipposiderid bat responses to habitat structure.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient element that commonly acted as a feed additive and antimicrobial in agricultural production. Tribasic copper chloride (TBCC) is a relatively new dietary Cu source, and its exposure directly or indirectly affects the safety of animals and ecological environment, thus posing a potential risk to human health. Cu overexposure would produce toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may have toxic effects on the host, but the mechanism of neurotoxicity remains unclear. Herein, to explore the effects of long-term TBCC-induced neurotoxicity, 150 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated and treated with different doses of TBCC, and the cortical and hippocampus tissues were harvested at 0, 6, and 12 weeks after treatment. Morris Water Maze (MWM) test showed that excessive intake of TBCC could induce cognitive dysfunction in rats. Moreover, after treatment with 160 mg/kg Cu (276 mg/kg TBCC) for 12 weeks, pathological changes were observed in the cortex and hippocampus, and the number of Nissl bodies decreased significantly in the hippocampus. Additionally, mitochondrial structure was significantly altered and neuronal mitochondrial fusion/fission equilibrium was disrupted in 80 mg/kg and 160 mg/kg Cu groups at 12 weeks. With an increase in TBCC dose and treatment time, the number of mitophagosomes and the expression of mitophagy-related genes were significantly decreased after initially increasing. Furthermore, metformin (Met) and 3-methyladenine (3 MA) were used to regulate the level of mitophagy to further explore the mechanism of Cu-induced nerve cell injury in vitro., and it found that mitophagy activator (Met) would increase mitochondrial fission, while mitophagy inhibitors (3-MA) would aggravate mitochondrial metabolic disorders by promoting mitochondrial fusion and inhibiting mitochondrial division. These results indicate that long-term oral TBCC could impede cognitive function and disrupts mitochondrial metabolism by inhibiting mitophagy, providing an insightful perspective on the neurotoxicity of dietary TBCC.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau is generally considered to be a significantly clean area owing to its high altitude; however, the transport of atmospheric pollutants from the Indian subcontinent to the Tibetan Plateau has influenced the Tibetan environments. Nyingchi is located at the end of an important water vapor channel. In this study, continuous monitoring of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), and particle-bound mercury (PBM) was conducted in Nyingchi from 30 March to 3 September 2019, to study the influence of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) on the origin, transport, and behavior of Hg. The GEM and PBM during the preceding Indian summer monsoon (PISM) period (1.20 +/- 0.35 ng m(-3) and 11.4 +/- 4.8 pg m(-3) for GEM and PBM, respectively) were significantly higher than those during the ISM period (0.95 +/- 0.21 ng m(-3), and 8.8 +/- 6.0 pg m(-3)); the GOM during the PISM period (13.5 +/- 7.3 pg m(-3)) was almost at the same level as that during the ISM period (12.7 +/- 14.3 pg m(-3)). The average GEM concentration in the Nyingchi region, obtained using passive sampler, was 1.12 +/- 0.28 ng m(-3) (from 4 April 2019 to 31 March 2020). The GEM concentration showed that the sampling area was very clean compared to other high-altitude sites. The GEM has several patterns of diurnal variation during different periods. Stable high GEM concentrations occur at night and low concentrations occur in the afternoon during PISM, which may be related to the nocturnal boundary layer structure. High values occurring in the late afternoon during the ISM may be related to long-range transport. Low concentrations of GEM observed during the morning in the ISM may originate from vegetation effects. The results of the trajectory model demonstrate that the sources of pollutants at Nyingchi are different with different circulation patterns. During westerly circulation in the PISM period, pollutants mainly originate from central India, northeastern India, and central Tibet. During the ISM period, the pollutants mainly originate from the southern part of the SET site. The strong precipitation and vegetation effects on Hg species during the ISM resulted in low Hg concentrations transmitted to Nyingchi during this period. Further, principal component analysis showed that long-distance transport, local emissions, meteorological factors, and snowmelt factors are the main factors affecting the local Hg concentration in Nyingchi. Long-distance transport factor dominates during PISM and ISM3, while local emissions is the major contributor between PISM and ISM3. Our results reveal the Hg species distribution and possible sources of the most important water vapor channel in the Tibetan Plateau and could serve as a basis for further transboundary transport flux calculations.

AB  - The performance of plants in any one generation can be influenced not just by the prevailing biotic and abiotic factors, but also by those factors experienced by the parental generation. These maternal effects have been recorded in an array of plant species, but most studies tend to focus on abiotic factors over two generations. Here we show that maternal effects in the annual forb Senecio vulgaris may be influenced by beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and insect herbivory over four successive generations. These effects were very much determined by seed provisioning, wherein C:N:P ratios were altered by both fungi and aphids. There was little evidence of epigenetic changes induced by the fungi or insects, instead the driving forces seemed to be allocation of N and P to the seeds. However, changes in seed chemistry were not cumulative over generations, often decreases in seed nutrient content were followed by recovery in subsequent generations. The changes in seed stoichiometry can have important consequences for viability, germination and subsequent seedling growth rates. We conclude that studies of maternal effects need to be conducted over multiple generations, and also need to be multifactorial, involving variation in abiotic factors such as water and nutrients, combined with biotic factors.

AB  - Migrations, dispersal, and the conditions and sequence of speciation in righteye flounders of the subfamily Hippoglossoidinae are analyzed using the method of historical biogeography. It is shown that the morpho-ecological evolution of the group was directed by adaptation to progressive climate cooling and that the species divergence occurred during the isolation of the Arctic Basin and the Sea of Japan in the Plio-Pleistocene. As a result of the analysis of the origin and dispersal of righteye flounders, the validity of the species Hippoglossoides robustus and H. herzensteini is recognized, as well as the division of the genus Hippoglossoides into the subgenera Hippoglossoides and Cleisthenes.

AB  - Long-term monitoring (2015-2019) was carried out on artificial salt licks (a total of 19 in 3 districts). The total monitoring time was 7123 camera trap days. Depending on the place and year of monitoring, from 5 to 33 different individuals were recorded on each salt lick. Six sex and age groups were identified: adult males, yearling males, adult single females, yearling female, adult females with calves, adult females with yearling individuals. All duration data by sex and age groups including "passing" visits have the form of an exponential distribution (lambda = 0.029 +/- 0.001 min(-1)). The data of the duration of gcophagous visits have the form of a gamma distribution (kappa = 1.76 +/- 0.087; theta = 21.20 +/- 1.501 min). European Moose visit salt licks all year round, most actively in May-August. The average duration of a visit is close to half an hour for each of the identified groups (33.7 +/- 1.3 min for all groups; clear time of geophagous visit is 33.2 +/- 2.8 min). The duration of salt licking and the mineral lick attendance differs between some identified sex-age groups and months. During the days of salt licking, the same individual most often visits the lick several times (1 to 5 visits a day (max 11), on average 1.48 +/- 0.39). The activity of visiting salt licks during the day has a pronounced tendency to acquire peak values in the twilight post-sunset and pre-dawn periods. The moose use a third of the month (34.9% +/- 20.8% of month) for salt licking, alternating this with varioustime periods break. Age and sex competition for the use of salt licks was noted.

AB  - In assessments of skeletal variation, allometry (disproportionate change of shape with size) is often corrected to examine size-independent variation for hypotheses relating to function. However, size-related trade-offs in functional demands may themselves be an underestimated driver of mammalian cranial diversity. Here, we use geometric morphometrics alongside dental measurements to assess craniodental allometry in the rock-wallaby genus Petrogale (all 17 species, 370 individuals). We identified functional aspects of evolutionary allometry that can be both extensions of, and correlated negatively with, static or ontogenetic allometric patterns. Regarding constraints, larger species tended to have relatively smaller braincases and more posterior orbits, the former of which might represent a constraint on jaw muscle anatomy. However, they also tended to have more anterior dentition and smaller posterior zygomatic arches, both of which support the hypothesis of relaxed bite force demands and accommodation of different selective pressures that favour facial elongation. By contrast, two dwarf species had stouter crania with divergent dental adaptations that together suggest increased relative bite force capacity. This likely allows them to feed on forage that is mechanically similar to that consumed by larger relatives. Our results highlight a need for nuanced considerations of allometric patterns in future research of mammalian cranial diversity.

AB  - Insect herbivores require a variety of habitats across their life cycle, with behavior often mediating transitions between life stages or habitats. Human management strongly alters urban habitats, yet herbivore behavior is rarely examined in cities. We review the existing literature on several key behaviors: host finding, feeding, egg placement and pupation location, and antipredator defense. We emphasize that unapparent portions of the life cycle, such as the habitat of the overwintering stage, may influence if urbanized areas act as population sources or sinks. Here, management of the soil surface and aboveground biomass are two areas with especially pressing research gaps. Lastly, high variability in urban environments may select for more plastic behaviors or greater generalism. We encourage future research that assesses both behavior and less apparent portions of insect life cycles to determine best practices for conservation and management.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary fiber (DF) levels and copper concentrations on the production performance and cecal microbial diversity of finishing pigs. A 2 x 2 factorial experimental design was used, with different levels of dietary fiber (low [23% DF]: L and high [30% DF]: H) and copper concentrations (normal [25 mg/kg]: N and supplemented [45 mg/kg]: S) resulting in four diets (LN, LS, HN, and HS). Forty-eight hybrid barrows (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire), with an initial body weight of 76 kg +/- 1.5 kg, were randomly assigned to four groups: LN, LS, HN, and HS, with 12 replicates per group and one pig per replicate. There was a 7-day adaptation period followed by a 56-day feeding trial, after which all pigs were slaughtered for sampling. Results indicated that in finishing pigs, the low dietary fiber group exhibited a higher final weight, a higher average daily gain, and a lower feed-to-gain ratio compared to the high fiber group (p < 0.05). The LS group showed higher digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, crude fiber, ash, neutral detergent fiber, and DF than the HN and HS groups (p < 0.05). Blood total protein levels were higher in the high fiber group, whereas blood Cu levels were higher in the supplemented copper group (p < 0.05). High dietary fiber increased the activities of colonic carboxymethylcellulase and beta-glucanase (p < 0.05). Concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, and total volatile fatty acids were elevated in the high fiber group (p < 0.05). Microbial alpha-diversity indices (observed species, Chao 1, and Shannon indices) increased with fiber but decreased with copper supplementation (p < 0.05). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio increased with fiber levels, with a higher relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the LS group. In conclusion, appropriate copper supplementation in diets can mitigate the negative effects of high fiber levels on finishing pig production performance by enhancing nutrient digestibility, fiber-degrading enzyme activity, regulating the microbial community, and its metabolic products.

AB  - The extinction and the persistence of the population of the harmful sheep blowfly (Lucilia cuprina) are discussed in this paper through a stochastic mathematical model. Using appropriate Lyapunov functionals, the extinction of these flies depends on the time to oviposition and the time between generations. The oviposition period must be sufficiently short. Another species of blowfly, called Lucilia sericata, also attacks sheep in many areas. Both blowflies are ectoparasites of warm-blooded vertebrates, particularly domestic sheep. These two blowflies are related to sharing the same mitochondrial DNA sequences, although the two species are distinct. A sufficiently small egg-laying delay then leads to the rapid extinction of both blowfly populations.

AB  - The shortage of high-quality coarse feed resources is the main factor that restricts the development of animal husbandry in many developing countries. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of replacing corn silage with daylily silage on the growth performance, slaughter performance, blood biochemical indicators, meat quality, and muscle amino acid composition of Tan sheep. A total of 72 healthy Tan sheep were randomly assigned to four groups. In each group, 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% of corn silage were replaced with daylily silage (denoted as CON, HC20, HC40, and HC60, respectively). Tan sheep fed with daylily silage showed no significant adverse effects on their growth performance, meat quality, and muscle amino acid composition (p > 0.05). Some increase was observed in the carcass fat content value (GR-value, p < 0.05), thickness of backfat (p < 0.05), and the blood urea level (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that the utilization of daylily silage instead of whole-plant corn silage has no adverse effects on the growth performance and meat quality of Tan sheep, thus indicating that it can partially replace whole-plant corn feed as a feed resource for Tan sheep.

AB  - Transport of extended boar semen doses is a common practice in the swine industry. This study aimed to verify the effect of agitation time on sperm parameters during storage in two semen extenders. One normospermic ejaculate from each boar (n = 20) was diluted in a split sample design with long-term (LONG, Androstar (R) Plus) and short-term (SHORT, Beltsville Thawing Solution) extenders. Extended semen doses were filled with a total volume of 45 mL and 1.5 billion sperm cells and submitted to 0, 3, 6, and 12 h of agitation in an orbital shaker at 70 rpm. The samples were stored at 17 degrees C for 120 h. Sperm parameters were evaluated for sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, pH, thermo-resistance test (TRT), oxidative stress status, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Total and progressive motility were affected by the interaction between the agitation time and the extender, with a linear reduction in sperm motility as the agitation time increased for LONG extender (P <= 0.05). Semen doses diluted with SHORT showed a higher pH (P < 0.01), and agitation time had a positive quadratic effect with the highest pH observed after 6 h of agitation, regardless of the extender used (P < 0.01). Sperm motility after TRT and plasma membrane integrity potential were not affected by agitation time (P > 0.05). Mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative stress status quadratically decreased as agitation time increased (P <= 0.05). Based on the results, long transport durations of AI doses under mild vibration emissions affect boar semen quality.

AB  - Simple Summary This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with Bacillus licheniformis and a combination of probiotics and enzymes on the growth and blood parameters of grazing yak calves. The body weight, body size, serum biochemical parameters, and growth hormone levels of grazing yaks were assessed. We found that supplementation with probiotics alone or with a combination of probiotics and enzymes significantly increased the average daily gain, compared to the controls, and the combination of probiotics and enzymes showed a better performance. Supplementation with the complex of probiotics and enzymes significantly increased the concentration of serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1, and epidermal growth factor, which may be the main reason for the higher daily weight gain. The findings of this study may help improve the growth efficiency of yak calves on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Early weaning is an effective strategy to improve cow feed utilization and shorten postpartum intervals in cows; however, this may lead to poor performance of the weaned calves. This study was conducted to test the effects of supplementing milk replacer with Bacillus licheniformis and a complex of probiotics and enzyme preparations on body weight (BW), size, and serum biochemical parameters and hormones in early-weaned grazing yak calves. Thirty two-month-old male grazing yaks (38.89 +/- 1.45 kg body weight) were fed milk replacer at 3% of their BW and were randomly assigned to three treatments (n = 10, each): T1 (supplementation with 0.15 g/kg Bacillus licheniformis), T2 (supplementation with a 2.4 g/kg combination of probiotics and enzymes), and a control (without supplementation). Compared to the controls, the average daily gain (ADG) from 0 to 60 d was significantly higher in calves administered the T1 and T2 treatments, and that from 30 to 60 d was significantly higher in calves administered the T2 treatment. The ADG from 0 to 60 d was significantly higher in the T2- than in the T1-treated yaks. The concentration of serum growth hormone, insulin growth factor-1, and epidermal growth factor was significantly higher in the T2-treated calves than in the controls. The concentration of serum cortisol was significantly lower in the T1 treatment than in the controls. We concluded that supplementation with probiotics alone or a combination of probiotics and enzymes can improve the ADG of early-weaned grazing yak calves. Supplementation with the combination of probiotics and enzymes had a stronger positive effect on growth and serum hormone levels, compared to the single-probiotic treatment with Bacillus licheniformis, providing a basis for the application of a combination of probiotics and enzymes.

AB  - Background and Aims Nitrogen (N-2) fixation through endophytic diazotrophs within the non-nodulated plants has been considered a novel source of N inputs in terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about the composition and diversity of endophytic diazotrophs within the non-nodulated plants, especially when compared with the diazotrophs in nodulated plants.
   Methods High-throughput nifH amplification sequencing was conducted to characterize endophytic diazotrophs within different tissues (leaf, stem, and root) of non-nodulated plants (Salix rehderiana Schneid, S. ernestii Schneid, and Populus purdomii Rehd.) and nodulated plants (Astragalus mahoshanicus and Hippophae rhamnoides L.) which dominate in the newly formed N-limited glacier floodplain in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
   Results We found endophytic diazotrophs, primarily Proteobacteria, in all tissue types of non-nodulated plants and leaf and stem of nodulated plants. The dominant genera were Bradyrhizobium, Ideonella, Azotobacter, and Geobacter. In comparison, diazotrophs within the nodule of leguminous Astragalus mahoshanicus and actinorhizal Hippophae rhamnoides were predominantly of genera Rhizobium and Frankia, respectively. Further, the community composition of diazotrophs was structured by plant species (P=0.001), tissue types (P=0.001), and nutrient concentrations (P =0.001). Leaves of non-nodulated plants exhibited higher Chao1 indices and lower Simpson and Shannon indices than their stem and root, but these were not significantly different among different tissue types of nodulated plants.
   Conclusions Endophytic diazotrophs might be prevalent in pioneer plants occurring in the N-limited habitat and have a high degree of host specificity; these findings could help to understand the ability of those pioneer plants to acquire N.

AB  - Wild boars in Asia heavily depend on bamboo shoots, a high-protein springtime food source, although the timing of shoot emergence varies by bamboo species, and some species have a limited availability window. This study observed wild boar feeding behavior on three major Japanese bamboo species to elucidate their specific patterns. The number of feeding signs increased in the order of Phyllostachys edulis, P. nigra var. henonis, and P. bambusoides, according to the shoot emergence phenology of each species. A common feature in the three species was that the cumulative relative frequency of feeding signs exceeded 50% before the temperature reached the thermosensitive limit temperature of each species, which is a suitable criterion for shoot emergence. Bamboo shoots that survived feeding by wild boars accounted for only 3% of most of the bamboo shoots produced in a year. Moreover, annual differences were detected in the feeding risk by wild boars of P. nigra var. henonis and P. bambusoides. Abandoned bamboo forest areas continue to increase in size and provide food resources for wild boars. This study indicates the importance of understanding bamboo forests at the species level and proper management of these forests.

AB  - Large mammals have been colonising urban areas throughout the world. This process is often accompanied by genetic and behavioural changes, and as a result, urban populations may form distinct entities within continuous range of the species. In this paper, we present the results of an analysis of the spatial distribution of genetic variation in urban/suburban populations of wild boars Sus scrofa. We used a genetic variation of 12 microsatellite markers to analyse the population structure of wild boars inhabiting a large city (Krakow, Poland) and its rural surroundings. We discovered a profound differentiation between urban and rural areas, with urban individuals forming a distinct genetic group within an otherwise more continuous range of the species. The genetic distinctiveness of the urban wild boar population seems to be maintained not only by physical barriers but plausibly by behavioural differences. Although the chronology of the highway bypass construction may partly explain some of the genetic relatedness between wild boar populations, our results suggest attitudes towards humans may be an important factor influencing immigration to the areas of increased human presence. We discuss possible implications for the management of the wild boar in the city.

AB  - Horns, antlers, and other bony cranial appendages of even-toed hoofed mammals (ruminant artiodactyls) challenge traditional morphological homology assessments. Cranial appendages all share a permanent bone portion with family-specific integument coverings, but homology determination depends on whether the integument covering is an essential component or a secondary elaboration of each structure. To enhance morphological homology assessments, we tested whether juvenile cattle horn bud transcriptomes share homologous gene expression patterns with deer antlers relative to pig outgroup tissues, treating the integument covering as a secondary elaboration. We uncovered differentially expressed genes that support horn and antler homology, potentially distinguish them from non-cranial-appendage bone and other tissues, and highlight the importance of phylogenetic outgroups in homology assessments. Furthermore, we found differentially expressed genes that could support a shared cranial neural crest origin for horns and antlers and expression patterns that refine our understanding of the timing of horn and antler differentiation.
   An RNA sequencing study comparing juvenile cattle horn buds to growing deer antler tissues finds gene expression patterns that support homology of horns and antlers relative to a cranial-appendage-lacking outgroup.

AB  - Estimations of the trophic position and the food web nitrogen baseline from compound-specific isotope analysis of individual amino acids (CSIA-AA) are challenged when the diet of consumer organisms relies on different proportions of vascular and non-vascular primary producers. Here we propose a method to infer such proportions using mixing models and the delta 15N CSIA-AA values from marine herbivores. Combining published and new data, we first characterized CSIA-AA values in phytoplankton, macroalgae and vascular plants, and determined their characteristic beta values (i.e. the isotopic difference between trophic and source AA). Then, we applied MixSIAR Bayesian isotope mixing models to investigate the transfer of these isotopic signals to marine herbivores (molluscs, green turtles, zooplankton and fish), and their utility to quantify autotrophic sources. We demonstrated that primary producer groups have distinct delta 15NAA fingerprints that can be tracked into their primary consumers, thus offering a rapid solution to quantify resource utilization and estimate beta mix values in mixed-sourced environments.

AB  - Understanding terrestrial ecosystems and their response to anthropogenic climate change requires quantification of land-atmosphere carbon exchange. However, top-down and bottom-up estimates of large-scale land-atmosphere fluxes, including the northern extratropical growing season net flux (GSNF), show significant discrepancies. We developed a data-driven metric for the GSNF using atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration observations collected during the High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research Pole-to-Pole Observations and Atmospheric Tomography Mission flight campaigns. This aircraft-derived metric is bias-corrected using three independent atmospheric inversion systems. We estimate the northern extratropical GSNF to be 5.7 +/- 0.3 Pg C and use it to evaluate net biosphere productivity from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 and 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6) models. While the model-to-model spread in the GSNF has decreased in the CMIP6 models relative to that of the CMIP5 models, there is still disagreement on the magnitude and timing of seasonal carbon uptake with most models underestimating the GSNF and overestimating the length of the growing season relative to the observations. We also use an emergent constraint approach to estimate annual northern extratropical gross primary productivity to be 56 +/- 17 Pg C, heterotrophic respiration to be 25 +/- 13 Pg C, and net primary productivity to be 28 +/- 12 Pg C. The flux inferred from these aircraft observations provides an additional constraint on large-scale gross fluxes in prognostic Earth system models that may ultimately improve our ability to accurately predict carbon-climate feedbacks.
   Plain Language Summary The exchange of carbon between the land and atmosphere is an important part of the Earth's climate, and this exchange might change due to human-caused climate change. However, estimates of land-atmosphere carbon fluxes made using different techniques do not agree with each other. We use atmospheric carbon dioxide observations collected during two flight campaigns to show that 5.7 Pg C is exchanged between the atmosphere and the land in the northern hemisphere during the summer growing season. This estimate is used to evaluate the performance of two generations of climate prediction models. The newer generation of models show less spread than the older generation, but there is still significant disagreement on the magnitude and timing of land-atmosphere carbon exchange among models. Most models underestimate the growing season net flux and overestimate the length of the growing season. We also use our observational estimate to reduce the spread on component fluxes of carbon exchange, namely uptake by photosynthesis and release by respiration.

AB  - The clarification of the suppressive effect of biogas slurries (BSs) on soil-borne plant pathogens is needed for their large-scale use as a biocontrol tool in potting soil in order to understand the mechanisms of suppression. In this study, pig manure biogas slurry (PS) and vinasse biogas slurry (VS) were used to conduct assays of pathogen mycelial growth suppression and pot experiment to evaluate their effects on the growth of Fusarium. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (FOC) mycelia and cucumber fusarium wilt. The microbial communities of the PS and VS were deeply analyzed to explore the key taxa and potential mechanisms. Results showed that the PS and VS have similar suppression on FOC mycelia and on the control efficiency, while they were significantly weakened when the PS and VS were used after sterilization. The microbial parameters of the two BSs were obviously different, and functional microbial taxa for disease resistance were observed in the two BSs. Spearman correlation showed that genera of the Pseudomonas, Ochrobactrum, Papiliotrema, etc., were the suppression-related taxa in the PS, while Leucobacter, unclassified_Microbacteriaceae, etc. in the VS. Overall, various key taxa in the PS and VS produced similar suppression on cucumber fusarium wilt.

AB  - Accumulation of excessive molybdenum (Mo) and cadmium (Cd) in the environment poses detrimental effects on organisms. The precise mechanisms of hepatotoxicity that are involved with mitochondria, resulting from the coexposure to Mo and Cd, remain poorly understood and elusive. To fill the gap, a total of 24 sheep were stratified into two groups: control group and Mo + Cd group (45 mg Mo & sdot;kg-1 & sdot;B.W. and 1 mg Cd & sdot;kg-1 & sdot;B.W.). Results showed that exposure to Mo and Cd adversely co-induced the liver function related biochemical marker alterations in serum, histopathological abnormalities, mitochondrial ultrastructure damage and oxidative stress in the livers of sheep. Sequencing results from isolated mitochondria indicated that a total of approximately 4788 mitochondrialocalized proteins were identified, of which 360 exhibited significant differential expression. GO and KEGG database analysis demonstrated excessive Mo and Cd primarily induced hepatotoxicity by affecting mitochondria-mediated oxidation-reduction processes, single-organism metabolic processes, and enhancing the TNF signaling pathway. Mo and Cd co-exposure increased the levels of mitophagy- and necroptosis- related factors regulated by PGAM5 in the livers. Consistently, our findings highlight the co-exposure of Mo and Cd induced necroptosis triggered by PGAM5-mediated mitophagy, which offers valuable insights into the toxico- logical mechanisms underlying the combined effects of Mo and Cd.

AB  - The Bronze Age-Iron Age transition in Central Asia (ca. 800 BCE) was a period of significant cultural change that was heavily influenced by greater population interaction and mobility. Indeed, scholars have increasingly emphasized the role that "food globalization in prehistory" has played in defining this period. In the mountain foothills of Kazakhstan, culinary traditions from across Eurasia were combined through the use of Southwest Asian wheat, barley, and livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) with East Asian foxtail and broomcorn millets. The development of food cultures during this period has been investigated by archaeobotanical and isotopic analysis, yet lipid residues from pottery, which directly represent culinary practices, have not been adequately examined. In this study, lipid residue analysis was conducted on 72 pottery sherds, excavated from three burial mounds and one non-burial, ritual site located in Kazakhstan, dating to ca. 700-200 BCE. A particularly informative observation was the frequency of miliacin, a biomarker of broomcorn millet, detected in residues that corresponded well with previously published regional differences observed in carbon isotope ratios of human remains that indicate the consumption of C-4 plants. This study also demonstrates continuity of Bronze Age dairying traditions into the Iron Age. Finally, this study sheds new light on the diversity of food cultures and mortuary practices in this region, which were not uniform across either space or time.

AB  - To help understand the bioaccumulation of Cd and Tl in beaver tissue, we examined the enrichment of these metals in vegetation available to the animals. Bark was collected from 40 species of trees and shrubs, along with a complete soil weathering profile, within a small watershed devoid of trace metal contamination. Weathering resulted in a 5x enrichment of Cd in the soils relative to the underlying sediments, and a 6x Tl depletion: while Cd was lost from calcite and accumulates in the organic matter and oxyhydroxide fractions, Tl occurred only in the residual fraction. Soil processes alone, however, cannot explain the anomalous concentrations and enrichments of Cd in willow and poplar which contain up to 8.5 mg/kg Cd. The concentrations of Cd and Tl in the dissolved fraction (<0.45 mu m) of the Wye River are similar (1.2 +/- 0.4 and 1.6 +/- 0.1 ng/L, respectively), and are taken to estimate their bioavailability in soil solutions. Normalizing the Cd/metal ratios in bark to the corresponding ratios in water yields the Stream Enrichment Factor: this novel approach shows that all plant species are enriched in Cd relative to Ni; 33 relative to Cu, 13 relative to Zn, and 7 relative to Mn. Thus, many plants preferentially accumulate Cd, especially willow and poplar, over these essential micronutrients. Clearly, the enrichment of Cd over Tl in bark is not a reflection of differences in bioavailability, but rather on the preferential uptake of Cd by the plants. The profound natural bioaccumulation of Cd in the bark of willow and poplar, the two favourite foods of the beaver, has ramifications for the use of these aquatic mammals as biomonitors of environmental contamination, as well as for the direct and indirect consumption of bark for traditional food and medicine.

AB  - Endophytic fungi are extensive in plant tissues and involved in the defense against stress from harmful microbes. The interaction between pedicel endophytic fungi and nectar yeasts is critical for maintaining nectar homeostasis. This study used Camellia reticulata as the research subject. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the community composition of endophytic fungi in the pedicel is dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Their abundance varies at different taxonomic levels, showing sample variability. In total, 27 endophytic fungal isolates were isolated and screened from the pedicel under laboratory conditions. They exhibited antagonistic effects against three nectar yeasts (Metschnikowia reukaufii, Cryptococcus laurentii, and Rhodotorula glutinis) and displayed morphological and physiological diversity. The isolates were classified into the phylum Ascomycota and further categorized into the genera Alternaria, Trichoderma, Fusarium, and Dactylaria. The endophytic fungus D23, which effectively antagonizes nectar yeasts, was identified as Alternaria alternata. This fungus produces various secondary metabolites, including antibiotics such as penicillin G, grandiomycin, and cephalosporin C. The metabolic pathways involved include the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites, phenylpropanoids, amino acids, nucleotides, and antibiotics. The endophytic fungal community in C. reticulata pedicel is rich and diverse, making it a valuable material for screening antagonistic strains. This study provides a theoretical basis for the antagonistic effects of endophytic fungal metabolites from the pedicel of C. reticulata against nectar yeasts, highlighting their significance in maintaining nectar stability and reproductive fitness in cross-pollinated plants.

AB  - Early life events affect the morphology, physiology and quality of individuals, determine their behaviour and personality and influence their response to seasonal changes in daylength. We hypothesized that differences in early life events shape the variability of foraging behaviour and predicted that individuals born early in the breeding season are active and risk prone to ensure current reproductive success, whereas late-born individuals are risk averse to increase their chance of reproducing in the future. To investigate whether time of birth during the year shapes animal behaviour, we used the Siberian hamster, Phodopus sungorus, which is a highly seasonal and polymorphic species. Polymorphism of winter phenotype is observed when individuals from one population respond to a shortening photo-period in different ways. Some individuals change phenotype for winter (responding individuals), while others maintain the summer phenotype throughout the year (nonresponding individuals). We hypoth-esized that polymorphism of winter phenotype and interindividual differences in foraging behaviour are interrelated. Since the responding phenotype is considered to use an energy-conserving strategy, we predicted that shy, less efficient foragers should be more prone to develop the responding phenotype than bold, better foragers. We measured locomotor activity, boldness, giving-up density and food intake in 200 Siberian hamsters born in the first or third litter in a season and postnatally acclimated to a long photoperiod for either 3 or 5 months. We found that hamsters born in the first litters were bolder than their younger siblings, and animals that spent 5 months under a long photoperiod were more active and risk prone than individuals acclimated to long days for 3 months. This variability in behaviour may reflect various strategies that ensure equal fitness of individuals born at different times of the year. Since in-dividual behaviour changed consistently between seasons, we suggest that seasonal changes in behav-iour are a fixed strategy that could be favoured by natural selection. However, these seasonal changes were not related to moulting and torpor use indicating independency of various winter adjustments.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Males in many species engage in physical combat over access to mates, and sexual selection has led to the evolution of weapons to enhance contest performance. The size of these often-elaborate structures is known to be exquisitely sensitive to nutrition. However, we know very little about the degree to which nutrition affects other attributes of animal weapons that can be crucial to fighting. In this study, we investigated the impact of natural dietary variation on weapon structural integrity in a fighting insect, Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae). Males in this species display their enlarged, spiny hind legs to other males, and these legs serve as weapons in aggressive physical contests where they are used to strike and squeeze opponents. N. femorata feeds on the fruit of prickly pear cactus and sets up territories on this plant. In North Central Florida the prickly pear Opuntia mesacantha ssp. lata blooms and begins to produce fruits in April and May. N. femorata has multiple, overlapping generations while the green fruits slowly ripen over the next several months. We examined insects reaching adulthood at two nearby time points in this range, June and July, to test the influence of the nutrition provided by ripening green cactus fruit on weapon size and its ability to resist puncture. We also raised insects on cactus with red, ripe fruit for comparison. We found a striking effect of cactus fruit phenology on weapons. Insects raised with the more mature green fruit (those in the second cohort) had 71% larger weapon area and 4.4 times greater puncture resistance than those raised on the early green fruit (those in the first cohort). In contrast, insects raised on red, ripe fruit were moderate in size, had high puncture resistance, and they changed little phenotypically from the first to second cohort. Increased structural integrity of the hind femur weapon was associated with the increased body size that came with better nutrition. This pattern highlights that cuticle thickness increased or its material properties changed when weapons were larger. Importantly, effects of nutrition on puncture resistance also transcended size. Insects of the same size had greater structural integrity if they received superior nutrition. Sexually selected weapons are often used as visual signals to conspecifics before fights, and this work hints that the size of the weapons may be a poor signal of weapon performance when nutrition is variable.

AB  - Synopsis Determining how variation in morphology affects animal performance (and ultimately fitness) is key to understanding the complete process of evolutionary adaptation. Long tails have evolved many times in arboreal and semi-arboreal rodents; in deer mice, long tails have evolved repeatedly in populations occupying forested habitat even within a single species (Peromyscus maniculatus). Here, we use a combination of functional modeling, laboratory studies, and museum records to test hypotheses about the function of tail-length variation in deer mice. First, we use computational models, informed by museum records documenting natural variation in tail length, to test whether differences in tail morphology between forest and prairie subspecies can influence performance in behavioral contexts relevant for tail use. We find that the deer-mouse tail plays little role in statically adjusting center of mass or in correcting body pitch and yaw, but rather it can affect body roll during arboreal locomotion. In this context, we find that even intraspecific tail-length variation could result in substantial differences in how much body rotation results from equivalent tail motions (i.e., tail effectiveness), but the relationship between commonly-used metrics of tail-length variation and effectiveness is non-linear. We further test whether caudal vertebra length, number, and shape are associated with differences in how much the tail can bend to curve around narrow substrates (i.e., tail curvature) and find that, as predicted, the shape of the caudal vertebrae is associated with intervertebral bending angle across taxa. However, although forest and prairie mice typically differ in both the length and number of caudal vertebrae, we do not find evidence that this pattern is the result of a functional trade-off related to tail curvature. Together, these results highlight how even simple models can both generate and exclude hypotheses about the functional consequences of trait variation for organismal-level performance.

AB  - In natural populations, quantitative traits seldom show short-term evolution at the rate predicted by evolutionary models. Resolving this "paradox of stasis" is a key goal in evolutionary biology, as it directly challenges our capacity to predict evolutionary change. One particularly promising hypothesis to explain the lack of evolutionary responses in a key offspring trait, body weight, is that positive selection on juveniles is counterbalanced by selection against maternal investment in offspring growth, given that reproduction is costly for the mothers. Here, we used data from one of the longest individual-based studies of a wild mammal population to test this hypothesis. We first showed that despite positive directional selection on birth weight, and heritable variation for this trait, no genetic change has been observed for birth weight over the past 47 years in the study population. Contrarily to our expectation, we found no evidence of selection against maternal investment in birth weight-if anything, selection favors mothers that produce large calves. Accordingly, we show that genetic change in birth weight over the study period is actually lower than that predicted from models including selection on maternal performance; ultimately our analysis here only deepens rather than resolves the paradox of stasis.

AB  - Simple Summary Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium and Eimeria species are parasites of phylum Apicomplexa, which includes several protozoa affecting animals and humans. In Ecuador, the maintenance of goat health is a matter of utmost importance because it affects the economic welfare of the breeders. N. caninum and T. gondii cause reproductive problems in goats, leading to abortions or weak offspring. Severe diarrhea in kids and delays in growth are due to the Cryptosporidium and Eimeria species. Moreover, T. gondii and Cryptosporidium are zoonotic parasites with serious consequences for human health. The aim of this work was to determine, by serological and parasitological tests, the prevalence of these parasites and the risk factors for goat populations in Southern Ecuador. On some farms, the prevalence of N. caninum and T. gondii reached more than 50%; up to 17% of the kids were positive for Cryptosporidium and 90% of the goats were positive for the Eimeria species. The analysis of risk factors revealed differences according to the parasite species. Considering the zoonotic significance of these results, control and prevention measures are essential and constitute a warning to veterinarians and governmental institutions. Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium and Eimeria cause severe impacts on the productivity of goat herds. The objectives of the present study were to establish the prevalence of these apicomplexans in goat farms from Ecuador; to evaluate a rapid test for Cryptosporidium diagnosis and to identify the risk factors associated with the infections. A questionnaire was designed to obtain information from 24 goat farms from Zapotillo, Garza Real, Cazaderos, Limones and Paletillas parishes in Ecuador. Blood (n = 388) and feces (n = 391) samples were collected. Indirect ELISA and standard parasitological assays were carried out to evaluate the seroprevalence of N. caninum and T. gondii and to detect oocysts of Cryptosporidium and Eimeria. The overall prevalence values of N. caninum and T. gondii were 12.11% and 18.20%, Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. oocysts were detected in 10.49% and 89.51% of the total samples. A low correlation value was found between the results obtained by Ziehl-Nielsen and the rapid test. The multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that vitamin supplementation, age of diarrhea, frequency of deworming, pasture area, presence of artiodactyls, domestic fowl, administration of sulfas, age group, body condition, abortions, type of pastures and the presence of cattle were risk factors according to the parasite species.

AB  - An experimentwas performed to study the inactivation effect of aerobic composting on heavy metals in maggot, pig and chicken manures. After composting, Cu mainly occurred in the oxidizable (OXI) fraction with a percentage distribution above 54%. Zn and Cd mainly existed in the bioavailable factor (BF), which has strong activity, with percentage distributions greater than 88.3% and 82.7%, respectively. Cr and Pb mainly existed in the stable residual (RES) fractionwith a percentage distribution of approximately 50%. The aerobic composting process had a clear inactivation effect on heavy metals. For maggot manure compost in particular, the inactivation effects of Cu, Cr, Zn, Cd, and Pb were very good throughout the composting process, and the inactivation effect of Pb reached 54.42%. In addition, the process of biotransformation by housefly maggots promoted the conversion of fulvic acid (FA) to humic acid (HA) in pig manure, and the final increase in HA/FA after maggot manure composting was the largest among the different types of manure and beneficial to the inactivation of heavy metals. Compounds containing -CH3 and -CH2 groups were reduced, and aromatic structures were enhanced. Moreover, a maggot yield equivalent to 13.2% of the fresh pig manure was achieved during the process of biotransformation. The correlation analysis results showed that moisture content was an important factor affecting the inactivation rates of heavymetals in the threemanure composts. Our results highlight that the process of biotransformation by houseflymaggots can promote composting maturity and the inactivation of heavymetals, and produce a large amount of insect protein, yielding beneficial ecological and economic benefits.

AB  - The exposure of wildlife to waste plastic is widely recognised as an issue for aquatic ecosystems but very little is known about terrestrial systems. Here, we addressed the hypothesis that UK small mammals are ingesting plastics by examining faecal samples for the presence of plastic using micro Fourier Transform infrared microscopy. Plastic polymers were detected in four out of the seven species examined (European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus); field vole (Microtus agrestis); brown rat (Rattus norvegicus)). Ingestion occurred across species of differing dietary habits (herbivorous, insectivorous and omnivorous) and locations (urban versus non urban). Densities excreted were comparable with those reported in human studies.The prevalence of confirmed plastics in the 261 faecal samples was 16.5 % (95 % CI 13 %, 22 %). Most (70 %) of the 60 plastic fragments were <1 mm (microplastics). Polyester, likely to be derived from textiles, accounted for 27 % of the fragments and was found in all plastic-positive species except for the wood mouse. The high prevalence of polyester in terrestrial ecosystems was unexpected and suggests that evaluation is needed of practices likely to transfer this plastic into the environment (such as sewage sludge application to farmland). Polynorbornene, which is likely to be derived from tyre wear, and polyethylene were also commonly detected polymers. 'Biodegradable' plastics formed 27 % (n = 12) of the particles found in wild mammal faeces, warranting further research to assess their persistence in the environment.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of locally available bulking agents on the faecal sludge (FS) composting process and quality of the final FS compost. Dewatered FS was mixed with sawdust, coffee husk and brewery waste, and composted on a pilot scale. The evolution of physical and chemical characteristics of the composting materials was monitored weekly. Results indicate that bulking agents have a statistically significant effect (p < 0.0001) on the evolution of composting temperatures, pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen forms, organic matter mineralisation, total organic carbon, maturity indices, quality of the final compost and composting periods during FS composting. Our results suggest reliable maturity indices for mature and stable FS compost. From the resource recovery perspective, this study suggests sawdust as a suitable bulking agent for co-composting with FS-as it significantly reduced the organic matter losses and nitrogen losses (to 2.2%), and improved the plant growth index, thus improving the agronomic values of the final compost as a soil conditioner. FS co-composting can be considered a sustainable and decentralised treatment option for FS and other organic wastes in the rural and peri-urban communities, especially, where there is a strong practice of reusing organic waste in agriculture.

AB  - Animal coloration can benefit fitness via its function in homeostatic regulation, communication, or camouflage. For wide-ranging taxa that are exposed to diverse climatic conditions throughout their range, spatial variation in color morphology might reflect locality-specific adaptive responses to those variable conditions. As a result, these species might vary in their color-climate associations over geographic space. Here, we integrate georeferenced photographs of adult animals with available bioclimatic data to test the hypothesis that dorsal color differences in Eastern Hog-Nosed Snakes (Heterodon platirhinos) reflect ecogeographic divergence. We first assigned each photographed snake into one of four dorsal color phases, namely, black, brown, red-orange, or yellow, and evaluated the spatial dispersion and bioclimatic niche occupancy of each phase by using multiple environmental niche modeling approaches. We then used pairwise comparisons of bioclimatic niche space to explicitly test for niche divergence among the color phases. Overall, black, brown, and red-orange phase H. platirhinos exploited different subsets of the species' geographic range and bioclimatic niche. In contrast, yellow phase snakes partly overlapped with red-orange and brown phase snakes in geographic and bioclimatic space. These findings support our hypothesis, and we discuss some of the possible functions of phase coloration.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In order to favor milk production, this research suggests that the concentration of starch in the diet of dairy ewes in mid-lactation should be reduced, compared to early lactation, by introducing sources of highly digestible fiber. On the other hand, this type of diet is not adequate for dairy goats, which should maintain the use diets rich in starch, even in mid-lactation, to support milk yield, as well.
   Evolution of milk production, body reserves and blood metabolites and their relationships with dietary carbohydrates were compared in 30 Sarda dairy ewes and 26 Saanen dairy goats in mid-lactation. From 92 to 152 +/- 11 days in milk (DIM), each species was allocated to two dietary treatments: high-starch (HS: 20.0% starch, on DM basis) and low-starch (LS: 7.8% starch, on DM basis) diets. In mid-lactating goats, the HS diet increased fat-corrected milk yield (FCM (3.5%); 2.65 vs. 2.53 kg/d; p = 0.019) and daily milk net energy (NEL; p = 0.025), compared to the LS diet. The body condition score (BCS) was not affected. In mid-lactating ewes, the LS diet increased FCM (6.5%) (1.47 vs. 1.36 kg/d; p = 0.008), and NEL (p = 0.008), compared to the HS diet. In addition, BCS was greater in HS than in LS ewes (3.53 vs. 3.38; p = 0.008). Goats had a higher growth hormone (GH) and lower insulin concentration than ewes (GH: 2.62 vs. 1.37 ng/mL; p = 0.04; insulin: 0.14 vs. 0.38 mu g/L; p < 0.001 in goats and ewes, respectively). In conclusion, in mid-lactation, the two species responded differently to dietary carbohydrates, probably due to differences in the concentration of GH and insulin. The HS diet favored milk yield in goats and body reserve accumulation in ewes. In ewes, the partial replacement of starch with highly digestible fiber increased energy partitioning in favor of milk production.

AB  - Goat farming represents a critical component of rural livelihoods, food security, and cultural heritage in southeastern Tunisia. This study adopts a multi-stakeholder approach to analyze the goat value chain in Tataouine, incorporating focus groups, semi-structured questionnaires, and direct observations with 80 farmers, 3 veterinarians, 13 butchers, and 100 consumers. The findings reveal strong local demand, with 72% of consumers purchasing goat meat and 66% consuming milk. However, significant inefficiencies exist, particularly a misalignment between production and market requirements: while 92% of butchers prefer fattened animals, only 16% of farmers engage in fattening practices. Women constitute 49% of dairy processors, yet face persistent resource constraints. Climate pressures exacerbate these challenges, with 80% of farmers reporting water scarcity and 93.8% observing pasture degradation. Three strategic interventions emerge as pivotal for sustainable development: targeted support for feed-efficient fattening techniques, establishment of women-led dairy processing collectives, and implementation of climate-resilient water management systems. These measures address core constraints while leveraging existing strengths of the production system. The study presents a transferable framework for livestock value chain analysis in arid regions, demonstrating how integrated approaches can enhance both economic viability and adaptive capacity while preserving traditional pastoral systems.

AB  - In Assam state, northeastern India, human-elephant conflict mitigation has included technocentric measures, such as installation of barriers, alternative livelihoods, and afforestation. Such measures treat conflict as a technical problem with linear cause-effect relations and are usually ineffective over the long term because they do not consider how historical conditions have shaped present interactions between humans and elephants. Human-elephant encounters in South Asia, including in Assam, have arisen from colonial and postcolonial land-use policies, ethnic relations, and capital extraction. To disentangle these relations, we conducted ethnographic fieldwork in Udalguri district of Assam among the Adivasi (Tea Tribe) to examine their interactions with wild elephants. Through socioecological ruptures, caused by displacement and deforestation, Adivasi (Tea Tribe) and elephant lives have intersected through space and time. Adivasi (Tea Tribe) life narratives and observations of daily encounters with elephants revealed that their interactions are multifaceted and motivated by multiple factors. Myths and oral testimonies revealed that the community has created conceptualizations of the elephant by closely observing their behavior, especially their movements, diets, vocalizations, and interactions with humans. These conceptualizations are filled with vignettes of shared marginalized lives, caused by the loss of homeland, food poverty, and uncertain ways of living. The empathy, expressed by the Adivasi (Tea Tribe), highlights ways of living with elephants that are affective and reach beyond technocentric interventions. For Adivasi (Tea Tribe) members, cohabitation could thus be achieved by living close to elephants as uneasy neighbors. Concepts of cohabitation, we suggest, could be harnessed to inform conservation policy and bring into focus the critically important-and yet often underutilized-values, encompassed by bottom-up, place-centric understandings of what elephants are and how coexistence may be possible in increasingly anthropogenic landscapes.
   Cosmogon & iacute;a de los Adivasi sobre la cercan & iacute;a con elefantes asi & aacute;ticos silvestres en Assam, India En el estado de Assam, al noreste de la India, la mitigaci & oacute;n del conflicto humanos-elefantes ha incluido medidas tecnoc & eacute;ntricas, como la instalaci & oacute;n de barreras, medios de vida alternativos y repoblaci & oacute;n forestal. Estas medidas abordan el conflicto como un problema t & eacute;cnico con relaciones causa-efecto lineales y suelen ser ineficientes a largo plazo porque no toman en cuenta c & oacute;mo las condiciones hist & oacute;ricas han configurado las interacciones actuales entre humanos y elefantes. Los encuentros entre humanos y elefantes en el sur de Asia, incluido Assam, han surgido de las pol & iacute;ticas coloniales y poscoloniales de uso de la tierra, las relaciones & eacute;tnicas y la extracci & oacute;n de capital. Realizamos un trabajo de campo etnogr & aacute;fico en el distrito de Udalguri de Assam entre los Adivasi (Tea Tribe) (A/TT) para entender estas relaciones y para analizar sus interacciones con los elefantes silvestres. A trav & eacute;s del rompimiento socioecol & oacute;gico provocado por el desplazamiento y la deforestaci & oacute;n, las vidas de los A/TT y los elefantes se han traslapado en el espacio y el tiempo. Los relatos de vida de los A/TT y las observaciones de sus encuentros diarios con los elefantes revelaron que sus interacciones son polifac & eacute;ticas y est & aacute;n motivadas por m & uacute;ltiples factores.

AB  - Dietary energy level impacts rumen function and the microflora in ruminants, which are closely related to their growth and well-being. This study explored how dietary energy levels affect sheep's growth performance, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, barrier function, and microflora. Our findings indicated that the average daily weight gain and nutrient digestibility improve with the increase of dietary energy. Meanwhile, the concentration of total volatile fatty acids and propionate in rumen increased, which indicated the enhancement of rumen fermentation. The content and expression of tight junction proteins, which represents rumen barrier function, increased with the increase of dietary energy. In addition, the bacterial diversity in rumen decreased, and the relative abundance of some bacteria like Prevotellaceae, Muribaculaceae, Saccharofermentans, Prevotella and Succiniclasticum changed at the family and genus levels. Ultimately, the growth performance, fermentation characteristics and barrier function were the best when the daily dietary metabolizable energy was 9.8-10.4 MJ/kg. This study revealed the complex interaction between diet, microbiota, and rumen health, ultimately guiding the development of more effective and scientifically informed animal feeding strategies. Dietary energy is crucial for ruminants' performance and health. To determine optimal dietary energy levels for growing sheep, we evaluated their growth performance, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, barrier function, and microbiota under varying metabolic energy (ME) diets. Forty-five growing Yunnan semi-fine wool sheep, aged 10 months and weighing 30.8 +/- 1.9 kg, were randomly allocated to five treatments, each receiving diets with ME levels of 8.0, 8.6, 9.2, 9.8 or 10.4 MJ/kg. The results showed that with increasing dietary energy, the average daily gain (ADG) as well as the digestibility of dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) increased (p < 0.05), while the feed conversion ratio (FCR) decreased linearly (p = 0.01). The concentration of total VFA (p = 0.03) and propionate (p = 0.01) in the rumen increased linearly, while rumen pH (p < 0.01) and the acetate-propionate ratio (p = 0.01) decreased linearly. Meanwhile, the protein contents of Claudin-4, Claudin-7, Occludin and ZO-1 as well as the relative mRNA expression of Claudin-4 and Occludin also increased (p < 0.05). In addition, rumen bacterial diversity decreased with the increase of dietary energy, and the relative abundance of some bacteria (like Saccharofermentans, Prevotella and Succiniclasticum) changed. In conclusion, increasing dietary energy levels enhanced growth performance, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, and barrier function, and altered the rumen bacterial community distribution. The optimal dietary ME for these parameters in sheep at this growth stage was between 9.8 and 10.4 MJ/kg.

AB  - In seasonal environments, sinks that are more persistent than sources may serve as temporal stepping stones for specialists. However, this possibility has to our knowledge, not been demonstrated to date, as such environments are thought to select for generalists, and the role of sinks, both in the field and in the laboratory, is difficult to document. Here, we used laboratory experiments to show that herbivorous arthropods associated with seasonally absent main (source) habitats can endure on a suboptimal (sink) host for several generations, albeit with a negative growth rate. Additionally, they dispersed towards this host less often than towards the main host and accepted it less often than the main host. Finally, repeated experimental evolution attempts revealed no adaptation to the suboptimal host. Nevertheless, field observations showed that arthropods are found in suboptimal habitats when the main habitat is unavailable. Together, these results show that evolutionary rescue in the suboptimal habitat is not possible. Instead, the sink habitat functions as a temporal stepping stone, allowing for the persistence of a specialist when the source habitat is gone.

AB  - The study aimed to provide a detailed anatomical description of the forelimb of the capybara using gross anatomy, radiography images, and three-dimensional reconstruction. Four adult animals were used for macroscopic dissections, one for the acquisition of radiographic images and reconstructions, and one specimen for bone descriptions. The results showed the anatomical details of the scapula with a developed hamate process and the absence of a clavicle. Radius and ulna do not fuse. The hand has five metacarpal bones, and the first digit is rudimentary. The proximal row of the carpal comprises the intermedioradial, ulnar, and accessory carpal bones, and the distal row comprises four carpal bones. The muscles present a general pattern similar to other groups of domestic animals; however, the absence of the accessory head of the triceps brachii muscle has been demonstrated. The resulting images provided excellent detail of the main anatomical structures of the capybara's thoracic limb. The illustrations in the present study are a valuable reference for the interpretation of normal and pathological imaging studies in the species in the present study.

AB  - The recently identified swine inflammation and necrosis syndrome (SINS) occurs in high prevalence from newborn piglets to fattening pigs and resembles an important concern for animal welfare. The primary endogenous syndrome affects the tail, ears, teats, coronary bands, claws and heels. The basis of clinical inflammation and necrosis has been substantiated by histopathology, metabolomic and liver transcriptomic. Considerable variation in SINS scores is evident in offspring of different boars under the same husbandry conditions. The high complexity of metabolic alterations and the influence of the boar led to the hypothesis of a polygenic architecture of SINS. This should be investigated by a genome-wide association study. For this purpose, 27 sows were simultaneously inseminated with mixed semen from two extreme boars. The mixed semen always contained ejaculate from a Pietrain boar classified as extremely SINS susceptible and additionally either the ejaculate from a Pietrain boar classified as SINS stable or from a Duroc boar classified as SINS stable. The 234 piglets were phenotyped on day 3 of life, sampled and genetically assigned to the respective boar. The piglets showed the expected genetic differentiation with respect to SINS susceptibility. The suspected genetic complexity was confirmed both in the number and genome-wide distribution of 221 significantly associated SNPs, and led to 49 candidate genes. As the SNPs were almost exclusively located in noncoding regions, functional nucleotides have not yet been identified. The results suggest that the susceptibility of piglets to SINS depends not only on environmental conditions but also on genomic variation.

AB  - Hybridization between wild animals and feral individuals from closely related domestic species can occur when they share the same habitat. Such events are generally regarded as a threat to the genetic integrity and survival of established wild populations. The aim of this study is to confirm a hybridization between European mouflon and feral sheep on the Adriatic island Dugi Otok, where a group of individuals phenotypically indicative of a possible introgression was photographed. Using an ovine medium-density SNP array genotypes, we provided genetic evidence of recent gene admixture between the two species. The ADMIXTURE analysis suggests that two hybrid individuals had 82.2% and 94.1% of their ancestry attributable to feral sheep, respectively, with the rest of the mouflon in origin. NEWHYBRIDS analysis estimated the combined probabilities for the putative hybrid individuals belonging to one of the hybrid classes at 87.0% and 90.1%, respectively. The main phenotypic differences in the hybrids were observed in the shape of the horns, a stronger horn circumference than in the mouflon and weaker than for the sheep, pronounced horn rings, a shorter tail, and intermediate color. We therefore recommend constant monitoring of the purity of the mouflon population to maintain its genetic integrity. In addition, all feral sheep should be removed from the wild, and released sheep raised in semi-wild conditions should be better controlled.

AB  - Simple Summary The colon plays a crucial role in the fermentation and utilization of cell wall carbohydrates, cellulose, and hemicellulose in ruminants. MicroRNAs have been reported to be involved in regulating the gastrointestinal development and maintaining intestinal homeostasis of mammals. In this study, we first reveal the microRNA expression profiles in the colon of kid goats. Meanwhile, we found that targeted genes of DEmiRNAs were highly enriched for the prevention of microbial invasion via the Erbb-MAPK network while targeted genes of HEmiRNAs contributed to the permeable barrier maintenance and surveillance of cell damage. Additionally, more than half of the microRNAs showed a developmentally dynamic expression in the colon of kid goats. This study disclosed microRNA-based biological functions in the regulation of colon development in ruminants. The colon is a crucial digestive organ of the hind gut in ruminants. The bacterial diversity and mucosal immune maturation in this region are related to age. However, whether the microRNA expression in the colon of goats is affected by age is still unclear. In the current study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of colon microRNAs during preweaning (Day 10 and Day 25) and postweaning (Day 31). A total of 1572 microRNAs were identified in the colon tissues. Of these, 39 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 88 highly expressed microRNAs (HEmiRNAs) were screened. The target genes regulated by the DEmiRNAs and HEmiRNAs were commonly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, focal adhesion, and adherens junction. Remarkably, the targeted genes of the DEmiRNAs were highly enriched for the prevention of microbial invasion via the Erbb-MAPK network while the targeted genes of HEmiRNAs contributed to the permeable barrier maintenance and cell damage surveillance. Additionally, there were eight different expression profiles of 87 dynamic miRNAs, in which approximately half of them were affected by age. Taken together, our study reveals the different roles of DEmiRNAs, HEmiRNAs, and dynamic microRNAs in the development of the colon and gives new insights into the regulatory mechanism of colon development in goats.

AB  - Warming ocean conditions have resulted in rapid borealization of Arctic seas, with fish assemblages reorganizing as sub-Arctic fish species expand into new territories, such as in the Chukchi Sea in the Pacific Arctic. During the summer months, this region has seen increases in the presence and abundance of groundfishes, including Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), with the possibility of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) arriving in coming years. To assess this potential, thermal conditions occupied by Pacific halibut in the adjacent northern Bering Sea were compared to modeled bottom-water temperatures in the Chukchi Sea to determine if suitable thermal habitat is available in the region. Pacific halibut in the Bering Sea primarily occupied waters from 6.0 to 8.2 degrees C, but were regularly found in conditions from 3.8 to 9.8 degrees C during the summer and temperatures around 0.9 degrees C during the winter. The availability of these conditions in the Chukchi Sea was relatively limited during a recent cold year, constrained to eastern coastal waters near Alaska with maximal availability during August and September. In contrast, suitable thermal conditions were 2.5 to 7.8 times more prevalent during a warm year, comprising a large portion of the Chukchi Sea from July to October. Findings suggest that suitable thermal conditions are currently available for Pacific halibut in the Chukchi Sea, indicating the potential for range expansion into the region. However, the current absence of the species suggests that alternative factors are currently discouraging this movement, such as prey availability or substrate type.

AB  - The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is the main carbon metabolism pathway leading to carbon loss in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). Research on the CO2 emission reduction mechanism based on the TCA cycle under different composting strategies is relatively lacking. This study investigated the effects of semi-permeable membrane coverage on CO2 emissions and pathways of carbon metabolism during three batches of large-scale dairy manure aerobic composting by using gas chromatography and high-throughput sequencing technologies. The results showed that the CO2 emission rate peaked at the initial stage of composting and stabilized after the 10th day. Among all groups, the semi-permeable membrane coverage coupled forced aeration groups had the lowest CO2 emission rate. Using semi-permeable membrane coverage during aerobic composting increased the abundance of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Ortholog (KO) K01647, citrate synthase, but decreased the total abundance of KOs related to the TCA cycle. KOs K01895 and K01638, acetyl-CoA synthetase and malate synthase, respectively, played a regulatory role in the intensity of the TCA cycle during aerobic composting; and their abundances were lower in the semi-permeable membrane-covered compost groups than in the traditional static compost groups. Therefore, citrate synthase was not a limiting factor for the TCA cycle during aerobic composting, and acetyl-CoA synthetase and malate synthase played a regulatory role in the intensity of the TCA cycle. In sum, using semi-permeable membrane coverage in the aerobic composting process of dairy manure is an effective strategy to decrease carbon loss by inhibiting the TCA cycle.

AB  - Macroalgae are one of the potential natural sources for the isolation of novel eco-friendly antifouling compounds. In this study, the antifouling activity of an extract of the brown macroalga Dictyota dichotoma collected from the Red Sea was tested against bacteria isolated from the marine biofilm and larval forms of the barnacle. A maximum inhibition of barnacle larval settlement of 89.36% was observed in 25 mu g ml(-1) extract concentration at 24 h treatment. The secondary metabolite composition of the extract was analyzed by GC-MS and compounds were used as ligands for molecular docking with barnacle cement protein. The toxicity profile of secondary metabolites present in the extract was predicted through in silico analysis. The results indicate that the crude extract of the alga inhibited the biofilm formation by the bacteria and significantly reduced the settlement of the barnacle larvae. GC-MS analysis of the extract revealed the presence of five metabolites, including two fatty acids. All metabolites showed higher binding affinity with barnacle cement than the reference compound, copper. Among the secondary metabolites detected in the algal extract, the cholestane derivative exhibited maximum binding affinity (-14.2 kcal mol(-1)) with barnacle cement. The metabolites also showed positive for crustacean and fish toxicity in toxicity prediction using an in silico method.

AB  - Simple Summary Abortions have a large economic impact in small ruminant flocks. Some abortions may be induced by non-infectious causes but most of them are due to a broad spectrum of abortifacient infectious agents. In this study, abortion cases from sheep (n: 1242) and goat (n: 371) flocks in the Iberian Peninsula were analyzed for the presence of Coxiella burnetii and other major abortifacients using molecular methods. C. burnetii and Chlamydia abortus were by far the most common pathogens circulating in sheep and goat flocks, since approximately 75% of cases from both hosts tested positive. C. burnetii infection was more prevalent in goats than sheep and was detected in almost half of caprine abortions. A significant proportion of C. burnetii PCR-positive cases were positive only for this bacterium in both ovine (33.1%) and caprine (63.2%) abortions, with the remaining cases harboring mixed infections. Toxoplasma gondii was the third most prevalent pathogen in both caprine (4.6%) and ovine (10.1%) abortions, followed by Campylobacter sp., Salmonella enterica, border disease virus and Neospora caninum. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most thorough studies reported in the literature regarding the presence of infectious agents in ovine and caprine abortions. Coxiella burnetii is an intracellular bacterium causing human Q fever and reproductive disorders in domestic ruminants. We analyzed the occurrence of C. burnetii and co-infections with six other major pathogens causing abortion in sheep (1242 cases) and goat (371 cases) flocks from Spain and Portugal. After real-time PCR detection, co-infections were established by principal component and cluster analysis that grouped cases based on the joint presence/absence of several microorganisms. C. burnetii and Chlamydia abortus were the most common abortifacient agents with approximately 75% of cases from both hosts testing positive, followed by Toxoplasma gondii, Campylobacter sp., Salmonella enterica, border disease virus and Neospora caninum. C. burnetii was significantly more common than C. abortus in goat abortions (p < 0.001). Co-infections with at least two pathogens were found in more than 66% cases of ovine abortions and 36% cases of caprine abortions testing positive for C. burnetii, mostly including mixed infections with only C. abortus. These findings indicate that both pathogens are the most significant ones to be readily prevented by vaccination in this geographical area. Biosecurity and biocontainment measures are also steadfastly recommended to prevent both the economic losses and public health risks associated with most of these abortifacient agents.

AB  - No study yet is undertaken to measure positive emotions in goats by stroking their body. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the effect of stroking goats' body as high valence and low arousal emotional state on facial grimace scale, ear postures and surface temperatures. The study lasted 10 months from September 2021 to May 2022. Thirty-two healthy goats were used in this study. Goats were stroked in three areas including forehead, neck and withers. The process was divided into three stages, which were pre-stroking, stroking, and post-stroking with five minutes for each stage. Results indicated that there were significant differences (P < 0.01) between all face units measured, except the ear position. In addition, significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in the positions of forward, backward and asymmetrical ears, while time spent with plane ears was not significant. Similarly, there were significantly (P < 0.05) higher ear position changes during both stroking and post-stroking periods, compared to pre-stroking stage. The stroking procedure had a significant effect (P < 0.05) only on eye and nasal temperatures during stroking and post-stroking stages compared to the stage before stroking, whereas no significant effect was found on the ear temperature. It was concluded that facial expressions and peripheral temperatures are vital indicators in measuring positive emotional valence in goats.

AB  - Modern, intensive, high-density farming practices cause elevated concentrations of particulate matter (PM) inside livestock barns. PM in livestock barns is predominantly biological, hence, it contains abundant microorganisms. Understanding the microbial composition of PM is crucial for assessing the hazards of air emitted from livestock barns. PM10 and PM2.5 from a pig barn were collected in winter and spring, and morphological, chemical, and microbial analyses were performed. The PM samples exhibit diverse morphological characteristics. The top three elements detected in the PM samples were O, C, and Si. Other elements, including N, Al, K, Mg, Ca, Na, Zn, P, W, Ba, Fe, S, Cl, and Ti, were also identified in these samples. For bacterial alpha diversity, the Sobs and Chao1 indices for PM10 were significantly higher than those for PM2.5 in winter (p < 0.05), and in spring, the ACE index for PM10 was significantly higher than that for PM2.5 (p < 0.05). For fungal alpha diversity, the Shannon index for PM10 was significantly higher than that for PM2.5 in winter (p < 0.01), and in spring, the Ace index for PM10 was significantly higher than that for PM2.5 (p < 0.05). The beta diversity results indicate that season, rather than the particle size, had a significant effect on the microbial composition in the PM samples. A total of seven bacterial pathogen genera and 16 fungal allergen genera were identified in PM samples. In winter, the relative abundances of total bacterial pathogens and fungal allergens in PM2.5 were higher than those in PM10. In contrast, the relative abundance of fungal allergens in PM10 was higher in spring than in winter. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of PM from a pig barn across the particle sizes and seasons.

AB  - We analyzed the lead content in antlers of 90 adult European roe bucks (Capreolus capreolus) that had been culled between 1901 and 2019 in an agricultural-dominated hunting district in Lower Saxony (Northern Germany). Antler lead values ranged between 0.2 and 10.9 mg/kg dry weight. Median lead concentration was highest after World War II, during a period (1956-1984) of rapidly increasing mass motorization and use of leaded gasoline. Lead levels in antlers decreased markedly after the phase-out of leaded gasoline, but high values were still found in some recently collected antlers. This could indicate persistent lead pollution from former use of lead additives to gasoline, other traffic-related sources, or from agricultural sources (e.g., sewage sludge, fertilizers). This study highlights the suitability of analyzing roe deer antlers for the historical monitoring of changing lead levels in the environment. By collecting antlers and providing them for study, local hunters can significantly contribute to environmental surveillance and the monitoring of environmental pollution by bone-seeking contaminants.

AB  - Understanding the exchange of individuals between wildlife populations, particularly those with naturally fragmented habitats, is important for the effective management of these species. This is of particular consequence when the species is of conservation concern, and isolated populations may be lost due to pressures from predation or competition, or catastrophic events such as wildfire. Here we demonstrate the use kinship and population structure analysis to show potential recent movement between colonies in metapopulations of yellow-footed rock-wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus Gray 1854) at two sites in the Grey Range of Queensland, and at four sites in the Gawler Ranges of South Australia. These colonies are also compared to a single colony from the Flinders Ranges, a connected landscape of rock-wallaby habitat. Using reduced representation next-generation sequencing, we acquired and filtered a set of similar to 17,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to examine population genetic variation, structure and relationships within populations, and also identify putative migrants. Initial STRUCTURE analysis re-confirmed each population should be considered separately. Tests of population genetic variation identify several colonies appearing to be experiencing genetic erosion, also with low calculated effective population sizes (N-e = 4.5-36.6). Pairwise comparisons of individual relatedness (relatedness coeffiecients; r) implied several contemporary movement events between colonies within both the Gawler and Grey Ranges (r > 0.125), which was then affirmed with tests for putative first generation migrants. These results are of particular note in South Australia, where threat abatement (management of key predators and competitors) may facilitate dispersion. Additionally, in Queensland, colonies are separated by anthropogenic barriers: predator exclusion fencing designed to exclude dingoes (Canis familiaris) from grazing land, which may hinder dispersal. This work highlights the usefulness of population genetics to inform management outcomes in wildlife, in this case, highlighting the need for threatened species management at the landscape level.

AB  - Endoclita signifer is a major wood-boring pest of eucalyptus trees in China, and its third instar larvae can accurately find and infest eucalyptus trees in mixed-species forests, although it can also feed on another 51 tree species in the same planted area. A total of 34 volatile compounds were identified from eucalyptus trunks, including non-infested and infested trunks with single or multiple (more than three) larval entrance cover packets, and forest floor humus. Of these, o-cymene showed a strong gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) activity and significant attraction of the third instar E. signifer larvae. Higher abundance of alpha-phellandrene, o-cymene, and the unique 2-phenyl-2-propanol in the volatile profile from infested eucalyptus trunks indicated that they were herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). The larvae showed significantly higher attraction to volatile blends, especially those from infested eucalyptus trunks, than to single volatiles. A blend of the three HIPVs, alpha-pinene, D-limonene, and n-butyl ether may serve as an attractant for the control of E. signifer larvae in eucalyptus plantations. Further, exposure of third instar E. signifer larvae to some of these volatiles which also elicited electroantennogram and behavioral responses, influenced expressions of some olfactory proteins. Our results show that third instar E. signifer larvae can recognize o-cymene from host eucalyptus trunks and are attracted to the trunk by the three HIPVs when they shift their habitats from the forest floor humus to the tree trunks.

AB  - Pinnipeds have vibrissae with which they can explore their environment. Two vibrissal parameters that differ in pinnipeds are shape and number. Regarding shape, most phocids have undulated vibrissae, whereas the vibrissae of a few phocids, all otariids and walruses are smooth. As there is disagreement with respect to which phocid vibrissae lack the undulation, we systematically collected information on vibrissal type. We have documented that all eared seals we examined, walruses, Mediterranean monk seals, bearded, and leopard seals have smooth vibrissae. All other phocids have undulated vibrissae, except for Ross seals and Hawaiian monk seals, which have partially undulated vibrissae. Moreover, we quantified and documented the existence of vibrissae from photos revealing otariids to have 20-43 mystacial vibrissae/pad, no rhinal vibrissae, 1-2 supraorbital vibrissae above each eye, and phocids to have 15-97 mystacial vibrissae/pad, 0-2 rhinal vibrissae/nostril, 1-9 supraorbital vibrissae above each eye, all averages determined from counts made from photos. Walruses have the maximum number of mystacial vibrissae amounting to 198 vibrissae/pad on average, but almost all walruses lack rhinal and supraorbital vibrissae. Vibrissae were found at the upper lip and on the lower jaw in some pinnipeds.

AB  - Kobuviruses (KoVs) are a group of small, non-enveloped RNA viruses classified in the genus Kobuvirus within the Picornaviridae family, comprising Aichivirus species A to F. KoVs have been identified in humans and several mammals, including domestic ungulates. This study investigated the presence of KoVs in a collection of bovine stool samples (n = 38) obtained from animals with enteritis or without clinical signs. By RT-PCR screening, KoV RNA was detected in 10/38 animals (26.3%). Six of the ten positive animals had enteric signs. On sequence analysis of the amplicons, eight strains were related to species Aichivirus B, commonly identified in cattle. In contrast, two strains (ITA/2019/572-1 and ITA/2020/bovine/30-2), displayed the highest nt identity (up to 97.1%) to cattle, yak, and goat Aichivirus D strains. On whole genome analysis, strains ITA/2019/572-1 and ITA/2020/30-2 showed 88.9% nt identity to each other and 87.8-90.3% nt to the bovine kobuvirus strain CHN/2021/ON730709 identified in China. Interestingly these three Aichivirus D strains showed a recombinant makeup, clustering with D1 genotype in the capsid region and with D2 genotype in the non-structural genes. These findings suggest that Aichivirus D KoVs are common components of livestock virome. Understanding the genetic diversity of KoVs in animals will be useful to improve the diagnostics and gather epidemiological data.

AB  - Crop damage and vehicle collisions caused by wild ungulates require effective deterrents. Many commercial acoustic devices use ultrasonic signals, presenting them as aversive to these animals. However, unconvincing results reported in previous studies using (non-frequency modulated) ultrasounds bring their effectiveness as deterrent signals into question. Here, we explored the deterrent effectiveness of ultrasounds in several large mammalian species that are expected to perceive these high frequencies. Specifically, we tested the effect of different ultrasonic signals on red deer, peccaries, and wolves. Animals were exposed to sequences of nine acoustic signals in the 20-30 kHz frequency range, and to a lower-pitched signal (2-3 kHz). While red deer showed no aversion to ultrasonic signals (inaudible for humans), lower frequency (audible for humans) modulations increased aversive responses. Conversely, peccaries showed strong flight responses to several ultrasonic signals. Wolves also reacted to ultrasounds but did not flee. Our study confirms that ultrasonic signals are not suitable for deterring European red deer. However, our results suggest that their effectiveness in other species should be systematically tested, without assuming that their hearing frequency range is a reliable predictor of their behavioural responses to ultrasonic signals.

AB  - Lipid-rich copepods form an essential link between primary producers and higher trophic levels in high-latitude oceans. These zooplankton can take advantage of ephemeral phytoplankton blooms to fuel development and reproduction. However, we have limited understanding of how the physiological condition of these animals varies in relation to environmental factors such as food availability. Due to high advection, it is likely that physiological plasticity, rather than local adaptation, is primarily responsible for physiological differences within a region. We use transcriptomics and other physiological metrics to understand how two species of copepods (Calanoides acutus and Calanus propinquus) vary across environmental gradients along the West Antarctic Peninsula. For the primarily herbivorous C. acutus, physiological separation between sampling locations appears to be driven by feeding status, and gene expression differences indicate differential expression of genes regulating lipid metabolism, reproduction, aerobic metabolism, and protein translation. For the more omnivorous C. propinquus, physiology and gene expression did not segregate as clearly by location, showed minimal signs of food deprivation at any location, and had a weaker relationship with chlorophyll compared to C. acutus. By comparing these results with concurrent starvation experiments, we find that spatial variation in gene expression reflects short-term differences in food availability (particularly for C. acutus), and we identify genes whose expression indicates recent feeding status. Further examination of the relationships between food availability, copepod physiology, and population dynamics will ultimately improve our capacity to predict how copepod populations will respond to rapidly changing environmental conditions in the West Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem.

AB  - As an important component of carbonaceous aerosols (CA), organic carbon (OC) exerts a strong, yet insufficiently constrained perturbation of the climate. In this study, we reported sources of OC based on its natural abundance radiocarbon (14C) fingerprinting in aerosols and water-insoluble organic carbon (WIOC) in snowpits across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) - one of the remote regions in the world and a freshwater reservoir for billions of people. Overall, the proportions from C-14-based non-fossil fuel contribution (f(non-fossil)) for OC in aerosols was 74 +/- 10%, while for WIOC in snowpits was 81 +/- 10%, both of which were significantly higher than that of elemental carbon (EC). These indicated sources of OC (WIOC) and EC were different at remote TP. Spatially, high f(non-fossil) of WIOC of snowpit samples appeared at the inner part of the TP, indicating the important contribution of local non-fossil sources. Therefore, local non-fossil sources rather than long-range transportation OC dominants its total amount of the TP. In addition, the contribution of local non-fossil sourced WIOC increased during the monsoon period because heavy precipitation removed a high ratio of long-range transportation WIOC. The results of this study showed that not only OC and EC but also their different fuel sources should be treated separately in models to investigate their sources and atmospheric transportation.

AB  - BackgroundTibetan pigs, which have long inhabited the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at elevations exceeding 3000 m, serve as an ideal model for studying adaptation to extreme high-altitude environments. The multifunctionality of the liver (hematopoiesis, metabolism, detoxification) plays a crucial role in the adaptation of Tibetan pigs to hypoxic and cold environments, yet the specific mechanisms remain unclear.ResultsThis study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile and conduct bioinformatic analyses on the liver tissues of Diqing Tibetan pigs across 5 developmental stages (embryonic day 25, embryonic day 55, day of birth, development to 30 days, and development to 90 days). The goal was to identify and investigate key cell types and the regulatory mechanisms of core gene expression that facilitate adaptation to hypoxia and cold. In the fetal liver, various subpopulations of erythrocytes were detected. Analysis of these subpopulations allowed for the construction of a cellular development trajectory from proliferative erythrocytes to division erythrocytes to denucleating erythrocytes, revealing that key transcription factors (JUNB and MAFF) and functional genes (HBP1 and PPP2CB) play significant roles in erythrocyte enucleation. Furthermore, the presence of hematopoietic stem cells in the postnatal liver was observed, with identification of subpopulations exhibiting myeloid differentiation tendencies. These cells continuously support hematopoiesis and facilitate new blood vessel formation, thereby increasing red blood cell counts to aid in the adaptation of Diqing Tibetan pigs to hypoxic conditions. Additionally, a class of hepatocytes capable of converting metabolic energy into heat through uncoupling processes was identified, which assists in the adaptation to the cold environments of the plateau.ConclusionsIn summary, our study provides new scientific perspectives on the adaptation mechanisms of high-altitude animals to extreme environments.

AB  - Cattleyaks are equally adaptable to harsh environment as yaks, but produce far more milk and meat in terms of quality and quantity. However, male cattleyaks with active secondary sexuality are infertile and have restricted productivity and breeding of yaks. Much researches continue to be done in regard to the differences in transcriptome profiling in cattleyak epididymis with respect to yak epididymis. The caput segment of the epididymis is highly specialized for the initiation of spermatozoa maturation, synthesis and secretion. We used RNA-Seq technology to comparatively analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with sperm maturation between the caput epididymis of yak and cattleyak. Transcriptomic profiling identified 109 DEGs in which 44 were upregulated and 65 were downregulated. 8 DEGs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. DEGs were analyzed by GO and KEGG analysis to screen the key genes involved in sperm maturation. The upregulation of PAOX and ATP2C2 may be associated with toxicity and apoptosis resistance in cattleyak with respect to yak. However, downregulated DEFB109, DEFB121, DEFB123, DEFA1, LY6G5C, SLC13A2, CST3, CRYBA4 and ADAM28 were associated with innate immune response, sperm maturation, motility and antimicrobial functions. AMPK and Hedgehog signaling pathways were involved in the top-listed five significantly enriched pathways, and the downregulation of HNF4a and LRP2 may have contributed to infertility in cattleyak. The data provide a powerful resource, contributing to the knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying male cattleyak infertility.

AB  - Switching to a new host plant is a driving force for divergence and speciation in herbivorous insects. This process of incorporating a novel host plant into the diet may require a number of adaptations in the insect herbivores that allow them to consume host plant tissue that may contain toxic secondary chemicals. As a result, herbivorous insects are predicted to have evolved efficient ways to detoxify major plant defences and increase fitness by either relying on their own genomes or by recruiting other organisms such as microbial gut symbionts. In the present study we used parallel metatranscriptomic analyses of Altica flea beetles and their gut symbionts to explore the contributions of beetle detoxification mechanisms versus detoxification by their gut consortium. We compared the gut meta-transcriptomes of two sympatric Altica species that feed exclusively on different host plant species as well as their F-1 hybrids that were fed one of the two host plant species. These comparisons revealed that gene expression patterns of Altica are dependent on both beetle species identity and diet. The community structure of gut symbionts was also dependent on the identity of the beetle species, and the gene expression patterns of the gut symbionts were significantly correlated with beetle species and plant diet. Some of the enriched genes identified in the beetles and gut symbionts are involved in the degradation of secondary metabolites produced by plants, suggesting that Altica flea beetles may use their gut microbiota to help them feed on and adapt to their host plants.

AB  - Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the main pathogen of koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD), which has caused serious damage to the ornamental and food-producing carp industry. Effective and rapid on-site detection methods are needed for early diagnosis of CyHV-3. A lateral flow immuno-chromatographic assay (LFIA) using two specific anti-CyHV-3 monoclonal antibodies has been developed and validated for on-site detection of CyHV-3. MAb 3C9 was used to bio-conjugate CyHV-3 antigen with colloidal gold, and MAb 2A8 was used to capture antigen bound colloidal gold on the test line. The control line was lined with goat anti-mouse IgG to capture unbound colloidal gold to validate performance. The test results can be viewed within 10 min after putting the strip into CyHV-3 virus infection fluid. The lowest limit of detection for the LFIA test was found to be 1.5 x 10(4) copies/mu L and it showed no cross-reactivity with other fish viral pathogens. The specificity of the strip was 100% when spleen and kidney tissues of CyHV-3-infected and healthy koi were validated at the field level. The LFIA strip will be an effective device for the early detection of CyHV-3 in the future.

AB  - Heat stress affects the productivity of exposed animals by lowering fertility-related aspects. This phenomenon is more pronounced in buffaloes, particularly during the low breeding season, as it is coupled with thermal assaults. Under such conditions, altered metabolic activity is markedly noticed, affecting the production and reproduction of buffaloes. The obtained results revealed that the use of capsaicin is beneficial to improve milk yield and composition without altering the other metabolic process. Moreover, improved reproductive performance is achieved in buffaloes when capsaicin is supplemented prior to synchronization.
   The present study investigated the role of dietary capsaicin (CPS) supplementation on milk yield (liters/head) and milk composition (total solids, lactose, albumin, protein, fat, milk urea nitrogen (MUN), somatic cell count (SCC) and somatic cell score (SCS), serum metabolites (lipoprotein esterase (LPL) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), and reproductive physiology (follicular development, estrus response, ovulation and pregnancy) following synchronization during the low breeding season. One hundred (n = 100) crossbred buffaloes were randomly assigned to four dietary groups consisting of CPS supplementation dosages (0, 2, 4 or 6 mg/kg of total mixed ration; TMR) as CPS-0 (n = 26), CPS-2 (n = 22), CPS-4 (n = 25) and CPS-6 (n = 27), respectively, in a 30-day feed trial. The results revealed that the CPS-4 group of buffaloes had a better estrus rate (72%) along with improved (p < 0.05) ovulatory follicle diameter (13.8 mm), ovulation rate (68%) and pregnancy rate (48%) compared to other treatment groups. Milk yield improved (p < 0.05) in CPS-4 supplemented buffaloes after day 20 of the trial, comparatively. There was a significant effect (p < 0.05) of milk sampling day (day 30) on total milk solids, lactose, milk protein and MUN levels, whereas lactose, MUN, SCC and SCS were influenced by supplementation dosage (CPS-4). Glucose levels were affected in buffaloes by sampling time (artificial insemination (AI) and 50-day post-AI) and CPS-dose (CPS-4 and CPS-6), respectively. LPL level changed in CPS-2 and CPS-4 groups at AI time and 50 days after AI. In addition, the AST level was different in CPS-4 at AI time and 50 days after AI. Therefore, our data suggest that a medium dose (similar to 4 mg/kg of TMR) of CPS provided a better response in the form of milk yield, milk composition, serum metabolites and reproductive performance in crossbred buffaloes during the low breeding season.

AB  - Effect of resveratrol (RSV) on spermatogenesis and the mechanism of resveratrol in promoting spermatogenesis of breeding boars was explored by feeding sexually mature Duroc boars with normal diet and 20 mg/kg resveratrol diet for 14 days to the control group and experimental group, respectively. Semen volume, sperm density, motility, viability and abnormality rate were analyzed on day 0, 7, and 14. Blood samples were collected, and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone (T) in serum were analyzed. On day 14, the testis tissue was collected for antioxidant and proteomics analysis etc. The semen volume, sperm density, motility, and viability of the experimental group and the contents of serum FSH, LH, T and plasma SOD activity were significantly higher than those in the control group. However, the serum IL6, TNF-alpha and plasma MDA were remarkably lower in experimental group. The above results showed that resveratrol can simulate spermatogenesis in breeding boars. Proteomic results demonstrated that three differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were up-regulated and 12 DEPs were down-regulated; ODF1, calmodulin, Cabs1, and Hp were involved in spermatogenesis; and the main enriched metabolic pathway is steroid hormone synthesis pathway. Therefore, the improvement in sperm quality by resveratrol may be achieved by regulating the changes in outer dense fiber 1, calmodulin, spermatid specific 1, and haptoglobin expression and steroid synthesis pathway.

AB  - Trichomes are unicellular or multicellular hair-like appendages developed on the aerial plant epidermis of most plant species that act as a protective barrier against natural hazards. For this reason, evaluating the density of trichomes is a valuable approach for elucidating plant defence responses to a continuous challenging environment. However, previous methods for trichome counting, although reliable, require the use of specialised equipment, software or previous manipulation steps of the plant tissue, which poses a complicated hurdle for many laboratories. Here, we propose a new fast, accessible and user-friendly method to quantify trichomes that overcomes all these drawbacks and makes trichome quantification a reachable option for the scientific community. Particularly, this new method is based on the use of machine learning as a reliable tool for quantifying trichomes, following an Ilastik-Fiji tandem approach directly performed on 2D images. Our method shows high reliability and efficacy on trichome quantification in Arabidopsis thaliana by comparing manual and automated results in Arabidopsis accessions with diverse trichome densities. Due to the plasticity that machine learning provides, this method also showed adaptability to other plant species, demonstrating the ability of the method to spread its scope to a greater scientific community.

AB  - With an increased interest in nongame fishes such as buffalofishes (Catostomidae, Ictiobus), there is a need for better foundational data on their life history. Bigmouth Buffalo I. cyprinellus, for example, have been found to live for more than a century. Age estimates for other sucker species have similarly suggested long life spans, but validation studies as reference points are often lacking. We conducted a 3-year study on Smallmouth Buffalo I. bubalus in Oklahoma to validate annual increments on three hard part structures (otoliths [lapilli], pectoral fin rays, and opercula) typically used for age estimation. We marked wild fish with oxytetracycline (OTC) injection and stocked those fish into a hatchery pond to create a population of fish with known times since marking. Furthermore, reproduction in the pond allowed us to validate annulus formation in young fish. We analyzed 117 fish and found that otoliths were more reliable, precise, and accurate than the other two structures for detecting OTC marks and counting annuli. Age estimates, from 1 to 61 years, were greatest when otoliths were used, with 99% of estimates corresponding to known time since marking or known age. Otoliths appear to be the only reliable structure for accurately estimating the age of Smallmouth Buffalo within 1 year of actual age, and their use indicates that this species can live for more than six decades in Oklahoma.

AB  - Symbiotic relationships across trophic levels influence invasions. Although Epichlo & euml; endophytes are often linked to forage grasses spread through alkaloid-mediated herbivore resistance, this link oversimplifies a complex, multifactorial process. We investigate whether this fungal endophyte interacts with the fungus garden of the native leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex ambiguus by inducing the release of a widespread green leaf volatile, thereby altering its foraging behavior. We conducted 5-d choice experiments to assess ant preferences for leaves and seeds of Lolium multiflorum plants, either infected (E+) or uninfected (E-) with Epichlo & euml; occultans, along with a Petri dish assay to evaluate the effects of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (Z3-HAC) on the growth of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, ants' mutualistic fungi. Ants exhibited delayed rejection for E+ plants while showing no preference for seeds. In vitro, Z3-HAC promoted fungal growth away from volatile sources. These findings suggest that mutualistic fungi of a grass (alien) and its herbivore (native) shape their defense strategies in Pampean grasslands. Z3-HAC's effects extend beyond direct plant-herbivore interactions, signaling antagonistic fungi within the fungal garden without acting as a novel weapon. This study highlights the importance of integrating microbial networks into invasion ecology frameworks to understand the consequences of co-introduced plants and symbionts.

AB  - Haemonchus contortus is one of the most pathogenic gastrointestinal parasites that infect small ruminants. The indiscriminate use of anthelmintics (i.e., benzimidazole class, BZ) to control infections has led to the reduction of drug efficacy in H. contortus populations worldwide. Resistance to BZ is associated with high frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms at F200Y, F167Y, and E198A positions of the beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene. This study aimed to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BZ resistance in H. contortus from 18 farms (545 sheep and 124 goats) in Paran & aacute;, Southern Brazil. Health management practices were identified as risk factors from individual farms. Genomic DNA was extracted from 20,000 larvae/farm and used in quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays for the three mutations. We ran a correlation analysis between flock health and quantitative polymerase chain reaction data. H. contortus was the most prevalent parasite in 67% (12/18) of the farms. Resistant allele frequencies were detected for F200Y (var. 46.4 to 72.0%) and F167Y (var. 15.7 to 23.8%). Only (100.0%) susceptible alleles were detected for the E198A. High treatment frequency (15/18), visual weight estimations for anthelmintic dose (15/18), no integration with other farm practices (14/18), treatment of all animals (14/18), and no quarantine period for newly acquired animals (10/18) were considered the most critical risk factors associated with BZ resistance. This is the first systematic prevalence study linking management practices on smallholder farms and the molecular data of BZ resistance of H. contortus in Southern Brazil.

AB  - Cold stress severely limits tea plant (Camellia sinensis) productivity, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation remain elusive. Here, we identified a cold-inducible glycosyltransferase, CsUGT71A60, through integrative genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and proteomic profiling. Natural variation in CsUGT71A60 was strongly associated with cold tolerance, as evidenced by linkage disequilibrium analysis of flanking SNPs. Functional characterization revealed that CsUGT71A60 specifically catalyses the glycosylation of cis-zeatin to form cis-zeatin 9-O-glucoside in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of CsUGT71A60 in Arabidopsis enhanced cold tolerance and agronomic traits, including germination rate, tiller number and seed weight, while delaying flowering. Transient silencing of CsUGT71A60 in tea plants disrupted cis-zeatin homoeostasis, impairing antioxidant defences and osmotic regulation under cold stress. Mechanistically, the transcription factor ARR (TEA021099) directly binds to CRM elements in the CsUGT71A60 promoter, activating its expression to fine-tune cytokinin signalling. This study unveils a dual-function glycosyltransferase that orchestrates stress tolerance and developmental plasticity, offering a strategic target for breeding climate-tolerance crops without yield penalties.

AB  - The hispid hare, an endangered elusive mammal that dwells in the tall grasslands of the Himalayan foothills across in Nepal, India, and Bhutan is facing severe threats from anthropogenic activities and seasonal floods. Previous studies on hispid hare have investigated in Shuklaphanta National Park, only a study has been conducted in Bardia National Park over the past decade. We aim to evaluate current distribution pattern of the hispid hare in the Babai valley in Bardia National Park, identify factors influencing their distribution, and access existing threats. We surveyed 428 transects (50 m x 2 m) across 1048.55 hectares of grasslands in the valley pre-burn and post-burn. The hispid hare exhibited a clumped distribution pattern, with recorded pellets in six grasslands: Kalinara, Guthi, Sano Shree Phanta, Chitaale Phanta, Ratomate, Rhino Release Site, and Mulghat in Bardia National Park. Pellet density was higher in post-burn, indicating a greater population density in summer compared to winter. Our finding revealed a preference grasslands area close to riverbank in pre-burn and short grasslands in post-burn, while the species tended to avoid forests and edge between grasslands and forests. The best-fit model highlighted that grass density, grasslands burn, and annual precipitation significantly influence the distribution of the hispid hare. Major threats identified in the field included grasslands burn, flood, invasive species, vegetation succession, and predators. We recommend that conservation efforts focus on protecting and managing grasslands that provide suitable habitat for the hispid hare.

AB  - Impacts of low-head, run-of-the-river dams on migratory fish movements depend on the structure of the dam, river hydrology, and the ability of fish to navigate the tailrace environment. Here, we present results from a 3-year movement study in which telemetered Paddlefish Polyodon spathula and Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus were tracked as they approached and sometimes migrated past Claiborne Lock and Dam (CLD), a low-use low-head lock-and-dam structure on the Alabama River. A spillway portion of the dam is periodically inundated during early spring, dependent on precipitation and releases from the next upstream dam. Our goals were to (1) quantify dam passage rates for both species, (2) assess the importance of factors affecting passage success, and (3) quantify space use patterns in the tailrace. Both species exhibited annual upstream migrations during the study period. Correlation of daily average river position versus the CLD hydrograph showed that movements by both species appeared to be related to flow variation. Passage efficiency (range = 10.7-30.2%) varied between species and among years, with tailrace gauge height being the most important factor affecting passage success for both species. Using an acoustic positioning system in the tailrace, we quantified space use by individuals of both species. Time spent in the tailrace (mean = 3.9 continuous days; range = 0-94 continuous days) did not differ between individuals that passed and those that did not pass. Fine-scale position estimates showed that space use differed between species, across gauge heights, and between individuals that passed and those that did not pass. Differential space use may be due to the species' habitat preferences or swimming abilities. Our findings provide information to inform potential design of mitigation structures, and they also identify the need for additional work required to more fully understand the mechanisms of passage success versus failure for these and other native potamodromous species.

AB  - The aim of the study was to estimate genetic diversity parameters for Banija spotted pig population and to apply optimisation methods to control the inbreeding in the population in three different scenarios. The first scenario consisted of minimizing inbreeding by minimizing the average kinship without considering breeding values. The second scenario was to minimize inbreeding by minimizing the average kinship accounting for breeding values. The third scenario was to apply traditional optimal contribution selection by maximizing the breeding value of the offspring. A total of 5 boars and 49 sows were selected to create mating plan minimise inbreeding in the next generation. The average inbreeding coefficient in the population was 6.97, while effective population size was 8.47. In the first scenario, different kinship constrains between candidates resulted in a change in the number of selected animals and a change in the average breeding values, such that the number of selected candidates increased when the constraint on kinship was stronger, with a simultaneous decrease in breeding values. The second scenario resulted in increased inbreeding when additional weight was placed on genetic gain. The Maximisation of breeding values resulted with drastically increased average inbreeding coefficient in the next generation. Due the small total and effective population size, the application of optimisation methods demonstrated that genetic improvement is possible at a high cost of loss of the genetic variability and preservation of diversity remains the first objective in the breeding programme for Banija spotted pig.

AB  - Poultry manure is one of the important sources of antibiotic pollution in agricultural soil and groundwater. Recently, the excessive discharge of goat manure has resulted in groundwater environmental challenges and negative impacts. It is of practical significance that such wastes can be converted into functional materials to promote the resource utilization of waste and reduce the risk of antibiotic contamination. In this study, Fe (II)-loaded goat manure biochar (Fe-GMC) was prepared by pyrolyzing goat manure and iron salts and used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for tetracycline (TC) degradation in groundwater. The as-prepared Fe-GMC exhibited good catalytic performance for PMS activation due to its porous surface and rich oxygen-containing groups. Under the conditions of catalyst dosage of 0.2 g/L, PMS dosage of 1.0 mM, and pH of 3.0, TC was removed 81.3% within 60 min. In addition, the TC degradation efficiency was inhibited to different extents by inorganic anions (HCO3->Cl->NO3-) in water. Furthermore, the quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra analysis indicated that the generation of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) was responsible for TC degradation. Particularly, Fe-GMC produces a strong oxidizing agent. This study provides an efficient and environmentally friendly tetracycline degradation catalyst, which offers a new theoretical basis for water environmental remediation.

AB  - Dung beetles are predominantly coprophagous and use mammalian faeces as their main food resource and for offspring rearing. However, these resources are generally ephemeral and scarce. The objective of this study was to verify the attractiveness to dung beetles of the faeces of nine native mammal species of the Cerrado biome in different trophic guilds. This study was conducted during the rainy season (October 2016 to March 2017) in two sensu stricto areas of the Cerrado in the Brasilia National Park (PNB), Federal District, Brazil. Pitfalls containing faeces of nine mammals native to the region were used as bait (from three herbivores, three carnivores and three omnivores) for the collection of dung beetles. We collected 203 individuals and 19 species, and the most abundant species were Uroxys aff. thoracalis, Oxysternon palemo, Coprophanaeus spitzi and Diabroctis mirabilis. The most attractive faecal bait was from the omnivorous Chrysocyon brachyurus (32.67% of the individuals and 13 species). This study reveals variation in the attraction of dung beetles to native mammal dung of the Cerrado, with more abundance in the faeces of omnivores and carnivores and less in the faeces of herbivores. The species composition in the carnivore baits did not differ from that of the omnivore baits. These data indicate that changes in Scarabaeinae assemblages result from changes in mammal species such as those that have occurred in the Cerrado biome with the conversion to cattle production, which in recent years has caused intense fragmentation of habitats, expansion of agricultural and livestock activities and the introduction of exotic species. The mammal C. brachyurus, vulnerable to extinction in Brazil, should be a focus for future research, since its faeces support a great diversity of dung beetles in the Cerrado.

AB  - Compost teas are aqueous filtrates of steeped composted materials, which can be applied to the phyllosphere or rhizosphere of plants. Compost teas possess beneficial effects including reducing the impact of plant pathogens. Six compost teas were prepared and tested for their ability to inhibit mycelial growth of strawberry pathogens and to suppress grey mould of strawberry. All compost teas inhibited the growth of Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, Phytophthora fragariae, and Verticillium dahliae, by 45-73%. Compost teas prepared from forest, sea, sheep, shrimp, and vermicomposts reduced grey mould lesions on strawberry leaves by 38-62% up to 12 days. Heat and cold sterilised compost teas did not provide inhibition of B. cinerea, indicating that presence of microorganisms seemed key to the activity of the compost tea. Total bacteria, Gram negative bacteria, and fungal/oomycete population numbers did not relate to effectiveness of the compost teas. Three isolates from sheep compost tea showed antibiosis-like activity. Isolates SH1 and SH2 resembled Bacillus velezensis and isolate SH3 resembled Pseudomonas azotoformans, following sequence analysis and phylogenetic relatedness testing. Results indicated that pathogen inhibition and grey mould suppression did not seem related to different microbial community groups or population numbers, but rather to the general presence of specific microbial groups or individual antagonistic microorganisms.

AB  - In West Africa, dairy production plays a vital role in the economy and the wellbeing of the population. Currently, dairy production has become vulnerable due to climate variability. The main objective of this study is to investigate dairy farmers' perceptions and adaptation strategies towards climate variability and change in West Africa. Individual interviews and focus group discussions were conducted among 900 dairy farmers. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to assess dairy farmers' perception of climate change. Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering on principal component analysis were used to access the adaptation strategies of dairy farmers. The results revealed that dairy farmers perceived a decrease in the length of the rainy season and the annual rainfall but an increase in the length of the dry season and the annual temperature that affect their activities. Dairy farmers that fed the cattle mainly with natural pastures, crop residues, and agroindustrial by-products in Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger, used as climate change adaptation strategies, transhumance in the wetland. They also used animal manure to improve fodder quality and plants to improve milk production and milk conservation. They sold milk or produced local cheese with the remaining unsold milk. Dairy farmers that mainly invested in fodder production and conservation in the climate zones of Mali, sold milk produced to dairies and cheese production units; used plants to improve milk production, pasteurization for milk conservation, and veterinary service for animal care. This study provided relevant information for West African policymakers in designing appropriate policies and programs to assist dairy farmers to improve milk production under climate variability and change.

AB  - Sargassum fluitans was composted alongside sheep manure, in a transformative process that significantly enhanced the algal material's properties. Post the screening/washing/screening pretreatment, the content of total volatile solids escalated to 73.20%, while ash content reduced to 16.45%. Concurrently, lignin values surged to 30.12% as the biodegradability factor declined to 21%. The pretreatment decreased electrical conductivity from 11.60 to 1.32 DS/m. Employing a central composite design and response surface analysis pinpointed the optimal substrate combinations for carbon/nitrogen ratios of 35:1 and 25:1. The chosen combinations presented a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.9589, carbon/nitrogen ratio; R2 = 0.6584, pH), indicative of a robust statistical fit. Over a 45-day period, composting was conducted using bioreactors or biopiles, maintaining near-neutral pH values and temperatures slightly above ambient levels. The composting process reduced up to 94% of fecal coliforms in the 1:1 combination. Physicochemical analyses confirmed that the final product is a valuable compost-soil improver, with great potential for usage in organic agriculture, reforestation, and urban green spaces. Hence, this research underscores composting as an efficient technique in managing organic waste, including the emergent and seasonal Sargassum fluitans, thus addressing a pressing environmental concern with an innovative, effective solution.

AB  - center dot The recent biological invasion of box tree moth Cydalima perspectalis on Buxus trees has a major impact on European boxwood stands through severe defoliation. This can hinder further regrowth and threaten survival of populations. center dot In a mesocosm approach and controlled larval density over a 2-month period, responses of B. sempervirens essential and specialized metabolites were characterized using metabolomics, combining H-1-NMR and LC-MS/MS approaches. This is the first metabolome depiction of major Buxus responses to boxwood moth invasion. center dot Under severe predation, remaining green leaves accumulate free amino acids (with the noticeable exception of proline). The leaf trans-4-hydroxystachydrine and stachydrine reached 10-13% and 2-3% (DW), while root content was lower but also modulated by predation level. Larval predation promoted triterpenoid and (steroidal) alkaloid synthesis and diversification, while flavonoids did not seem to have a relevant role in Buxus resistance. center dot Our results reveal the concomitant responses of central and specialized metabolism, in relation to severity of predation. They also confirm the potential of metabolic profiling using H-1-NMR and LC-MS to detect re-orchestration of metabolism of native boxwood after severe herbivorous predation by the invasive box-tree moth, and thus their relevance for plant-insect relationships and ecometabolomics.

AB  - The liver-gut axis is an important regulatory axis for the host's metabolic functions. The study of liver gene expression, changes in metabolic products and the regulation of gut microbial communities in plateau animals under harsh environments can reveal the mechanisms by which Tibetan goats adapt to the plateau environment. This study employs transcriptome, metabolome and metagenomic analyses to reveal the differences in genes, metabolism, and gut microbiota between Jianzhou big-eared goats (JBG) and Xizang cashmere goats (TCG), which is of significant importance for improving survival models of high-altitude ruminants. The results showed that there were 553 DEGs in the liver of JBG and TCG. Hepatic metabolomic analysis revealed significant differences in metabolic activity between the JBG and TCG groups, with notable increases in glycerophospholipid and retinol metabolic pathways. The gut microbiota, including Andreesenia, Dielma, Oscillibacter, Agrobacterium, Hyella and Thermosinus, interact with liver metabolites and can regulate the high-altitude adaptability of goats. This study reveals that TCG enhance immune regulation and energy utilization efficiency by regulating liver gene expression, modulating metabolic pathways, and improving gut microbiota, thereby helping TCG maintain healthy survival capabilities in hypoxic and high-radiation environments.

AB  - Ruminants differ in the pattern how small particles and liquids pass through their gastrointestinal tract, and in particular their reticulorumen (RR). Based on that they may be classified into 'moose-type' and 'cattle-type' species (smaller and larger differences between particle and liquid passage, respectively). The ratio between the retention of particles and fluids is called the 'selectivity factor' (SF) and is a species-specific characteristic, studied in tragulids, giraffids and bovids, but not in many cervid species. Recently, it has been suggested that a high SF might also serve to wash digesta clean of external abrasives prior to regurgitation for rumination. In this study, we measured SF and passage kinetics (using a liquid marker and markers of different particle size, fed with the diet) in a capreoline deer, the southern pudu (Pudu puda, n = 5, 10.3 +/- 2.9 kg, kept at two zoos) and a cervine deer, the Reeves's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi, n = 6, 11.0 +/- 1.7 kg, kept at a research facility). The relative daily dry matter intake (38 +/- 3 g/kg0.75 for pudu and 76 +/- 5 g/kg0.75 for muntjac) was higher, and the mean retention times (MRT) correspondingly shorter (e.g., MRT small particles in the total digestive tract 39 +/- 8 h for pudu and 15 +/- 2 h for muntjac), in the muntjac. The SF for small particles/liquid in the reticulorumen were, however, similar for both species, at 1.47 +/- 0.21 for pudu and 1.66 +/- 0.20 for muntjac, indicating a 'moose-type' physiology for both, irrespective of their different phylogenetic origin. To date, SF recorded in bovids attain distinctively higher values than the few reported for cervids. This situation reflects the degree of hypsodonty (tooth crown height) attained by these taxa, which is higher in bovids than in cervids. Together, constraints in hypsodonty as well as SF might limit cervids to more mesic habitats without distinct loads of external abrasives (such as dust or grit) on their food. In both species, some animals showed the typical ruminant pattern of a longer MRT for large than for small particle markers, but in some animals, this difference was not evident. This may be due to variable degrees of marker chewing during ingestion.

AB  - Abandoned houses (AH) present an utmost challenge confronting the urban environment in contemporary U.S. shrinking cities. Data accessibility is a major hurdle that prevents the acquisition of large-scale AH information at the individual property level. To this end, the latest revolution of open-access remote sensing platforms has witnessed a plethora of multi-source, multi-perspective fine-spatial-resolution data for urban environments, among which very-high-resolution (VHR) top-down view remote sensing images and horizontal-perspective Google Street View (GSV) images are prominent exemplifiers. In this study, we aim to map individual-level abandoned houses across cities by developing a method that can effectively leverage VHR remote sensing and GSV images. The proposed method is composed of four steps. First, we explored the feasibility of the three most relevant and complementary remote sensing data for individual-level AH detection, i.e., daytime VHR images, nighttime light VHR images, and GSV images. Second, we extracted discriminative features that are indicative of housing abandonment conditions from the three disparate data sources. Third, we applied decision-level fusion with Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) to better leverage the prior knowledge about data effectiveness. In the last step, a geographical random forests (GRF) model was first implemented to improve the predictions of where houses were occluded on GSV images. We mapped individual AH in two typical U.S. shrinking cities, Buffalo, NY, and Cleveland, OH, which allowed us to further explore the individual-property-level spatial characteristics of AH. Results revealed that the proposed DST fusion and GRF prediction consistently achieved promising per-formance across the two cities. Given the merits of incorporating open-access and multi-perspective data, our proposed method has the potential to be generalized to understanding regional and national-scale urban envi-ronments tackling housing abandonment challenges.

AB  - Phenology has emerged as a key metric to measure how species respond to changes in climate. Innovative means have been developed to extend the temporal and spatial range of phenological data by obtaining data from herbarium specimens, citizen science programs, and biodiversity data repositories. These different data types have seldom been compared for their effectiveness in detecting environmental impacts on phenology. To address this, we compare three separate phenology datasets from Denmark: (i) herbarium specimen data spanning 145 years, (ii) data collected from a citizen science phenology program over a single year observing first flowering, and (iii) data derived from incidental biodiversity observations in iNaturalist over a single year. Each dataset includes flowering day of year observed for three common spring-flowering plant species: Allium ursinum (ramsons), Aesculus hippocastanum (horse chestnut), and Sambucus nigra (black elderberry). The incidental iNaturalist dataset provided the most extensive geographic coverage across Denmark and the largest sample size and recorded peak flowering in a way comparable to herbarium specimens. The directed citizen science dataset recorded much earlier flowering dates because the program objective was to report the first flowering, and so was less compared to the other two datasets. Herbarium data demonstrated the strongest effect of spring temperature on flowering in Denmark, possibly because it was the only dataset measuring temporal variation in phenology, while the other datasets measured spatial variation. Herbarium data predicted the mean flowering day of year recorded in our iNaturalist dataset for all three species. Combining herbarium data with iNaturalist data provides an even more effective method for detecting climatic effects on phenology. Phenology observations from directed and incidental citizen science initiatives will increase in value for climate change research in the coming years with the addition of data capturing the inter-annual variation in phenology.

AB  - Sperm survival and activity depend on the provision of energy and nutrients from seminal plasma (SP). This study aimed to investigate the variations of metabolites within SP before and after freezing and subsequently explore the potential regulatory mechanisms affecting yak sperm cryodamage due to changes in metabolites in the SP. Untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed to screen for differential metabolites, followed by KEGG analysis to identify enriched signaling pathways. The combinatorial analysis of metabolomics and sperm proteomics revealed the influence of key SP metabolites on sperm proteins. Subsequently, the relevant differentially expressed proteins were verified by Western blot analysis. Finally, the mechanism underlying the positive effect of galactose on sperm motility was determined by assessing the change in ATP content in sperm before and after freezing and thawing. The data showed that a total of 425 and 269 metabolites were identified in the positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Freezing and thawing resulted in the up-regulation of 70 metabolites and the down-regulation of 29 metabolites in SP. The primary impact of freezing and thawing was observed in carbohydrate metabolism, including pyruvate metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, galactose metabolism, the TCA cycle, and butanoate metabolism. In the combined analysis and Western blot results, a significant positive correlation was observed between galactose and Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) (P < 0.05), which has the ability to convert galactose into galactol. Furthermore, the addition of galactose to thawed semen improved sperm motility by increasing AKR1B1 protein in sperm and was associated with the content of ATP. These data identify differential metabolites between fresh and frozen-thawed SP and suggest that galactose is a valuable additive for cryopreserved sperm, providing a theoretical basis for further exploration of the refrigerant formula for yak sperm cryopreservation.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to investigate the diversity of Balantioides coli (B. coli) based on the 18S rDNA of isolates collected from weaned pigs with diarrhea and then select a B. coli isolate to determine its pathogenicity in weaned pigs through experimental infection. Methods The genetic analysis of field-isolated B. coli strains was based on sequencing of the partial 18S rDNA genetic fragment and the pathogenicity of an isolate of B. coli (DN2018-2-DTD) was identified through an experimental infection. Results The fourteen B. coli isolates shared 98.47-100% nucleotide similarity and were divided into two clades in a phylogenetic tree. In an infection experiment, a slight increase in the body temperature was identified in two infected groups as compared to that in the control group (P < 0.05) from days post-infection (dpi) 12-18 and from dpi 20-27. In the group infected with 3000 CPG/TPG, 2/9 pigs started to develop diarrhea on day two. In the group infected with 500 CPG/TPG, 8/9 pigs had diarrhea on dpi 3. Trophozoites/cysts of B. coli were firstly detected in feces on dpi 3 in a group of pigs infected with a dose of 3000 CPG/TPG, and CPG/TPG reached its peak at dpi 5 in both groups of infected pigs (35,450 and 13,250 CPG/TPG). There was a significant difference in the bodyweight of the control group (noninfected) as compared to that of the groups of infected pigs on dpi 7 (P < 0.05), 14 (P < 0.001) and 28 (P < 0.01). Lesions were solely recorded in infected pigs, including white ulcerative nodules with necrosis scattered in the mucosa of the colon and cecum on dpi 7, 14, and 28. Conclusion This is the first study to investigate the pathogenicity of B. coli in Vietnamese pigs to demonstrate that B. coli could induce necrotic ulcerative enteritis and diarrhea in weaned pigs.

AB  - Wild boars have become a common yet controversial species in France, where the main response to the species' development and the problems it may cause is an increased hunting effort. However, wild boars are an extremely adaptive species, and their response to human activities (including hunting) is not fully understood. Moreover, hunting may be a source of conflict with other stakeholders and a topic for public debate, which questions its sustainability. To discuss wild boar behaviour, as well as (other) means to coexist with these animals, we developed a role-playing board game framed around wild boars and hunting. In this paper, we outline the design of the WILD BOAR(D) GAME and reflect on the first three game sessions, which we conducted in our research areas (Gorges du Gardon and Camargue Biosphere Reserves, France). We show that a continuous back and forth between the game and reality allows the participants to elicit their knowledge as well as learn from the other participants, which contributes to filling in the knowledge gaps identified previously in the game design as well as mitigating conflicts regarding wild boars. Finally, we discuss the interest of including wild boars as a role in itself to reflect on their agency.

AB  - Introduction: A thorough understanding of the microbial ecology within the swine value chain is essential to develop new strategies to optimize the microbiological quality of pork products. To our knowledge, no study to date has followed the microbiota through the value chain from live farm animals to the cuts of meat obtained for market. The objective of this study is to evaluate how the microbiota of pigs and their environment influence the microbial composition of samples collected throughout the value chain, including the meat plant and meat cuts.Method and results: Results from 16S rDNA sequencing, short-chain fatty acid concentrations and metabolomic analysis of pig feces revealed that the microbiota from two farms with differing sanitary statuses were distinctive. The total aerobic mesophilic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae counts from samples collected at the meat plant after the pre-operation cleaning and disinfection steps were at or around the detection limit and the pigs from the selected farms were the first to be slaughtered on each shipment days. The bacterial counts of individual samples collected at the meat plant did not vary significantly between the farms. Alpha diversity results indicate that as we move through the steps in the value chain, there is a clear reduction in the diversity of the microbiota. A beta diversity analysis revealed a more distinct microbiota at the farms compared to the meat plant which change and became more uniform as samples were taken towards the end of the value chain. The source tracker analysis showed that only 12.92% of the microbiota in shoulder samples originated from the farms and 81% of the bacteria detected on the dressed carcasses were of unknown origin.Discussion: Overall, the results suggest that with the current level of microbial control at farms, it is possible to obtain pork products with similar microbiological quality from different farms. However, broader studies are required to determine the impact of the sanitary status of the herd on the final products.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate whether conventional farming can be replaced by a lower chemical pollution farming system, integrated rice-duck farming in a suburban agricultural area in northern Zhejiang, Southeast China. We comprehensively assessed the impacts of integrated rice-duck farming on weeds and herbivorous insects along with their natural enemies during the rice-growing season. We found that the rice-duck system effectively controlled weeds within the paddy fields. Nevertheless, the abundance of herbivores, particularly planthoppers and leafhoppers was increased in the duck-roaming paddy fields compared to the control and conventional fields, indicating the inefficiency of the rice-duck system in the control of rice main herbivore pests. Rice-duck farming significantly reduced the abundance of predators, especially spiders and dragonflies, therefore an 'enemy-free space' was created for herbivores which might be responsible for the observed herbivore increase in the rice-duck fields. Despite the inefficiency of rice-duck farming in the control of rice main herbivore pests, the net income of the rice-duck treatment with an organic certification was 7.6 and 1.4 times higher compared to the conventional and control treatments, respectively. In the view of the favourable results obtained in this study, the integrated rice-duck farming system might be suggested as a high economic return organic farming method suitable for modern farmers.

AB  - The high-osmolarity glycerol mitogen-activated protein kinase (HOG-MAPK) pathway plays a central role in environmental stress adaptation in eukaryotes. However, the biological function of the HOG-MAPK pathway varies in different fungi. In this study, we investigated the HOG-MAPK pathway by inactivation of the core element Hog1 in Botryosphaeria dothidea, the causal agent of Botryosphaeria canker and apple ring rot. Targeted deletion of BdHOG1 resulted in the loss of conidiation ability and significant reduction of virulence. In addition, the Delta BdHog1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to osmotic stress but resistance to phenylpyrrole and dicarboximide fungicides. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that inactivation of BdHog1 influenced multiple metabolic pathways in B. dothidea. Taken together, our results suggest that BdHog1 plays a crucial role in development, virulence, and stress tolerance in B. dothidea, which provides a theoretical basis for the development of target-based fungicides.

AB  - Drought stress is one of the most important factors in reducing yield and seed quality of rapeseed. Therefore, in this study, several new rapeseed genotypes were evaluated to provide practical solutions to reduce the effects of drought stress or improve canola yield. Seed and oil yield, fatty acids, physiological features, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes were assessed in late-season drought stress conditions with the foliar application of silicon. A factorial split-plot experiment was performed in a randomized complete block design with three replications in two cropping years, 2016-2018. Treatments included irrigation at two levels (normal irrigation (control) and limited irrigation from the silique formation stage onwards) and foliar application at two levels (0 and 4 g L-1 of silicon), as factorial in the main plots, and spring rapeseed genotypes (Dalgan, RGS003, RGS x OKAPI, RGS x SLM, and OG x AL) as subplots. The results showed the highest seed yield (5620 kg ha(-1)), oil yield (2601 kg ha(-1)), oleic acid (68.16%), and linoleic acid (18.68%) was obtained in normal irrigation conditions along with the foliar application of silicon in OG x AL. Drought stress increased the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase enzymes in all genotypes. Among the genotypes, both RGS x SLM and Dalgan were the best (with high seed yield and oil quality) in late-season drought conditions when silicon was applied. In arid and semi-arid locations, introducing and diversifying rapeseed genotypes are one of the management techniques for achieving satisfactory yield. The quality of rapeseed oil diminishes as a result of environmental challenges. However, the foliar application of nutrients can help mitigate the impacts of drought stress. As a result, the current study's findings revealed that silicon positively improved rapeseed drought tolerance during the late growing season.

AB  - Callioratis millari Hampson (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is a Critically Endangered moth endemic to South Africa. Despite extensive searches, it was previously known only from the Entumeni Nature Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, where its larvae exclusively feed on the cycad Stangeria eriopus (Kunze) Baill (Cycadales: Stangeriaceae). In July 2022, a new population of C. millari was discovered in the Kabouga section of Addo Elephant National Park in the Eastern Cape. Larvae of C. millari were feeding on the cycad Encephalartos caffer (Thunb.) Lehm (Cycadales: Zamiaceae), which also constitutes a new host record. In June 2023, we determined larval incidence and herbivory at this new locality, offering insights into the ecological requirements of C. millari. Known C. millari localities, although ecologically different, share low altitudes (700-950 m a.s.l.), moderate to high rainfall, and grassy habitats with sparse woody cover. A total of 59 larvae were counted in Kabouga, mostly in the fifth and sixth (final) instars. Herbivory incidence was lower on smaller plants and those covered by other vegetation. The flight period of adult C. millari likely occurs between mid-March and April in Kabouga, but further investigation is needed to clarify this. The peak period of larval occurrence in Kabouga occurs during the driest and coldest months of the year (May-July). Considering limited habitat availability, host plant poaching, and the risk of untimely fires, the species should be considered highly threatened. This study adds to our understanding of the biology of C. millari and provides information on its ecological requirements and may contribute to making informed management decisions.

AB  - Leaf variegation, the mosaic of colors on the leaf surface, can be developed by certain plant species without external influence. Although it may be associated with a variety of functions, the stable existence of different leaf color morphs within a plant species has not been fully explained by previous studies. This study focuses on the two leaf morphs of Cypripedium forrestii, an endangered lady slipper orchid, and compares their micromorphological structure, photosynthetic potential, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and ecological features to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying leaf variegation polymorphism. Our findings demonstrate that leaf variegation is not pathological and does not affect photosynthetic potential. Additionally, it significantly reduces herbivory damage. We found that the probability of herbivory and leaf area loss for variegated leaves was notably higher under drought conditions. Therefore, variegated individuals may be more adaptive under such conditions, while non-variegated ones may be more cost-effective in normal years. These results suggest that different leaf color morphs may be favored by varying environmental conditions, and leaf polymorphism may be a legacy of ancient climate and herbivore fluctuations.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is one of the major conservation challenges for elephants. To address this issue, understanding the ecological and sociological perspectives of HEC is crucial. In North Bengal, India, we explored 25 electrocution cases of Asiatic elephants (Elephas maximus) and surveyed the attitudes of 209 local people toward elephants and the HEC management authority (forest officials). We used open-ended and closed-ended questionnaires in the surveys and binomial logistic regressions to analyze the datasets. We observed that electrocutions primarily occurred during cropping seasons and adult elephants mostly died in these incidences. Despite experiencing high HEC, most respondents had a positive attitude toward elephants. However, they felt differently about the forest officials. Key factors driving their attitudes include cultural, emotional, and economic associations with elephants, HEC-related costs, and perceptions of HEC management. Community participatory approaches and financial and technical support are recommended for local people in HEC management.

AB  - Vehicle collisions with animals pose serious issues in countries with well-developed highway networks. Both expanding wildlife populations and the development of urbanised areas reduce the potential contact distance between wildlife species and vehicles. Many recent studies have been conducted to better understand the factors that influence wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) and provide mitigation methods. Most of these studies examined road density, traffic volume, seasonal fluctuations, etc. However, in analysing the distribution of WVC, few studies have considered a spatial and significant distance geostatistical analysis approach that includes how different land-use categories are associated with the distance to WVCs. Our study investigated the spatial distribution of agricultural land, meadows and pastures, forests, built-up areas, rivers, lakes, and ponds, to highlight the most dangerous sections of roadways where WVCs occur. We examined six potential 'hot spot' distances (5-10-25-50-100-200 m) to evaluate the role different landscape elements play in the occurrence of WVC. The near analysis tool showed that a distance of 10-25 m to different landscape elements provided the most sensitive results. Hot spots associated with agricultural land, forests, as well as meadows and pastures, peaked on roadways in close proximity (10 m), while hot spots associated with built-up areas, rivers, lakes, and ponds peaked on roadways farther (200 m) from these land-use types. We found that the order of habitat importance in WVC hot spots was agricultural land < forests < meadows and pastures < built-up areas < rivers < lakes and ponds. This methodological approach includes general hot-spot analysis as well as differentiated distance analysis which helps to better reveal the influence of landscape structure on WVCs.

AB  - Goat lactoferrin is an N-glycoprotein, and its glycan moieties are essential for its biological activity. However, the structures of these glycans, particularly the sialylated isomers with alpha-2,3- or alpha-2,6-linkages, remain poorly characterized. Utilizing online hydrophilic liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, our study characterized N-glycans in goat lactoferrin across different lactation stages, and the putative structures of the 86 N-glycans of goat lactoferrin were presented, including 53 previously undetected ones. The content and variety of N-glycans decreased from colostrum to mature milk, with transitional milk exhibiting the highest levels of neutral and high-mannose N-glycans. Colostrum was particularly rich in fucose- and sialylated N-glycans, especially those with alpha-2,6-linkages. Notably, the alpha-2,6-linked sialylated N-glycan H5N4F1A1-1 was 7.09-fold and 12.85-fold more abundant in colostrum compared to transitional and mature milk, respectively. These findings provide valuable insights into the structure of lactoferrin and could facilitate the development of functional goat milk products.

AB  - This paper is a synthesis of zooarchaeological evidence from 27 medieval and post-medieval sites from Finland. These faunal samples derive from rural, town, manor, castle and ecclesiastic sites, and their production and consumption patterns were examined by studying the role of the major domesticates (cattle, sheep, goats and pigs). As taxonomic abundance in faunal material may be altered by taphonomic processes, such as burning, these factors were assessed before comparison. The animal husbandry system in Finland was shaped by environmental constraints that limited the number of animals that could be kept over winter. However, some specialisations were observed within the frame of the basic pattern. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of zooarchaeological data in the study of animal husbandry and consumption and production patterns. These findings support data integration as a useful tool for understanding general large-scale processes, such as urbanisation, development, environmental adaptation and the specialisation of animal production.

AB  - Animal personality refers to consistent individual differences in behavior that are widely seen across the animal kingdom, but only recently has interest in animal personality of livestock species flourished. This review first establishes common terminology to better understand how personality testing methods originating in primates, great tits, and rodents have been adapted and applied for use in livestock species, specifically chickens, goats, sheep, pigs and cattle. This review outlines the most common personality tests utilized to measure personality traits for each highlighted livestock species, providing a brief historical background for the basis of these tests. The personality traits inferred from these tests are described in terms of their use for research and commercial purposes, and how personality traits are associated with animal performance. This review does not present an exhaustive review of the field, but rather serves to highlight the different personality traits that have been assessed in livestock using key research examples.

AB  - This study aimed to assessing of effect of holding (Ezab) type on flock composition and use in Qatar. A survey was conducted to sheep and goats' holdings. The questionnaire information included holdings' area, supervisor education level, flock's type, age, and sex composition and use of production. Survey sample size was 380 holdings. Data was tested for significance of variation between holding types using chi square for qualitative traits and one-way analysis of variance for quantitative data. With no variation among types, holdings rearing mixed flocks were 68.1% of total. Percentages of females/flock, adult males to adult females, female offspring of all offspring, offspring below one year/flock and flocks' breeding value were not different among holdings. Roving Ezab had the largest total area, whereas, compound Ezab had the smallest total area. Compound Ezab had the largest values of barn area/animal and percent of shaded barn part. All the type of holding mainly use their production for only slaughter to their own needs except Roving Ezab type that also practiced selling their production. 90% of all holdings types except farms had the education level of supervisor between no education and primary education, whereas, 20% farms had supervisor's education was secondary and above. It is concluded that small ruminants were raised mainly in mixed sheep and goats' flocks. Sex and age compositions of flocks was not variable among holding types. Holding area was not used efficiently for animal production. The study availed marked highlights about potential of traditional system of small ruminants' national flock.

AB  - An experiment was conducted from 2016 to 2017 to assess the effect of kernel metabolism in development stages after organic mulching compared to control. Organic mulching significantly increased crop yields (higher 128% in 2016, higher 60% in 2017), oil content (the highest oil content was 27.6% higher than that of the control), and improved soil properties (SOC, SAN, AP, and AK). In this study, soil pH, SOC, AN, AP, and AK in 0-30 cm soil depth were measured. Results showed that the effect of mulching on soil pH was not significant at the harvesting stage. The greatest metabolic differences occurred during the period of high oil conversion (S2-S4), primarily involving 11 relevant metabolic pathways. This further verified that Camellia oleifera oil yield was improved after mulching. A total of 1,106 OTUs were detected by using 16S rRNA, and Venn diagram showed that there were 106 unique OTUs in control and 103 OTUs in the treatment, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that soil pH and soil temperature were two indicators with the most correlations with soil microbiota. The yield was significantly positively correlated with soil microbial Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and soil nutrition indexes. Organic mulching improved the physicochemical properties of soils, caused differences in the relative abundance of dominant bacteria in soil bacteria, and improved the soil microbiological environment to promote plant growth, indicating that organic mulching is an effective measure to alleviate seasonal drought.

AB  - The Early Cretaceous terrestrial revolution involved global shifts from gymnosperm- to angiosperm-dominated floras. However, responses of insect herbivores to these changes remain unexamined. We evaluated 2 176 highly sampled plant specimens representing 62 species/morphotypes from the 126 Ma Dawangzhangzi plant assemblage of Northeastern China. Our study consisted of horsetails, ferns, ginkgoaleans, czekanowskialeans, conifers, and an angiosperm. Their herbivory was evaluated by the functional feeding groups of hole feeding, margin feeding, and surface feeding (ectophytic feeders); piercer and suckers, and ovipositing insects (ectoendophytic feeders); mining, galling, and borings (endophytic feeders); and pathogens, collectively constituting 65 damage types (DTs). The plant assemblage was assessed for herbivory richness by DT richness, component community structure, and DT specialization on plant hosts; for herbivory intensity, it was evaluated for DT frequency, herbivorized surface area, and feeding event occurrences. Using feeding event occurrences, the data supported seven species/morphotypes as most intensely herbivorized: Liaoningocladus boii (76.6%), Czekanowskia sp. 1 (8.4%), Czekanowskia rigida (4.10%), Lindleycladus lanceolatus (3.5%), Ginkgoites sp. 2 (2.0%), Podozamites sp. 1 (1.1%), and Solenites sp. 1 (0.9%). The most herbivorized taxa were pinaleans (conifers), then czekanowskialeans, and lastly ginkgoaleans; the monodominant component community was the conifer Liaoningocladus boii. DT host specialization levels were low. The plant assemblage had an overall low 0.86% of foliage removed by herbivores, explained by physical and chemical antiherbivore defenses, and parasitoid attack. Although Paleozoic, gymnosperm-dominated assemblages had greater herbivory, component community structure of the three most herbivorized taxa are more similar to modern bracken fern and willow than modern gymnosperm taxa.

AB  - The study of reciprocal adaptation in interacting species has been an active and inspiring area of evolutionary research for nearly 60 years. Perhaps owing to its great natural history and potential consequences spanning population divergence to species diversification, coevolution continues to capture the imagination of biologists. Here we trace developments following Ehrlich and Raven's classic paper, with a particular focus on the modern influence of two studies by Dr. May Berenbaum in the 1980s. This series of classic work presented a compelling example exhibiting the macroevolutionary patterns predicted by Ehrlich and Raven and also formalized a microevolutionary approach to measuring selection, functional traits, and understanding reciprocal adaptation between plants and their herbivores. Following this breakthrough was a wave of research focusing on diversifying macroevolutionary patterns, mechanistic chemical ecology, and natural selection on populations within and across community types. Accordingly, we breakdown coevolutionary theory into specific hypotheses at different scales: reciprocal adaptation between populations within a community, differential coevolution among communities, lineage divergence, and phylogenetic patterns. We highlight progress as well as persistent gaps, especially the link between reciprocal adaptation and diversification.

AB  - Simple Summary Plastic pollution presents a growing concern for marine biodiversity, and among these, anthropogenic particles (APs) are entering marine ecosystems at an alarming rate from land and sea sources. In this study, we quantify the ingestion of APs across fish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers (echinoderms), bivalves (molluscs), and jellyfish (cnidarians), identify biotic and abiotic factors that might influence the ingested items; and identify ingestion patterns based on taxonomic groups, trophic guilds, and habitats. Ingestion of APs was observed in the majority of the species analyses with occurrence ranging from 0% to 100%. The study results indicate that plastic pollution poses a threat to species found within the marine protected area of the Cabrera Marine-Terrestrial National Park despite their protection status. The multispecies approach provided a better understanding of the high level of AP exposure to species, highlighting the associated damage to marine biodiversity related to marine waste. We have applied a multispecies ecosystem approach to analyse the ingestion of anthropogenic particles (AP) in the gastrointestinal tract of 313 individuals (17 fish species and 8 invertebrate species) from pelagic, demersal and benthic habitats in a marine protected area off the Western Mediterranean (Cabrera National Park). We have quantified and characterized the ingestion at several taxonomic levels of fish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, bivalves, and jellyfish in relation to biotic/abiotic factors based on taxonomic groups, trophic guilds (functional groups) and habitats. AP ingestion occurrence ranged from 26 to 100% with no significant differences among taxonomic groups. The fish within the MPA showed an overall ingestion occurrence ranging from 0 to 100%, the echinoderms from 29 to 100%, the bivalves from 72 to 96% and the jellyfish 36% ingestion. The ecosystem approach applied to evaluate overall AP ingestion within the species reported that for trophic guilds, the omnivorous species ingested the highest amounts of anthropogenic items, while herbivores ingested significantly fewer items than all other trophic guilds. Moreover, no significant differences were found amongst habitats, indicating a homogeneous spatial distribution of APs at all studied habitats. The multispecies approach provided insight into the high APs exposure to species within Cabrera MPA, highlighting the potential harm linked with marine litter that threatens marine biodiversity.

AB  - Plants associate with both aboveground and belowground mutualists, two prominent examples being ants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), respectively. While both of these mutualisms have been extensively studied, joint manipulations testing their independent and interactive (non-additive) effects on plants are rare. To address this gap, we conducted a joint test of ant and AMF effects on herbivory by leaf-chewing insects attacking potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants, and further measured plant traits likely mediating mutualist effects on herbivory. In a field experiment, we factorially manipulated the presence of AMF (two levels: control and mycorrhization) and ants (two levels: exclusion and presence) and quantified the concentration of leaf phenolic compounds acting as direct defenses, as well as plant volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions potentially mediating direct (e.g., herbivore repellents) or indirect (e.g., ant attractants) defense. Moreover, we measured ant abundance and performed a dual-choice greenhouse experiment testing for effects of VOC blends (mimicking those emitted by control vs. AMF-inoculated plants) on ant attraction as a mechanism for indirect defense. Ant presence significantly reduced herbivory whereas mycorrhization had no detectable influence on herbivory and mutualist effects operated independently. Plant trait measurements indicated that mycorrhization had no effect on leaf phenolics but significantly increased VOC emissions. However, mycorrhization did not affect ant abundance and there was no evidence of AMF effects on herbivory operating via ant-mediated defense. Consistently, the dual-choice assay showed no effect of AMF-induced volatile blends on ant attraction. Together, these results suggest that herbivory on potato plants responds mainly to top-down (ant-mediated) rather than bottom-up (AMF-mediated) control, an asymmetry in effects which could have precluded mutualist non-additive effects on herbivory. Further research on this, as well as other plant systems, is needed to examine the ecological contexts under which mutualist interactive effects are more or less likely to emerge and their impacts on plant fitness and associated communities.

AB  - Camelina, a traditional oil-producing plant, has gained global interest due to the high-quality oil found in its seeds. It has numerous applications, including human dietary consumption, aviation biofuel, and biodiesel production. Seed quality testing is crucial for identifying suitable seed batches for market sale. Currently, vigor tests have been established for a limited selection of commercially cultivated plant species, including camelina. This study aims to assess seed vigor and contribute to the development and validation of methods/tests for reliable vigor assessment. The experiment used two camelina genotypes developed at the Institute of Field and Vegetables Crops in Novi Sad, Serbia. The findings revealed a noteworthy reduction in germination percentages for both genotypes across all the conducted tests, as compared to the conventional laboratory germination. Simultaneously, there was a notable increase in abnormal seedlings. However, no statistically significant differences in the values of growth parameters were observed among the applied tests. In summary, the reduced seed vigor values indicate potential issues with this trait, despite generally sound germination. Additionally, the preliminary findings and methodology developed for testing the camelina seed vigor highlighted the need for optimization when applying these tests to other species to ensure their reliability and applicability.

We investigated tem-poral and spatial variation in concentrations of radiocaesium among five functional groups of alpine plants at two mountain areas in central Norway over a 31-year period from 1991 to 2022. Average concentrations of radiocaesium were initially high in lichens and bryophytes at around 4600-6400 Bq/kg dry weight during 1991-1994 but then decreased dramatically over three decades to current concentrations of <200 Bq/kg for all plant groups in 2019-2022. The effective half-life of radiocaesium was estimated to be 4-6 years in lichens and mosses, 7-13 years in herbaceous plants, and 22-30 years in woody plants, which were less than the physical half-life of 30.2 years. Concentrations of radiocaesium were greater at the nutrient-poor site than at the nutrient-rich site, probably due to greater deposition levels at higher elevations and the geographical pattern of the deposition. Functional groups of plants differed with higher concentrations among non-vascular than vascular plants. Common heather Calluna vulgaris was unusual among woody plants with high concentration of radio-caesium, especially in the new shoots. Our new estimates of concentrations and dynamics of radiocaesium for alpine plants in natural environments will be useful for modelling herbivore exposure and evaluating potential impacts on wildlife and human health.

AB  - Pinus edulis Engelm. (pinyon pine) is a tree in the Pinaceae family with wide geographic distribution throughout dry forests of western North America. Pinyon pine seed cones, which mature over a 2-year period before shedding seed, are often resinous. Conifer resin, which is a liquid-soluble mixture of volatile and non-volatile secondary metabolites, typically demonstrates significant ecological functions. In the current study, seed cones (n = 240) were collected monthly for a 1-year period from pinyon pine trees (n = 20) and separated equally into two groups, resinous and non-resinous cones, for research on the volatile compound chemistry and insect herbivory. Upon distillation, resinous cones yielded 41x more volatile oil and contained more viable seeds, compared to non-resinous cones. Chemical profiles of volatile oils were seemingly consistent between seasons but differed between cone groups. In resinous cone samples, volatile oils were largely composed of alpha-pinene (avg. 75.6%) and delta-3-carene (avg. 7.4%). In contrast, in non-resinous cone samples, the volatile oil profiles were not dominated by any single prominent compound. Cone inquiline insect communities varied with regard to the resinous status of the cones, the month of collection, and with overall volatile oil yield. Typically, with larger oil yields we saw more diverse and more abundant inquiline communities. Findings from this study suggest that the volatile oils, in addition to other components of cone resin and physical structures, play a significant ecological role in pinyon pine seed preservation from insect herbivory.

AB  - Biomanipulation by piscivore stocking has been widely used to combat eutrophication in north temperate lakes, but its applicability in warm lakes has not yet been well elucidated. Here, we used experimental mesocosms to test the effects of a native benthi-piscivore (snakehead, Channa argus Cantor) on water clarity under subtropical conditions where small omni-benthivorous fish like crucian carp (Carassius carassius L.) prevail. Our results showed that, despite of a great reduction of crucian carp biomass, snakehead stocking did not create a strong trophic cascade as neither (herbivorous) zooplankton biomass nor their grazing pressure, indicated by biomass ratio of (herbivorous) zooplankton to phytoplankton, changed significantly. Moreover, snakehead stocking significantly increased water non-algal turbidity as well as nutrient and chlorophyll -a concentrations, suggesting that these benthi-piscivores also disturbed sediments like crucian carp did. Our study showed that biomanipulation by stocking of snakehead does not facilitate clear-water state in warm shallow lakes, even on the short-term.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are molecules with a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. These peptides are widely distributed in insects, amphibians and mammals. Indeed, they are key molecules of the innate immune system with remarkable antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity. Besides, these peptides have also shown regulatory activity for gut microbiota and have been considered inductors of growth performance. The current review describes the updated findings of antimicrobial peptides in domestic animals, such as bovines, goats, sheep, pigs, horses, canines and felines, analyzing the most relevant aspects of their use as potential therapeutics and their applications in Veterinary medicine.

AB  - Simple Summary Goat meat constitutes one of the main animal protein sources in the human diet in developing countries. Consumers realize that there are multiple links between diet and happiness. Livestock feeding strategies can increase the concentration of a number of healthy fatty acids. Forages play an important role in maintaining rumen function. This preliminary investigation evaluated the effects of feeding different mixed hays grown in the orchard on meat quality, fatty acids, amino acids, and the gastrointestinal tract microbial ecosystem. The results indicated that goats fed alfalfa + oats mixed hay displayed a more favorable fatty acid profile and microbiota for human health. Feeding higher nutritional value forage is a good strategy for providing high-quality goat meat and is beneficial to the ruminant production system. This preliminary investigation was designed to study the effects of different mixed orchard hays on meat quality, fatty acids, amino acids, rumen intestinal microflora, and the relationship between rumen bacteria and fatty acids in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Saanen dairy goats. In this preliminary investigation, goats were separately fed crop straws (corn and wheat straws) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (CK group), alfalfa + oats (Avena sativa L.) (group I), alfalfa + perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (group II), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) + perennial ryegrass (group III). There were differences in shear force and cooking loss between treatments. The contents of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0 in the CK group were significantly higher than those in other three groups (p < 0.001). The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in group II were higher than those in other three groups (p < 0.05). Association analysis showed that Prevotella_1 was negatively correlated with C18:0 and significantly positively correlated with C16:1, while Clostridium and Romboutsia showed a positive correlation with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Therefore, feeding mixed hays can increase beneficial fatty acids and the percentages of associated bacteria in rumen and intestines.

AB  - Habitat use is a virtually universal activity among animals and is highly relevant as regards designing wildlife management and conservation actions. This has led to the development of a great variety of methods to study it, of which resource selection functions combined with biologging-derived data (RSF) is the most widely used for this purpose. However this approach has some constraints, such as its invasiveness and high costs. Analytical approaches taking into consideration imperfect detection coupled with camera trap data (IDM) have, therefore, emerged as a non-invasive cost-effective alternative. However, despite the fact that both approaches (RSF and IDM) have been used in habitat selection studies, they should also be comparatively assessed. The objective of this work is consequently to assess them from two perspectives: explanatory and predictive. This has been done by analyzing data obtained from camera traps (60 sampling sites) and biologging (17 animals monitored: 7 red deer Cervus elaphus, 6 fallow deer Dama dama and 4 wild boar Sus scrofa) in the same periods using IDM and RSF, respectively, in Donana National Park (southern Spain) in order to explain and predict habitat use patterns for three studied species. Our results showed discrepancies between the two approaches, as they identified different predictors as being the most relevant to determine species intensity of use, and they predicted spatial patterns of habitat use with a contrasted level of concordance, depending on species and scale. Given these results and the characteristics of each approach, we suggested that although partly comparable interpretations can be obtained with both approaches, they are not equivalent but rather complementary. The combination of data from biologging and camera traps would, therefore, appear to be suitable for the development of an analytical framework with which to describe and characterise the habitat use processes of wildlife.

AB  - The practice of planting even-aged spruce monoculture has long tradition in the Czech Republic. Although these stands are due to climate change expected to suffer from increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events, their conversion has been too slow. Hence, to suggest policies that will effectively support the conversion from spruce monocultures to the recommended mixed stands, the drivers behind forest managers decision making must be understood.In this study we aim to reveal the attitudes of Czech forest managers towards even-aged spruce monocultures and mixed stands and understand the drivers behind their decision making in terms of developing mixed forests. To this end, a questionnaire survey among 52 Czech forest managers was conducted; the enterprises employing the respondents were in charge of 29% of forest land in the Czech Republic. The results showed that forest managers are well-informed about alternative mixed stands and ameliorative and soil-improving species, which they consider not only ecologically advantageous but also economically acceptable. We revealed that the deci-sion making of forest managers is affected by a combination of multiple factors: (a) long-term experience with spruce profitability, particularly the ability to provide not only long-term income but also short term yield; (b) steady high spruce-timber tradability; (c) a steady business-as-usual mindset of forest managers; and (d) missing effective measures for preventing damage by wild ungulates.

AB  - Darwin described several 'checks on increase', later termed 'hostile forces of nature', four of which are thought to be the principal forces shaping group size in animals: predation, food scarcity, disease and hostile conspecifics. However, the simultaneous effects of all four forces on group size have yet to be investigated in the wild. We set out to do so in wild equids. Equids fall into two social types: modular societies of stable bands that combine into unstable herds (e.g. plains zebras, Equus quagga) and societies of highly fluid groups (e.g. Grevy's zebras, Equus grevyi). We conducted censuses of zebra groups in sympatric populations of plains and Grevy's zebras across three sites over 3 years. Group size was not associated with predation risk (site-specific lion density) or hostile conspecifics (bachelor pressure, estimated using male:female ratios) for either species, although our measure of the latter may have been too crude to capture its effect. Neither species disaggregated when disease risk was high (in the wet season), but Grevy's zebras did so when food was scarce (in the dry season). Grevy's zebras are aridadapted and their social cohesion may have evolved to be more sensitive to food scarcity than that of the more mesic-adapted plains zebras. Both species aggregated in open habitat, as do many group-living herbivores, a behaviour that may be attributable to indirect effects of predation risk or bachelor pressure, or to aggregation around common resources.

AB  - Simple Summary Concerns about animal welfare practices have increased as consumer awareness and regulatory standards have evolved. This study investigated the effects of lairage conditions on welfare and meat quality of pigs during lairage periods. A total of 3070 finishing pigs were assigned to one of six groups arranged in two trials in a 2 x 3 factorial design according to the illuminance (under 40 lux (LX), over 40 lux (HX)) and stocking density (low density (LD), higher than 0.83 m2/100 kg; normal density (ND), 0.50-0.83 m2/100 kg; high density (HD), lower than 0.50 m2/100 kg) with high temperature (HT), higher than 24 degrees C; low temperature (LT), lower than 10 degrees C. Based on the obtained results, stocking of too-high (lower than 0.50 m2/100 kg) density at HT and stocking of too-low (higher than 0.83 m2/100 kg) density at LT are generally not good for meat quality and animal welfare.Abstract This study investigated the effects of lairage conditions on the welfare and meat quality of pigs during lairage periods.

Pigs stocked with HD showed lower aggression behavior and overlap behavior than those stocked with LD at LT. Pigs stocked with HD showed higher standing, sitting, and aggression behavior than those stocked with LD at HT. Pigs stocked with HD showed higher pH than those stocked with LD at LT. At HT, pigs stocked with LD showed higher pH, WHC, DL, and CL than those stocked with HD. At LT, pigs stocked with LD showed higher cortisol levels than those stocked with HD. However, pigs stocked with LD showed lower cortisol levels than those stocked with HD at HT. Based on the obtained results, stocking of too-high (lower than 0.50 m2/100 kg) density at HT and stocking of too-low (higher than 0.83 m2/100 kg) density at LT are generally not good for meat quality and animal welfare.

AB  - Simple Summary Male and female red deer typically live separately in single-sex groups throughout the year, except during the mating season when they come together in mixed groups to mate. This phenomenon is known as sexual segregation. Some experts believe that this segregation occurs because males and females have different nutritional requirements due to their distinct body sizes. Our study delves into the diets of both sexes in a Mediterranean mountainous environment and provides evidence that diet may be a contributing factor to sexual segregation. Our findings indicate that males consume more arboreal species, while both sexes primarily consume shrub species. Additionally, our research highlights the importance of evaluating other factors that may impact sexual segregation in ungulates across various species and populations. Sexual segregation is a common phenomenon among animals, particularly dimorphic ones. Although widely addressed, the reasons and consequences of sexual segregation are still an important topic in need of better understanding. In this study, we mainly evaluate the diet composition and feeding behaviour of animals, which are related to the use of different habitats by the sexes, a special case of sexual segregation also termed habitat segregation. Sexually size dimorphic males and females often have different energetic and nutritional needs and, thus, different diets. We collected fresh faecal samples from wild Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) in Portugal. Samples were analysed in terms of diet composition and quality. As expected, both sexes differed in their diet composition, with males eating more arboreous species than females, but this difference was affected by sampling periods. Diet composition of both sexes had the biggest differences (and the lowest overlap) in spring, which corresponds to the end of gestation and beginning of birth. These differences might be a consequence of the sexual body size dimorphism characteristic of this species, as well as of different needs due to different reproductive costs. No differences regarding the quality of the excreted diet were observed. Our results may help to understand some patterns of sexual segregation observed in this red deer population. However, besides foraging ecology, other factors may also be contributing to sexual segregation in this Mediterranean population of red deer, and further studies focusing on sexual differences regarding feeding behaviour and digestibility are needed.

AB  - A female albino fanray specimen was collected by trawl from the southern Taiwan Strait on April 11, 2022. This unique individual was identified as the Chinese fanray, Platyrhina sinensis (Bloch & Schneider, 1801), based on morphological identification and DNA barcoding. It was classified as partial albinism (leucism) due to the absence of pigmentation in the skin and normal pigmentation in the irises. This specimen represents the first reported case of albinism within the family Platyrhinidae, providing valuable insights for physiological and ecological research on albino fish.

AB  - While the intricate underwater environment leads to blurry and faint features of sonar targets, SonarNet has depicted great success due to its high model capabilities and multifeature fusion mechanism. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavier backbones and larger model sizes to achieve benefits at the cost of increased complexity. The research on fast segmenters deployed on edge devices is urgently inquired. In this article, we analyze the current best-performing sonar image segmentation network named SonarNet. Based on the analysis, we propose a lightweight local feature grafted vision transformer (ViT) embedding network for forward-looking sonar (FLS) images called EsonarNet, which promotes a priority balance between efficiency and accuracy. EsonarNet is based on a hybrid local-global feature grafting architecture and comprises four modules. First, expand from the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), a lightweight sonar semantic segmentation model based on hybrid CNN-transformer-HOG fusion encoding and decoding, while preserving high efficiency applied to hardware resources. Second, lightweight encoder units are employed in our EsonarNet, including a designed spatial mobile inverted bottleneck convolution (SMBConv) and efficient vision transformer (ViT) module. Third, serving as a transitional liaison between the CNN encoder and the transformer encoder, the local-global features interaction (LGFI) module focuses on dispersing local semantic information to facilitate long-distance computations, and the global-local aggregation unit (GLAU) module computes correlations through dot products to restore inductive bias. Fourth, the HOG features are introduced into EsonarNet through the lightweight HOG-deep learning graft mechanism (LHDGM) module to ensure the coherence and compatibility of the acquired traditional and abstract information with different semantics. Ultimately, experimental results demonstrate that EsonarNet outperforms other methods for FLS image segmentation in efficiency.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the forage availability and performance of goats in thinned Caatinga enriched with Urochloa trichopus subjected to grazing fallowing and levels of phosphorus fertilization. Twenty-four F1 crossbred goats (Boer x Non-descript breed), whole, 15.0 +/- 2.6 kg body weight were distributed in four paddocks (n = 6) according to body weight, age and physiological status. Animals grazed on Caatinga, under continuous stocking, and were gathered and kept in individual pens overnight. The experiment to evaluate animal performance was a randomized block design with 4 treatments (0, 11, 33 and 60 days of fallowing) and six replications. To determine dry mass production and floristic composition, phosphate fertilization was used in the doses of x P2O5 in a randomized block design with five treatments, 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg P2O5 with 4 replications. Phosphate fertilization had an effect on the floristic composition of dicots and U. trichopus (P<0.05). There was an effect of pasture fallowing on the final weight of goats, with the lowest weight (20.40 kg) observed after 60 days of fallowing (P<0.05). Fallowing is not suitable for an area of vegetation in the caatinga, because there was a decrease in forage availability and quality in the dry period, resulting in a lower performance of animals.

AB  - Heat stress is associated with impaired meat quality and disruption of redox balance. This study investigated the effect of chronic exposure to high temperature on meat quality and antioxidant markers of muscles (longissimus lumborum and gluteus medius) of growing Iberian pigs. Twenty-four pure Iberian pigs were allocated during 28 days to one of three treatments (n = 8/treatment): thermoneutral conditions (20 degrees C) and ad libitum feeding (TN), heat stress conditions (30 degrees C) and ad libitum feeding (HS) and thermoneutral and pair-fed with HS (TN-pf). Muscles of the HS group had greater intramuscular fat content than the TN-pf group and higher Zn levels than TN and TN-pf, whereas differences on fatty acid composition were negligible. Heat exposure did not affect pH, color coordinates of redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) and MDA values but had a positive influence on lightness and drip losses. Moreover, chronic heat stress stimulated the activity of antioxidant defenses SOD, CAT and GPx. The statistical factor analysis adequately classified the muscles studied, but was unable to differentiate samples according with treatments. Findings of the present study support an adaptive response of the Iberian pig to high temperatures and show the high Iberian meat quality even under adverse climate situations.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by Leptospira bacteria present in the urine of mammals. Leptospira is able to survive in soils and can be resuspended during rain events. Here, we analyzed the pathogenic Leptospira concentration as a function of hydrological variables in a leptospirosis hot spot. A total of 226 samples were collected at the outlet of a 3 km2 watershed degraded by ungulate mammals (deer and feral pigs) and rats which are reservoirs for leptospirosis. Water samples collected at the beginning of a rain event following a dry period contained high concentrations of pathogenic Leptospira. The concentration was generally correlated with the water level and the suspended matter concentration (SMC) during the main flood event. A secondary peak of pathogenic Leptospira was sometimes detected after the main flood and in slightly turbid waters. Lastly, the pathogenic Leptospira concentration was extremely high at the end of a wet season. The pathogenic Leptospira concentrations could not be explained by a linear combination of hydrological variables (e.g. the rainfall, water level, SMC and soil moisture). However, nonlinear machine learning models of rainfall data only provided a fair fit to the observations and explained 75 % of the variance in the log10-transformed pathogenic Leptospira concentration. A comparison of identical machine learning models for the water level, SMC and pathogenic Leptospira concentration showed that the residual error in the Leptospira concentration was due to not only the small dataset but also the intrinsic characteristics of the signal. Our results support the hypothesis whereby pathogenic Leptospira survive at different depths in soils and superficial river sediments (depending on their water saturation) and are transferred to surface water during erosion. These results might help to refine leptospirosis warnings given to the local population. Future research should be focused on larger watersheds in more densely populated areas.

The first part aimed to compare microplastics in fishes' guts differing in feeding guilds, in-dividual sizes, and body weights. The second part compared MPs in fishes' guts and their surrounding waters. Part one revealed that herbivores (58.57%) ingested more MPs than their detritivore-counterparts (30.0%). Pearson correlation, averaging 0.06, suggests a weak correlation between fish weight and MPs amount for both species. Part two showed marine fishes (66.0%) ingested more MPs than its freshwater counterparts (45.0%). A very weak correlation was observed between fish weight and amount of MPs ingested. Fish along the estuary ingested more MPs than those in other stations. No significant differences (p = 0.23) between the MPs in the water samples from each sampling stations was found.

AB  - To evaluate the use of infrared thermography to assess the thermal status of heat-stressed and water-deprived Capra hircus, full-body surface temperature (T-S) and six other body-thermal variables [core, rectal (T-R), and skin (T-SK) temperatures, respiratory and heart rates, and total body-thermal gradient (core-to-ambient, BTG)] were measured after three days of euhydration (EU), dehydration (DE), and rehydration (RE). Results revealed that the combined effect of heat stress and water deprivation had affected all tested variables including the T-S, and once these animals gained access to water in the RE stage variables returned to their EU levels. Moreover, there were positive correlations between T-S and all variables with the exception of BTG. From these six variables, only three variables (i.e. the T-R, T-SK, and BTG) during the DE stage and two variables (i.e. the T-SK and BTG) throughout the experimental stages showed higher constancy (R-2 >= 0 75, P < 0 001; agreement intervals +/- 1 96 95 % CI) with T-S. However, BTG appeared more closely correlated with T-S, representing the body-thermal status more realistically than other variables. In effect, the mean and thresholds of the BTG were predicted using the recorded T-S and were within 0.02 degrees C of original estimates. Collectively, these findings show that infrared thermography is appropriate for assessing body-thermal status, and thus the welfare, of these animals under the three conditions studied, and conclude that full-body T-S can be a surrogate proxy for BTG in these animals. Further experiments are needed to adequately examine the reproducibility of these results under biometeorologically-simulated environments and natural habitats.

AB  - Plants often associate with multiple arthropod mutualists. These partners provide important services to their hosts, but multiple interactions can constrain a plant's ability to respond to complex, multivariate selection. Here, we quantified patterns of genetic variance and covariance among rewards for pollination, biotic defence and seed dispersal mutualisms in multiple populations of Turnera ulmifolia to better understand how the genetic architecture of multiple mutualisms might influence their evolution. We phenotyped plants cultivated from 17 Jamaican populations for several mutualism and mating system-related traits. We then fit genetic variance-covariance (G) matrices for the island metapopulation and the five largest individual populations. At the metapopulation level, we observed significant positive genetic correlations among stigma-anther separation, floral nectar production and extrafloral nectar production. These correlations have the potential to significantly constrain or facilitate the evolution of multiple mutualisms in T. ulmifolia and suggest that pollination, seed dispersal and dispersal mutualisms do not evolve independently. In particular, we found that positive genetic correlations between floral and extrafloral nectar production may help explain their stable coexistence in the face of physiological trade-offs and negative interactions between pollinators and ant bodyguards. Locally, we found only small differences in G among our T. ulmifolia populations, suggesting that geographic variation in G may not shape the evolution of multiple mutualisms.

AB  - Simple Summary Yaks are among the largest high-altitude mammals in the world, and they are ideally adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the plateau regions. Yaks are thus central to the lives of herdsmen and other local populations in these high-altitude areas. Copy number variations (CNVs) are an important cause of genomic variation in livestock and identifying advantageous CNVs can aid in livestock breeding efforts. In this study, an association between CNVs in the MICALL2 and MOGAT2 genes and Ashidan yak growth traits was confirmed, providing a theoretical foundation for Ashidan yak breeding and meat production efforts. Copy number variations (CNVs) are a result of genomic rearrangement affecting DNA regions over 1 kb in length, and can include inversions, translocations, deletions, and duplications. The molecule interacting with CasL-like protein 2 (MICALL2) gene is primarily associated with mitochondrial protein targeting and exhibits predicted stress fiber colocalization. The monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (MOGAT2) gene encodes an enzyme responsible for catalyzing diacylglycerol synthesis from 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acyl-CoA. For this study, blood samples were obtained from 315 yaks, and the body weight, body length, withers height, and chest girth of these animals were measured at 6, 12, 18, and 30 months of age. Genomic DNA was harvested from the collected blood samples, and CNVs in these samples were detected by qPCR. The resultant data were compared using ANOVAs, revealing significant associations between MICALL2 gene CNVs and body weight at 6 months of age (p < 0.05), body length and chest girth at 30 months of age (p < 0.05), and withers height at 18 months of age (p < 0.01) in Ashidan yaks. Similarly, MOGAT2 CNVs were significantly associated with body weight at 6 and 30 months of age (p < 0.05), and with withers height at 18 months of age (p < 0.01) in these Ashidan yaks. MICALL2 and MOGAT2 gene expression was further analyzed in yak tissue samples, revealing that MICALL2 was most highly expressed in the adipose tissue, whereas MOGAT2 was most highly expressed in the lung. These results thus confirmed the relationship between CNVs in the MICALL2 and MOGAT2 genes and Ashidan yak growth traits, providing a valuable gene locus that can be leveraged for future marker-assisted yak breeding efforts.

AB  - Over the past several years, substantial studies have been conducted for the analysis of the impact of biochar application on the composting of organic solid waste. Essentially, the environmental benefits achieved through the organic waste compositing process due to the use of biochar in it have been assessed thoroughly. This paper deal with the agronomic roles of biochar utilised as a compost supplement as well as for soil improvement and highlights the assessment of biochar benefits. Furthermore, the review also focuses on biochar's positive effect on the humification process which enhances the quality and maturity of the final compost. Although biochar has proven to have numerous potential applications, further research and in-depth analysis is required to provide enriched understanding about its long-term effect on the environmental and the agronomical font.

AB  - We have compiled a unique data set on the age, sex, body weight and dimensions of over 500 European fallow deer from two contrasting areas of habitat in southern England: a high-density managed parkland population and a lower-density feral woodland one. We plot growth in body weight, shoulder height and bone dimensions against individual age, assessing sexual dimorphism and regional differences in growth from birth, the timing of cessation of growth and adult size. This variation can be related to differences in habitat, feeding, population density and season of death between the two populations. We highlight the biases inherent in body weight comparisons and contrast them with size comparisons based on postcranial bones. We also identify potential differences in bodily dimensions between the colour morphs of European fallow deer. Finally, we generate predictive equations enabling the estimation of sex, shoulder height and body mass from isolated metapodials, of value for relating fallow deer remains to palaeoenvironmental variation at archaeological and palaeontological sites.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The pig industry routinely uses artificial insemination with refrigerated semen. Cryopreserved semen has many advantages, but it is not widely used, partly because of unreliable results. The supplementation with seminal plasma (SP) could improve these results, but this fluid also presents variability. We evaluated if a simple cold-shock test (CST) could allow to easily identify the most suitable ejaculates for obtaining SP. Therefore, we tested 63 ejaculates, obtaining SP from the 4 showing higher quality (SPr, cold-shock-resistant) and lower quality (SPs, cold-shock-sensitive) after the CST. SPs and SPr pools supplemented thawed semen (20% SP) from six different boars, incubating at 37 degrees C and analyzing at times 0, 2, and 4 h. SPr was able to improve post-thawing sperm motility while maintaining viability. SPs had a similar but lower effect. SP in general seemed to stimulate sperm physiology, however decreasing membrane stability, acrosomal integrity, and disulfide bridges in the chromatin. This study supports the suitability of SP for improving thawed semen, with CST-selected ejaculates as preferable for this aim. Artificial insemination trials with thawed semen supplemented with SPr and SPs must validate the practical application of CST.
   Artificial insemination (AI) with cryopreserved semen is still unreliable for extensive pig industry application. Adding seminal plasma (SP) could improve post-thawing quality, but its suitability could vary. We applied a simple cold-shock test (CST, 5 min at 0 degrees C) on neat semen for classifying ejaculates (n = 63) as resistant or sensitive, obtaining two SP pools (CST-resistant: SPr, sensitive: SPs). Subsequently, frozen/thawed spermatozoa from six boars were incubated (37 degrees C) in MR-A (R) extender (control), 20% SPr, or 20% SPs, and analyzed at 0, 2, and 4 h. SP improved total and progressive motility, with a higher effect for SPr and STR (p < 0.05), decreasing kinematic parameters VCL and VAP, ALH, and BCF. Sperm viability was unaffected. SP increased apoptotic and membrane disorder ratios, and acrosomal damage, not affecting the chromatin structure (DNA fragmentation and immaturity by SCSA), protamination (CMA3), or disulfide levels (mBBr). However, the proportion of spermatozoa with elevated free thiols (disulfide bridges reduction) significantly increased. Results support a stimulatory role of SP on thawed semen, with additional benefits from SPr. The effect of SP and especially SPr after AI should be tested since CST could be a practical test for selecting suitable ejaculates in AI centers.

AB  - Dryland areas in northern Kenya experience challenges due to various factors, including environmental degradation associated with unstable weather conditions and climate change. These and related risks and stressors are threats to the sustenance of camel milk production for many of Kenya's northern communities. We conducted a study among the pastoral communities in Isiolo County whose principal source of livelihood is dependent on camel production. In this paper, we discuss the drivers of the environmental factors influencing the resilience and sustainability of the camel milk value chain in Isiolo County, northern Kenya. We analyzed (i) the internal factors that influence the system, which includes: the categories and economic contributions of livestock-based value chains, the occupation of the camel milk value chain micro players, and land-use practices in Isiolo County, and (ii) the external factors influencing the system: the climatic variability (2014-2017) and its effect on the camel milk value chain, and the vegetation condition index (VCI) indicating drought trends for Isiolo County (2002-2020). The study adopted a field survey through interviews with randomly selected households involved in the camel milk value chain by using a survey questionnaire and a survey guide for focus group discussions (FGD) and key informant interviews (KII). The results from the study showed camel milk as a dominant value chain among the livestock-based value chain products in Isiolo County, the variations in quantities of camel milk supplied due to changes in seasonality, and we show that the current system is not sustainable. We conclude with recommendations to establish a modernized camel milk value chain based on improved natural resources management for a resilient and sustainable system.

AB  - The Boer goat is one of the top meat breeds in modern animal husbandry and has attracted widespread attention for its unique growth performance. However, the genetic basis of muscle development in the Boer goat remains obscure. In this study, we identified specific structural variants in the Boer goat based on genome-wide selection signals and analyzed the basis of the molecular heredity of related candidate genes in muscle development. A total of 9 959 autosomal copy number variations (CNVs) were identified through selection signal analysis in 127 goat genomes. Specifically, we confirmed that the highest signal CNV (HSV) was a chromosomal arrangement containing an approximately 1.11 Mb (CHIR17: 60062304-61171840 bp) duplicated fragment inserted in reverse orientation and a 5 362 bp deleted region (CHIR17:60145940-60151302 bp) with overlapping genes (e.g., ARHGAP10, NR3C2, EDNRA, PRMT9, and TMEM184C). The homozygous duplicated HSV genotype (+/+) was found in 96% of Boer goats but was not detected in Eurasian goats and was only detected in 4% of indigenous African goats. The expression network of three candidate genes (ARHGAP10, NR3C2, and EDNRA) regulating dose transcription was constructed by RNA sequencing. Results indicated that these genes were involved in the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) and their overexpression significantly increased the expression of SAA3. The HSV of the Boer goat contributed to superior skeletal muscle growth via the dose effects of overlapping genes.

AB  - During cryopreservation, sperm encounters oxidative stress induced by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), destroying the sperm plasma membrane structure and reducing its physiological functions. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) on the cryopreservation of dairy goat semen. Semen was collected from six goats, and then qualified semen with movement >80% was selected after preliminary evaluation. The semen was divided into six aliquots, diluted with dairy goat semen extender (1:10) at 37 degrees C, containing 0 g/L (control), 0.1 g/L, 0.2 g/L, 0.3 g/L, 0.4 g/L and 0.5 g/L APS, cryopreserved, and stored in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). Sperm quality was assessed after freeze -thawing. The highest sperm motility, motion performance, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and antioxidant properties (total antioxidant capacity and levels of antioxidant enzymes) were recorded (P < 0.05) in the 0.2 g/L APS group after the semen was freeze-thawed. The control and the optimal group (0.2 g/L) were then selected to analyze the effects of APS on sperm energy metabolism (mitochondrial membrane potential [MMP] and adenosine triphosphate [ATP]), sperm apoptosis, and the expression of the AMPK signaling pathway. The results showed that treatment with 0.2 g/L APS increased sperm MMP and ATP content after freeze-thawing, reduced sperm apoptosis by regulating apoptosis-related proteins, and promoted AMPK phosphorylation by activating the AMPK signaling pathway. The cleavage rate of frozen goat sperm during in vitro fertilization (IVF) was also observed to increase. These findings suggest meaningful ways to improve cryopreservation of dairy goat semen and provide new insights into the mechanism by which APS protects sperm from oxidative damage via AMPK activation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple Summary Artificial insemination with extended liquid boar semen is widely used in the swine industry. The identification of the relationship between boar sperm characteristics and fertility could be of substantial importance to reproduction management. This study evaluated the relationship between boar sperm characteristics and sperm/seminal plasma proteins with main parameters of field fertility. Immotile spermatozoa and spermatozoa with biochemically active plasma membranes affected the number of live-born piglets and litter size of >= 12 piglets. The proteins osteopontin 70 and glutathione peroxidase 5, both separately and in combination, affected the farrowing rate. The combination of immotile sperm and protein osteopontin 70 explained the variation regarding litter size with >= 12 piglets. In conclusion, the evaluation of semen quality variables combined with the evaluation of specific sperm or seminal plasma proteins could provide useful information on in vivo fertilizing capacity of semen doses. This study aimed to evaluate boar sperm characteristics and proteins, in relation to their importance regarding in vivo fertility. Sixty-five ejaculates were used and 468 sows (parity >= 2) were inseminated. Sperm CASA kinetics, morphology, viability, DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm membrane biochemical activity (HOST) and sperm proteins (Heat Shock Protein 90-HSP90, glutathione peroxidase-5-GPX5, Osteopontin 70-OPN70) were assessed and related to field fertility (number of live-born piglets-NLBP, litter size >= 12 piglets-LS, farrowing rate-FR). Statistical analysis was conducted with simple and multiple regression models. Simple regression analysis showed that immotile sperm (IM) significantly affected the NLBP and LS, explaining 6.7% and 6.5% of their variation, respectively. The HOST positive spermatozoa significantly affected the NLBP and LS, explaining 24.5% and 7.8% of their variation, respectively. Similarly, sperm with activated mitochondria significantly affected the NLBP, explaining 13.5% of its variation. Moreover, the OPN70 affected LS and FR, explaining 7.5% and 10.8% of their variation, respectively. Sperm GPX5 protein affected FR, explaining 6.7% of its variation. Multiple regression analysis showed that the combination of IM and/OPN70 explains 13.0% of the variation regarding LS, and the combination of GPX5 and OPN70 explains 13.6% of the variation regarding FR. In conclusion, the estimation of parameters IM, membrane biochemical activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, OPN and GPX5 can provide useful information regarding semen doses for field fertility.

AB  - A study of gastrointestinal nematodes in roe deer was carried out in the regional hunting reserves of Riano and Mampodre, Province of Leon, Spain, to provide information on their prevalence and intensity of infection in relation to the sampling areas, age of the animals, and body weight. Through a regulated necropsy of the animals, all of them harbored gastrointestinal nematodes in their digestive tract, with a mean intensity of parasitism of 638 +/- 646.1 nematodes/infected animal. Eleven genera were found and 18 species of gastrointestinal nematodes were identified, three of them polymorphic: Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus vitrinus, Trichostrongylus capricola, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Haemonchus contortus, Spiculopteragia spiculoptera/Spiculopteragia mathevossiani, Ostertagia leptospicularis/Ostertagia kolchida, Ostertagia (Grosspiculopteragia) occidentalis, Teladorsagia circumcincta/Teladorsagia trifurcate, Marshallagia marshalli, Nematodirus europaeus, Cooperia oncophora, Capillaria bovis, Oesophagostomum venulosum, and Trichuris ovis. All of them have already been cited in roe deer in Europe, but Marshallagia marshalli, Capillaria bovis, and Ostertagia (Grosspiculopteragia) occidentalis are reported for the first time in Spain in this host. The abomasum was the intestinal section, where the prevalence (98.9%) and mean intensity (x over bar = 370.7 +/- 374.4 worms/roe deer; range 3-1762) were significantly higher, but no statistically significant differences were found when comparing the sampling areas and age of animals. The animals with lower body weight had a higher parasite load than those in better physical condition, finding, in this case, statistically significant differences (p = 0.0020). Seven genera and 14 species were identified. In the small intestine, 88% of the animals examined presented gastrointestinal nematodes, with an average intensity of x over bar = 131.7 +/- 225.6 parasites/infected animal, ranging between 4-1254 worms. No statistically significant differences were found when the three parameters studied were compared. Four genera and seven species were identified. In the large intestine/cecum, 78.3% of the examined roe deer presented adult worms, with an average intensity of 6.3 +/- 5.5 worms/infected animal; range 1-26 worms. Only statistically significant differences were observed when considering the mean intensity of parasitism and the sampling area (p = 0.0093). Two genera and two species were identified. Several of the species found in the study were studied molecularly, and with the sequences obtained compared with those deposited in GenBank, phylogenetic trees were prepared to determine their taxonomic status. Using coprological techniques, the existing correlation in the shedding of gastrointestinal nematode eggs in roe deer was investigated with that of semi-extensive sheep farms in the same study area to verify the existence of cross-transmission of these parasites between wild and domestic animals. The high values found in the studied parameters show that northern Spain is an area of high-intensity infection for roe deer.

AB  - Many herbivorous insects die of pathogen infections, though the role of plant traits in promoting the persistence of these pathogens as an indirect interaction is poorly understood. We tested whether winter leaf retention of bush lupines (Lupinus arboreus) promotes the persistence of a nucleopolyhedroviruses, thereby increasing the infection risk of caterpillars (Arctia virginalis) feeding on the foliage during spring. We also investigated whether winter leaf retention reduces viral exposure of younger caterpillars that live on the ground, as leaf retention prevents contaminated leaves from reaching the ground. We surveyed winter leaf retention of 248 lupine bush canopies across twelve sites and examined how it related to caterpillar infection risk, herbivory, and inflorescence density. We also manipulated the amount of lupine litter available to young caterpillars in a feeding experiment to emulate litterfall exposure in the field. Greater retention of contaminated leaves from the previous season increased infection rates of caterpillars in early spring. Higher infection rates reduced herbivory and increased plant inflorescence density by summer. Young caterpillars exposed to less litterfall were more likely to starve to death but less likely to die from infection, further suggesting foliage mediated exposure to viruses. We speculate that longer leaf life span may be an unrecognized trait that indirectly mediates top-down control of herbivores by facilitating epizootics.

AB  - Mammalian scent glands mediate species-specific chemical communication, yet the mechanistic basis for convergent musk production remain incompletely understood. Forest musk deer and muskrat have independently evolved specialized musk-secreting glands, representing a striking case of convergent evolution. Through an integrated multi-omics approach, this study identified cyclopentadecanone as a shared key metabolic precursor in musk from both forest musk deer and muskrat, although downstream metabolite profiles diverged between the two lineages. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that these specialized apocrine glands possessed unique secretory architecture and exhibited transcriptional profiles associated with periodic musk production, distinct from those in conventional apocrine glands. Convergent features were evident at the cellular level, where acinar, ductal, and basal epithelial subtypes showed parallel molecular signatures across both taxa. Notably, acinar cells in both species expressed common genes involved in fatty acid and glycerolipid metabolism (e.g., ACSBG1, HSD17B12, HACD2, and HADHA), suggesting a conserved molecular framework for musk precursor biosynthesis. Metagenomic analysis of musk samples further revealed parallel microbial community structures dominated by Corynebacterium and enriched in lipid metabolic pathways. These findings suggest multi-level convergence in musk biosynthesis, from molecular pathways to microbial communities, providing novel insights into mammalian chemical signaling and artificial musk production.

AB  - Flies belonging to the families Streblidae and Nycteribiidae are highly specialized arthropods that feed on the blood of bats. Their morphology varies and has adapted throughout their coevolutionary history with hosts. Bat flies are often associated with specific bat species and can establish distinct infracommunities. Interaction networks have been used to better understand these associations, revealing interaction modules between bats and their parasites. The Magdalena River basin is the largest in Colombia, encompassing a wide variety of climatic and ecological conditions, with up to 98 bat species reported. We conducted field trips to capture bats and bat flies in different locations along the basin and reviewed literature records and biological collections to gather additional data on interactions between bats and bat flies in this region. We found a high diversity of bats and bat flies in the Magdalena River basin, revealing a medium specialization and modularity in these interactions. We identified bat fly infracommunities and negative associations between certain bat fly species, suggesting competition for resources within hosts. The specialization is similar to that reported in degraded and fragmented habitats where the availability of shelters decreases, favoring the overcrowding of bats, forming multi-species colonies. In conclusion, our study provides important information on the interactions between bats and bat flies in the Magdalena River basin, expanding knowledge about the diversity and structure of these communities in inter-Andean landscapes.

AB  - The reproductive efficiency in buffalo is highly influenced by seasonal variability. Angiogenesis in the reproductive cycle is important for optimal physiological functioning of uterus. Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphatase diaphorase (NADPH-d) are vital indicators for the uterine angiogenic process. This study was conducted to see the effect of season on the expression of different uterine angiogenic factors. Season wise (winter and summer) and phase wise (follicular and luteal), immune staining intensity of buffalo uterus was measured by calculating the optical density value (OD) for ER alpha and VEGF. Percentage of immuno-positive cell count for ER alpha was done. Histoenzymic NADPH-d expression was analysed. Expression of all these factors increased during follicular phase of oestrous cycle in order to support the angiogenesis; however, the expression was significantly lower (p <= 0.05) in term of OD value as well as percentage count of immuno-positive cells during summer season indicating lower angiogenic activity that subsequently affected reproduction in buffalo.

AB  - Using untreated livestock manure adversely affects the environment and human health. Although transforming untreated livestock manure into organic fertilizer can alleviate these adverse effects, the adoption rate of this technology is relatively low in rural areas. This study investigates whether information technology adoption, focusing on Internet use, increases farmers' willingness to transform untreated livestock manure into organic fertilizer using data collected from pig breeding farmers in the Hubei province of China. A recursive bivariate probit model addresses the sample selection bias issues. Findings show that Internet use increases the probability of pig breeding farmers' willingness to transform untreated manure by around 35-56 percentage points. Gender, farm size, credit availability, extension contact, environmental protection attitude and governmental regulation are also important factors driving pig breeding farmers' willingness to transform untreated manure. Moreover, the impact of Internet use on farmers' willingness to transform untreated pig manure tends to be higher for pig breeding farmers with a larger breeding size and longer breeding years. Our findings have significant policy implications that help to improve livestock manure management, environmental quality, and the well-being and health of livestock breeding farmers.

AB  - In their response to Wilson, Pashkevich, Rookmaaker, et al. (2022), Ferreira et al. argue that our conclusions regarding shrinking rhino horns were risky, given the low sample size used for this assessment, the variation in rhino horn length related to non-heritable factors (including age, sex, environment and behaviour) and the low impact that current selective trophy hunting has on rhino numbers. We agree that our sample size was low and that many factors can influence horn length and therefore we discussed these points as important caveats in Wilson, Pashkevich, Rookmaaker, et al. (2022). However, we argue that although many factors can lead to variation in horn length, they do not explain the decline in relative horn length over time that we observed, and we note that the response does not offer an alternative explanation for this temporal shift. Although selective hunting is currently a minor factor in rhino mortality, this may have been relatively more important and to have had a potentially greater selective influence in the past. Our dataset does not allow identification of factors driving this change, and in Wilson, Pashkevich, Rookmaaker, et al. (2022), we offered selective hunting as one possible explanation for the relative decline, calling for more work to investigate this further. We highlight that the focus of Wilson, Pashkevich, Rookmaaker, et al. (2022) was far more than an assessment of changing relative horn length and instead aimed to demonstrate that a wide range of data can be extracted effectively from image repositories for use in a conservation context. We hope that the results in Wilson, Pashkevich, Rookmaaker, et al. (2022) will provide a useful starting point for future research, including addressing the questions raised by Ferreira et al. Ultimately, we feel that the attention given to Wilson, Pashkevich, Rookmaaker, et al. (2022) reveals the enduring interest people have in rhinos, a topic addressed in other parts of our original paper, which we encourage readers to read in its entirety.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Lead concentrations in hard antlers of adult European roebucks (Capreolus capreolus) were analyzed to assess lead exposure of roe deer roaming the floodplain of the Innerste River, a river system contaminated due to historical metal ore mining, processing, and smelting in its upper reaches. Antler lead concentrations of roebucks culled in the period 1939-2018 within or close to the Innerste floodplain ranged between < 0.17 mg Pb/kg (limit of detection) and 51.5 mg Pb/kg (air-dry weight). Median lead concentration in antlers of roebucks culled within the floodplain was 11.1 mg Pb/kg, compared to 2.3 mg Pb/kg in antlers of bucks culled in the floodplain vicinity (P < 0.01). Sampling year had no significant effect on antler lead concentrations (P = 0.748). Lead isotope ratios of antlers from the Innerste downstream area (Pb-206/Pb-207: 1.179-1.181; Pb-208/Pb-206: 2.083-2.085) fell within the range of those reported for hydrothermal vein deposits from the upper catchment area of the Innerste River in the Harz Mountains. Our study demonstrates the long-lasting impact of the historical metal ore mining, processing, and smelting in the Harz Mountains on lead pollution in floodplains of rivers draining this area and the lead exposure of wild herbivores inhabiting the floodplains. Furthermore, it highlights the suitability of roe deer antlers for monitoring environmental lead levels and the usefulness of lead isotope signatures in antlers for source apportionment of lead pollution.

AB  - Invasive alien mammals cause huge adverse ecological impact on human society and natural ecosystems. Although studies have estimated economic costs of mammal invasions at regional scales, there is lacking the large-scale comprehensive assessment of currency costs for this taxon. Here, we estimated the economic cost of invasive alien mammals on a global scale using the most comprehensive global database compiling economic costs of invasive species (InvaCost). From 1960 to 2021, mammal invasions caused costs (summing damage costs and management costs) of US$ 462.49 billion to the global economy, while the total amount of robust costs reached US$ 52.49 billion. The majority of the total economic costs corresponded to damage costs (90.27 %), while only 7.43 % were related to management cost. Economic costs showed an increasing trend over time. The distribution of costs was uneven among taxonomic groups and regions, with the global total cost highly biasing toward to 5 species (European rabbit, Domestic cat, Black rat, Wild boar and Coypu), and North America reporting much higher costs (60.78 % of total economic costs) than other regions. The total costs were borne by agriculture, environment, authorities stakeholders and other sectors. Geographic and taxonomic biases suggested that total economic costs caused by invasive alien mammals were underestimated. Integrated research efforts are needed to fill in knowledge gaps in the economic costs generated by mammal invasions and to identify the drivers of the economic costs.

AB  - Pyrolysis is considered as a promising method to immobilize potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in animal manures. However, comparative study on characteristics and environmental risk of PTEs in biochar obtained by pyrolysis of animal manure at different reactors are lacking. In this study, swine manure was pyrolyzed at 300-600 degrees C in a lab-scale or pilot-scale reactor with the aim to investigate their effects on characteristics and environmental risk of As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in swine manure biochar. Results showed that biochars produced from pilot scale had lower pH and carbon (C) content but higher oxygen (O) content than those from lab scale. Biochars from pilot scale had higher total PTEs (except Cd) concentrations and releasable PTEs (except Pb) but lower CaCl2-extractable PTEs and phytotoxicity germination index (GI) to radish seedings than those from lab scale. Chemical speciation analysis indicated that PTEs in biochar produced from pilot-scale fast pyrolysis at 400 degrees C had higher percentage of more stable fraction (F5 fraction) and lower potential ecological risk index (RI) than those from lab-scale slow pyrolysis. These findings demonstrated that bioavailability and potential ecological risk of PTE in swine manure biochar were greatly decrease in the pilot-scale pyrolysis reactor and the optimum temperature was 400 degrees C considering the lowest potential ecological risk index.

AB  - Obsolete organochlorine pesticides (OSPs) are currently prohibited as persistent organic pollutants that contaminate the environment. If undisposed, they continue to pollute soil and water, to accumulate in the food chain and to harm plants, animals and the human body. The aim of the study was to assess water and soil pollution around the storehouses of undisposed, banned OSPs and their possible genotoxic effect. The storehouses in four villages near Almaty, Kazakhstan were investigated. Chemical analysis confirmed contamination of water and soil around storehouses with OSPs. The genotoxic effect of water and soil samples was evaluated using model objects: S.typhymurium, D.melanogaster, sheep lymphocytes cultures and human lymphocytes cultures. It was found that water and soil samples caused mutagenic effect in all model systems. They increased the frequency of revertants in Salmonella, the frequency of lethal mutations in Drosophila chromosomes, and the frequency of chromosome aberrations in cultures of human and sheep lymphocytes. Although a genotoxic effect was demonstrated for each of these models, various models showed different sensitivity to the effects of pesticides and they varied degree of response. The association between the total content of OCPs in soil and the level of mutations for different model systems was discovered.

AB  - Individuals integrated into a new social group may suffer from group aggression, which is common in animals but remains unresolved. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the establishment time and structural composition of different herds on the intensity of aggression toward unfamiliar pigs. Six pig herds were established, with a pig integrated into each herd at intervals of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 days after their establishment. A parabolic model based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and conjoint analysis identified factors influencing the intensity of aggression toward unfamiliar pigs. Our results indicate that aggression intensity towards unfamiliar pigs in the herd was not significantly influenced by herd size but was significantly affected by the number of pens used to form the herds. Furthermore, we found a significant and positive correlation between herd establishment time and aggression intensity, which was consistently observed across different pig herds. The impact of the number of pens on aggression intensity showed a significant correlation with the interaction effect of the number of pens and establishment time. These findings underscore the complexity of interactions between herd establishment time and structural composition in influencing aggression intensity towards unfamiliar pigs. Aggression in farm animals affects welfare. Although one-on-one aggression was studied, group-on-individual aggression remains unresolved. This study aimed to examine how herd establishment times and structures influence aggression intensity (AI) of herds towards unfamiliar pigs. Six groups of pigs were established, with a new pig added every three days. AI was measured by skin lesion severity on the new pigs. A parabolic model based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and conjoint analysis identified factors influencing AI. Results show AI was not significantly affected by herd size but was significantly influenced by the number of pens (p < 0.01). AI showed a significant association with elevated time (T) since the establishment of the herd in six pig herds (Kendall's tau-tau = 0.976, p < 0.001). The effect of T on the AI became stronger as T increased, which was consistently validated in six pig herds. Furthermore, the interaction effect indicates a significant difference in AI between herds formed with two pens and those with more than two pens when T <= 12 (p < 0.05). However, as T increased beyond 12, the number of pens used to form the herd did not significantly affect AI. These findings highlight the complex interactions between herd establishment time and structural composition in shaping aggression intensity towards unfamiliar pigs.

AB  - The welfare of sheep transported by sea is a pertinent issue for Australia's agriculture industry and a subject of concern amongst the general public. Evaluating the effect of sea transport on the welfare of livestock requires an accurate system of reporting. This study piloted an animal welfare monitoring protocol during two sea voyages from Australia to the Middle East. Sheep health and behaviour were analysed to determine if the protocol could detect animal responses to voyage conditions such as feeding management and changes to the pen environment. Data were recorded for target pens of five different commercial lines of Merino sheep. Principle Components (PC) analysis on behavioural data identified three principal components which were compared with voyage day, management and environmental conditions using general linear mixed modelling (GLMM). PC factor 1 scores (23.35 % of total variance) showed that resting and recumbency increased as the voyage progressed. PC factor 2 scores (17.09 % variance) demonstrated that behavioural responses to heat fluctuated by voyage day. PC factor 3 scores (9.48 % variance) showed reduced flight distances and increasingly competitive feeding behaviour as the voyage progressed. Environment and management conditions were associated with behavioural changes, with Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) being the most influential measure affecting all three PC factors (p < 0.001). There were few diseases or symptoms of ill-health (including veterinary treatments) or mortalities recorded for sample pens; however, associations between ill-health and nutrition, environmental conditions and behaviour, were identified using GLMM. Increases in WBGT were linked to increased nasal discharge (p < 0.001), ocular discharge (p < 0.05), pink eye (p < 0.05) and Panting Score 4 (p < 0.01). With few recordings of ill-health, and a low mortality incidence, it was difficult to interpret the results of comparisons between health and behaviour. It is likely that associations between health indicators and behavioural variations will be more meaningful if a welfare monitoring protocol were applied to a larger sample size. The pen-side assessments presented in this study provided a practicable and comprehensive system for monitoring the behaviour and health of sheep during sea voyages. The application of such assessments on an industry basis could better inform all stakeholders about the welfare of sheep during sea transport.

AB  - Oil tea (Camellia oleifera) is one of the world's major woody edible oil plants and is vital in providing food and raw materials and ensuring water conservation. The yield of oil tea can directly reflect the growth condition of oil tea forests, and rapid and accurate yield measurement is directly beneficial to efficient oil tea forest management. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), which can penetrate the canopy to acquire the geometric attributes of targets, has become an effective and popular method of yield identification for agricultural products. However, the common geometric attribute information obtained by LiDAR systems is always limited in terms of the accuracy of yield identification. In this study, to improve yield identification efficiency and accuracy, the red-green-blue (RGB) and luminance-bandwidth-chrominance (i.e., YUV color spaces) were used to identify the point clouds of oil tea fruits. An optimized mean shift clustering algorithm was constructed for oil tea fruit point cloud extraction and product identification. The point cloud data of oil tea trees were obtained using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and field measurements were conducted in Changsha County, central China. In addition, the common mean shift, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and maximum-minimum distance clustering were established for comparison and validation. The results showed that the optimized mean shift clustering algorithm achieved the best identification in both the RGB and YUV color spaces, with detection ratios that were 9.02%, 54.53%, and 3.91% and 7.05%, 62.35%, and 10.78% higher than those of the common mean shift clustering, DBSCAN clustering, and maximum-minimum distance clustering algorithms, respectively. In addition, the improved mean shift clustering algorithm achieved a higher recognition rate in the YUV color space, with an average detection rate of 81.73%, which was 2.4% higher than the average detection rate in the RGB color space. Therefore, this method can perform efficient yield identification of oil tea and provide a new reference for agricultural product management.

AB  - Multilevel society is one of the most complex social systems in natural ecosystems and is a typical feature among some primates. Given the potential connection between social behavior and gut microbiome composition, the multilevel social system could affect the primate gut microbiome. Here, based on long-term observation (e.g. social unit dynamics, transfer, and behavior), we investigated this potential integrating 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and behavior data in Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti), which possess a multilevel social group based on one male units (OMUs, each unit with several breeding females and their offspring) and all-male unit (AMU, several bachelor males residing together). We found that the mean unweighted Unifrac distance between adult males from different OMUs was significantly lower than that between adult females from different OMUs (paired Wilcoxon test, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in the mean unweighted Unifrac distance between females within the same OMU or between females from different OMUs. These findings indicated the potential connection between the defense and invasion of social units and the gut microbiome community in wild Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys. We speculated that the resident males of OMUs displaying a significantly higher similarity in the gut microbial community than that of adult females in separate OMUs might be associated with the sexual differences in their interactions and from previously having cohabitated together in the AMU. Therefore, this study suggested that multilevel societies might have an effect on the gut microbial community in this wild nonhuman primate species.

AB  - Complex sphingolipids are important components of the lipid bilayer of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a defect of the biosynthesis causes widespread cellular dysfunction. In this study, we found that mutations causing upregulation of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway cause hypersensitivity to the defect of complex sphingolipid biosynthesis caused by repression of AUR1 encoding inositol phosphorylceramide synthase, whereas loss of PKA confers resistance to the defect. Loss of PDE2 encoding cAMP phosphodiesterase or PKA did not affect the reduction in complex sphingolipid levels and ceramide accumulation caused by AUR1 repression, suggesting that the change in sensitivity to the AUR1 repression due to the mutation of the cAMP/PKA pathway is not caused by exacerbation or suppression of the abnormal metabolism of sphingolipids. We also identified PBS2 encoding MAPKK in the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway as a multicopy suppressor gene that rescues the hypersensitivity to AUR1 repression caused by deletion of IRA2, which causes hyperactivation of the cAMP/PKA pathway. Since the HOG pathway has been identified as one of the rescue systems against the growth defect caused by the impaired biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids, it was assumed that PKA affects activation of the HOG pathway under AUR1-repressive conditions. Under AUR1-repressive conditions, hyperactivation of PKA suppressed the phosphorylation of Hog1, MAPK in the HOG pathway, and transcriptional activation downstream of the HOG pathway. These findings suggested that PKA is possibly involved in the avoidance of excessive activation of the HOG pathway under impaired biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids.

AB  - Environmental pollutant cadmium (Cd) can cause macrophage dysfunction, and the imbalance of M1/M2 is involved in the process of tissue fibrosis. In order to explore the effect of subacute CdCl2 exposure on pig lung tissue fibers and its mechanism, based on the establishment of this model, ICP-MS, H&E staining, Masson staining, Immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and Western Blot methods were used to detect related indicators. The results found that lung tissue fibrosis, Cd content significantly increased, lung tissue ion disturbance, miR-20a-3p down-regulation, M1/M2 imbalance, LXA4/FPR2 content decreased, MDA content increased, NF-kappa B/NLRP3, TGF beta pathway, PPAR gamma/Wnt pathway activated, and the expression of fibrosis-related factors increased. The above results indicate that subacute CdCl2 exposure increase Cd content in the pig lungs, which leads to M1/M2 imbalance and down-regulates the content of LXA4/FPR2, further activates the oxidative stress/NF-kappa B/NLRP3 pathway, thereby activating the TGF beta and PPAR gamma/Wnt pathways to induce fibrosis. This study aims to reveal the toxic effects of CdCl2 and will provide new insights into the toxicology of Cd.

AB  - Calling on the concept of environmental justice in its distributive, procedural and recognition dimensions, we implemented a coelaborative scenario building approach to explore sustainable livelihoods pathways in four sites belonging to two Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) in southern Africa. Grounded on participation and transdisciplinarity, as a foundation for decolonised anticipatory action research, we aimed at stimulating knowledge exchange and providing insights on the future of local livelihoods engaging experts living within these TFCAs. Our results show that wildlife and wildlife-related activities are not seen as the primary drivers of local livelihoods, despite the focus and investments of dominant stakeholders in these sectors. Instead, local governance and land use regulations emerged as key drivers in the four study sites. The state of natural resources, including water, and appropriate farming systems also appeared critical to sustain future livelihoods in TFCAs, together with the recognition of indigenous culture, knowledge and value systems. Nature conservation, especially in Africa, is rooted in its colonial past and struggles to free or decolonise itself from the habits of this past despite decades of reconsideration. To date, the enduring coloniality of conservation prevents local citizens from truly participating in the planning and designing of the TFCAs they live in, leaving room for limited benefits to local citizens and often limiting Indigenous people's capacity to conserve. A practical way forward is to consider environmental justice as a cement between the two pillars of the TFCA concept, that is, nature conservation and socio-economic development of local or neighbouring communities, as part of a more broadly and urgent need to rethink the relationships between people in, and with, the rest of nature.

AB  - We studied molecular effects (RNAseq and qPCR) of first feeding prey types (copepods or rotifers/Artemia) on skeletal muscle myogenesis and growth dynamics (proliferation, differentiation), metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation), and antioxidant defense system (production/regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cod (Gadus morhua) larval skeletal muscle. Larval somatic growth rates were significantly higher in copepod fed larvae, although shifts in gene expressions related to muscle growth dynamics between hypertrophy and hyperplasia and generation and regulation of ROS mostly occurred around 5-, 10-, and 15-mm standard length (SL) for both groups. Gene expression for cell membrane proteins (such as nox1 and igf1r) peaked at 7 mm SL in all larvae, corresponding with increased ROS expressions in cod muscle during the exponential stratified hyperplasia phase from 7 mm SL. Expression for muscle differentiation (mef2a) occurred continuously (strongest from 10 mm SL). Expressions for muscle proliferation (pcna) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation (sod1 and sod2) occurred in the 5 - 15 mm SL range, peaking at 10 mm SL in all larvae. A downregulation of sod1 and sod2 in skeletal muscle from 15 mm SL indicated the first response of the defense antioxidant system. Gene expressions related to glucose metabolism (slc2A11, pfk, fpb2, ldha) was 3 - 10 times higher in copepod-fed larvae than in rotifer/Artemia-fed larvae between 7 - 10 mm (live prey period). Copepods move faster than rotifers, and cod larvae will also gradually increase their active swimming periods, due to less viscous forces. Active swimming during the strongest muscle stratified hyperplasia phase (7 - 10 mm SL) could promote a better delivery and transport across the muscle membrane and intracellular flux through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and would contribute to the observed earlier and more effective glucose metabolism in the larvae fed copepods. We suggest that active swimming is an important factor promoting cod larval muscle growth, especially during the strongest muscle hyperplasia phase between 7 and 10 mm SL. The rapid movements of copepods and better nutritional composition could play important roles in stabilizing ROS levels, promoting high swimming activities and enhancing long-term muscle growth in cod.

AB  - Unlike their reptile-like ancestors with continuous tooth replacement, mammals have evolved to replace each tooth either only once, or not at all. In previous large-scale comparative studies, it has been suggested that this tooth replacement only occurs from a successional dental lamina produced lingually to the primary tooth. This study aims to document the complete tooth development and replacement pattern of the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). The tammar wallaby is a diprotodont marsupial, a group defined by their two procumbent lower incisors. To provide a comprehensive documentation of the spatio-temporal pattern of tooth development, we used Lugol's Iodine staining and microCT scanning (diceCT) of embryos and pouch young into adulthood, resulting in high resolution 3D models for both soft and mineralised stages of development for all tooth positions. Our results reveal that the eponymous lower incisors are the successional generation at the third incisor locus, where the primary dentition initiates but never erupts. Furthermore, we track the development of the only replacement tooth, the permanent third premolar (P3), from initiation to eruption, and found it develops from the primary dental lamina, mesial to the dP3. This is contrary to the conventional view of lingual replacement from successional lamina in mammals. Our findings indicate that no functional tooth replacement occurs in the tammar wallaby, and expands the diversity of tooth replacement patterns found in mammals. We also conclude that since almost all marsupial and placental mammals produce replacement teeth from the distalmost deciduous premolar, this tooth should be considered homologous in these two groups.

AB  - Coevolution between plants and herbivores often involves escalation of defence-offence strategies, but attack by multiple herbivores may obscure the match of plant defence to any one attacker. As herbivores often specialize on distinct plant parts, we hypothesized that defence-offence interactions in coevolved systems may become physiologically and evolutionarily compartmentalized between plant tissues. We report that roots, leaves, flower buds and seeds of the tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) show increasing concentrations of cardenolide toxins acropetally, with latex showing the highest concentration. In vitro assays of the physiological target of cardenolides, the Na+/K+-ATPase (hereafter "sodium pump"), of three specialized milkweed herbivores (root-feeding Tetraopes tetrophthalmus, leaf-feeding Danaus plexippus, and seed-feeding Oncopeltus fasciatus) show that they are proportionally tolerant to the cardenolide concentrations of the tissues they eat. Indeed, molecular substitutions in the insects' sodium pumps predicted their tolerance to toxins from their target tissues. Nonetheless, the relative inhibition of the sodium pumps of these specialists by the concentration versus composition (inhibition controlled for concentration, what we term "potency") of cardenolides from their target versus nontarget plant tissues revealed different degrees of insect adaptation to tissue-specific toxins. In addition, a trade-off between toxin concentration and potency emerged across plant tissues, potentially reflecting coevolutionary history or plant physiological constraints. Our findings suggest that tissue-specific coevolutionary dynamics may be proceeding between the plant and its specialized community of herbivores. This novel finding may be common in nature, contributing to ways in which coevolution proceeds in multispecies communities.

AB  - Oily sludges are generated in large quantities in petroleum refinery wastewater treatment plants. Given their complex composition, they are classified as hazardous waste. Selecting a single treatment technique for their remediation is challenging. This work aims to assess the extent of composting followed by phytoremediation on an oily sludge from an API separator unit, pre-treated by chemical oxidation with alkaline activated persulfate (PS). 18% of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were determined by IR spectroscopy. The aliphatic hydrocarbon content was 4714 +/- 250 ppm by GC-FID, and aromatics were not detectable, suggesting a high amount of non-chromatographable complex hydrocarbons. The density of generalist and hydrocarbon-degrading populations of the oily sludge estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) evidenced an autochthonous microbiota with hydrocarbon-degrading capacity. The oxidative treatment with PS removed 31% of the TPH determined by IR after 20 days. The significant reduction of the native bacterial community was counterbalanced by coupling a composting treatment. Co-composting the sludge with goat manure and oat straw produced, after a year, a 96% reduction in TPH content, regardless of the oxidative pretreatment. Organic matter transformation was evidenced by the decrease of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the variation in E4/E6 ratio. The matrices obtained of composting were used as substrates for phytoremediation for 4 months. Ryegrass seeds were planted in both PS-treated and untreated sludge substrates. The presence of the plant grown in the pre-oxidised and composted substrate resulted in a higher aerial biomass of ryegrass (67%), an increase in enzymatic activities, and higher concentration of DOC, although without evidence of additional dissipation of TPH. The dynamics of the bacterial communities of the different substrates generated during the biological treatment were analyzed by Illumina NovaSeq DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. The findings mirrored a succession compatible with that described in contaminated matrices, but also in other non-contaminated ones. According to these findings, an organic matter transformation process occurred, which included the complex hydrocarbons of the oily sludge, resulting in an active substrate that promoted the retention of nutrients and water and provided the necessary support for plant development.

AB  - Different external stimuli are perceived by multiple sensor histidine kinases and transmitted by phosphorylation via the phosphotransfer protein Ypd1p in the multistep phosphorelay system of the high osmolarity glycerol signaling pathway of filamentous fungi. How the signal propagation takes place is still not known in detail since multiple sensor histidine kinase genes in most filamentous fungi are coded in the genome, whereas only one gene for Ypd1p exists. That raises the hypothesis that various Ypd1p isoforms are produced from a single gene sequence, perhaps by alternative splicing, facilitating a higher variability in signal transduction. We found that the mRNA of MoYPD1 in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is subjected to an increased structural variation and amplified putative isoforms on a cDNA level. We then generated mutant strains overexpressing these isoforms, purified the products, and present here one previously unknown MoYpd1p isoform on a proteome level. Alternative splicing was found to be a valid molecular mechanism to increase the signal diversity in eukaryotic multistep phosphorelay systems.

AB  - The Holocene in Australia is characterised as a period of dramatic social and economic reorganisation in Aboriginal culture across the continent, with some of the most evident changes visible in the archaeological record of subsistence patterns. The zooarchaeology of key sites suggests that during the Mid- to Late Holocene, hunters switched emphasis away from high-yield large macropods to a diversity of smaller-bodied animals as a response to changing environmental conditions, demographic demands and/or available technologies. One such key site is Graman B4 (GB4), where a transition from kangaroo to possum occurred around 3000 years ago. However, the low resolution of legacy data from sites such as GB4, and contrary results from more recent excavations elsewhere, question the integrity of this broader trend. Here, we revisit the issue of subsistence change in eastern Australia through an original analysis of the archaeological fauna from the adjacent site Graman B1 (GB1), which has an older sequence extending into the early Middle Holocene. We find a persistent pattern of macropod-majority meat contributions throughout the entire similar to 6500 year sequence with varying degrees of reliance on smaller animals. Only within the last 2000 years are there signs of emergent specialisation in possum acquisition, though this is not at the expense of macropod hunting. We also detect a sharp decline in the use of GB1 coincident with the first occupation of GB4. Our results highlight the importance of high-resolution taxonomic identification and close consideration of animal body mass, as well as data from more than one site within an archaeological complex, to the construction of representative chronologies in Australian Holocene subsistence change.

AB  - The variations in soil carbon (C), phosphorus (P) fractions, microbial indices, and their mechanisms to drive P mobilization are still poorly understood in calcareous soils. An incubation study was set up to evaluate the changes in microbial biomass index (C and P), soil organic C, and Pi fractions. The incubation study with a two-factor completely randomized design including manure source, poultry manure (PM), cow manure (CM), goat manure (GM), and mixed manure (MM), no manure (CK), and inorganic P (Pi) rates (P0 = 0, P50 = 50, and P100 = 100 mg kg-1 P2O5) was conducted in the greenhouse. Combined application of PM and Pi (100 mg kg-1) significantly improved the soil physicochemical traits, i.e., total P (692.88 mg kg-1), Olsen P (32.39 mg kg-1), soil organic carbon (4.21 g kg-1), and particulate organic carbon (2.58 g kg-1). The same treatment significantly (p <= 0.05) increased microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) by 173.89 and 42.03 mg kg-1, respectively. The moderately labile Ca8-P pool was greater than the Ca2-P pool under PM with Pi at 100 mg kg-1, whereas the Ca8-P pool was improved by 49 mg kg-1 compared to CK. Moreover, the Ca8-P pool had a significant (p <= 0.05) relationship with MBC and MBP. Based on the results, it is concluded that the application of PM along with Pi 100 mg kg-1 builds up microbial biomass, which can immediately store a higher amount of readily soluble P and protect it from fixation, eventually improving soil P availability.

AB  - Simple Summary High-energy or high-fat diets are often fed to pregnant and lactating sows to overcome problems resulting from insufficient energy intake. However, their long-term consumption has the potential to impair the reproductive and lactational traits in sows. The microalga spirulina has been previously described to exert beneficial health effects, and it may potentially reverse the detrimental effects induced by a high-energy diet. In the present study, both a high-energy diet and the spirulina did not affect the reproduction and lactational traits in sows, though they both influenced the colostrum fatty acids profile in a way that may impact offspring growth and health. Moreover, sows fed a high-energy diet tended to have less piglets weaned than sows fed a control diet. The spirulina was not able to reverse these effects but tended to affect the proportion of males and females per litter in a diet-specific manner. Feeding high-energy (HED) or high-fat diets during gestation and lactation to pigs may help cover the energy requirements of high-prolific sows but may also adversely affect their reproductive performance. The microalga Arthrospira plantensis (Sp), rich in bioactive compounds, has been described to exert beneficial health effects. The present study investigated the effects of HED and Sp intake during gestation and lactation in pigs. Twenty-four primiparous crossbred sows were fed either a HED or a control diet. Half of the sows per group were supplemented with 20 g/day of Sp. Despite a higher gross energy intake, consuming the HED did not affect the sows' reproductive and lactational performance but significantly modified the colostrum fatty acid (FA) composition and tended to decrease the number of weaned piglets. The Sp supplementation did not affect the reproduction and lactation traits, but slightly affected the colostrum FA composition. A trend was observed for an interaction of diet and Sp in terms of offspring sex ratio with a 50% lower male-to-female ratio in the HED group compared to all other animals. These findings suggest that an HED and Sp intake hardly influence reproduction in sows. However, the HED modified the colostrum FA composition, whereas the Sp had only fewer effects, which may potentially affect offspring performance.

AB  - Herbicides and heavy metals are hazardous substances of environmental pollution, resulting in plant stress and harming humans and animals. Identification of stress types can help trace stress sources, manage plant growth, and improve stress-resistant breeding. In this research, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (Chl-FI) were adopted to identify the rice plants under two types of herbicide stresses (butachlor (DCA) and quinclorac (ELK)) and two types of heavy metal stresses (cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu)). Visible/near-infrared spectra of leaves (L-VIS/NIR) and stems (S-VIS/NIR) extracted from HSI and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic curves of leaves (L-Chl-FKC) and stems (S-Chl-FKC) extracted from Chl-FI were fused to establish the models to detect the stress of the hazardous substances. Novel end-to-end deep fusion models were proposed for low-level, middle-level, and high-level information fusion to improve identification accuracy. Results showed that the high-level fusion-based convolutional neural network (CNN) models reached the highest detection accuracy (97.7%), outperforming the models using a single data source (<94.7%). Furthermore, the proposed end-to-end deep fusion models required a much simpler training procedure than the conventional two-stage deep learning fusion. This research provided an efficient alternative for plant stress phenotyping, including identifying plant stresses caused by hazardous substances of environmental pollution.

AB  - Simple Summary Gut microbiota has become a key factor affecting various phenotypic characteristics of the host. Chinese indigenous pig breeds (Ningxiang pigs) have shown greater stress resistance compared to commercial breeds (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) pigs) which may be related to their distinctive gut microbiota. However, there are few studies on how exogenous microbiota (Ningxiang pigs) change the physiology or metabolism of the host. This study aimed to investigate the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from Ningxiang pigs on the growth performance, fecal microbiota, and serum metabolites of the same-old DLY pigs. The results showed that Ningxiang pig's FMT could alleviate oxidative stress and enhance growth performance in DLY pigs by modulating their gut microbiota and metabolic features.Abstract The gut microbiota is crucial for maintaining the host's intestinal homeostasis and metabolism. This study investigated the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from Ningxiang pigs on the growth performance, fecal microbiota, and serum metabolites of the same-old DLY pigs. The results indicated that the average daily gain of FMT pigs was significantly greater than that of the control (CON) group. Compared to the CON group, the FMT group significantly improved the apparent digestibility of crude fiber, crude ash, gross energy, and calcium of the pigs. The analysis of serum antioxidant status revealed that the activities of total superoxide dismutase and catalase in the serum of pigs in the FMT group were significantly elevated, whereas the level of malondialdehyde was significantly reduced. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that the Ningxiang pig-derived microbiota altered the fecal microbiota structure and modulated the diversity of the gut microbiota in the DLY pigs. Untargeted LC-MS metabolomics demonstrated that pigs in the FMT group exhibited distinct metabolomic profiles compared to those in the CON group. Significant changes were observed in key metabolites involved in amino acid, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Additionally, a correlation analysis between serum differential metabolites and the gut microbiota revealed that the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Corynebacterium was highly correlated with lipid compounds. In conclusion, Ningxiang pig-derived microbiota can alleviate oxidative stress and enhance growth performance in DLY pigs by modulating their gut microbiota and metabolic features.

AB  - Ebola virus disease, EVD, has been linked with wild meat. In Nigeria, strict restrictions on wild meat sales were applied after the first case in July 2014. We quantified wild meat trade in nine markets in southern Nigeria, during Oct. 2010 ? Dec. 2019, and undertook consumer interviews during 2018?2019. Wild meat sales fell to low levels between during EVD (Jul. -Oct. 2014), after which Nigeria was declared Ebola-free. Prior to EVD (2012?2014), reptile carcass numbers declined markedly, collapsed during EVD, but rebounded immediately post-EVD until 2017 to values exceeding pre-EVD (especially true for turtles and tortoises). Reptile consumption increased as mammal numbers declined. After 2017, reptile numbers fell and remained low until the end of the study, indicating population collapses and depletion. Fruit bats and primates did not recover after EVD, but ungulates, rodents and carnivores increased significantly after EVD though never reached pre-EVD levels. In-terviews revealed strong rural versus urban and age-specific differences regarding wild meat consumption and attitudes. Most people worried about Ebola and more than half of interviewees agreed that wild meat poses a transmission risk. Except urban males, over-60-year olds were least informed about the Ebola risk of wild meat, indicating that any future behavioural change campaign should focus on the younger age classes. Unlike other studies, our research clearly shows that changes in purchasing behaviour of consumers and education campaigns were effective in reducing the trade of bats and primates, animal groups likely to be implicated in the trans-mission of Ebola.

AB  - The effects of two typical phosphorus-containing additives (i.e. phosphogypsum and superphosphate) on carbon transformation during pig manure composting were investi-gated. Three addition strategies, including 10% phosphogypsum as well as 2.5% and 10% superphosphate (based on dry mass) were designed with same dosage or phosphorus content. Results showed that all strategies could alter organic biotransformation to reduce carbon loss during composting. Adding 10% superphosphate and phosphogypsum could restrain microbial activities to retard organic biodegradation, which thus reduced carbon dioxide and methane emission as well as humic acid (HA) formation. Compared to these strategies with high dosage additives, addition of 2.5% superphosphate could promote the conversion of unstable fulvic acid (FA) to stable HA with high aromaticity for humification. In addition, 2.5% superphosphate was more favorable to reduce CH4 emission given its low dosage to maintain suitable thermophilic period. Thus, addition of 2.5% superphosphate was recommended to accelerate humification and reduce carbon loss during pig manure composting in practice. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Ammonia, a common toxic gas, is not only one of the main causes of haze, but also can enter respiratory tract and directly affect the health of humans and animals. Pig was used as an animal model for exploring the molecular mechanism and dose effect of ammonia toxicity to lung. In this study, the apoptosis of type II alveolar epithelial cells was observed in high ammonia exposure group using transmission electron microscopy. Gene and protein expression analysis using transcriptome sequencing and western blot showed that low ammonia exposure induced T-cell-involved proinflammatory response, but high ammonia exposure repressed the expression of DNA repair-related genes and affected ion transport. Moreover, high ammonia exposure significantly increased 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) level, meaning DNA oxidative damage occurred. In addition, both low and high ammonia exposure caused oxidative stress in pig lungs. Integrated analysis of transcriptome and metabolome revealed that the up-regulation of LDHB and ND2 took part in high ammonia exposure-affected pyruvate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation progress, respectively. Inclusion, oxidative stress mediated ammonia-induced proinflammatory response and apoptosis of porcine lungs. These findings may provide new insights for understanding the ammonia toxicity to workers in livestock farms and chemical fertilizer plants. ?? 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Klebsiella spp. are ubiquitous bacteria capable of colonizing humans and animals, and sometimes leading to se -vere infections in both. Due to their high adaptability against environmental/synthetic conditions as well as their potential in aquiring antimicrobial/metal/biocide resistance determinants, Klebsiella spp. are recognized as an emerging threat to public health, worldwide. Currently, scarce information on the impact of livestock for the spread of pathogenic Klebsiella spp. is available. Thus, the phenotypic and genotypic properties of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing, and colistin-resistant Klebsiella strains (n = 185) from process-and wastewater of two poultry and pig slaughterhouses as well as their receiving municipal wastewater treat-ment plants (mWWTPs) were studied to determine the diversity of isolates that might be introduced into the food-production chain or that are released into the environment by surviving the wastewater treatment. Selectively-isolated Klebsiella spp. from slaughterhouses including effluents and receiving waterbodies of mWWTPs were assigned to various lineages, including high-risk clones involved in human outbreaks, and exhib-ited highly heterogeneous antibiotic-resistance patterns. While isolates originating from poultry slaughterhouses showed the highest rate of colistin resistance (32.4%, 23/71), carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella spp. were only de-tected in mWWTP samples (n = 76). The highest diversity of resistance genes (n = 77) was detected in Klebsiella spp. from mWWTPs, followed by isolates from pig (n = 56) and poultry slaughterhouses (n = 52). Interestingly, no carbapenemase-encoding genes were detected and mobile colistin resistance genes were only obeserved in isolates from poultry and pig slaughterhouses. Our study provides in-depth information into the clonality of livestock-associated Klebsiella spp. and their determinants involved in antimicrobial resistance and virulence development. On the basis of their pathogenic potential and clinical importance there is a potential risk of colonization and/or infection of wildlife, livestock and humans exposed to contaminated food and/or surface waters.

AB  - Manure is widely used as a fertilizer and applied to agricultural land. It may contain highly active chemicals like veterinary medicinal products or biocides, which enter into the environment by this pathway. This is recognized by several regulatory frameworks, however, a detailed method for examining the transformation of chemicals in manure was lacking. This article describes the validation of a method for studying the anaerobic transformation of chemicals in pig and cattle liquid manure. Different steps are covered with an emphasis on the validation ring test and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) process that led to the recent adoption of the method as OECD Test Guideline (TG) 320.

AB  - Simple Summary Artificial insemination is a common breeding technique employed in the contemporary livestock industry. However, the efficacy of this technique is contingent upon the quality of the sperm utilized. Several factors influence the quality of sperm during liquid storage. It is, therefore, essential to select an effective physiological regulator in order to maintain sperm quality during this process. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of MTFMT in different motile sperm and to investigate the effects of the addition of amino acids and methionine on sperm quality during liquid storage of boar sperm. The results demonstrated that MTFMT was highly expressed in high-motility sperm. Methionine could act as a substrate for protein translation, affecting mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial protein translation and directly influencing boar.Abstract Boar sperm quality serves as an important indicator of reproductive efficiency, playing a direct role in enhancing the output of livestock production. It has been demonstrated that mitochondrial protein translation is present in sperm and plays a crucial role in regulating sperm motility, capacitation and in vitro fertilization rate. The present study aimed to determine whether methionine supplementation enhances mitochondrial translation in boar sperm, thereby improving sperm quality. The results showed a significant elevation in the abundance of mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTFMT), a crucial enzyme for mitochondrial protein translation, and mitochondrial DNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) in boar sperm exhibiting high motility. Both amino acids and methionine supplementation significantly enhanced boar sperm motility during storage. Moreover, methionine supplementation mitigates the loss of acrosomal integrity, enhances the expression of COX1, and boosts mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, the positive impact of methionine was negated in the presence of the mitochondrial translation inhibitor chloramphenicol. Together, these findings suggest that boar sperm may utilize methionine as a protein translation substrate to enhance sperm motility by stimulating mitochondrial protein translation. The supplementation of methionine may enhance the quality of boar sperm, thereby providing guidance for the optimization of diluent formulations for liquid storage and the identification of physiological regulators that regulate sperm motility.

AB  - Social animals make behavioural decisions based on local habitat and conspecifics, as well as memorized past experience (i.e. 'familiarity') with habitat and conspecifics. Here, we develop a conceptual and empirical understanding of how spatial and social familiarity fit within the spatial-social interface-a novel framework integrating the spatial and social components of animal behaviour. We conducted a multi-scale analysis of the movements of GPS-collared plains bison (Bison bison, n = 66) residing in and around Yellowstone National Park, USA. We found that both spatial and social familiarity mediate how individuals respond to their spatial and social environments. For instance, individuals with high spatial familiarity rely on their own knowledge as opposed to their conspecifics, and individuals with high social familiarity rely more strongly on the movement of conspecifics to guide their own movement. We also found that fine-scale spatial and social phenotypes often scale up to broad-scale phenotypes. For instance, bison that select more strongly to align with their nearest neighbour have larger home ranges. By integrating spatial and social familiarity into the spatial-social interface, we demonstrate the utility of the interface for testing hypotheses, while also highlighting the pervasive importance of cognitive mechanisms in animal behaviour. This article is part of the theme issue 'The spatial-social interface: a theoretical and empirical integration'.

AB  - The spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agroecosystems through the application of animal manure is a global threat to human and environmental health. However, the adaptability and colonization ability of animal manure-derived bacteria determine the spread pathways of ARG in agroecosystems, which have rarely been studied. Here, we performed an invasion experiment by creating a synthetic communities (SynCom) with ten isolates from pig manure and followed its assembly during gnotobiotic cultivation of a soil-Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) system. We found that Firmicutes in the SynCom were efficiently filtered out in the rhizosphere, thereby limiting the entry of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) into the plant. However, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in the SynCom were able to establish in all compartments of the soil-plant system thereby spreading TRGs from manure to soil and plant. The presence of native soil bacteria prevented the establishment of manure-borne bacteria and effectively reduced the spread of TRGs. Achromobacter mucicolens and Pantoea septica were the main vectors for the entry of tetA into plants. Furthermore, doxycycline stress promoted the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of the conjugative resistance plasmid RP4 within the SynCom in A. thaliana by upregulating the expression of HGT-related mRNAs. Therefore, this study provides evidence for the dissemination pathways of ARGs in agricultural systems through the invasion of manure-derived bacteria and HGT by conjugative resistance plasmids and demonstrates that the priority establishment of soil bacteria in the rhizosphere limited the spread of TRGs from pig manure to soil-plant systems.

AB  - Context: Connectivity modelling is a powerful tool for strengthening the link between landscape and species conservation. This approach often relies on expert knowledge of connectivity indicators or limited, small numbers and small-scale monitoring data, for example during animal foraging activities. However, integrating larger scale movement data, including dispersal or seasonal movements, is crucial to making conservation relevant by covering the entire life cycle of species. Approach and methods: Using Resource Selection Function, the movement patterns of greater horseshoe bats (GHB) studied on a local scale were transposed to a regional scale to model the connectivity in western France. GHB is highly sensitive to loss of connectivity and makes seasonal regional migrations. How the local landscape heterogeneity influenced the conductance parameters estimation for modelling was examined using the gap-crossing method at four different sites with variable landscape composition. The inferred parameters were used to create a regional connectivity map based on circuit theory. To validate this map, acoustic monitoring was conducted during the autumn migration to assess its effectiveness in identifying connectivity gradients. Finally, the resulting connectivity map was superimposed on the Natura 2000 network. Results: First, it can be assumed that connectivity parameters are identical whatever the landscape context. Second, the regional connectivity model identified the main potential corridors connecting all the major sites in the region. Finally, based on acoustic sampling, the number of GHB in transit was significantly higher in areas of higher connectivity. In terms of overlap with conservation, the functional connectivity of the GHB has been variously addressed in the current Natura 2000 network, with an overall lack of representativeness. Policy implications: Studying pathways during high mobility periods is one of the main missing elements for effective conservation, particularly for small species such as bats. An acoustic, stratified sampling at both local and large scale provided sufficient spatial and temporal accuracy to model connectivity throughout the life cycle of bats. This framework can easily be applied to other bat species to improve our understanding of connectivity, in order to explicitly integrate this crucial aspect for highly mobile species into the protection network.

AB  - Simple Summary Cryopreservation of sperm is an important process used in livestock breeding. It is used to facilitate artificial insemination and helps to maintain genetic diversity by utilizing storage in cryobanks. Boar sperm are extremely sensitive to the conditions present during cryopreservation. Glycerol is the most used permeable cryoprotectant, showing both protective activity and some level of sperm toxicity. To improve the insemination rates, it is necessary to develop new cryoprotective agents. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effect of the highly biocompatible, non-toxic polysaccharides dextran and pentaisomaltose on the cryopreservation of boar sperm. Additionally, we used computational modeling for the prediction of their cryoprotective action through interaction with selected sperm surface proteins. Our results show a lower impact of cryopreservation on sperm qualitative parameters when the extender is modified by pentaisomaltose. This approach represents a promising option for the complete removal of toxic glycerol in cryopreservation. The long-term storage of boar sperm presents an ongoing challenge, and the modification of the cryoprotective compounds in semen extenders is crucial for improving cryopreservation's success rate. The aim of our study was to reduce the percentage of glycerol in the extender by elimination or substitution with biocompatible, non-toxic polysaccharides. For boar semen extender improvement, we tested a novel modification with the polysaccharides dextran and pentaisomaltose in combination with unique in silico predictive modeling. We targeted the analysis of in vitro qualitative sperm parameters such as motility, viability, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, and DNA integrity. Non-penetrating polysaccharide-based cryoprotective agents interact with sperm surface proteins such as spermadhesins, which are recognized as fertility markers of boar sperm quality. The in silico docking study showed a moderate binding affinity of dextran and pentaisomaltose toward one specific spermadhesin known as AWN, which is located in the sperm plasma membrane. Pentaisomaltose formed a hydrophobic pocket for the AWN protein, and the higher energy of this protein-ligand complex compared with dextran was calculated. In addition, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis for the molecular dynamics (MD) of both polysaccharides and AWN simulation suggests their interaction was highly stable. The in silico results were supported by in vitro experiments. In the experimental groups where glycerol was partially or entirely substituted, the use of pentaisomaltose resulted in improved sperm mitochondrial activity and DNA integrity after thawing when compared with dextran. In this paper, we demonstrate that pentaisomaltose, previously used for cryopreservation in hematopoietic stem cells, represents a promising compound for the elimination or reduction of glycerol in extenders for boar semen cryopreservation. This novel approach, using in silico computer prediction and in vitro testing, represents a promising technique to help identify new cryoprotectants for use in animal breeding or genetic resource programs.

AB  - Animal agriculture is recognized as a key source of fecal microbial impacts on water quality and associated risks to human health. Most of the research effort has focused on losses of fecal microbes from cow/cattle feces with little research effort on sheep fecal risks. The literature on fecal microbial risks from pasture is complicated by the fact that experiments are carried out in different environments leading to difficulties in making direct comparisons between sheep and cow/cattle losses from pasture areas. In this study, a plot scale simulation was conducted on the same pasture plots, using simulated rainfall to generate comparable runoff conditions, and using simulated grazing to create similar relative stocking rates. The Escherichia coli concentrations in the runoff were similar from simulated or natural rainfall events. At an equivalent stocking rate, the E. coli runoff concentrations from the sheep grazed pastures were four times higher than the cow grazed pasture. These results show that at an equivalent stocking rate, the E. coli runoff risk from sheep grazed pasture is higher than for cow grazed pasture. Further research is needed to understand the relative impacts of different grazing species of animals as well as stocking rate or management effects on these relative risks to water quality.

AB  - Mixotrophy, a physiological trait combining autotrophy and heterotrophy in one organism, significantly contributes to energy and matter transfer in aquatic ecosystems. However, understanding how environmental factors influence mixoplankton success across freshwater ecosystems has been uncertain. The grand & eacute;cart hypothesis (GEH) posits that light and nutrient availability are key components of mixotrophs' niche, suggesting that ecosystem properties determine opposing gradients of light and nutrients, creating environmental filtering for mixotrophs. We hypothesized that ecosystem size, a property of lake ecosystems, mediates the prevalence of patterns and control mechanisms predicted by the GEH on mixoplankton relative biomass (MRB). Using data from 98 tropical lakes, we demonstrated that lake size mediates the inverse relationship between light and nutrient availability across ecosystems. Larger lakes have more light but low nutrients, while smaller lakes have more nutrients but greater shading. Light availability better explains MRB in small lakes, and nutrients better explain MRB in large lakes, with MRB values being higher in small lakes, with secondary influence from zooplankton herbivory. Our results validate the GEH as a significant framework for explaining patterns and control mechanisms of mixoplankton across tropical lakes. This study highlights the significance of lake size as an ecosystem property that generates opposing light and nutrient gradients, further emphasizing its importance for understanding mechanisms regulating freshwater phytoplankton community structure and functioning.

AB  - Telemetry using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and camera trapping are two widely used approaches to detect animal interactions involving wildlife. However, while the former follows an individual-based approach, the latter follows a population-based approach, which may lead to different outcomes when describing interaction networks. In this study, we compared the performance of GPS telemetry, regular grid camera trapping (CT-RG), and resource monitoring camera trapping (in which cameras are placed monitoring a valuable resource for animals, such as water or food; CT-RM) in detecting and quantifying animal interactions. We used spatially explicit simulated trajectories of 150 individuals of 3 imaginary species. We simulated 9 different scenarios of resource visiting frequency and spatial resource aggregation in the environment to assess the potential influence of animal behavior and landscape structure. The simulated trajectories were sampled using the three approaches with six different sampling efforts each, and the direct and indirect interactions between the three species were quantified. Additionally, CT-RG and CT-RM were applied in Donana National Park to evaluate their differences and limitations in field application. In terms of simulation, CT-RM offered the best performance in detecting direct interactions, and GPS achieved good performance when using a high number of fixes per hour. Both CTRM and GPS also achieved good performance in detecting indirect interactions. CT-RG, on the other hand, missed most direct and indirect interactions, but correctly identified the pairs of species that interacted indirectly at some point. In the field trial, CT-RM and CT-RG detected almost the same number of species pairs interacting indirectly. However, CT-RG missed at least half of the species pairs that interacted directly. The spatial aggregation of the resource favors the performance of GPS over CT-RM, while the opposite occurs when the frequency of animal visits to the resource increases. To summarize, CT-RM is the most reliable method for detecting interactions when resource monitoring is feasible (e.g., small ponds in arid areas). Otherwise, GPS may show better performance, although it may miss direct interactions if a high fix rate is not used. Finally, the use of CT-RG should be limited to identify which species could potentially interact indirectly, but not to quantify these interactions.

AB  - In the hyperarid Namib Desert, the sand termite Psammotermes allocerus Silvestri, 1908 (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) establishes colonies that create conspicuous, barren patches known as 'fairy circles' on permeable, sandy soils. The central bare areas of fairy circles serve the key function of storing moisture received from sparse rainfall. The sandy soil texture allows rapid infiltration and percolation of precipitation, while localized herbivory by the termites creates the bare patch, thereby reducing the rapid loss of soil moisture by the uptake and transpiration of water by plants. The resulting storage of rain water even during prolonged periods of drought enables perennial life in hyperarid desert environments and forms a globally unique example of ecosystem engineering by social insects. During the past decade, most publications primarily debated the origin of fairy circles. Here, we contribute to the special issue with a focus on the functional and evolutionary dimension of the structure of the Psammotermes colony with two differing nest types and two spatially separated key resources, as a successful adaptation to extreme desert environment. The paper is primarily a review and a synthesis of previous work, with the inclusion of new, relevant findings.This article is part of the theme issue 'The evolutionary ecology of nests: a cross-taxon approach'.

AB  - Deer farming is a robust industry in the United States, with farmed and wild cervids vulnerable to vector-borne diseases such as hemorrhagic disease, caused by bluetongue virus and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus. These viruses are transmitted by biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae: Culicoides), highlighting the importance of vector control in safeguarding deer health on deer farms. Despite the role of biting midges as pathogen vectors, effective control programs for managing biting midges remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, a comprehensive evaluation of current pest and vector management practices on deer farms is essential for designing successful control strategies against hemorrhagic disease vectors. We conducted a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey among Florida trophy-deer farmers using an online questionnaire to gather data related to pest and vector control. Thirty-three survey responses were collected out of a pool of 60 farmers. Sixty-six percent of the respondents used insecticides to control pests and vectors, including biting midges, with nearly 70% of these applications using permethrin-based products, with applications taking place as often as daily. Over 82% of the respondents believe that insecticides are the most effective way to control pests, yet most (66%) do not rotate insecticides, raising concerns about the development of insecticide resistance. Our findings underscore the need for educational programs to enhance deer farmers' understanding of safe and sustainable pest and vector management practices. These efforts could improve pest and vector control efficacy while mitigating the risk of insecticide resistance, ultimately promoting long-term health and productivity in trophy-deer farming.

AB  - The combination of snake-proof barriers and an aerial toxicant-delivery system for snake suppression may allow large-scale control of invasive brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) on Guam. However, suppression or local eradication of several other species (e.g., introduced ungulates, cats, rodents) may be required for successful restoration and recovery of forest habitat and reintroduction of native fauna. Island-wide eradication of invasive species is unlikely on Guam, and existing snake-proof barriers are largely ineffective against cats, rodents, shrews, or monitor lizards. Improved barrier technology and pest-control tools may together provide a viable solution to support localized restoration of species and habitats. We designed and tested prototype multispecies barriers using materials known to repel ungulates, cats, and rodents, with a focus on testing the ability of a rolled hood installed over three different mesh designs to repel brown treesnakes and black rats (Rattus rattus). Woven wire (4.9 x 12 mm aperture, 2.5 mm dia. wire) repelled 99.1% of all snakes, including >= 1031 breach attempts by 106 individuals and 2 successful breaches by 1 small individual. Woven wire (6 x 6 mm aperture, 2.7 mm dia. wire) repelled 100% of all snakes, including 611 breach attempts by 65 individuals. Mini chain link mesh (7 x 9 mm aperture, 1 mm dia. wire) repelled 100% of all snakes, including 1053 breach attempts by 97 individuals. Brown treesnakes were unable to climb either of the two woven wire designs (1642 breach attempts by 171 individuals), making the rolled hood serve as a redundant secondary snake barrier. The rolled hood repelled 100% of all snakes when individuals were provided a climbable surface to access the hood (94 breach attempts by 39 snakes). The probability of a snake being able to climb the mini chain link mesh was inversely related to snout-vent length. The rolled hood repelled 100% of all rats, with 5080 breach attempts by 21 individuals. Recommended next steps include consultation with engineers to address wind loading, structural integrity, material interactions, and integration of decision-support tools to optimize cost and efficacy of barrier designs on the landscape.

AB  - Main conclusionNicotiana attenuata's capacity to interact with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi influences its intraspecific competitive ability under field and glasshouse conditions, but not its overall community productivity.Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can alter the nutrient status and growth of plants, and they can also affect plant-plant, plant-herbivore, and plant-pathogen interactions. These AM effects are rarely studied in populations under natural conditions due to the limitation of non-mycorrhizal controls. Here we used a genetic approach, establishing field and glasshouse communities of AM-harboring Nicotiana attenuata empty vector (EV) plants and isogenic plants silenced in calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase expression (irCCaMK), and unable to establish AM symbioses. Performance and growth were quantified in communities of the same (monocultures) or different genotypes (mixed cultures) and both field and glasshouse experiments returned similar responses. In mixed cultures, AM-harboring EV plants attained greater stalk lengths, shoot and root biomasses, clearly out-competing the AM fungal-deficient irCCaMK plants, while in monocultures, both genotypes grew similarly. Competitive ability was also reflected in reproductive traits: EV plants in mixed cultures outperformed irCCaMK plants. When grown in monocultures, the two genotypes did not differ in reproductive performance, though total leaf N and P contents were significantly lower independent of the community type. Plant productivity in terms of growth and seed production at the community level did not differ, while leaf nutrient content of phosphorus and nitrogen depended on the community type. We infer that AM symbioses drastically increase N. attenuata's competitive ability in mixed communities resulting in increased fitness for the individuals harboring AM without a net gain for the community.

AB  - Simple Summary: Animal production generates emissions of gaseous pollutants to the environment. Natural sorbents are used to reduce emissions increase feed safety and reduce the impact of farms on the environment. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the effect of three natural sorbents added to the diet of pigs on the composition and physicochemical properties of two skeletal muscles (Longissimus lumborum and semimembranosus) of crossbred pigs. The experiment was carried out on a farm in two production cycles. The animals received feed supplemented with three different natural sorbents. The results indicate that the sorbents used in the diet of pigs have no negative effect on the physicochemical properties of meat or its use as case-ready meat or material for processing.
   The effect of three natural sorbents added to the diet of pigs on the composition and physicochemical properties of two skeletal muscles-the musculus Longissimus lumborum (MLL) and musculus semimembranosus (MSM) of crossbred pigs were evaluated. The experiment was carried out on a farm in two production cycles. The addition of biochar (trial 1) significantly influenced instrumental color parameters, shear force and energy, and the oxidative stability of the skeletal muscles, while the proximate composition, pH, texture, and water-holding capacity (WHC) parameters did not differ significantly between groups in either of the two muscles. Similarly, no statistical differences were noted in the proximate chemical composition, texture parameters, or WHC of the meat in trial 2. The addition of both sorbents was associated with a significantly (p <= 0.01) lower content of haem pigments in the MLL and MSM, which was accompanied by a significantly (p <= 0.05) higher lightness (L*). Moreover, the MLL muscle of the pigs had higher oxidative stability, as well as lower drip loss (DL). In turn, the MSM of pigs had a significantly lower pH compared to the control group, however, the ultimate pH (48 h) in all groups was within the acceptable range (5.50-5.80). Summing up, the sorbents used are a safe ingredient in the diet of pigs, however, there is a need to continue and strengthen this line of research, including the relationships linking the future production goals of pig farming and processing potential in the meat industry with current climate policy.

AB  - Ammonia (NH 3 ), a significant precursor of particulate matter, affects not only biodiversity, ecosystems, and soil acidification but also climate and human health. In addition, its concentrations are constantly rising due to increasing feeding needs and the large use of fertilization and animal farming. Despite the significance of ammonia, its emissions are associated with large uncertainties, while its atmospheric abundance is difficult to measure. Nowadays, satellite products can effectively measure ammonia with low uncertainty and a global coverage. Here, we use satellite observations of column ammonia in combination with an inversion algorithm to derive ammonia emissions with a high resolution over Europe for the period 2013-2020. Ammonia emissions peak in northern Europe due to agricultural application and livestock management, in western Europe (industrial activity), and over Spain (pig farming). Emissions have decreased by - 26 % since 2013 (from 5431 Gg in 2013 to 3994 Gg in 2020), showing that the abatement strategies adopted by the European Union have been very efficient. The slight increase ( + 4.4 %) in 2015 is also reproduced here and is attributed to some European countries exceeding annual emission targets. Ammonia emissions are low in winter (286 Gg) and peak in summer (563 Gg) and are dominated by the temperature-dependent volatilization of ammonia from the soil. The largest emission decreases were observed in central and eastern Europe ( - 38 %) and in western Europe ( - 37 %), while smaller decreases were recorded in northern ( - 17 %) and southern Europe ( - 7.6 %). When complemented with ground observations, modelled concentrations using the posterior emissions showed improved statistics, also following the observed seasonal trends. The posterior emissions presented here also agree well with respective estimates reported in the literature and inferred from bottom-up and top-down methodologies. These results indicate that satellite measurements combined with inverse algorithms constitute a robust tool for emission estimates and can infer the evolution of ammonia emissions over large timescales.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPlant domestication can alter plant and insect interactions and influence bottom-up and top-down effects. However, little is known about the effects of wild, local, and cultivated varieties of the same plant species in the same region on herbivores and their parasitoids. Here, six tobacco varieties were selected: wild Bishan and Badan tobaccos, local Liangqiao and Shuangguan sun-cured tobaccos, and cultivated Xiangyan 5 and Cunsanpi. We examined how wild, local, and cultivated tobacco types affect the tobacco cutworm herbivore Spodoptera litura and its parasitoid Meteorus pulchricornis. RESULTSLevels of nicotine and trypsin protease inhibitor in leaves and the fitness of S. litura larvae varied significantly among the varieties. Wild tobacco had the highest levels of nicotine and trypsin protease inhibitor, which reduced the survival rate and prolonged the development period of S. litura. The tobacco types significantly influenced the life history parameters and host selection of M. pulchricornis. The cocoon weight, cocoon emergence rate, adult longevity, hind tibia length, and offspring fecundity of M. pulchricornis increased, whereas the development period decreased from wild to local to cultivated varieties. The parasitoids were more likely to select wild and local varieties than cultivated varieties. CONCLUSIONDomestication of tobacco resulted in reduced resistance to S. litura in cultivated tobacco. Wild tobacco varieties suppress S. litura populations, adversely affect M. pulchricornis, and may enhance bottom-up and top-down control of S. litura. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In November 2019, muscone content was measured from musk secreted by 114 male captive Alpine musk deer in Xinglongshan Alpine Musk Deer Farm located in Xinglongshan National Nature Reserve, western China. The relationships between muscone content and individual age, health, mating history and enclosure condition were analyzed. The results showed that the muscone content ranged from 0.35% to 5.55% (dry weight percentage of muscone in musk), which was correlated with age (r = -0.132). The muscone content of adults (1.5-8.5 yrs.;1.17 +/- 0.09%) was significantly higher than in older individuals (9.5-11.5 yrs.; 0.85 +/- 0.06%; p < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between health and muscone content (r = 0.266; p < 0.01), with healthy males (1.16 +/- 0.09%) having significantly higher muscone content than weaker ones (0.92 +/- 0.07%, p < 0.05). The muscone content of males mated in the former year (1.23 +/- 0.14%) was higher than that of unmated males (1.04 +/- 0.08%; p > 0.05). The males in the enclosure with lower (1.04 +/- 0.12%), medium (1.14 +/- 0.16%) and higher density conditions (1.17 +/- 0.13%) did not significantly differ in muscone levels. Males that lived with females had slightly higher muscone content (1.18 +/- 0.12%) than those who did not (1.06 +/- 0.10%; p > 0.05). In general, muscone content of musk decreased with age and poor health, but mating history or captive environment had insignificant effect. In musk deer farming, the farms could enhance the health of musk deer and concentrate on younger individuals in order to improve the musk quality and sustainable production of musk resources.

AB  - Tropical ectotherms are particularly vulnerable to global warming because their physiologies are assumed to be adapted to narrow temperature ranges. This study explores three mechanisms potentially constraining thermal adaptation to global warming in tropical insects: (a) Trade-offs in genotypic performance at different temperatures (the jack-of-all-trades hypothesis), (b) positive genetic covariance in performance, with some genotypes performing better than others at viable temperatures (the 'winner' and 'loser' genotypes hypothesis), or (c) limited genetic variation as the potential result of relaxed selection and the loss of genes associated with responses to extreme temperatures (the gene decay hypothesis). We estimated changes in growth and survival rates at multiple temperatures for three tropical rain forest insect herbivores (Cephaloleia rolled-leaf beetles, Chrysomelidae). We reared 2,746 individuals in a full sibling experimental design, at temperatures known to be experienced by this genus of beetles in nature (i.e. 10-35 degrees C). Significant genetic covariance was positive for 16 traits, supporting the 'winner' and 'loser' genotypes hypothesis. Only two traits displayed negative cross-temperature performance correlations. We detected a substantial contribution of genetic variance in traits associated with size and mass (0%-44%), but low heritability in plastic traits such as development time (0%-6%) or survival (0%-4%). Lowland insect populations will most likely decline if current temperatures increase between 2 and 5 degrees C. It is concerning that local adaption is already lagging behind current temperatures. The consequences of maintaining the current global warming trajectory would be devastating for tropical insects. However, if humans can limit or slow warming, many tropical ectotherms might persist in their current locations and potentially adapt to warmer temperatures.

AB  - BackgroundBehavioral responses of prey to predation risk have ecological impacts that can be as great as direct mortality. Risk response involves either behavioral changes or spatial avoidance, but it is not clear how prey decide between these strategies. Theory often suggests that prey pair responses to risks based on the hunting mode of the prey (hunting mode hypothesis), but prey may ignore hunting mode to prioritize responding to the most lethal predators (lethality hypothesis). Furthermore, prey may respond to the spatial distribution of these risks (risky places hypothesis) or respond only during the periods of highest risk (risky times hypothesis).MethodsTo test these hypotheses, we evaluated the behavioral responses of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to risks from two natural mesopredators and human sources of mortality. Specifically, we determined, for each source of risk, whether deer responded with behavioral state changes or spatial avoidance and whether this behavior changed with time (diurnally and annually). We collared and tracked 40 female and 29 male deer. To determine the response of deer to risk, we collected data on the distribution of coyotes (Canis latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), human modification, hunters, and roads. We used hidden Markov models to determine whether each covariate impacted the probability of transitioning between behavioral states and selection functions to determine whether deer spatially avoided each covariate.ResultsGenerally, deer changed behavioral state in response to both mesopredators but avoided human modification. In response to mesopredators, deer consistently shifted to slower movement behavioral states. Spatial responses to human modification varied depending on the time of day. During daylight hours, deer selected for human modification, but during the crepuscular and nighttime period, deer avoided human modification.ConclusionsSpace use was most strongly related to more lethal humans, providing support for the lethality hypothesis. Despite prioritizing humans, mesopredators impacted behavioral state, suggesting that mesopredators still have important impacts on prey behavior. Finally, temporal patterns of avoidance align with other studies that indicate avoidance of predators is time-dependent, but further highlight the complex push-pull relationship of human modified areas on wildlife.

AB  - Plants typically experience great losses from their reproductive potential represented by ovule production to the post-dispersal crop of viable seed. We examined seed density and viability in a founder population of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa), aiming to quantify losses at different stages and examine potential selection forces on the reproduction success of the founder generation of an isolated population. At the time of the study (2017-2020), the population had recently reached reproductive maturity, following its colonization around 1990 through long-distance dispersal onto an early successional outwash plain in southeast Iceland. Seed densities were high, but 89% of apparently intact seeds did not contain an embryo, despite being visually indistinguishable from filled seeds. Externally evident losses amounted to about 45% of the total seed crop and were mostly due to predation by the gall midge Semudobia betulae. When all losses were accounted for, 2.7% of the seed crop remained viable and germinated. Pollen limitation may partially explain the high incidence of empty seeds. Excessive flower production is compatible with the predator satiation hypothesis but cannot explain pre-dispersal losses. Another adaptation to predation, masting, appears poorly developed in Iceland. Our results suggest the presence of constraints on the reproduction potential of the new island population, that are more limiting than in neighbouring populations, and we discuss their developmental, ecological, and environmental correlates.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of various treatments on soil pH, SOC, and crop yield in red soil with a pH of 4.25 through a two-year field experiment, using a rapeseed and sesame cropping system. The treatments included the control (CK); lime (CaO) (L); fully fermented pig manure (M); a calcium-magnesium-phosphate fertilizer (P); lime and fully fermented pig manure (LM); lime and the calcium-magnesium-phosphate fertilizer (LP); fully fermented pig manure and the calcium-magnesium-phosphate fertilizer (MP); and lime, fully fermented pig manure, and the calcium-magnesium-phosphate fertilizer (LMP). Then, the changes in yield, soil pH, and SOC were analyzed. The results showed that, among all treatments, the LMP treatment produced the highest yields for both rapeseed (93.62%) and sesame (45.10%); they increased by 93.62% and 45.10% compared with that for CK. Furthermore, these treatments with lime application increased the soil pH. During the rapeseed season, compared with CK, the soil pH values increased by 0.87, 0.75, 0.90, 1.03, 1.24, 1.18, and 1.45 units in the L, M, P, LM, LP, MP, and LMP treatments, respectively. Moreover, they increased by 0.66, 0.34, 0.51, 0.95, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.03 units, respectively, in the sesame season. Similarly, in terms of yield, the highest pH was observed in the LMP treatment for both the rapeseed and sesame seasons. In contrast to soil pH, the effects of these treatments on SOC were less pronounced. Furthermore, the relationship between soil pH and crop yields was significant (R-2, p < 0.05). In addition, fitted equations indicated a higher yield response (5.17%) in rapeseed compared with that in sesame (2.32%), while soil pH increased by 0.1 unit. Therefore, the combined application of lime, composted pig manure, and calcium-magnesium-phosphate is an effective strategy to reduce soil acidification and improve crop yield in highly acidified red soils, with the increase in soil pH having a more substantial impact on crop yield than the increase in SOC.

AB  - The present study investigated the impact of peat moss as a feed additive on the emission of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from piggery slurry stored in slurry pits. There is no well-known study on the relationship between pig manure generated after feeding peat moss as a feed additive and CH4 and CO2 released during the storage period. A lab-scale experiment was conducted for two months using a slurry pit simulator composed of six vessels-three for pig slurry collected after feeding 3.0% peat moss as a feed additive (PFS) and three for pig slurry without feeding peat moss (CTL). PFS reduced CO2 and CH4 emissions (p < 0.05) from stored pig slurry by approximately 23% and 44%, respectively. PFS exhibits substantially elevated concentrations of humic substance (HS) such as humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin compared with CTL, with fold differences of 2.3, 1.8, and 1.1, respectively. Elevated HS levels in the PFS seemed to limit hydrolysis, resulting in lower total volatile fatty acid concentrations compared with CTL. A dominance of CH4 in total carbon emissions was observed (p < 0.05), with CH4 accounting for approximately 93% and 95% of total carbon emissions in PFS and CTL, respectively. PFS had a roughly 43% lower impact on cumulative carbon emissions than CTL, primarily due to decreased CH4 emissions. These findings suggest that PFS may be a promising approach for mitigating carbon emissions and potentially impacting environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation efforts.

AB  - Context. Rhinoptera steindachneri is the third-most abundant batoid species in the artisanal gillnet fishery of the Gulf of California, but there are limited age and growth data available for management. Aims. The aim was to estimate age and growth of this species from vertebral centra of 276 individuals. Methods. Two adjusted data sets were constructed on the basis of the birth and capture months and defining adequately the birth band. Individual growth was described through a multi-model approach and inference by using von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and Logistic models (two and three parameters), and a two-phase growth model (four and five parameters). Key results. The model with the best fit to the size-at-age data was the two-phase model for both sexes (females: Dw(infinity )= 91.21 cm; k = 0.25 year(-1), Dw(infinity) = 46.2 cm; males: Dw(infinity) = 79.1 cm; k = 0.42 year(-1), Dw(infinity) = 45.5 cm). Maximum ages ranged from 9.92 to 10.75 years (female) and from 6.92 to 7.67 years (males). Maturity age was estimated in 3.92 years (females) and 3.72 years (males). Conclusions. Rhinoptera steindachneri is a batoid species with intermediate growth and a shorter lifespan than for confamilial species and even than species with similar reproductive traits. Implications. The need to carry out age validation studies for this species is highlighted.

TI  - Early depictions of the first Lisbon rhinoceros in the 16th century
T2  - PACHYDERM
LA  - English
AB  - The first post-Roman rhinoceros to be seen alive in Europe reached the harbour of Lisbon, Portugal on 20 May 1515. After a fight with an elephant staged on 3 June 1515, King Dom Manuel I 'the Fortunate' decided to gift the rhino to Pope Leo X in Rome. The animal drowned when the vessel was shipwrecked in a storm off La Spezia in northern Italy at the end of January 1516. Information and a sketch reached the German city of Nuremberg, where Albrecht D & uuml;rer proceeded to make a drawing with text dated 1515, followed by a woodcut of the Lisbon Rhinoceros. D & uuml;rer's works show a characteristic twisted horn in the shoulder region, found in all later copies, which became the standard representation of the rhinoceros from 1545, in books and artworks. During the first part of the 16th century, until about 1560, there were at least 16 works which showed a rhinoceros without this D & uuml;rer-hornlet. These would have been sketches of the living animal during its short life in Europe, or possibly been derived from such portrayals. Five of such works have remained largely unknown, and are here described, discussed and illustrated. First, there is a set of similar engravings found in three separate Cartinhas (booklets) produced in Portugal between 1534- 1544 by the printer Germ & atilde;o Galharde, where the animal is uniquely named "Rhinocerom", noted here in zoological context for the first time. Second, two similar figures of a rhinoceros on the cover of a pamphlet published by the Italian author Giovanni Giacomo Penni and seen in the background of a large painting by Francesco Granacci of 1515-1516, might both be based on a coloured unsigned sketch found in a volume of manuscripts held in the Library of the Vatican (Vat. lat. 2847). Third, the Historia Senensium by Sigismondo Tizio contains a sketch of a rhinoceros in shackles in an entry for 1515. Fourth, a rhinoceros is found among marginal drawings and manuscript annotations added to a volume of Pliny's Natural History. Finally, a book on Quadrupeds published by Michael Herr in 1546 has an independent illustration of a rhinoceros without a hornlet on the shoulders and was copied in books by Hubert de L'Espine of 1558 and Barth & eacute;lemy Aneau of 1549. All examples are illustrated for future comparison.

FX  - We dedicate this short paper to Hermann Walter (b. 1934) , who retired from the University of Mannheim, where he specialized in Roman Grammar and Mythographie. He came across rhinoceros' depictions in the course of his original research in Italian libraries, museums and buildings. These were the subject of a small number of incisive papers, which deserve to be better known. Walter and KR corresponded for several years in the 1990s and 2000s, exchanging ideas and information on rhinoceros iconography. Through his intensive and informed research, the iconography of the rhinoceros has made some great leaps helping to build a better understanding of the historical events. In our search of early Ganda images, we were greatly assisted by the specialists and librarians in Portugal: Helga Maria Justen, bibliographic researcher in Lisbon; Zelia Parreira, Director, Biblioteca Publica de Evora; and Maria de Fatima Bogalho, General Library of the University of Coimbra. We thank Annemarie Jordan Gschwend for reading an early draft and providing information on her forthcoming paper. Many of the older books, drawings and manuscripts can now be consulted online, thanks to the invaluable efforts of the world's museums and libraries to digitize their holdings. We are grateful to these institutions who have allowed us to reproduce the artwork in their care. The Rhino Resource Center (RRC) is sponsored by SOS Rhino and IRF-International Rhino Foundation.

AB  - Seahorses comprise a charismatic, high-value and high conservation-concern group of fishes, whose demographics, including the dynamics of populations, are poorly studied. In this paper, we fill this key knowledge gap by determining the population dynamics of two threatened species, Hippocampus kuda and H. trimaculatus, from the south-east coast of India using samples encountered in trawl by-catch. Hippocampus kuda showed a comparatively greater asymptotic length, whereas H. trimaculatus had a greater growth coefficient and growth performance index. Further, H. trimaculatus showed two recruitment peaks (March/April and December) in a year, against a single peak (February) for H. kuda. An assessment of mortality rates (instantaneous total, natural and fishing) indicated a high vulnerability of the local population of both species to fishing pressure. Hippocampus kuda had a greater mean length at first capture than H. trimaculatus. Biomass-per-recruit analysis showed that the exploitation of H. kuda is closer to the exploitation rates under which stock will be reduced to half the unexploited biomass, suggesting their extreme vulnerability to overexploitation, even as 'by-catch'. Demographic parameters of the two threatened seahorses indicated that even as 'incidental catch', these species are vulnerable to overfishing, and species-specific conservation guidelines need to be developed and their on-ground implementation and enforcement ensured.

AB  - Amino acid balance is central to improving the efficiency of feed protein utilization and for reducing environmental pollution caused by intensive farming. In previous studies, supplementation with limiting amino acids has been shown to be an effective means of improving animal nutrient utilization and performance. In this experiment, the effects of methionine on the apparent digestibility of nutrients, antler nutrient composition, rumen fluid amino acid composition, fecal volatile fatty acids and intestinal bacteria in antler-growing sika deer were investigated by randomly adding different levels of methionine to the diets of three groups of four deer at 0 g/day (CON), 4 g/day (LMet) and 6 g/day (HMet). Methionine supplementation significantly increased the apparent digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in the LMet group (p < 0.05). The crude protein and collagen protein of antlers were significantly higher in the LMet and HMet groups compared to the CON group and also significantly higher in the HMet group compared to the LMet group, while the calcium content of antlers was significantly lower in the HMet group (p < 0.05). Ruminal fluid free amino acid composition was altered in the three groups of sika deer, with significant changes in aspartic acid, citrulline, valine, cysteine, methionine, histidine and proline. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were highest in the rectal microflora. Unidentified bacterial abundance was significantly decreased in the HMet group compared to the CON group. Based on the results of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Adonis analysis, there was a significant difference in the composition of the intestinal flora between the CON and HMet groups (p < 0.05). At the genus level, compared with the CON group, the abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-010 in the LMet group increased significantly (p < 0.05), the abundance of dgA-11_gut_group in the HMet group decreased significantly (p < 0.05) and the abundance of Lachnospiraceae_UCG-010, Saccharofermentans and Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group increased significantly. Taken together, the results showed that methionine supplementation was beneficial in increasing the feed utilization efficiency and improving antler quality in sika deer, while affecting the composition of fecal bacteria.

AB  - Context: Shark and ray fisheries in the southern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) are multispecific and use diverse fishing gear in multiple coastal areas. Aim: Because no catch and fishing effort records by species exist, the aim of this study was to estimate the species' vulnerability to fisheries through limited-data assessment methods. Methods: The vulnerability to 14 fisheries through the productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA) and rebound-potential method were estimated for 14 elasmobranchs. Key results: Carcharhinus falciformis, Carcharhinus plumbeus and Sphyrna lewini among sharks, besides Hypanus americanus and Aetobatus narinari among rays, had the highest vulnerability and the lowest rebound potential. The sensitivity tests showed that the most significant differences in cumulative vulnerability (Cv) occur between two alternative widely applied PSA approaches. Cv determined from scores averaged over a range of susceptibility attributes tends to be higher than the product of the scores of four standard susceptibility attributes. Conclusions: Significant correlations between Cv of Approach 1 and rebound-potential scenarios were estimated, indicating a general pattern in which the species' rebound-potential increases while the vulnerability decreases.

AB  - The practice of utilizing animal manures on land is widespread in agriculture, but it has raised concerns about the possible spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the potential risk it poses to public health through food production. Fermentation bed culture is an effective circular agricultural practice commonly utilized in pig farming that minimizes the environmental impact of livestock farming. However, this method generates a significant amount of fermentation bed waste (FBW), which can be turned into organic fertilizer for land application. The objective of this research was to examine the impacts of amending agricultural soil samples with swine manure-derived FBW on microbial communities, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and ARG profiles over different periods. The study findings indicated that the amendment of swine manure-derived FBW significantly increased the diversity and abundance of ARGs and MGEs during the early stages of amendment, but this effect diminished over time, and after 12 months of FBW amendments, the levels returned to those comparable to control samples. The shift in the bacterial communities played a significant role in shaping the patterns of ARGs. Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were identified as the primary potential hosts of ARGs through metagenomic binning analysis. Furthermore, the pH of soil samples was identified as the most important property in driving the composition of the bacterial community and soil resistome. These findings provided valuable insights into the temporal patterns and dissemination risks of ARGs in FBW-amended agriculture soil, which could contribute to the development of effective strategies to manage the dissemination risks of FBW-derived ARGs.

AB  - Background Yaks have a strong adaptability to the plateau environment, which can be attributed to the effective oxygen utilization rate of their lung tissue. Elastic fibre confers an important adaptive structure to the alveolar tissues in yaks. However, little research has been focused on the structural development of lung tissues and the expression levels of elastic fibres in yaks after birth. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the morphological changes of elastic fibers and expression profiles of fibre-formation genes in yak lungs at different growth stages and the relationship between these changes and plateau adaptation. Results Histological staining was employed to observe the morphological changes in the lung tissue structure of yaks at four different ages: 1 day old, 30 days old, 180 days old and adult. There was no significant difference in the area of a single alveolus between the 1-day-old and 30-day-old groups (P-value > 0.05). However, the single alveolar area was gradually increased with an increase in age (P-value < 0.05). Elastic fibre staining revealed that the amount of elastic fibres in alveolar tissue was increased significantly from the ages of 30 days to 180 days (P-value < 0.05) and stabilized during the adult stage. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the highest levels of differentially expressed genes were found between 30 days of age and 180 days of age. KEGG analysis showed that PI3K-Akt signalling pathway and MAPK pathway, which are involved in fibre formation, accounted for the largest proportion of differentially expressed genes between 30 days of age and 180 days of age. The expression levels of 36 genes related to elastic fibre formation and collagen fibre formation were also analysed, and most of these genes were highly expressed in 30-day-old and 180-day-old yaks. Conclusions The content of elastic fibres in the alveolar tissue of yaks increases significantly after birth, but this change occurs only from 30 days of age to 180 days of age. Our study indicates that elastic fibres can improve the efficiency of oxygen utilization in yaks under harsh environmental conditions.

Seven treatment groups were established: a low-concentrate control (LC; 50 % concentrate + 50 % forage), a high-concentrate control (HC; 80 % concentrate + 20 % forage), and HC diets supplemented with 0.5 %, 1 %, 2 %, 4 %, or 8 % yeast beta-glucan. Rumen pH, gas production, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles were measured at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h of in vitro fermentation. At 9, 12, and 24 h, concentrations of deleterious metabolites-lactic acid, endotoxin (LPS), and histamine-were quantified. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to compare microbial community structures among the LC, HC, and HC + 1 % beta-glucan (1 % HCG) groups. The effects of fermentation supernatants on inflammatory gene expression and epithelial barrier integrity were evaluated using a yak rumen epithelial cell (YREC) model. Results demonstrated that the LC group maintained ruminal pH > 5.5 at all time points, whereas the HC group exhibited pH < 5.5 after 9, 12, and 24 h. Supplementation with 1-8 % yeast beta-glucan significantly elevated pH (P < 0.05) to values comparable with the LC group. Relative to LC, the HC group showed significant reductions in pH, microbial crude protein (MCP), acetate concentration, and acetate:propionate ratio (P < 0.05), concomitant with significant increases in NH3-N, propionate, butyrate, total VFA, and harmful metabolites (lactic acid, LPS, and histamine) (P < 0.05). Microbial community analysis revealed that HC feeding decreased the relative abundances of specific genera within the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Moreover, the HC diet upregulated pro-inflammatory gene expression and downregulated genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and cytoskeletal integrity in YRECs. Yeast beta-glucan supplementation (1-8 %) mitigated SARA-associated perturbations in fermentation parameters-elevating pH, acetate concentration, acetate:propionate ratio, and MCP content; reducing NH3-N accumulation; and lowering lactic acid, LPS, and histamine concentrations-while modulating key bacterial taxa and attenuating inflammatory responses and epithelial damage. In conclusion, yeast beta-glucan effectively alleviates high-concentrate diet-induced ruminal acidosis and promotes rumen health.

AB  - Purpose Sheep sector in Canada is growing, and producers have ranked their desire to estimate the environmental performance of sheep farming (for benchmarking and marketability) high. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on the Canadian sheep sector are underrepresented, however, and record on feeding options and pasture management on sheep farms is difficult to find. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting a cradle-to-gate LCA on sheep production using Ontario-specific primary data. Methods Life cycle implications of Ontario's sheep meat production in the categories of global warming (GW), non-renewable energy demand (ED), and water depletion (WD) are estimated by considering the impacts of livestock emissions, feed production, manure management, and farming infrastructure/operations up to the point where the animal leaves the farm for slaughter (i.e., cradle-to-farmgate system boundary). Data on sheep farming practices from 23 farms in Ontario is gathered (primarily through surveys), parametrized, and inputted into the LCA model to estimate Ontario-specific impacts. Allocation of impacts to sheep meat is done through protein mass allocation (PMA), and impact scores are normalized using a functional unit of kilogram liveweight (kg LW). The LCA model code is made available under General Public License (GPL) for further application and improvement. Results and discussion Life cycle impacts per kg LW meat for over 90% of the sampled farms are in the range of 8.4-18.6 kg CO2 eq for GW, 18.6-92.4 MJ for ED, and 0.06-0.27 m(3) for WD. PMA factors for meat are in the range of 68-80%. On average, enteric emissions from livestock are responsible for 39% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, followed by feed production (29%), farm operations (23%), and manure management (10%). ED and WD impacts are each roughly split evenly between feed production and farm operations. Regression analysis between farm practices and impacts shows that farming intensity does not have a significant effect on impact scores. Conclusions and recommendations Ontario sheep sector's impact scores, particularly for GW, are consistent with values observed in the literature. This study may represent an important first step in understanding the life cycle environmental implications of Canadian sheep farming, but room for improvement remains. It is recommended that a sensitivity analysis be carried to gauge the effect of farming practices on impact scores, and aquatic eutrophication impacts should be included in the model, considering the presence of algal growth in Ontario.

AB  - Associational effects are a phenomenon in which herbivore damage on co-occurring plant species is influenced by neighboring plants. Mistletoes are a group of shrubs that obtain nutrients from host plants through haustoria. Despite the potential for mistletoe herbivory to be affected by associational effects with their hosts, the effects of host and mistletoe functional traits on mistletoe herbivory have been largely overlooked. This study aimed to evaluate the associational effects of host plants and the direct effects of mistletoe functional traits on mistletoe herbivory. To achieve this, we measured leaf herbivory and leaf traits of three mistletoe species (Dendrophthoe pentandra, Scurrula chingii var. yunnanensis, and Helixanthera parasitica) and their associated 11 host species during both dry and wet seasons. Our results showed that leaf herbivory of D. pentandra and S. chingii var. yunnanensis differed significantly on their respective host species, but H. parasitica did not. The relationships between mistletoe and the paired host herbivory differed between seasons, with a stronger positive relationship observed during the dry season. Furthermore, significant relationships were observed between paired leaf carbon, leaf nitrogen, and condensed tannin in mistletoes and their host plants, indicating that host plants can affect mistletoes' leaf functional traits. A group of mistletoe leaf traits provided significant predictions for leaf herbivory: leaves with higher leaf thickness and leaf total nitrogen showed higher herbivory. Overall, our study reveals that mistletoe leaf herbivory is directly affected by its leaf traits and indirectly affected by host associational effects, primarily through changes in mistletoes' leaf traits.

AB  - Moths are among the most diverse and abundant animals. They have evolved a suite of acoustic defenses, such as producing ultrasound to guard against predation by low-duty-cycle bats. Recently, we found that the ultrasonic clicks of several moth species can also help decrease the capture success of high-duty-cycle bats. We tested whether moth clicks could advertise moth toxicity and/or jam the echolocation calls of high-duty-cycle bats. We examined the acoustic response of a hawkmoth (Cechenena minor) and a tiger moth (Creatonotos transiens) to free-flying horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus osgoodi. C. minor and C. transiens produced anti-bat ultrasonic clicks with an average duty cycle of 22.3% and 4.9%, respectively. The clicks of C. minor overlapped spectrally with the echolocation calls of R. osgoodi. C. minor occasionally emitted clicks immediately after the end of bat feeding buzzes. The clicks of C. transiens did not overlap spectrally with the echolocation calls of R. osgoodi. More than half the click sequences of C. transiens were produced before the emergence of bat feeding buzzes and did not overlap temporally with the feeding buzzes. Moreover, we found that C. minor was palatable and C. transiens was unpalatable to R. osgoodi. These results suggest that C. minor might be capable of jamming R. osgoodi and might also use ultrasonic clicks as warning signals. The clicks of C. transiens probably function to advertise moth toxicity. This study highlights the diversity of moth anti-bat sounds and illustrates the potential mechanisms of moth acoustic defense against high-duty-cycle bats.

AB  - Herbivores have evolved distinct strategies to cope with plant defenses prior to becoming a pest. Some evolved resistance to toxic compounds; others suppress host toxin production. These traits seem to co-occur within herbivore species, particularly among spider mites, which are major pests in many crops. The intraspecific variation within the spider mites is a model for adaptive pest evolution on crops such as tomato. Empirical data collected from nonsolanaceous wild host plants suggest that natural populations predominantly comprise individuals capable of inducing tomato defenses, while a small proportion suppress these defenses. Additionally, resistant individuals are observed only rarely within these populations. This study aimed to investigate the presence of these traits within populations adapted to tomato plants. Here, Tetranychus urticae populations sampled from tomato at three field sites were compared. To discriminate between mites that induce/suppress defenses and to assess their degree of resistance, the magnitude of induced defenses was measured and aligned with oviposition data. The expression of effector 84 was also assessed to determine whether its magnitude of expression is a good predictor of suppression with the magnitude of suppression. Surprisingly, we observed that suppression is the dominant phenotype in mite populations collected from field-grown tomatoes. Our results suggest that suppression may be rare only at the beginning of an herbivore's adaptive trajectory after colonization of a novel host but may rapidly become common due to natural selection. This suggests the possibility that suppression potentially represents a prevalent phenotype among host-adapted herbivores and, consequently, among pests.

AB  - Understanding the distribution of herbivore damage among leaves and individual plants is a central goal of plant-herbivore biology. Commonly observed unequal patterns of herbivore damage have conventionally been attributed to the heterogeneity in plant quality or herbivore behaviour or distribution. Meanwhile, the potential role of stochastic processes in structuring plant-herbivore interactions has been overlooked. Here, we show that based on simple first principle expectations from metabolic theory, random sampling of different sizes of herbivores from a regional pool is sufficient to explain patterns of variation in herbivore damage. This is despite making the neutral assumption that herbivory is caused by randomly feeding herbivores on identical and passive plants. We then compared its predictions against 765 datasets of herbivory on 496 species across 116 degrees of latitude from the Herbivory Variability Network. Using only one free parameter, the estimated attack rate, our neutral model approximates the observed frequency distribution of herbivore damage among plants and especially among leaves very well. Our results suggest that neutral stochastic processes play a large and underappreciated role in natural variation in herbivory and may explain the low predictability of herbivory patterns. We argue that such prominence warrants its consideration as a powerful force in plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary Ticks transmit different disease-causing agents to humans and animals. Pakistan is an agricultural country, the rural economy mainly relies on livestock farming, and tick infestation is a severe constraint to its livelihood. The genus Anaplasma comprises obligate Gram-negative intracellular bacteria multiplying within the host cells and can be transmitted to humans and animals through the tick vector. The current study aimed to molecularly characterize the Anaplasma spp. in hard ticks infesting livestock in different districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The present study reported nine species of hard ticks infesting different hosts. The most prevalent tick life stage was adult females, followed by nymphs and adult males. In the phylogenetic tree, 16S rDNA sequences of Anaplasma spp. clustered with sequences of A. marginale. The hard ticks act as a carrier for the transmission of A. marginale. Further extensive country-wide research is required to explore the diverse tick species and the associated pathogens in Pakistan. Ticks transmit pathogens to animals and humans more often than any other arthropod vector. The rural economy of Pakistan mainly depends on livestock farming, and tick infestations cause severe problems in this sector. The present study aimed to molecularly characterize the Anaplasma spp. in hard ticks collected from six districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Ticks were collected from various livestock hosts, including cattle breeds (Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, Sahiwal, and Achai), Asian water buffaloes, sheep, and goats from March 2018 to February 2019. Collected ticks were morphologically identified and subjected to molecular screening of Anaplasma spp. by amplifying 16S rDNA sequences. Six hundred seventy-six ticks were collected from infested hosts (224/350, 64%). Among the nine morphologically identified tick species, the highest occurrence was noted for Rhipicephalus microplus (254, 37.6%), followed by Hyalomma anatolicum (136, 20.1%), Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides (119, 17.6%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (116, 17.1%), Haemaphysalis montgomeryi (14, 2.1%), Hyalomma dromedarii (11, 1.6%), Haemaphysalis bispinosa (10, 1.5%), Hyalomma scupense (8, 1.2%), and Haemaphysalis kashmirensis (8, 1.2%). The occurrence of tick females was highest (260, 38.5%), followed by nymphs (246, 36.4%) and males (170, 25.1%). Overall, the highest occurrence of ticks was recorded in the Peshawar district (239, 35.3%), followed by Mardan (183, 27.1%), Charsadda (110, 16.3%), Swat (52, 7.7%), Shangla (48, 7.1%), and Chitral (44, 6.5%). Among these ticks, Anaplasma marginale was detected in R. microplus, R. turanicus, and R. haemaphysaloides. The 16S rDNA sequences showed high identity (98-100%) with A. marginale reported from Australia, China, Japan, Pakistan, Thailand, Uganda, and the USA. In phylogenetic analysis, the sequence of A. marginale clustered with the same species reported from Australia, China, Pakistan, Thailand, Uruguay, and the USA. Further molecular work regarding the diversity of tick species and associated pathogens is essential across the country.

AB  - The present experiment was aimed to study differential expression of miRNAs and related mRNAs during heat stress (HS) in buffalo heifers. Twelve Murrah buffalo heifers aged between 1.5 and 2.0 years, weighting between 250 and 300 Kg were randomly assigned into two equal groups. The animals were kept in the psychrometric chamber under Thermo-neutral (TN; THI = 72) and HS (THI = 87-90) conditions for 6 h every day between 1000 and 1600 h for 21 days. The blood sampling was done at 1500 h on 15th day of the experiment and physiological parameters viz. pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded at 1500 h on day -5, -3, -1, 0, +1, +3, +5 with respect to blood sampling. PBMCs were used for extraction of miRNAs and total RNA; and first strand cDNA was synthesized. qPCR was performed for relative gene expression studies. Physiological, hematological (erythrocytic indices), biochemical (triglycerides, urea, ALT, AST, LDH), redox (SOD, ROS) and endocrine parameters (T-4) altered significantly (P < 0.05) during HS as compared to TN. Out of eight targeted miRNAs only four were expressed in buffalo heifers. The relative expression of bta-mir-142, btamir-1248 and bta-mir-2332 was significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated whereas expression of bta-mir-2478 was significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated during HS as compared to TN. The relative expression of the predicted target genes i.e. HSF1, HSP60, HSP70, HSPA8 and HSP90 were significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated whereas HSF4 expression was significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated during HS as compared to TN. It can be concluded that a THI of 87-90 could lead to a moderate HS in buffalo heifers. Differential expression studies of miRNAs and related mRNAs in present study deciphers the role of miRNAs in the heat tolerance in buffalo heifers.

AB  - Simple Summary Motivation to express a socially learned behavior can be inhibited or facilitated by the presence of socially dominant individuals, who often attract greater attention from their conspecifics. This study investigated whether experienced pigs (termed "demonstrators") of higher rank attract greater attention from their pen mates when they are observed from behind an acrylic panel while being gently handled by the stockperson. We also investigated whether the presence of a demonstrator pig of different social rank, who previously established a positive relationship with the stockperson in presence of conspecifics, affects the motivation and behaviors of their pen mates to positively interact with humans. Our results show that during the gentle handling of the demonstrator, there was an overall preference for observer pigs to visually attend to the dominant demonstrators more than the low-ranking demonstrators. Furthermore, our study shows that the proximity of a dominant demonstrator pig interfered with the motivation of their pen mates to positively interact with the stockperson, whereas the presence of a subordinate demonstrator facilitated the expression of a greater affinity toward the human, resulting in longer physical contact, and a higher percentage of accepted strokes. These findings reveal that social dynamics and dominance rank have a strong effect on the attentional state and the facilitation and inhibition of social behaviors in domestic pigs. In this study, we addressed the social attentiveness, as well as the phenomenon of social facilitation and inhibition in the context of a positive human-pig relationship. Specifically, we investigated whether the social rank of an experienced pig (termed "demonstrator") has an effect on the attentiveness of the remaining pen mates (N = 40) when they observe the demonstrator being gently handled by a stockperson from behind an acrylic panel. We found that pigs preferentially attended to dominant demonstrators rather than subordinate demonstrators during their gentle handling sessions with the stockperson. Additionally, we also examined whether the presence of a demonstrator pig of different social rank, who previously established a positive relationship with the stockperson in presence of conspecifics, affects the behavior and motivation of their pen mates to positively interact with the stockperson. To test for the effect of the presence and demonstrator's social rank on pen mate interactions with the stockperson, we evaluated the behavior of domestic pigs (N = 65) toward the stockperson using a human-approach test in their home-pen. Pigs showed a decrease in their motivation to positively interact with the stockperson when a socially dominant demonstrator was present, behaving similarly to animals receiving minimal human contact (control group). Overall, they exhibited a greater latency to physical contact, a lower acceptance of stroking, and spent more time looking at the stockperson compared to pigs exposed to subordinate demonstrators. Taken together, these findings expand our current understanding of pigs' cognition and social behavior, and the nature of social attention bias in farm animals. Our findings indicate that positive handling of previously selected subordinate demonstrators seems to be the best strategy to reduce the level of fear in large groups of pigs.

AB  - Arthropod natural enemies can contribute to pest management by consuming crop pests, but populations of these natural enemies may be low within crops due to a lack of resources. Floral strips can provide these resources and support natural enemy communities, which in turn can suppress pest populations and thereby improve crop yields. Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) floral strips were added to experimental plots of organic green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and paired with control plots, without floral strips, to determine their impact on arthropod communities, crop yields, and pest control costs. Crop yields were maintained, but costs of pest control significantly lower (16%) in plots with floral strips. This was not explained by an increased abundance or diversity of natural enemies or a decrease of pests (i.e. all herbivores). Instead, the composition of arthropod natural enemy communities were similar between buckwheat floral strips and the crop, suggesting that the floral strips support natural enemies already present within crops. Semi-natural edge habitat in control plots, had a unique community of natural enemies, which had little spillover into the crop and therefore may have little impact on biological control. These results suggest that higher crop yields can be achieved with reduced inputs, such as insecticides, by adding floral strips to crops as they may support the natural enemies present within crops. Future studies should consider the impacts of specific natural enemies, rather than diversity, and direct measurements of biological control to connect the impact of floral strips to crop yields.

AB  - Simple Summary Increasing the starch level in the diet of ruminants can promote rumen fermentation to a certain extent and improve production performance. However, the degradation of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates in the rumen can lead to the accumulation of large amounts of organic acids (mainly volatile fatty acids and lactic acid), increasing the risk of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in high-yielding ruminants. By changing the fermentation sites of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates, the rumen environment and feed efficiency could be effectively improved. The object of this study was to explore the effects of replacing corn starch with barley starch in the diet of Hu sheep on the fermentation and microflora in the rumen. Our results showed that, starch in the diet cannot be derived entirely from barley, and it is feasible to replace 33% of the corn with barley in the diet for Hu sheep. This study aimed to explore the effects of different levels of barley starch instead of corn starch on the rumen fermentation and microflora when feeding a corn-based diet to Hu sheep. Thirty-two male Hu sheep equipped with permanent rumen fistulas were selected and fed in individual metabolic cages. All sheep were randomly divided into four groups (eight sheep in each group) and fed with four diets containing a similar starch content, but from different starch sources, including 100% of starch derived from corn (CS), 33% of starch derived from barley + 67% of starch derived from corn (33 BS), 67% of starch derived from barley + 33% of starch derived from corn (67 BS) and 100% of starch derived from barley (100 BS). The experimental period included a 14 d adaptation period and a 2 d continuous data collection period. The results showed that the molar proportions of acetate, isobutyrate, butyrate and isovalerate and the ratio of acetate to propionate in the 67 BS and 100 BS groups decreased compared with the CS and 33 BS groups (p < 0.001), while the molar proportions of propionate and valerate increased (p < 0.001). The combination of 33% barley starch and 67% corn starch in the diet improved the production of TVFAs (p = 0.007). The OTUs and Shannon indexes of the CS and 33 BS groups were higher than the 67 BS and 100 BS groups (p < 0.001), and the Chao1 and Ace indexes were higher than the 100 BS group (p < 0.05). In addition, the 33 BS group had increased the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Prevotella and Ruminococcus and the abundances of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium and Prevotella brevis relative to the CS group (p < 0.05). These results indicate that the substitution of 33% of the CS with BS did not change the rumen fermentation pattern relative to the CS group, and increased the richness and diversity of the rumen microbes in Hu sheep compared with other two starch substitute groups.

AB  - Seeds and seedlings are particularly vulnerable to herbivory. Unlike mature plants, which can wait until herbivory is experienced to induce defense, seeds and seedlings face mortality if they wait. Slug mucus functions as a kairomone, a non-attack-related substance emitted by consumers that is detected by a prey species (in this case, plants). While snail mucus has been shown to induce defense in seedlings, it is not widely confirmed whether slugs have the same effect and whether seeds can also detect and react to such herbivore cues. We investigated how exposure to Arion subfuscus mucus affected growth and defense in Brassica nigra seeds and seedlings. Seeds exposed to slug mucus germinated 5% faster than control (water only) seeds, but the resulting seedlings weighed 16% less than control seedlings. To test whether this difference results from herbivore-exposed plants allocating energy from growth to defense, we conducted choice bioassays assessing slug preference for control seedlings versus seedlings that were either (A) exposed to mucus only as a seed; or (B) exposed to mucus as a seed and seedling. While slugs did not differentiate between control seedlings and ones exposed to herbivore cues only as a seed, they ate 88% less biomass of seedlings exposed to mucus as both seeds and seedlings. These results suggest that slug mucus induces changes in plant traits related to defense and growth/competitive ability. Future research should determine the chemical mechanisms of this induced defense.

AB  - Animals may use long-distance foraging trips to capitalize on spatiotemporal variation in food availability, allowing individuals to maximize resource gain from foraging effort. This is particularly important for dimorphic species with polygynous mating where males face strong selection pressures to attain large size and access to reproductive females. We tracked 17 male Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, during their prolonged postbreeding trips and assessed links between their movements and environmental predictors of profitable feeding areas. Males made one of two types of trips: a long trip to the Antarctic ice edge or shorter trips to areas where the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts generate high biological activity. The trip type was not determined by body size but was related to departure date from the breeding area, suggesting that males must trade off opportunities at the breeding area (reproductive, social interactions) and foraging opportunities between breeding seasons. Regardless of trip structure, males focused search effort far from foraging areas of central-place foraging seabirds and seals including female Antarctic fur seals provisioning offspring. Males showed clear spatiotemporal patterns in dive behaviour, with deep dives in shelf waters during the day and predominantly shallower dives in pelagic waters at night. Diel dive patterns showed monthly changes in photoperiod and lunar phase, consistent with feeding on vertically migrating prey. However, males did not use area-restricted search to focus dive effort, instead performing a mix of foraging and nonforaging behaviour within and between restricted search areas. We discuss the scale and type of inference that can be made from movement models, given the behavioural constraints that govern long-distance trips in vast, heterogeneous environments like the Southern Ocean.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Corynebacterium silvaticum is a newly identified animal pathogen of forest animals such as roe deer and wild boars. The species is closely related to the emerging human pathogen Corynebacterium ulcerans and the widely distributed animal pathogen Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. In this study, Corynebacterium silvaticum strain W25 was characterized with respect to its interaction with human cell lines. Microscopy, measurement of transepithelial electric resistance and cytotoxicity assays revealed detrimental effects of C. silvaticum to different human epithelial cell lines and to an invertebrate animal model, Galleria mellonella larvae, comparable to diphtheria toxin-secreting C. ulcerans. Furthermore, the results obtained may indicate a considerable zoonotic potential of this newly identified species.

AB  - Encephalartos eugene-maraisii is an endangered, endemic plant in the Waterberg Mountain range of South Africa. This is the first report of herbivory by Zerenopsis lepida (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) on natural populations of E. eugene-maraisii. The impact of herbivory by folivorous arthropods on this cycad species has not been studied before. This study aimed to determine the incidence and intensity of Z. lepida herbivory on E. eugene-maraisii under field conditions. Local plant dynamics were studied by recording the plant location, sex, size and phenological stage for each plant. Damage surveys were carried out over two consecutive seasons (2020-2021 and 2021-2022). Leaf damage was assessed on 227 plants comprising 692 stems. Approximately 40% of the stems had signs of leaf herbivory by Z. lepida and 10% of the total leaf area was removed by Z. lepida larvae. Less herbivory was recorded in areas where plants synchronously produced new leaf flushes compared to areas with asynchronous leaf flushes. Greater apparency of plants led to a greater incidence of herbivory and level of damage. Repeated damage to plants may delay future leaf and cone flushing events and contribute to the threat against this cycad species.

AB  - Background Coptotermes curvignathus Holmgren (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) is a subterranean termite that poses serious damage to oil palm and rubber trees. Chemical pesticides could cause negative effect to human and the environment in long-term usage. The use of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) to suppress the population of subterranean termites is in favour when compared to chemical pesticides because they do not harm to the environment and non-target organisms. The study aimed to isolate and identify the EPF from the soil using yellow mealworm larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus in the baiting method and assessed their efficacy against subterranean termite, C. curvignathus. Result Eleven EPF isolates were successfully isolated from the oil palm plantation in Universiti Putra Malaysia, namely: Aspergillus auricomus (UPM-A1C-1), A. caelatus (UPM-A1C-2), Metarhizium anisopliae var anisopliae (UPM-A2C-1, UPM-A3C-1, UPM-A3C-2, UPM-A5C-1 and UPM-A10C-1), Purpureocillium lilacinum (UPM-A2C-3 and UPM-A7C-1), Cordyceps javanica (UPM-A2C-5), and M. pinghaense (UPM-A13C-2). The identity of these EPF were confirmed by morphological and molecular characteristics. All EPF yielded 100% mortality in C. curvignathus in 10 days after inoculation (DAI), except UPM-A1C-1 and UPM-A1C-2 after exposure to 1 x 10(7) conidia ml(-1). UPM-A2C-5 Cordyceps javanica yielded the highest mycelia formation (69%) after 6 DAI. The LT50 values varied from 3.90 to 7.75 days. UPM A2C-1 M. anisopliae var anisopliae showed the lowest LT50 (3.90 days), while UPM-A1C-1 Aspergillus auricomus showed the highest LT50 (7.75 days). The lowest LC50 value (1.49 x 10(5) conidia ml(-1)) was recorded in UPM A2C-1 M. anisopliae var anisopliae. Conclusions The present study confirmed the soilborne EPF with potential insecticidal activity against C. curvignathus. UPM-A2C-1 M. anisopliae var anisopliae was a potential biological control agent against Subterranean termite, C. curvignathus due to its virulence score and high percentage of mycelia formation after 6 DAI. The data reported in the present study, particularly using P. lilacinum, M. pinghaense, Aspergillus auricomus, A. caelatus and C. javanica with potential insecticidal activity against C. curvignathus, are new records.

AB  - Globally, human-bird conflict has been a major concern in wildlife conservation in artificial landscapes. Wintering ducks often feed on crops, causing economic losses. However, studies on their habitat use and economic losses remain limited, especially in China, a major agricultural country worldwide. We investigated the number and distribution of wintering ducks at the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve and adjacent farmland in the Yangtze estuary, China in 2022 and 2023. The local farming practices follow a rice-wheat rotation system, with rice harvested earlier in 2023 (early-November) than in 2022 (late November). We conducted monthly bird surveys and tracked the two dominant species: spot-billed ducks (Anas zonorhyncha) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Fecal DNA analysis, plot method and questionnaires were used to detect their dietary composition and economic losses. In 2022, the peak number of ducks exceeded 100,000, predominantly on farmland in November. In 2023, the number of ducks in November decreased by 71.6 %. The total number of ducks in farmland decreased from 30.1 % in 2022 to 14.9 % in 2023. Both tracked species exhibited significantly higher use of farmland in 2022, at night, and in late winter. Rice grains and wheat accounted for over 50 % of the ducks' food. Economic losses caused by ducks foraging on rice grains significantly reduced in 2023, although questionnaire estimates were much higher than plot surveys in both years. The results suggest that earlier rice harvest can reduce farmland use and economic losses by ducks. We recommend sowing precocious rice varieties and harvesting crops promptly, and increasing edible wild plants in nature reserve to minimize crop losses and mitigate human-bird conflicts.

AB  - A broadening fish host range is affected by novel and known pigmented fungal pathogens. A review of 2,250 piscine submissions received by the Aquatic Pathology Service, University of Georgia, revealed 47 phaeohyphomycosis cases (2.1%), representing 34 bony and cartilaginous fish species. The majority involved bony fish (45/47, 95.7%) and were predominantly marine (41/47, 87.2%), with only a few freshwater species (4/47, 8.5%). Cartilaginous fish cases included two zebra sharks (Stegostoma fasciatum) (2/47, 4.3%). Northern seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) had the highest incidence overall (7/47, 14.9%). Culture and sequencing of the internal-transcribed spacer region of the rDNA (ITS), large ribosomal subunit gene D1/D2 domains (LSU) and the DNA polymerase II gene (RPB2) were performed for fungal identification when fresh tissue was obtainable. Exophiala, Ochroconis and Neodevriesia spp. were identified, with Exophiala as the most common fungal genus (8/11, 72.7%). Exophiala lecanii-corni and Neodevriesia cladophorae were described for the first time from fish. Microscopically, lesions were characterized by necrosis, granulomatous inflammation and angioinvasion most frequently affecting the skin/fin, skeletal muscle and kidneys. In this study of diverse aquarium-housed fish species, phaeohyphomycosis cases occurred sporadically and in rare outbreaks with variable pathologic presentations, tissue distributions and severities.

AB  - The yak is a classic grazing livestock species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and fat deposition is indispensable for its survival and metabolism. Coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play an important role in regulating fat deposition in livestock. In this study, the expression of mRNAs, lncRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs in the subcutaneous fat of yaks under grazing and stall feeding was measured using whole-transcriptome sequencing technology. A total of 677 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, 120 DE lncRNAs, 2216 DE circRNAs, and 15 DE miRNAs were identified, and their biological function was explored using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Co-expression RNA (ceRNA) networks between DE ncRNAs and DE mRNAs were further constructed, and the crucial RNAs and signal pathways regulating fat deposition in yaks were obtained. The effect of mRNAs and ncRNAs on fat deposition in yaks mainly depended on the PPAR, PI3K-Akt, and cAMP signaling pathways, and the regulatory pathways TCONS00042948, TCONS00012083/bta-miR-2316/MCAT, and NR4A3 may be critical in this process. This study provides some theoretical basis for breeding yak species and promotes improvements in yak production.

AB  - The behavioural, sensory and neural bases of vertebrate navigation are primarily described in mammals and birds. While many studies have explored amphibian navigation, none have characterized brain activity associated with navigation in the wild. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a study on navigation in the cane toad, Rhinella marina. First, we performed a translocation experiment to describe how invasive cane toads in Hawaii navigate home and observed homing following displacements of up to 1 km. Next, we tested the effect of olfactory and magnetosensory manipulations on homing, as these senses are most commonly associated with amphibian navigation. We found that neither ablation alone prevents homing, further supporting that toad navigation is multimodal. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the medial pallium, the amphibian homologue to the hippocampus, is involved in homing. Our comparisons of neural activity revealed evidence supporting a conservation of neural structures associated with navigation across vertebrates consistent with neural models of amphibian spatial cognition from recent laboratory studies. Our work furthers our evolutionary understanding of spatial behaviour and cognition in vertebrates and lays a foundation for studying the behavioural, sensory and neural bases of navigation in an invasive amphibian.

AB  - BackgroundHaemonchus contortus, a gastrointestinal hematophagous parasitic nematode, causes substantial economic losses to the livestock sector across the globe. The widespread use of benzimidazoles in livestock has contributed greatly to the evolution of resistance in H. contortus. To effectively tackle this expanding threat, regular and diligent monitoring is required to identify and manage resistance, ensuring that treatment techniques continue to be effective.ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the genetic and structural variations in beta-tubulin isotype-1 of Haemonchus contortus isolated from goats and cattle in Pakistan, with a focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance to benzimidazole.MethodsA total of 150 goats and 100 cattle from four abattoirs in Rawalpindi were tested for Haemonchus contortus. Faecal samples were cultured for L3 larvae, DNA was isolated, and whole genome sequencing was performed. beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene sequence was extracted. Phylogenetic tree with reference genome from GenBank, and protein models were generated via ExPaSy and I-TASSER and validated with SAVESv.6.0.ResultsSix genotypes of Haemonchus contortus isotype1 beta-tubulin gene, each with a length of 385 base pairs were identified. The E198A SNP was the most prevalent mutation among the larvae of Haemonchus contortus collected from cattle (62.5%) and goats (50%), followed by the F200Y which was detected in 6 (37.5%) larvae collected from cattle and 9 (37.5%) larvae from goats. SNP F167Y was not identified in any of the samples. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates were closely related to H. contortus from China (KX258930) and H. contortus x H. placei hybrids from Pakistan. Six genotypes of beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene were translated into three haplotypes based on protein sequences: wild type/susceptible, E198A-resistant/mutant, and F200Y-resistant/mutant. Structural analysis revealed high model quality and confidence, with the E198A and F200Y resistant/mutants exhibiting different characteristics, with refined quality factors exceeding 91%.ConclusionThe study demonstrated alterations in tubulin structure and function are crucial for understanding anthelmintic resistance patterns. These findings help for improving therapeutic approaches, comprehending resistance mechanisms, and promoting sustainable parasite control.

AB  - Simple Summary Pig castration is a common practice in the Iberian breed (boar and gilts), known for the quality of its products. This work studies the effect of pig castration (surgically castrated females and males, immunocastrated females and males and entire females) on the sensory expectations and acceptability of the meat. Attitudes and beliefs towards castration and immunocastration were also evaluated. The study was carried out in Madrid and Barcelona, where consumers (n = 252) evaluated meat from the five sex types in blind and informed conditions. Results showed that consumers could be classified into three groups as "Indifferent", "Against castration and immunocastration" and "Against immunocastration". Meat from castrated males had higher overall liking scores than the other types of meat. Information provided to the consumers, together with their expectations, affects the overall liking scores. Thus, this needs to be considered to determine the best marketing strategy according to the type of pork produced. A common practice in Iberian pigs is the castration of both males and females, and it can be carried out surgically or by immunization against gonadotropin-releasing factor (GnRF). The aim of this work was to determine consumers' overall liking and expectations towards Iberian pork from five different sex types (castrated females, entire females, GnRF-vaccinated females, castrated males and GnRF-vaccinated males), as well as to know the attitudes and beliefs of consumers towards castration and immunocastration. Loins from 83 Iberian pigs were collected and evaluated by 252 consumers in Barcelona and Madrid. Consumers evaluated the five types of meat in three situations: blind condition (tasting the product), expectations (without tasting) and informed condition. Finally, attitudes and beliefs towards castration and immunocastration were also determined. Results distinguished three segments of consumers labeled as "Indifferent", "Against castration and immunocastration" and "Against immunocastration". Meat from castrated males had higher overall liking scores in the blind condition. Expectations towards pork depending on its sex type affect consumer-informed acceptability; thus, it is important to consider marketing strategies to avoid or direct the effect of the information provided on the acceptability of the pork.

AB  - Composting, a vital process for organic waste management, hinges on intricate microbial dynamics. The role of specific microbial inoculants, such as fungi, in shaping these dynamics remains an area of keen interest. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of the fungal inoculant Marasmius tricolor 310b on composting dynamics, with a focus on temperature variations and the degradation of lignocellulosic components. We conducted a comprehensive composting experiment with four treatments: pure rapeseed straw, rapeseed straw with Marasmius tricolor 310b, a combination of rapeseed straw and pig manure, and the combination with Marasmius tricolor 310b. Temperature dynamics, lignocellulosic degradation rates, and fungal community structures were meticulously analyzed. While Marasmius tricolor 310b did not significantly alter the temperature profile, its presence markedly enhanced the degradation rates of cellulose and lignin. With the introduction of Marasmius tricolor 310b, the degradation rate of cellulose in the rapeseed straw compost increased from 0.0319 (ST) to 0.0419 (STM). In the combined rapeseed straw and pig manure compost, this rate rose from 0.0422 (STPM) to 0.045 (STPMM). For hemicellulose, the degradation rate in the rapeseed straw compost increased from 0.0103 (ST) to 0.014 (STM). However, in the combined compost, it slightly decreased from 0.0146 (STPM) to 0.013 (STPMM). As for lignin, its degradation rate in the rapeseed straw compost saw an increase from 0.0024 (ST) to 0.00366 (STM). In the combined compost, the rate rose from 0.00302 (STPM) to 0.00402 (STPMM). Fungal community analyses revealed discernible shifts in structure and diversity upon the fungus's introduction. Network analyses further highlighted a highly interconnected microbial community, suggesting its robustness against perturbations. Temporal dynamics underscored the intricate interplay of microbial interactions, substrate availability, and external inoculants. The introduction of Marasmius tricolor 310b profoundly influences composting dynamics, offering valuable insights into microbial community interactions and presenting potential avenues for optimizing composting strategies.

AB  - The study of complex traits and their genetic underpinnings is crucial for understanding the evolutionary processes and mechanisms that shape natural populations. Regional heritability mapping (RHM) is a method for estimating the heritability of genomic segments that may contain both common and rare variants affecting a complex trait. This research is important because it advances our ability to detect genetic loci that contribute to phenotypic variation, even those that might be missed by traditional methods such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we compare three RHM methods: SNP-RHM, which uses genomic relationship matrices (GRMs) based on SNP genotypes; Hap-RHM, which utilizes GRMs based on haplotypes; and SNHap-RHM, which integrates both SNP-based and haplotype-based GRMs jointly. These methods were applied to data from a wild population of sheep, focusing on the analysis of eleven polygenic traits. The results were compared with findings from previous GWAS to assess how RHM performed at identifying both known and novel associated loci. We found that while the inclusion of the regional matrix did not account for significant variation in all regions associated with trait variation as identified by GWAS, it did uncover several regions that were not previously linked to trait variation. This suggests that RHM methods can provide additional insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits, highlighting regions of the genome that may be overlooked by GWAS alone. This study underscores the importance of using complementary approaches to fully understand the genetic basis of complex traits in natural populations.

AB  - Flower strips are advocated as a strategy to promote beneficial insects as well as the services they deliver to adjacent crops. Flower strips have, however, often been developed separately for pollinators and natural enemies and, additionally, little consideration has been given to effects on insect herbivores. We sampled insect herbi-vores, their natural enemies and parasitism of pest eggs using vacuum sampling, sticky cards and egg cards in nine pairs of bee-attractive wildflower plantings and control field borders, as well as in adjacent tomato and watermelon crop fields in Yolo County, California 2015-2016. Control field borders had a higher total number of herbivores on sticky traps than did wildflower plantings, a pattern that was driven by more aphids, hoppers, psyllids and whiteflies, whereas wildflower plantings had more lace bugs and Lygus bugs. The total number of herbivores in the adjacent crop fields did not differ between treatments, but there were more leaf beetles near (at 10 m but not 50 m from) wildflower plantings. Control field borders had a higher total number of predators, driven by more big-eyed bugs, lady beetles and minute pirate bugs, whereas spiders were more common in wildflower plantings. The total number of predators in adjacent crop fields was, however, higher in those next to wildflower plantings, which was driven by more minute pirate bugs. Parasitoid wasps were more common in wildflower plantings and at 10 m but not 50 m into adjacent crop fields. Stink bug egg parasitism rate did not differ between treatments, either in the borders or in the crop fields. In conclusion, wildflower plantings clearly affect the insect herbivore and natural enemy community, but do so in a highly taxon-specific manner, which can lead to both positive and negative outcomes for pest control as a result.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress occurs when goats are exposed to high environmental temperatures and humidity for a long period. Heat stress could adversely affect the rumen fermentation and growth performance of goats. Dietary supplementation with Clostridium butyricum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and their mixture were effective ways to alleviate the effects on the rumen fermentation and growth performance of heat-stressed goats. In this study, these two probiotics and their mixture were supplemented in goats for a period before heat stress. The results showed that these probiotics effectively alleviate the adverse effects of heat stress by promoting rumen fermentation and growth performance. Therefore, this study provides a reference for applying these two probiotics at the optimum timing to alleviate the adverse effects of heat stress on goats. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the prophylactic feeding of Clostridium butyricum (CB), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC), and their mixture before the onset of heat stress on the rumen fermentation and growth performance of goats, and subsequently, on heat stress status. Forty-eight male Macheng Black x Boer crossed goats (22.25 +/- 4.26 kg) were divided into four groups-the control group (fed the basal diet), and the CB (0.05% CB added to the basal diet), SC (0.60% SC added to the basal diet), and Mix (0.05% CB and 0.60% SC added to the basal diet) groups-and fed for fourteen days. Then, these goats were kept in a heat stress environment (with a temperature-humidity index of 87.04) for fourteen days. Then, the parameters of rumen fermentation and growth performance were measured. The results showed that the pH values, the activities of cellulolytic enzymes (avicelase, CMCaes, cellobiase, and xylanase), and the concentrations of ammonia-N, total volatile fatty acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the rumens of the CB, SC, and Mix groups compared to those of the control group. Moreover, the average daily gain and the digestibility of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the CB, SC, and Mix groups compared to those of the control group. These results suggest that these two probiotics and their mixture effectively alleviate the adverse effects of heat stress on rumen fermentation and growth performance via prophylactic feeding.

AB  - Drones provide a privileged birds'-eye view for collecting high-resolution imagery for morphometric and behavioral sampling of animals. Biologically meaningful measurements extracted from overhead images require an accurate estimate of altitude, but current commercial drones include inaccurate barometer estimates. Recent proposals for coupling altimeter systems to drones have provided customized, open source solutions; yet assembling such altimeter systems requires advanced technical skills, thereby potentially limiting their use. Here, we built upon recent advances to provide a 3D printed enclosure for an altimeter system that is inexpensive, self contained, easy to set-up, and transferable across commercial drones. We depart from a published, successful data logger system composed of a GPS and LiDAR sensor, and design a more compact and self-powered version ("LidarBoX") that easily attaches to a variety of commercial drones. We compare flight times with/without LidarBoX attached, test flight maneuverability and performance, and validate reliability of measurement accuracy. To make LidarBoX accessible, we provide an open-source repository with design code and files and a how-to assemble guide for non-specialists. We hope this work helps popularize LiDAR altimeter systems on commercial drones to improve the accuracy and reliability of drones as a sampling platform for ecology and wildlife research.

AB  - Simple Summary Minerals are essential for maintaining the health and productivity of livestock. Yaks are mainly grazed rotationally in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but the natural forage nutrients in the alpine meadow are seasonal and even different every month, and the nutritional requirements of yaks at different ages are different. Therefore, it is very important to understand how host genes and microorganisms in the rumen of yaks at different ages coordinate to regulate the metabolism of mineral elements and other nutrients. In this study, we performed transcriptome and metagenomic analyses of the rumen and its contents at different age stages to explore the synergistic regulation of mineral metabolism by host genes and microorganisms. In total, 13 bacteria and 22 host genes were mainly involved in the regulation of metal ion binding. The results of this study are of great significance for the improvement of supplementary feeding and growth performance of yaks at different ages.Abstract Yaks are the main pillar of plateau animal husbandry and the material basis of local herdsmen's survival. The level of mineral elements in the body is closely related to the production performance of yaks. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of rumen epithelial morphology, transcriptomics and metagenomics to explore the dynamics of rumen functions, microbial colonization and functional interactions in yaks from birth to adulthood. Bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea and viruses colonized the rumen of yaks from birth to adulthood, with bacteria being the majority. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in five developmental stages, and the abundance of genus Lactobacillus and Fusobacterium significantly decreased with age. Glycoside hydrolase (GH) genes were the most highly represented in five different developmental stages, followed by glycosyltransferases (GTs) and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), where the proportion of genes coding for CBMs increased with age. Integrating host transcriptome and microbial metagenome revealed 30 gene modules related to age, muscle layer thickness, nipple length and width of yaks. Among these, the MEmagenta and MEturquoise were positively correlated with these phenotypic traits. Twenty-two host genes involved in transcriptional regulation related to metal ion binding (including potassium, sodium, calcium, zinc, iron) were positively correlated with a rumen bacterial cluster 1 composed of Alloprevotella, Paludibacter, Arcobacter, Lactobacillus, Bilophila, etc. Therefore, these studies help us to understand the interaction between rumen host and microorganisms in yaks at different ages, and further provide a reliable theoretical basis for the development of feed and mineral element supplementation for yaks at different ages.

AB  - Simple Summary In current pig farming, pigs are susceptible to stress-induced adverse emotions. Emotional contagion may propagate these emotions within a herd, potentially affecting overall welfare. Typically, treatments of individual pigs should be conducted separately from the group. Thus, after separation from treatment on an individual pig, the behavioral responses and heart rate changes of the companion pig were recorded to determine if the sensory avoidance was effective. It was found that peers were still affected by the treated pigs after sensory avoidance. Separation from treatment does not eliminate the effects of the treated pig on companion pigs, which can still be affected in post-treatment contact.Abstract In the pig farming industry, it is recommended to avoid groups when treating individuals to reduce adverse reactions in the group. However, can this eliminate the adverse effects effectively? Piglets were assigned to the Rewarding Group (RG), the Punishing Group (PG), and the Paired Control Group (PCG). There were six replicates in each group, with two paired piglets per replicate. One piglet of the RG and PG was randomly selected as the Treated pig (TP), treated with food rewards or electric shock, and the other as the Naive pig (NP). The NPs in the RG and PG were unaware of the treatment process, and piglets in the PCG were not treated. The behavior and heart rate changes of all piglets were recorded. Compared to the RG, the NPs in the PG showed longer proximity but less contact behavior, and the TPs in the PG showed more freezing behavior. The percentage change in heart rate of the NPs was synchronized with the TPs. This shows that after sensory avoidance, the untreated pigs could also feel the emotions of their peers and their emotional state was affected by their peers, and the negative emotions in the pigs lasted longer than the positive emotions. The avoidance process does not prevent the transfer of negative emotions to peers via emotional contagion from the stimulated pig.

AB  - Copper deficiency is a common problem leading to adverse effects on productive and reproductive performance of ruminant animals. The aims of present study were to restore ovarian activity, blood indices and milk production of goats grazing copper-deficient alfalfa upon copper and/or Chlorella vulgaris microalgae supplementation. Forty pregnant Boer goats (38.10 +/- .70 kg body weight) were distributed to four groups; Chlorella vulgaris microalgae (CV; 10.0 g/head/day), copper (Cu; 15.0 ml/head/day copper sulfate), a mixture of both CV and Cu (CVCu) and control groups. Ovarian ftmctions, blood profiles and milk yield of Boer goats grazing copper-deficient alfalfa were determined. The numbers and sizes of ovarian follicles and corpora lutea in addition to pregnancy rate were increased (P < 0.05) due to CV and/or Cu supplementation. Values of blood indices (RBCs, WBCs, Hb and PCV), physiological parameters, metabolic parameters (total protein, albumin, glucose, urea and total cholesterol) and hormones (T3, T4, estrogen, progesterone) were significantly improved in CV and/or Cu groups. Supplementation with CVCu increased (P < 0.05) milk yield and its total solid and energy. In conclusion, productive and reproductive performances could be improved as results of copper and Chlorella vulgaris administration to Boer goats grazing copper-deficient alfalfa in arid subtropics.

AB  - In Poyang Lake, the largest and one of the most important wintering sites in the East AsianAustralasian Flyway, Carex (Carex cinerascens Kuk) meadows provide the primary food source for the wintering geese. However, due to intensified river regulation and more frequent extreme climatic events such as drought, observational evidence suggests that the synchrony of geese migration and Carex phenology could not be maintained without human interventions, imposing a great risk of food shortage during the wintering period. Consequently, the current conservation priority in this Ramsar site is shifted to wet meadow improvement to ensure optimal food quality. Understanding the food preferences of wintering geese is the key for effective wet meadow management. As the growth stage and nutrient level of food plants are the decisive factors influencing the diet selection of herbivores, in this study, we sampled the preferred food items by tracking the foraging paths of the Greater White-fronted Goose (n = 84) and Bean Goose (n = 34) to quantify the "foraging window" in terms of plant height,protein level, and energy content. Further, we established relationships between the above three variables of Carex based on in-situ measurements. The results show that the geese prefer plants with height ranging from 2.4 to 25.0 cm, with protein content from 13.9 to 25.2 %, and energy content from 1440.0 to 1813.6 KJ/100 g. While plant energy content increases with height, the height-protein level relationship is negative. The opposite growth curves signify a conservation challenge to maintain the delicate balance between the quantity and quality requirements of wintering geese. Carex meadow management, such as mowing, should focus on optimizing the timing of action to maximize energy supply while maintaining the right protein level for the long-term fitness, reproduction and survival of the birds.

AB  - Despite the large size and economic value of the species, populations of oceanic manta ray (Mobula birostris) are often poorly studied and almost completely undescribed in the Red Sea. Here, photo-identification (photo-ID) was used to provide the first description of M. birostris movement patterns and population demographics for the northern Red Sea. Images collated from social media, researchers, and photo-ID databases from 2004 to 2021 identified 267 individual M. birostris from 395 sightings in Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan. Sexual parity was observed in the population with 134 females, 111 males, and 22 individuals of undetermined sex. Nearly half of the individuals in this study were first identified through social media searches, highlighting the value of the sightings data collected by the public. The regular presence of juveniles in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, indicates that this area is a potential nursery, which is the second identified for this species globally and the first in the Indo-Pacific. Encounter data from this study recorded the first known movements of juvenile M. birostris and demonstrate that they can travel long distances of at least 525 km. Within the recorded population, 24.7% (n = 67) of individuals were resighted, including 21 oceanic manta rays that were encountered in more than one location. These records reveal long-distance migrations of up to 700 km and confirm the international connectivity of M. birostris in the Red Sea. The lagged identification rate data are best fitted with an open-population model, implying that the northern Red Sea is represented by one well-mixed population. The baseline data presented here should encourage the expansion of directed research and citizen science initiatives for M. birostris. Increased knowledge of movement patterns and site use will be crucial to successfully protecting this endangered species in a region characterized by high levels of shipping traffic, unregulated fisheries, and extensive coastal development.

AB  - Multi-species assemblages can help identify key resources in their habitat by evaluating how they are partitioning their resources. Here we used the isotopic niche of loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and green sea turtles to assess their ecological niche within a Gulf of Mexico bay. Additionally, we assessed temporal and size-class variation in their diets by comparing the delta 13C and delta 15N values over various capture years and size classes. Based on the isotopic niche overlap results, interspecific competition occurs among loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and smaller green turtles. Green turtle and Kemp's ridley diet varied by size class, while Kemp's ridley diet also varied temporally. The three species partition resources by selecting different preferred diet items, although some overlap in diet, including between the herbivorous (green) and carnivorous (Kemp's ridley, loggerhead) species, appears to occur. The high quality of this habitat may allow species co-existence and population recovery despite the possible use of shared resources.

AB  - Simple Summary Prolonged stress negatively affects pig health, welfare, and productivity. Herein, we used a porcine model of stress during the growing period, divided into stressed and control groups. Stressed pigs experienced reduced space and were mixed twice, leading to decreased body weight and feed efficiency. Differences in feeding behavior were also observed; stressed pigs visited feeders less frequently and spent more time per meal. The microbiota of stressed pigs showed an increase in opportunistic bacteria, while control pigs had a higher abundance of beneficial butyrate- and propionate-producing bacteria. This study highlights the potential of using specific fecal microorganisms as non-invasive biomarkers to assess stress and well-being in pigs, with implications for improving both animal welfare and research applied to the human gut-brain axis.Abstract Stress significantly affects the health, welfare, and productivity of farm animals. We performed a longitudinal study to evaluate stress's effects on pig performance, feeding behavior, and fecal microbiota composition. This study involved 64 Duroc pigs during the fattening period, divided into two experimental groups: a stress group (n = 32) and a control group (n = 32). Stressed groups had less space and were mixed twice during the experiment. We monitored body weight, feed efficiency, feeding behavior, and fecal microbiota composition. Compared to the control group, the stressed pigs exhibited reduced body weight, feed efficiency, fewer feeder visits, and longer meal durations. In the fecal microbiota, resilience was observed, with greater differences between groups when sampling was closer to the stressful stimulus. Stressed pigs showed an increase in opportunistic bacteria, such as Streptococcus, Treponema and members of the Erysipelotrichaceae family, while control pigs had more butyrate- and propionate-producing genera like Anaerobutyricum, Coprococcus and HUN007. Our findings confirm that prolonged stress negatively impacts porcine welfare, behavior, and performance, and alters their gut microbiota. Specific microorganisms identified could serve as non-invasive biomarkers for stress, potentially informing both animal welfare and similar gut-brain axis mechanisms relevant to human research.

AB  - Survival of ungulates can vary seasonally due to changing environmental conditions, e.g. weather or predation pressure. The wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus, "WFR") migrate between calving and wintering grounds. The annual cycle of female WFR includes four main seasons (wintering, calving, rutting and autumn migration) during which they are subject to different conditions, but almost nothing is known about their survival or mortality patterns. We measured survival in 305 GPS-tagged female WFR in two subpopulations in Finland (2010-2022). Data were analysed for inter-annual and seasonal patterns in survival and cause-specific mortality (predation, traffic, accidents and unknown causes) with known-fate models. Inter-annual survival in Suomenselka (mean 0.90) showed an increasing trend during the study and was higher than in Kainuu (mean 0.84) which showed a declining trend. Seasonal variation in survival was population dependent. Survival was lowest in Kainuu during the winter while in Suomenselka, it was lowest during autumn migration. Concerning cause-specific mortality, seasonal variation mirrored variation in predation that was the primary cause of mortality (55% of cases). Wolves (Canis lupus) killed the majority of predated individuals (58%). Predation rates were two times higher in Kainuu where the wolf density was higher. We provide the first adult survival estimates for WFR and show that the seasonal variation in survival is clearly different between these two northern ungulate populations. This indicates that seasonal variation in survival is determined by site-dependent factors and cannot be generalised across populations.

AB  - The majority of non-native animal species globally are insects, though some insect species are more successful invaders than others. These differences can be attributed, in part, to differences among dominant trophic groups. Previous analyses indicate that insect herbivores are generally over-represented among non-native species while other groups, such as predators, are under-represented. Here we explore how invasion success varies among insect taxa and trophic groups. We quantify over-representation in species grouped by taxon (order or family) and larval trophic group (herbivore, detritivore, predator, parasite, brood carer); over-and under-representation is computed by comparing proportional representation of groups among non-native species in 12 world regions with total numbers in these same groups globally. Although herbivores are generally the most successful group among non-natives, we found their invasion success to vary among their taxonomic groups: herbivores are over-represented among Hemiptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera and Hymenoptera, but under-represented among Lepidoptera and Orthoptera; similar patterns are seen at the family-level within orders. Even after accounting for trophic group, some orders were still over-represented. Within trophic groups, this pattern appeared strongest for herbivores, where predominantly parthenogenetic families belonging to the Hemiptera and Thysanoptera were over-represented in non-native assemblages, while families in the Lepidoptera and Polyneoptera were under-represented. Over time (1850s to 2000s), fractions of non-native species numbers in certain orders and trophic groups have varied, such as among parasites, where a considerable turnover took place from mostly bird-lice (Psocodea) in the 19th century to parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera) in the 20th century. It is thus likely that factors other than trophic group, such as associations with invasion pathways (e.g., plants, wood packaging), cause the observed differences in the over-representation of families belonging to different orders.

AB  - Simple SummaryBypass fat supplementation has been shown to influence the carcass and meat qualities of large ruminants, especially cattle. However, limited information is available on the influence of bypass fat on carcass characteristics and the meat proximate and fatty acid compositions of buffaloes. The objective of this study was to evaluate both the effects of bypass fat on carcass traits and meat proximate and fatty acid compositions, and the profitability of Murrah cross and swamp buffaloes. Bypass fat supplementation improved the proximate and fatty acid compositions of buffalo meat without affecting the carcass characteristics. Although the mixture of the concentrate and bypass fat supplement (26:4) used in this study was found to increase the feed cost, the eventual overall returns resulted in a greater profit.The deposition and distribution of buffalo body fats play a vital role in the quality of the buffalo carcass and are of great commercial value, since the carcass quality influences the profitability and consumer acceptability of ruminant meat. The current study examined the effect a mixture of 4% bypass fat and 26% concentrate supplementations in buffalo basal diet had on both the carcass characteristics and the proximate and fatty acid composition in longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL), supraspinatus (SS) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles of Murrah cross and swamp buffaloes. In addition, profit and loss analyses were performed to determine the profitability. This study employed a completely randomized 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two diets, two breeds and four replicates per treatment. A total of sixteen buffaloes (eight buffaloes per breed, bodyweight 98.64 & PLUSMN; 1.93 kg) were randomly assigned into two dietary groups. The first group was given Diet A, which consisted of 70% Brachiaria decumbens + 30% concentrate, whereas the second group was given Diet B, which consisted of 70% Brachiaria decumbens + 26% concentrate + 4% bypass fat. The buffaloes were fed for 730 days before slaughter. The results showed that supplemented bypass fat significantly (p < 0.05) increased the pre-slaughter weight, hot and cold carcass weights, meat:fat ratio, pH at 24 h, moisture and crude protein of LTL, ST and SS, the ether extract of LTL and ST and the meat fatty acid of C16:0, C16:1, C18:1, PUFA n-6/n-3 and total MUFA. The carcass yield and carcass fat percentages, the ash content in ST, the EE in the SS muscle and the meat fatty acid of C18:3, total PUFA n-3, UFA/SFA and PUFA/SFA were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased. Furthermore, Murrah cross showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher pre-slaughter weight, hot and cold carcass weights, carcass bone percentage and total fatty acid, but a lower (p < 0.05) meat:bone ratio, ash of LTL and CP of LTL and ST when compared to swamp buffaloes. No significant changes were found in the proximate composition of different types of muscle, but the ST muscle revealed significantly high C14:0, C16:0 and C18:1, and the SS muscle had high C18:2 and total fatty acid (p < 0.05). Supplementing using bypass fat increased the cost of buffalo feeding but resulted in a higher revenue and net profit. In conclusion, the concentrate and bypass fat supplementations in the buffalo diet could alter the nutrient compositions of buffalo meat without a detrimental effect on carcass characteristics, leading to a higher profit.

AB  - Guizhou white goat is an excellent local goat breed in China, however, it has the disadvantages of smaller individuals, slower growth rate and low feed conversion rate, so, we introduced Boer goat as the male parent and crossed with Guizhou white goat to obtain F3 generation of Boer x White goat hybrid to improve its production performance. To study the effect of PGAM2 gene polymorphisms on the performance of F3 generation hybrid goats, the relationship between PGAM2 gene polymorphisms and slaughter traits, meat quality traits and organ coefficients was determined in 39 F3 generation hybrid goats. The results showed that the slaughtering performance of male goats was better than that of female goats, and there were highly significant (P<0.01) and significant (P<0.05) differences in live weight and carcass weight, respectively. In meat quality, the marbling score of female goats was significantly higher than that of male goats (P<0.01), and the shear force of female goats was significantly lower than that of male goats (P<0.01). Regarding organ coefficients, the large intestine and stomach of male goats was significantly higher than that of female goats (P<0.01), whereas the liver of female goats was significantly higher than that of male goats (P<0.01). Polymorphism analysis of the PGAM2 gene showed that there were polymorphic loci in the 3'UTR (2435A -> G), and there were significant (P<0.01) or highly significant (P<0.05) differences in some traits between the GG and AG or AA genotypes. Conclusion: The production performance of male goats is better than that of female goats in F3 generation hybrid goats, and the slaughtering performance of F3 generation hybrid goats was significantly improved compared with that before breeding. The correlation study showed that the slaughter performance of the GG population with the PGAM2 gene was significantly better than that of GA and AA, which could be used as a potential molecular breeding marker for research.

AB  - Autophagy plays an important role in mammalian oocyte maturation and early embryonic development and rapamycin is well known for inducing autophagy. Although previous studies have reported the ef-fects of rapamycin on oocytes in vitro maturation (IVM) in different species, few studies have been re-ported on the role of rapamycin in yak oocytes IVM and embryonic development. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of rapamycin treatment on yak oocytes IVM and early embryonic development. Specifically, immature yak oocytes during IVM or parthenogenetic (PA) embryos were treated with different rapamycin concentrations to select an optimal dose. Then evaluated its effect on maturation rates, cleavage, and blastocyst formation rates, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS levels. Related genes and proteins expression in matured oocytes and blastocysts were also evaluated. The results show that 10 nM rapamycin treatment during IVM significantly improved oocyte maturation rates of oocytes and blastocyst formation rates. Treatment with 10 nM rapamycin reduced ROS level but increased mitochondrial membrane potential. Correspondingly, mRNA and protein expressions of LC3, Beclin-1, and Bcl-2 up-regulated while Bax down-regulated in matured yak COCs. When parthenogenetic embryos were treated with different rapamycin concentrations, 10 nM rapamycin treatment showed higher 8-cell and blastocyst formation rates. Also, CDX2, POU5F1, SOX2, and Nanog levels in blastocysts were upregulated. In summary, our findings demonstrate that rapamycin treatment improves oocytes maturation probably by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing ROS levels, and regu-lating the apoptosis in mature yak oocytes. Rapamycin treatment also improves embryonic develop-mental competence in the yak.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gray wolves are capable of adapting to human-dominated landscapes by utilizing domestic prey as a source of food. Livestock depredation by wolves incurs a heavy economic loss to the villagers, resulting in negative attitudes toward the species and leading to increased conservation conflict. We used multi-state occupancy modeling on the interview data to assess the ecological factors governing livestock depredation by wolves. We also assessed the socio-demographic factors that may govern the attitude of villagers toward the wolf using ordinal regression. Over the past year, 64% of respondents reported a loss of livestock, in which goats (63%) comprised the major share, followed by sheep (22%) and cattle calves (15%). Wolves tend to hunt medium-sized domestic prey (sheep and goats) that commonly graze in open agricultural areas. The estimated livestock depredation probability of wolves was 0.84 (SD = +/- 0.23). Depredation probability was influenced by habitat use by wolves, the extent of agricultural areas, scrubland area, and settlement size. Respondents with prior experience of livestock loss held more negative attitudes. Shepherds held more negative attitudes than other occupations. Increases in the respondent's age and education level reflected a positive shift in attitudes toward the wolf. High economic loss caused by livestock depredation by wolves can lead to retaliatory persecution of wolves. Adequate compensation for livestock loss, along with better education and awareness can help lead to coexistence between wolves and humans in multi-use landscape of Kailadevi Wildlife Sanctuary, Rajasthan, India.

AB  - As a highly contagious viral disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) can cause severe socio-economic impacts in developing countries due to its threat to sheep and goat production. Previous studies have identified several risk factors for PPR at the individual or herd level. However, only a few studies explored the impacts of landscape factors on PPR risk, particularly at a regional scale. Moreover, risk factor analyses in Africa usually focused on sub-Saharan Africa while neglecting northern Africa. Based on regional occurrence data during 2006-2018, we here explored and compared the risk factors, with a focus on factors related to ruminant habitats, for the occurrence of PPR in sub-Saharan and northern Africa. Our results demonstrated different risk factors in the two regions. Specifically, habitat fragmentation was negatively correlated with PPR occurrence in sub-Saharan Africa, while positively correlated with PPR occurrence in northern Africa. Moreover, urbanization showed a positive association with PPR occurrence in sub-Saharan Africa. Our study is among the first, to our knowledge, to compare the risk factors for PPR in sub-Saharan and northern Africa and contributes to a better understanding of the effects of habitat characteristics on PPR occurrence at a regional scale.

AB  - Simple Summary Plateau stress is a main factor limiting pig production. There are great differences in oxidation state and antioxidant defense between Tibetan pigs (TPs) and DLY pigs exposed to a plateau environment. However, there are limited reports on the mechanism of adaptation of TPs and DLY pigs to the plateau environment involving a signal pathway related to oxidation state. In the present study, we found that TPs exhibit a stronger heart and liver antioxidant stress capacity than DLY pigs through AMPK/p38 MAPK/Nrf2-ARE signaling pathways under a plateau hypoxic environment. This study evaluated the effect of a plateau environment on the heart and liver oxidation state of Tibetan pigs (TPs) and DLY pigs through analyzing AMPK, p38 MAPK, and Nrf2 signaling pathways. Twelve 120-day-old TPs and twelve 120-day-old DLY pigs were randomly divided into two groups in a plateau environment for three weeks. Exposed to a plateau environment, TPs exhibited a lower (p < 0.05) malondialdehyde level but higher (p < 0.05) glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activities in the liver and heart than those observed in DLY pigs. TPs also showed higher (p < 0.05) mRNA levels of SOD and GSH-Px in the liver and heart compared with those of DLY pigs. The TPs showed higher (p < 0.05) mRNA and protein levels of AMPK and Nrf2 in the liver and heart compared with those of DLY pigs. Furthermore, TPs showed higher (p < 0.05) mRNA and protein levels of p38 MAPK in the heart and higher mRNA levels of p38 MAPK in the liver compared with those of DLY pigs under a plateau environment. In summary, TPs possess a stronger antioxidant capacity in the heart and liver than that of DLY pigs in a plateau environment through AMPK/p38 MAPK/Nrf2-ARE signaling pathways.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of supplemental mycotoxin-sequestering agents on growth performance and nutrient utilization in growing pigs fed deoxynivalenol (DON)-contaminated diets. Twelve barrows with an initial body weight of 35.5 kg (standard deviation = 1.3) were assigned to six dietary treatments in a replicated 6 x 5 incomplete Latin square design. Five experimental diets consisted of an uncontaminated diet (PC), a DON-contaminated diet at 6.89 mg/kg (NC), NC + bentonite 0.5%, NC + yeast cell wall 0.5%, and NC + a mixture product 0.5% which consisted of enzymes, microorganisms, minerals, and plant extracts. Pigs had ad libitum access to the five diets. In the last group, the PC diet was restrictedly provided to pigs at the quantity of feed consumption of the NC group. Average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and gain:feed were not affected by supplemental mycotoxin-sequestering agents except for the mixed product that tended to improve (p = 0.064) gain:feed in pigs fed DON-contaminated diets. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter was not affected by DON contamination or by supplemental mycotoxin-sequestering agents, whereas the ATTD of Ca was decreased (p = 0.032) by supplemental yeast cell wall in pigs fed DON-contaminated diets. The ATTD of P was greater (p = 0.042) in pigs fed the NC diet compared with the pigs fed the restricted amount of the PC diet. In conclusion, bentonite and yeast cell wall did not affect growth performance of pigs fed DON-contaminated diets, but a supplemental mixed product consisting of enzymes, microorganisms, minerals, and plant extracts partially alleviated the negative effects of dietary DON on the gain:feed of pigs. Calcium digestibility was decreased by supplemental yeast cell wall in pigs fed DON-contaminated diets. Based on the present work, the use of a mixed product consisting of enzymes, microorganisms, minerals, and plant extracts is suggested, and the reduction of Ca digestibility by yeast cell wall needs to be considered in diet formulations.

AB  - Conditioned responding gradually stops during successful extinction learning. The renewal effect is defined as the recovery of a extinguished conditioned response when the context of extinction is different from acquisition. The stress hormone cortisol is known to have an influence on extinction memory and associative learning. Different effects of cortisol on behaviour and brain activity have been observed with respect to stress timing, duration, and intensity. However, the influence of cortisol prior to the initial encoding of stimulus-outcome associations on extinction learning, renewal and its behavioural and neurobiological correlates is still largely unknown. In our study, 60 human participants received 20 mg cortisol or placebo and then learned, extinguished, and recalled the associations between food stimuli presented in distinct contexts and different outcomes in three subsequent task phases. Learning performance during acquisition and extinction phases was equally good for both treatment groups. In the cortisol group, significantly more participants showed renewal compared to placebo. In the subgroup of participants with renewal, cortisol treated participants showed significantly better extinction learning performance compared to placebo. Participants showing renewal had in general difficulties with recalling extinction memory, but in contrast to placebo, the cortisol group exhibited a context-dependent impairment of extinction memory recall. Imaging analyses revealed that cortisol decreased activation in the hippocampus during acquisition. The cortisol group also showed reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation when extinction learning took place in a different context, but enhanced activation in inferior frontal gyrus during extinction learning without context change. During recall, cortisol decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation. Taken together, our findings illustrate cortisol as a potent modulator of extinction learning and recall of extinction memory which also promotes renewal.

AB  - Host plant selection by herbivores is driven by a complex array of cues, including leaf traits and previous leaf damage. Herbivore-associated cues to host selection at the plant and leaf scale aid understanding of mechanisms responsible for host preference that might translate into increased performance, as well as processes structuring herbivore populations mediated by interactions. We investigated how changes induced by a galling insect in the tropical fern Cyathea phalerata act as repellent or attractant cues for sawfly feeding and the effects of leaf size on herbivory levels. We recorded gall abundance, damage by chewers, leaf size, plant nutritional quality, phenolic concentration and leaf anatomical traits between galled and non-galled leaf samples. Galled samples contained less N, higher levels of phenolics and higher C/N ratio. However, leaf-chewing damage did not differ between galled and non-galled leaves. The gall structure was avoided by chewers, as it had high concentrations of phenolics, lignification and suberization. Larger leaves sustained higher gall abundance, but leaf size did not have a significant effect on chewer damage. A co-occurrence index calculated for both guilds indicated that galls and chewers exhibited a distribution that did not differ from random, reinforcing that the two guilds on C. phalerata do not show patterns of repulsion such as those maintained by interspecific competition. Sawflies dismissing chemical cues indicate that the increase in phenolics caused by galling insects does not generate increased protection of the galled pinnules. Our results highlight ferns as key resources for herbivores and as a potential plant group to study new research avenues on plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Deer mice, Peromyscus, thrive in diverse environments and altitudes across North and Central America. The number of extant species continues to be debated with species counts ranging from 53 to 83. This study represents the first comprehensive historical and taxonomic account of the genus Peromyscus for Honduras. We systematically compiled records from all available sources, incorporating verified genetic and morphological evidence. We confirm the presence of P. beatae, P. cordillerae, P. nicaraguae, P. salvadorensis and P. stirtoni for Honduras. The distribution maps provided here include confirmed records and approximate localities in a few cases and offer insights into the geographical distribution of these species in Honduras. Conducting a comprehensive assessment of the taxonomic status of Peromyscus in Honduras is imperative to achieve accurate conservation assessments within the larger Mesoamerican landscape. The present review establishes the baseline for future research on deer mice in Honduras, aiding in the validation of distributions and ecological data for the poorly understood genus Peromyscus in the country.

AB  - The IUCN now recognizes the savannah Loxodonta africana and forest Loxodonta cyclotis elephants to be separate species. Despite ecological, behavioural and morphological differences, and different habitat ranges, genetic studies confirm that the two species and hybrids coexist in forest-savannah ecotones. However, the hybrid phenotypes have not yet been described. In this survey we examined whether the phenotypes of the two species and of hybrids can be distinguished. In the first step, we used a machine learning algorithm (K-nearest neighbours) to compare 296 reference images of African elephants from five forest areas and six savannah areas where hybrids have not been recorded, confirming that six morphological criteria can be used to distinguish the species with more than 90% confidence. In the second step, we analysed 1,408 videos of elephants from 14 camera traps in Sebitoli, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, part of the main hybridization area. We used a multiple correspondence analysis and a species assignment key, highlighting the presence of three categories of phenotypes. Compared to the savannah and forest phenotypes (36.8 and 12.1%, respectively), the intermediate phenotypes, which could include hybrids, were more frequent (51.1%). Further studies combining morphology and genetics of the same individuals will be necessary to refine this species assignment key to characterize phenotypes confidently. This non-invasive, fast and inexpensive phenotypical-based method could be a valuable tool for conservation programmes.

AB  - Simple Summary Paratuberculosis (PTB) is a neglected disease in Africa, and it is a hidden killer disease of large and small ruminants with utmost socio-economic importance, especially for rural communities. The disease has been reported in the Sudan in both goats and cattle, but not in sheep. In this study we report the disease for the first time in sheep in the country. We suspected this disease in a breeding flock of sheep because of a history of unknown wasting condition. In this context, we used different diagnostic techniques to detect the bacteria causing the disease and to confirm the disease presence. As sheep in the Sudan are the most important export animal, it is worthy to conduct a wide investigation to gain insight into the disease prevalence in sheep to set up preventive measures and implement control programmes, as well as raising the awareness of animal owners in the country. Paratuberculosis (PTB) has been reported in the Sudan in cattle and goats for more than 50 years but has never been reported in sheep. However, suspicion of the disease in a breeding flock of sheep in Khartoum North locality was made due to a history of unknown cause of loss of weight. Blood and faecal samples were collected from all animals (N = 59): harvested sera were tested for anti-Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) antibodies by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA); faeces were screened for acid-fast bacilli by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, tested for MAP DNA by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and some faecal samples were cultured for MAP isolation. Typical MAP acid-fast bacilli were seen in 10.2% (6/59) of the faecal smears, 37.5% of the tested faecal samples (12/32) were positive for MAP DNA and only 3 (5.1%) animals were seropositive for MAP. MAP positive cultures were obtained from 2 out the 6 samples showing typical MAP acid-fast bacilli; the isolates were confirmed by real-time PCR and sequencing. As sheep are animals of utmost economic importance as the main export animals for the country, this first report of ovine PTB warrants special considerations and more investigations for planning control programmes of the disease.

AB  - Located 51.5 degrees S in the vicinity of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, Cerro Benitez and the glacial valley of Lago Sofia host several caves and rock shelters that were occupied by megafauna and humans during the Late Pleistocene, including the Mylodon Cave and two of the oldest archaeological sites in Patagonia. During the last glaciation, Cerro Benitez was alternately covered by the Patagonian Ice Sheet and surrounded by an ice-dammed lake which restricted the access to the caves and rock shelters located under its uppermost level, 155 m a.s.l. This study aims to provide a detailed chronology of the deglaciation and lake regression in Cerro Benitez. The glacial fluctuations and the variations of lake level were reconstructed from multi-scale, remote-sensing data and field geomorphological mapping. In addition, we calculated the surface exposure age of 11 erratic blocks located above and on the lacustrine erosional platform using terrestrial cosmogenic Be-10 in order to date ice downwasting and lake regression, respectively. Dates of ice downwasting and lake regression events were modelled from prior surface exposure ages using Bayesian statistics. The results suggest that the Patagonian Ice Sheet locally thinned by at least 300 m during MIS 3 in the aftermath of a major glacial advance. Following deglaciation, the ice-dammed lake experienced a slow local regression (ca. 2.5 mm. a(-1) until 16.9 ka B2k, interpreted as the result of lake basin tilting due to differential post-glacial isostatic rebound. This initial phase of lake regression was followed by a faster regression caused by the reversal of the lake drainage between 16.9 and 15.4 ka B2k. We assess the chronological model by comparison with uplift and lakeshore erosion rates from the literature and eventually discuss the implications for megafaunal colonisation of the area.

AB  - Understanding gut lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in healthy hosts is an important first step in selecting potential probiotic species. To understand the dynamics of LAB in healthy goats, a cohort of thirty-seven healthy new-born goat kids was studied over a ten-month period. Total LAB was quantified using SYBR green qPCR. Seven hundred LAB isolates were characterized using microscopy, M13 RAPD genotyping and 16S rDNA sequencing. The highest and lowest LAB counts were detected at one week and ten months of age, respectively. Diverse LAB species were detected, whose identity and prevalence varied with age. The main isolates belonged to Limosilactobacillus reuteri, Limosilactibacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus johnsonni, Ligilactobacillus murinus, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, Limosilactobacillus mucosae, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Ligilactobacillus agilis, Lactobacillus acidophilus/amyolovolus, Pediococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. Uniquely, L. reuteri and Pediococcus spp. were most common in pre- and peri-weaned goats, while Lactobacillus mucosae and Enterococcus spp. were predominant in goats one month and older. Based on RAPD genotyping, L. reuteri had the highest genotypic diversity, with age being a factor on the genotypes detected. This data may be relevant in the selection of age-specific probiotics for goats. The findings may also have broader implications by highlighting age as a factor for consideration in probiotic bacteria selection in other animal hosts.

AB  - We describe new evidences of plant-insect interactions from the Late Pennsylvanian of northern Iberian Peninsula (Leon, Spain). We document nine different Damage Types (DTs) among 216 fossil plant specimens. The interactions include four different Functional Feeding Groups (FFGs), including margin feeding (DT12 and DT13), hole feeding (DT09), galling (DT33, DT80, and DT116), and oviposition (DT67, DT100, and DT102) on Pteridophytes, Pteridospermatophytes, and Coniferophytes. Margin feeding and hole feeding were identified on different species of Polymorphopteris (P. polymorpha, P. cf. pseudobucklandii, and P. integra); galling on Mixoneura wagneri, Pecopteris apicalis, and Oligocarpia gutbieri; and oviposition on Polymorphopteris integra, Cordaites cf. angulostriatus and Polymorphopteris cf. integra. The oviposition scars represent the oldest record of oviposition from the Iberian Peninsula so far. In addition, it is the first evidence of plant-insect interactions on Oligocarpia and Polymorphopteris leaves in the area. These evidences reveal various ecological interactions between different groups of plants and insects in the Late Pennsylvanian forests of Spain, suggesting that these plants were a relevant source of food and lodge for a variety of arthropods (mainly insects). We also explore the possible culprits of these damages and the climatic implications. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the eastern United States, there are nine species of subterranean termites in three genera: Reticulitermes (six species), Coptotermes (two species), and Prorhinotermes (one species).These species serve as important ecological players by decomposing cellulose material, and some are important structural pests. Many of these species are difficult to discriminate morphologically and require examining the reproductive or soldier castes, which can be difficult to collect. While some genetic tools have been developed for species identification, they are often expensive and time-consuming. To help facilitate identification, we developed a more cost-effective and rapid genetic method to identify Reticulitermes species by screening 10 PCR primers that amplified intersimple sequence repeats (ISSRs) in other termite species. From these, one primer was amplified in all five focal Reticulitermes species and contained conserved, species-specific fragments. We further screened this identification method on samples of each species covering a diversity of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and localities. This identification method utilizing ISSRs can be used to quickly identify five species of Reticulitermes subterranean termites in the eastern United States in a matter of hours, providing a useful technique for pest management as well as future ecological research.

AB  - 1. Plants deploy diverse anti-herbivore defences which reduce feeding and performance of herbivores. Temperate grasses use silicon (Si) accumulation and Epichloe-endophytes for physical and chemical (i.e. endophytic-alkaloids) defence against insect herbivores. Recent studies suggest that Epichloe-endophytes increase Si accumulation in their host grass. It is unknown, however, how this affects Si-deposition on the leaf surface, their impacts on insect herbivore feeding efficiency and their immunity to potential infection/parasitism.
   2. To address this knowledge gap, we grew tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) hydroponically with and without Si, in the absence or presence of the novel AR584 Epichloe-strain. We exposed plants to Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in both in situ (intact leaves) and ex situ (excised leaves) feeding trials and determined the effects of Si and endophyte defences on herbivore feeding efficiency, growth rates and immunity against potential infection/parasitism.
   3. Endophytic plants supplied with Si showed 110% and 143% increases in leaf silica density and leaf Si concentrations, respectively, when exposed to herbivory, compared to non-endophytic plants that were herbivore-free. Despite the endophyte-mediated increases in Si concentrations, H. armigera was only affected by Si supply; growth rates decreased by 87% and most feeding efficiency indices decreased by at least 30%. Si supply also increased mandibular wear by 16%, which was negatively correlated with H. armigera growth rates. Cellular and humoral immunity of H. armigera were negatively affected by both Si and endophytes. Endophytic-loline alkaloid concentrations were unaffected by Si supply or herbivory, whereas herbivory increased peramine concentrations by 290%.
   4. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Si defences and Epichloe-endophyte derived alkaloids compromising insect immunity via reduced melanisation response. Using tall fescue and H. armigera, our study suggests that deploying both physical (i.e. Si accumulation) and chemical (i.e. endophytic-alkaloids) defences acting against multiple insect herbivore traits, including feeding efficiency, growth and immunity, may be a successful defence strategy in temperate grasses. This multi-faceted defence may be particularly difficult for insect herbivores to overcome.

AB  - Log Size Index (LSI) has been developed and used in archaeozoology to perform biometric studies of often small datasets, a recurrent limitation of archaeological faunal assemblages. This approach consists of aggregating measurements taken on different anatomical parts by standardisation, using a reference to which the studied measurements are scaled. No consensus exists in the choice of the reference to be used for LSI analyses and several datasets are now available, differing in their specimens and variables composition, and geographic and temporal origin. Using a biometric dataset of 5533 measurements of cattle, suids, sheep and goat from southern France and dated from the Roman times we compared the use of several references, provided by the R package zoolog, with a 'mean' reference specifically built for our studied sample and that corresponds to an averaged specimen. We demonstrated that references differ both in their raw measurements and their allometries, and that the choice of the reference influences the number of variables and measurements that can be analysed, but also diachronic LSI analyses and potentially their interpretations. While the main patterns are similar among references, local variation exist and it could not be excluded that the choice of the reference will more strongly influence other studies. We advocate to use the mean of the studied archaeological assemblage as reference, with the double benefit of exploiting to the maximum the number of available measurements, and of minimising, on average, the possible allometric differences between the studied population and the reference.

AB  - Relatively little is known about the long-term sediment accumulation dynamics of Naracoorte Cave Complex (NCC) solution pipe cavities, and many of the megafauna-bearing infill deposits at this globally significant Australian Pleistocene fossil locality remain partially dated or lack any numerical age control. In this study, we assess the suitability of three different luminescence dating signals for improving existing chronologies at six Late and Middle Pleistocene NCC sites (n = 22 samples), and we undertake multi-site examinations of NCC sediment infill dynamics spanning the last 550 thousand years (ka). Modern analogue samples collected from above and beneath two active cave entrances confirm that single-grain OSL, single-grain TT-OSL and multi-grain pIR-IRSL signals can be reset down to insignificant residual levels (< 10(- 1)-10(0) Gy) when compared with the natural dose ranges of interest for most NCC palaeontological applications. Replicate luminescence dating comparisons performed at six NCC fossil sites (n = 15 samples) reveal consistent ages for twenty-eight out of thirty-one paired OSL-TT-OSL, OSL-pIR-IRSL and TT-OSL-pIR-IRSL datasets. Nineteen of the twenty Middle to Late Pleistocene samples analysed from the NCC sites produce homogeneous OSL, TT-OSL and pIR-IRSL De datasets suggesting that the NCC solution pipe deposits considered here are generally not affected by syn-depositional mixing complications that can take place within closed karst cavities (i.e., the remobilisation of unbleached grains from pre-existing cave floor sediments, and their subsequent translocation and incorporation into deposits within deeper parts of the cavity along with externally bleached, allochthonous grain populations). Detailed examination of solution pipe dynamics at Smoke Tortoise Cave (SMT) reveals a complex accumulation history focused on the marine isotope stage (MIS) 9 and MIS 7 interglacial complexes, as well as the MIS 8e interstadial. The SMT case study highlights that NCC solution pipes are not simply associated with short-lived opening and sediment accumulation events, but may involve multiple, discontinuous deposition episodes and reactivation events. An initial multi-site examination of all published NCC infill chronologies (n = 70) appears to suggest statistically significant, preferential solution pipe development during the relatively wet parts of interglacial or interstadial cycles. The non-uniform infill age distribution implies that NCC solution pipe dynamics may have exerted taphonomic biases on fossil accumulation, which should be taken into consideration when reconstructing long-term palaeoecological histories from NCC solution pipe cavities.

AB  - Microplastic pollution (plastic particles < 5 mm) has potentially harmful impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Un-derstanding the factors that impact microplastic loading and distribution within aquatic ecosystems is crucial for assessing potential threats from microplastics. Here we examine the extent of microplastic pollution in the surface waters and sediments of four small inland lakes in Minnesota, USA that represent a range of human impacts as well as a variety of watershed and lake characteristics. Surface water particulates and benthic sedi-ments were collected in the summers of 2019 and 2020 to examine the loading of microplastics into these lakes and their distribution throughout the ecosystems. Lower size cut offs were set at 330 mu m for surface water particulate samples and 250 mu m for sediment samples. Watershed to surface area ratio (WS:SA) and urban development were the most influential factors on microplastic loading. Surface water microplastic concentrations ranged from 27,000 microplastics km-2 in Elk Lake (small WS:SA and minimally developed) to 152,000 microplastics km-2 in White Iron Lake (large WS:SA and low development). Concentrations in benthic sediments ranged from 30 microplastics kg- 1 dry sediment in White Iron Lake (forested watershed) to 270 microplastics kg -1 dry sediment in Peltier Lake (urbanized watershed) and were not directly correlated to surface water concentrations. Results from this study highlight the characteristics of small lakes that influence spatial and temporal variability in microplastic loading, retention, and deposition of microplastics to sediments. Further, this study demonstrates the difficulties of accurately predicting microplastic loading and the importance of comprehensive sampling to account for the variability of microplastic loading and distribution in smaller inland lakes.

AB  - Sexually mature male deer are known to rub-urinate, a process where urine is deposited on the tarsal gland. The resulting mixture of compounds from urine and secretions from the tarsal gland are used to signal sex, age, maturation status, and other information at close distance. We examined the difference in metabolites of tarsal gland extracts from male and female whitetail deer, Odocoileus virginianus, harvested during the mating season. Using NMR spectroscopy and high-pressure liquid chromatography linked to high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC/HR-MS) we identified a homologous series of four male-specific compounds. The compounds are novel glycine conjugates of 10-hydroxy-6,9-oxido fatty acids, which we term cervidins A-D. Cervidins were deemed to possess the absolute configuration 6S,9R,10R through comparison of their spectroscopic data with those of known compounds. In addition, cholesterol 3-sulfate and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid were found to be present in the extracts. Our results clearly demonstrate the diversity of potential semiochemicals contained in the mammalian integument.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana) use many sensory modes to gather information about their environment, including the detection of seismic, or ground-based, vibrations. Seismic information is known to include elephant-generated signals, but also potentially encompasses biotic cues that are commonly referred to as 'noise'. To investigate seismic information transfer in elephants beyond communication, here we tested the hypothesis that wild elephants detect and discriminate between seismic vibrations that differ in their noise types, whether elephant- or human-generated. We played three types of seismic vibrations to elephants: seismic recordings of elephants (elephant-generated), white noise (human-generated) and a combined track (elephant- and human-generated). We found evidence of both detection of seismic noise and discrimination between the two treatments containing human-generated noise. In particular, we found evidence of retreat behaviour, where seismic tracks with human-generated noise caused elephants to move further away from the trial location. We conclude that seismic noise are cues that contain biologically relevant information for elephants that they can associate with risk.

AB  - The Lut Desert, southeastern Iran, regularly has the largest contiguous area of surface temperatures above 65 degrees C compared to anywhere else on Earth. Despite these harsh conditions, some specialized species thrive in this extreme habitat. Misonne's spider gecko, Rhinogecko misonnei de Witte, 1973 (Reptilia, Squamata, Gekkonidae) is an endemic species that is native to the central part of the Lut Desert. This research aimed to explore the dietary gut content and ecology of Misonne's spider gecko populations inhabiting the Lut Desert. A DNA metabarcoding approach was applied to obtain data from the stomach content of six collected specimens. A total of 147,451 amplicon reads representing a total of 94 OTU (=Operational Taxonomic Units) for the CO1-5P barcode region were sequenced. Of 94 OTUs, 50 (53.2%) identically matched >= 97% with BOLD and/or NCBI database and were identified at the genus level. Blasting in both databases revealed the presence of three phyla including Chordata (55.23%), Arthropoda (44.72%), and Annelida (0.05). 99.54% of Chordata DNA belonged to Rhinogecko misonnei mainly coming from stomach tissue of the examined specimens. Within the arthropods, 87.64% of the OTUs matched Insecta and 12.08% Arachnida. Our findings indicate that Rhinogecko misonnei is a generalist gecko that feeds on a variety of food items. About 81% of Rhinogecko food items in the central Lut are migratory insects that come from adjacent areas of the Lut District, although the arachnid food items originate from the central Lut. This study emphasizes the importance of the insect fauna of adjacent areas of the Lut Desert for the stability of the Desert food web.

AB  - L-proline has been reported to be useful in semen cryopreservation. However, its use has rarely been reported in the freezing of boar semen. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of L-proline (0, 10, 30, 50, and 90 mM) on the quality of boar semen after freezing and thawing. Semen samples from boars (n = 6) were frozen using freezing extenders with added concentrations of L-proline. Total sperm motility, progressive motility, survival time at 37 degrees C, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, DNA integrity, the content of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and, expression levels of apoptosis protein (cleaved caspase 3 and Bax) were evaluated after thawing. The results showed that total sperm viability (73.96% vs. 63.58%) and progressive motility (56.88% vs. 47.26%) after thawing were significantly higher in the 10 mM L-proline treatment group than in the control group. The survival time at 37 degrees C and the total motility of sperm in the 10 mM group within one hour after thawing were significantly higher than in the control group. Acrosome integrity and mitochondrial activity of sperm in the 10 mM group were significantly higher than those in the control, 50 mM, and 90 mM groups. The DNA integrity rate in the 10 mM group was significantly higher than in the control group. The L-proline treatment did not affect sperm MDA content or T-AOC. The expression levels of apoptosis protein (cleaved caspase 3 and Bax) in the 10 mM L-proline supplemented group were lower than those in the control group. In conclusion, the freezing extender containing 10 mM L-proline improved semen quality after freezing and thawing and thus would be a useful reagent for boar semen cryopreservation.

AB  - 1. In the context of marine species declines in data-limited regions, local ecological knowledge (LEK) is a valuable source of information on species ecology and his- torical trends. LEK can also help understand how threatened species exist within a local culture, in terms of their uses and values, and reveal attitudes towards their conservation. Rhino rays (guitarfish and wedgefish) are highly threatened by overfishing with most species critically endangered, yet poorly studied in coun- tries like India that fish them the most.2. We drew on LEK to understand the socio-ecological status of rhino rays in Goa, on the west coast of India. We investigated their habitat use and seasonality, interaction with fisheries, socio-economic uses and relational values. We also ex- plored attitudes of fishers towards rhino rays and their conservation. A combina- tion of semistructured interviews and key informant interviews (88 in total) was conducted with fishers at multiple sites.3. Local knowledge suggests that nearshore habitats around river mouths form important nursery grounds for some rhino rays, and provided insights on their seasonality and breeding. Rhino rays appeared to be targeted historically but are entirely bycaught at present, with highest catches in gillnets and in the South Goa district, during September and October. LEK indicated that taxa like sawfish (Pristis spp.) and wedgefish (Rhynchobatus spp.) have severely declined or disap- peared from this region. We coded different relational values, from recreation (rhino rays are consumed and enjoyed with alcohol) to symbolic values (rhino rays are considered lucky). All key informants expressed positive attitudes towards rhino ray conservation and stated that a ban on landing these species would have little to no impact on fisher earnings.4. The usefulness of LEK suggests it should be brought into the scientific main- stream to support development of more equitable and socially appropriate management plans. Fostering relational values can reinforce fishers' positive atti- tudes, thereby enhancing rhino ray conservation. Their low commercial value and potentially high post-capture survival suggest that using norm- based approaches to promote live release may be successful. Further research on rhino ray ecologyand human dimensions can support the development of appropriate conservation interventions.

AB  - Dispersal is a key process for population persistence, particularly in fragmented landscapes. Connectivity between habitat fragments can be easily estimated by quantifying gene flow among subpopulations. However, the focus in ecological research has been on endangered species, typically excluding species that are not of current conservation concern. Consequently, our current understanding of the behaviour and persistence of many species is incomplete. A case in point is the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), an Australian herbivore that is subjected to considerable harvesting and population control efforts. In this study, we used non-invasive genetic sampling of eastern grey kangaroos within and outside of the Mourachan Conservation Property to assess functional connectivity. In total, we genotyped 232 samples collected from 17 locations at 20 microsatellite loci. The clustering algorithm indicated the presence of two clusters, with some overlap between the groups within and outside of the reserve. This genetic assessment should be repeated in 10-15 years to observe changes in population structure and gene flow over time, monitoring the potential impact of the planned exclusion fencing around the reserve.

AB  - Phoresy is one of the most distinctive relationships between mites and insects, and the off-host interaction between phoretic mites and their carriers is the most critical factor sustaining the phoretic association. As phoretic associations commonly occur in temporary habitats, little is known about off-host interactions between phoronts and carriers. However, an off-host interaction has been reported, in which the plant-mediated competition between a phoretic gall mite, Aceria pallida, and its psyllid vector, Bactericera gobica, after detachment decreases leaf abscission caused by B. gobica and then directly facilitates their phoretic association. In this obligate phoresy, A. pallida seasonally attaches to B. gobica for overwinter survival and they share the same host plant, Lycium barbarum, during the growing season. It is unknown how the host plant responds to these two herbivores and what plant metabolites are involved in their interspecific interaction. Here, effects of A. pallida and B. gobica on the host plant's transcriptome and metabolome, and on enzymes involved in plant defence, at various infestation stages were studied by inoculating A. pallida and B. gobica either separately or simultaneously on leaves of L. barbarum. Our results showed that (a) A. pallida significantly promoted primary and secondary metabolite accumulation, (b) B. gobica markedly inhibited primary and secondary metabolite accumulation and had little influence on defence enzyme activity, and (c) under simultaneous A. pallida and B. gobica infestation, an intermediate response was predicted. These findings indicate that A. pallida and B. gobica have different effects on host plants, A. pallida inhibits B. gobica mainly by increasing the secondary metabolism of L. barbarum, whereas B. gobica inhibits A. pallida mainly by decreasing the primary metabolism of L. barbarum. In conjunction with our previous research, we speculate that this trade-off in host plant metabolite response between A. pallida and B. gobica after detachment promotes a stable phoretic association.

AB  - Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an emerging technology that provide an opportunity to increase agricultural efficiency through remote sensing and automatic inferencing of field conditions. This paper examined the novel use of CNNs to identify two weeds, hair fescue and sheep sorrel, in images of wild blueberry fields. Commercial herbicide sprayers provide a uniform application of agrochemicals to manage patches of these weeds. Three object-detection and three image-classification CNNs were trained to identify hair fescue and sheep sorrel using images from 58 wild blueberry fields. The CNNs were trained using 1280x720 images and were tested at four different internal resolutions. The CNNs were retrained with progressively smaller training datasets ranging from 3780 to 472 images to determine the effect of dataset size on accuracy. YOLOv3-Tiny was the best object-detection CNN, detecting at least one target weed per image with F-1-scores of 0.97 for hair fescue and 0.90 for sheep sorrel at 1280 x 736 resolution. Darknet Reference was the most accurate image-classification CNN, classifying images containing hair fescue and sheep sorrel with F-1-scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively at 1280 x 736. MobileNetV2 achieved comparable results at the lowest resolution, 864 x 480, with F-1-scores of 0.95 for both weeds. Training dataset size had minimal effect on accuracy for all CNNs except Darknet Reference. This technology can be used in a smart sprayer to control target specific spray applications, reducing herbicide use. Future work will involve testing the CNNs for use on a smart sprayer and the development of an application to provide growers with field-specific information. Using CNNs to improve agricultural efficiency will create major cost-savings for wild blueberry producers.

AB  - Managing large animal mortalities becomes challenging and potentially inappropriate, particularly within a livestock unit, due to the methods employed. These methods are not environmentally friendly, have the potential to spread diseases to both humans and animals, and do not align with the principles of promoting a circular economy within livestock units. Similarly, the management of green waste (GW) originating from gardens, parks, and tree-lined streets is challenging due to its high lignin content and the absence of efficient management plans by local authorities. Therefore, in most of the cases, GWs are discharged unexploited to landfill sites although composting seem to be a promising method. This study aims to develop a composting methodology of animal mortalities as an alternative management option by exploiting GWs from municipalities and by adding natural zeolite to the feedstock materials in order to control the extreme properties of the final product. The ultimate goal is to produce a safe and environment friendly product, appropriate to be applied to agricultural and forest ecosystems in order to enhance soil improvements. The feedstock materials were sheep mortalities, GWs and clinoptilolite. Three types of composts were produced; one with no zeolite addition, one with zeolite addition in the beginning of the composting process and one by adding zeolite after the 2nd heat cycle was completed. It was observed that the three composts were of high nutritional value, complied with most of the EU and US Standards of Compost Quality and that the addition of zeolite improved the nutritional status of the composts (e.g. N, K, Mg, Mn). A significantly reduced Enterobacteriaceae population was observed in zeolite-amended compost compared to the unamended one. The results are directly useful and applicable to promoting healthy plant growth and sustainable agro-silvo-pastoral practices.

AB  - Land use influences surface water quality, often alleviating stoichiometric constraints on primary production and altering biogeochemical cycling. However, land use effects on nutrient content and potential trace metal accumulation in aquatic plants remain unclear, and high concentrations of metals and altered nutrient ratios could impact the health of herbivores and detritivores. We tested for land use effects on nutrient and trace metal accumulation in a widespread riverine macrophyte, Podostemum ceratophyllum, collected from 91 locations from Georgia to Maine, USA in 2014-2016. We quantified carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), their molar and mass ratios, N and C stable isotopes, and 17 additional elements in dried plants collected from each location to estimate relationships between plant tissue content and watershed land use, which we quantified as agriculture, forest, and development. Decreasing forest cover was correlated with increasing delta N-15, Mg, Mn, and P in Podostemum tissue. Increasing urban development was correlated with increasing delta N-15, Mg and P, while increasing agriculture was correlated with a decrease in C: P and the concentrations of multiple metals, along with increases in P, Mg and delta N-15. Decreases in ratios of N: P and C:P with increasing agriculture and urban development in the watershed indicate more rapid P storage relative to C and N in plant tissue, and increased resource quality of the plant to consumers in these watersheds. We also observed potentially toxic dietary concentrations of some trace metals (B, Cd, Tl, Zn) in plant tissue which could be related to the plant's natural herbivory defense system or to land use. We conclude that land use influences the elemental composition of P. ceratophyllum, and potentially the quality and toxicity of the plant to herbivores and detritivores in eastern North American rivers.

AB  - Behavior affects an individual's life in all aspects, e.g., enhancing fitness, leveraging predation risk, and reducing competition with conspecifics. However, the sequential distribution of behaviors received less attention and is unclear what the function of displacement behavior is. Displacement activities can be found in vertebrate species but there is no formal method to determine whether a behavior is expressed as a displaced or normal activity. Analyzing the sequential distributions of behaviors in a natural setting may allow researchers to identify unexpected distributions as a possible signature of displacement activities. In this study, we used a behavior random permutation model to detect the presence of a displacement activity in the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii and the Tibetan gazelle Procapra picticaudata. The results showed that grooming in both ungulates tended to be accompanied with vigilance, and the frequency of grooming after vigilance was significantly higher than before vigilance. A significant positive correlation between the scan rate and grooming rate in the 2 ungulates was obtained. We suggest that grooming could sometimes be expressed as a displacement activity in ungulates. In addition to providing a general method for further research on displacement activities in a variety of animal species, this study sheds light on the importance of a spectral analysis of sequential distribution of animal behaviors. Behavior random permutation models can be used to explore the relevance between any 2 behaviors in a specific sequence, especially to identify a myriad of unexpected behaviors relative to their normal context of occurrence.

AB  - We developed an innovative approach to estimate the occurrence and extent of fecal pollution sources for urban river catchments. The methodology consists of 1) catchment surveys complemented by literature data where needed for probabilistic estimates of daily produced fecal indicator (FIBs, E. coli, enterococci) and zoonotic reference pathogen numbers (Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium and Giardia) excreted by human and animal sources in a river catchment, 2) generating a hypothesis about the dominant sources of fecal pollution and selecting a source targeted monitoring design, and 3) verifying the results by comparing measured concentrations of the informed choice of parameters (i.e. chemical tracers, C. perfringensspores, and host-associated genetic microbial source tracking (MST) markers) in the river, and by multi-parametric correlation analysis. We tested the approach at a study area in Vienna, Austria.
   The daily produced microbial particle numbers according to the probabilistic estimates indicated that, for the dry weather scenario, the discharge of treated wastewater (WWTP) was the primary contributor to fecal pollution. For the wet weather scenario, 80-99% of the daily produced FIBs and pathogens resulted fromcombined sewer overflows (CSOs) according to the probabilistic estimates. When testing our hypothesis in the river, the measured concentrations of the human genetic fecal marker were log10 4 higher than for selected animal genetic fecal markers. Our analyses showed for the first-time statistical relationships between C. perfringens spores (used as conservativemicrobial tracer for communal sewage) and a human genetic fecal marker (i.e. HF183/BacR287) with the reference pathogen Giardia in river water (Spearman rank correlation: 0.78-0.83, p < 0.05. The developed approach facilitates urban water safety management and provides a robust basis for microbial fate and transport models and microbial infection risk assessment.

AB  - Simple Summary Swine manure is a significant source of agricultural organic waste, and in recent years, it has been shown that black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens (L.), (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), is effective at treating manures or compounds based on them. African swine fever virus (ASFV) infections have significantly modified the preventative procedure, including the disinfection of manure with various disinfectants, since 2018 when they first became a serious issue in the Chinese swine production industry. However, there is not any research discussing the influences of disinfectants in manures on black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). Therefore, this study examined the effects of the disinfectants contained in pig manure on the growth of BSFL and the reduction of waste. Additionally, the disinfectants might not only eliminate important pathogens but also alter the microbial composition of the gut of the larvae; thus, investigations of the intestinal bacterial communities of the BSFL-fed manures, which were mixed with various disinfectants, were conducted. These findings will be helpful in providing a better treatment of swine manures with BSFL. The use of the black soldier fly has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of swine manure. Since the outbreaks of ASFV, prevention procedures, including manure disinfection, have changed dramatically. Glutaraldehyde (GA) and potassium peroxymonosulfate (PPMS) have been shown to be effective in the prevention of this pathogen and are thus widely used in the disinfection of swine manures, etc. However, research on the effects of disinfectants in manures on the growth of BSFL and gut microbiota is scarce. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of GA and PPMS on BSFL growth, manure reduction, and gut microbiota. In triplicate, 100 larvae were inoculated in 100 g of each type of manure compound (manure containing 1% GA treatment (GT1), manure containing 0.5% GA treatment (GT2), manure containing 1% PPMS treatment (PT1), manure containing 0.5% PPMS treatment (PT2), and manure without disinfectant (control)). After calculating the larval weight and waste reduction, the larval gut was extracted and used to determine the microbial composition. According to the results, the dry weights of the larvae fed PT1-2 (PT1: 86.7 +/- 4.2 mg and PT2: 85.3 +/- 1.3 mg) were significantly higher than those of the larvae fed GT1-2 (GT1: 72.5 +/- 2.1 mg and GT2: 70 +/- 2.8 mg) and the control (64.2 +/- 5.8 mg). There was a 2.8-4.03% higher waste reduction in PT1-2 than in the control, and the waste reduction in GT1-2 was 7.17-7.87% lower than that in the control. In a gut microbiota analysis, two new genera (Fluviicola and Fusobacterium) were discovered in PT1-2 when compared to GT1-2 and the control. Furthermore, the disinfectants did not reduce the diversity of the microbial community; rather, Shannon indices revealed that the diversities of GT1-2 (GT1: 1.924 +/- 0.015; GT2: 1.944 +/- 0.016) and PT1 (1.861 +/- 0.016) were higher than those of the control (1.738 +/- 0.015). Finally, it was found that both disinfectants in swine manures at concentrations of 1% and 0.5% may be beneficial to the complexity and cooperation of BSFL gut microbiota, according to an analysis of microbial interactions.

AB  - Landscape features, such as rivers, can act as geographical barriers to dispersal and gene flow and thus influence the population structure of some species. In this study, tissue samples were collected from 73 Hume's Pheasant Syrmaticus humiae, from six localities in Guangxi and Guizhou provinces, China, to examine the influence of rivers in landscape structure on genetic diversity and structure based on 12 microsatellite loci. Results indicated a high genetic diversity in Hume's Pheasant. Individuals from populations in Tianlin, Longlin and Xilin counties (TXL) (three geographically proximate populations) tended to form a genetic cluster, distinct from three other geographically proximate populations 100 km to the west in Pojie town (PJ), Luodian county (LD) and Leye county (LX), which showed more mixing and were less genetically distinct. Using simulated Markov-switching VAR (MSVAR), we found that the median population sizes of the posterior distributions were approximately 3,715 individuals for N-0, and approximately 100,000 for N1, indicating that Hume's Pheasant experienced a significant genetic bottleneck 4,800 years ago, possibly due to human activity. Hume's Pheasant shows female-biased dispersal. The results of STRUCTURE and GENELAND indicate that Nanpan River, Hongshui River and national road G324 act as potential genetic barriers for Hume's Pheasant in Guangxi and Guizhou provinces. In addition, genetic distinctiveness has persisted despite population declines of the Hume's Pheasant due to the bottleneck approximately 5,000 years ago and population declines in the last 100 years.

AB  - The cold and hypoxic conditions at high altitude place high demands on the cardiovascular system to sustain circulatory O2 transport. High-altitude natives have evolved to overcome cold hypoxia, but the cardiovascular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood in most taxa. Here, we investigated the evolved changes in reflex control of cardiovascular function in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to high altitude. High- and low-altitude populations of deer mice were each bred in captivity and then chronically acclimated to warm normoxia (25 degrees C, similar to 20 kPa O2) or cold hypoxia (5 degrees C, 12 kPa O2) for 6-8 weeks. Cardiovascular function was measured in vivo using physiological telemeters, complemented by wire myography to examine vascular function ex vivo. High-altitude mice acclimated to cold hypoxia exhibited greater heart rates and were better able to maintain blood pressure in moderate and severe hypoxia, in association with less pronounced depression of metabolism and body temperature. High-altitude mice also exhibited greater baroreflex sensitivity than low-altitude mice across acclimation environments, as reflected by greater changes in heart rate and smaller changes in arterial blood pressure during pharmacological manipulations. Mesenteric arteries from each population exhibited similar ex vivo smooth muscle contractions in response to phenylephrine (alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist), and similar endotheliumdependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine, suggesting that evolved changes in the baroreflex arise from adjustments in autonomic control of the heart and/or other resistance vessels. These evolved changes in cardiovascular function and reflex control may be valuable for supporting high metabolic rates in the cold and hypoxic environment at high altitude.

AB  - Insects closely interact with plants with multiple genes involved in their interactions. beta-glucosidase, constituted mainly by glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1), is a crucial enzyme in insects to digest plant cell walls and defend against natural enemies with sequestered plant metabolites. To gain more insights into the role of this enzyme in plant-insect interactions, we analyzed the evolutionary history of the GH1 gene family with publicly available insect genomes. We found that GH1 is widely present in insects, while the gene numbers are significantly higher in insect herbivores directly feeding on plant cell walls than in other insects. After reconciling the insect GH1 gene tree with a species tree, we found that the patterns of duplication and loss of GH1 genes differ among insect orders, which may be associated with the evolution of their ecology. Furthermore, the majority of insects' GH1 genes were tandem-duplicated and subsequently went through neofunctionalization. This study shows the evolutionary history of an important gene family GH1 in insects and facilitates our understanding of the evolution of insect-plant interactions.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is common in concentrated pig feed operations from the decomposition of manure. Ambient H2S is a respiratory tract irritant and an environmental stressor for caretakers and pigs. Influenza A virus (IAV), a zoonotic pathogen, has caused prior pandemics. The effects of H2S or IAV alone on the respiratory system have been investigated, but their interaction has not. We hypothesized that exposure to environmentally-relevant H2S concentrations increases the pathogenicity of IAV infection in swine. Thirty-five, three-week old pigs of mixed sex were exposed to breathing air or H2S via inhalation 6 hours daily for 12 days. After 7 days, pigs were inoculated with H3N2 IAV (or a placebo). Results showed that ambient H2S increased the severity of respiratory distress and lung pathology. H2S also suppressed IL-IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 cytokine response in BALF and increased viral loads and nasal shedding.

AB  - Feeding by Critically Endangered forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis in rural plantations is a conservation issue in Gabon, but studies characterizing drivers of spatiotemporal patterns of human-elephant interactions remain sparse, hindering mitigation. In this study, we use GPS tracking data from two elephants to characterize temporal patterns of village visitation, and surveys of 101 local farmers across seven villages to determine local patterns of crop planting and harvesting and of human-elephant interactions. Local farmers' perceptions of elephant visitations and empirical data on such visits were positively correlated with local crop availability. However, considering the two elephants separately revealed that the correlations were driven by just one individual, with the second elephant showing weak links between crop availability and visitation, highlighting the challenges in reliably predicting human-wildlife interactions. The most popular local perceptions of the drivers of elephant visitation were the presence of crops (53% of responses) and logging (39%). The most popular proposed interventions were letting the government find a solution (32%), killing problem elephants (30%) and providing compensation for lost crops (22%). We discuss the potential feasibility and efficacy of the proposed solutions in the context of human-elephant interactions. Future research efforts should focus on collaring elephants in zones with high potential for negative human-elephant interaction and expanding perception surveys to villages with contrasting ecological contexts (e.g. with and without logging in their surrounding forests), as these could influence local perceptions of conflicts and conservation initiatives.

AB  - Insects tend to feed on related hosts. Coevolution tends to be dominated by interactions resulting from plant chemistry in defense strategies, and evolution of secondary metabolisms being in response to insect herbivory remains a classic explanation of coevolution. The present study examines whether evolutionary constraints existing in host associations of economically important fruit flies in the species-rich tribe Dacini (Diptera: Tephritidae) and to what extent these species have evolved specialized dietary patterns. We found a strong effect of host phylogeny on associations on the 37 fruit flies tested, although the fruit fly species feeding on ripe commercially grown fruits that lost the toxic compounds after long-term domestication are mostly polyphagous. We assessed the phylogenetic signal of host breadth across the fruit fly species, showing that the results were substantially different depending on partition levels. Further, we mapped main host family associations onto the fruit fly phylogeny and Cucurbitaceae has been inferred as the most likely ancestral host family for Dacini based on ancestral state reconstruction.

AB  - In smallholder agriculture, the fast-growing and perennial accumulator plant comfrey (Symphytum spp.) was used to supply pigs with protein and minerals. Comfrey leaves show similar values in dry matter as soybean or blue lupine in crude protein content, but much higher levels of calcium and phosphorus. However, in terms of increased efficiency in animal husbandry, comfrey has been displaced by mainly soybean and cereals. Due to its profile of macro-and micronutrients the use of comfrey could have the potential to re-establish local resource cycles and help remediate over-fertilized soils. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether a modern pig breed accepts a continuous feed supplement of dried comfrey leaves. After an initial adaptation period post-weaning, German Landrace piglets were subjected to either a standard control diet or a diet supplemented with 15% dried comfrey leaves for 4 weeks. Body weight was reduced in comfrey-supplemented piglets compared to controls, which might be attributed to reduced palatability in the experimental setting. Nevertheless, comfreysupplemented piglets exhibited adequate bone mineralization and intestinal integrity. The microbiome profile in feces and digesta revealed higher diversity in comfrey-supplemented piglets compared to controls, with pronounced effects on the abundances of Treponema and Prevotella. This may be due to described bio-positive components of the comfrey plant, as data suggest that the use of comfrey leaves may promote intestinal health. Digestive tract phosphorus levels were reduced in piglets receiving comfrey supplementation, which may ultimately affect phosphorus levels in manure. Results indicate that comfrey leaves could serve as a feed component in integrated agricultural systems to establish regional nutrient cycles. The trial provides a basis for further work on comfrey as a regionally grown protein source and effective replacement for rock mineral supplements. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Chronic Wasting Disease is a deadly infectious disease affecting cervids that was discovered in Norway in 2016. CWD can transmit through environmental reservoirs and aggregation and spatial clustering of animals may affect transmission. Deer usually forage on scattered forage, but anthropogenic food sources are often concentrated in space, leading to spatial aggregation. We determined what caused red deer to revisit the same locations in the environment, and the extent to which this was caused by anthropogenic food sources. We document that the most visited sites were indeed anthropogenic, which opens potential avenues to disease mitigation.
   Herbivores like cervids usually graze on widely scattered forage, but anthropogenic food sources may cause spatial revisitation and aggregation, posing a risk for transmission of infectious diseases. In 2016, chronic wasting disease (CWD) was first detected in Norway. A legal regulation to ban supplemental feeding of cervids and to fence stored hay bales was implemented to lower aggregation of cervids. Knowledge of further patterns and causes of spatial revisitation can inform disease management. We used a recently developed revisitation analysis on GPS-positions from 13 red deer (Cervus elaphus) to identify the pattern of spatial clustering, and we visited 185 spatial clusters during winter to identify the causes of clustering. Anthropogenic food sources were found in 11.9% of spatial clusters, which represented 31.0% of the clusters in agricultural fields. Dumping of silage and hay bales were the main anthropogenic food sources (apart from agricultural fields), and unfenced hay bales were available despite the regulation. The probability of the clusters being in agricultural fields was high during winter. It may be necessary to find other ways of disposing of silage and enforcing the requirement of fencing around hay bales to ensure compliance, in particular during winters with deep snow.

AB  - Cetaceans have evolved unique limb structures, such as flippers, due to genetic changes during their transition to aquatic life. However, the full understanding of the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms behind these changes is still developing. By examining 25 limb-related protein-coding genes across various mammalian species, we compared genetic changes between aquatic mammals, like whales, and other mammals with unique limb structures such as bats, rodents and elephants. Our findings revealed significant modifications in limb-related genes, including variations in the Hox, GDF5 and Evx genes. Notably, a relaxed selection in several key genes was observed, suggesting a lifting of developmental constraints, which might have facilitated the emergence of morphological innovations in cetacean limb morphology. We also uncovered non-synonymous changes, insertions and deletions in these genes, particularly in the polyalanine tract of HOXD13, which are distinctive to cetaceans or convergent with other aquatic mammals. These genetic variations correlated with the diverse and specialized limb structures observed in cetaceans, indicating a complex interplay of relaxed selection and specific mutations in mammalian limb evolution.

AB  - Glyphosate is the most widely used non-selective herbicide in the world. Glyphosate residues in soil can affect plant quality by modifying plant physiology, hormonal pathways and traits, with potential consequences for plants' interactions with herbivores. We explored these indirect effects in the context of plant-herbivore interactions in a perennial, nitrogen-fixing herb. We quantified leaf herbivory for glyphosate-exposed and control plants grown in phosphorus-fertilized and non-fertilized soils, and assessed the impacts of glyphosate treatment on traits related to plant resistance against herbivores (leaf trichome density, leaf mass per area) and performance (aboveground biomass, root:shoot ratio, nodule number, nodule activity). Moreover, we conducted a laboratory feeding experiment to compare the palatability of leaves from glyphosate-exposed and control plants to a generalist mollusc herbivore. Herbivore damage and intensity in situ increased during the growing season regardless of glyphosate or phosphorus treatment. Glyphosate treatment reduced leaf trichome density but had no effect on the other plant traits considered. Herbivore damage was negatively associated with leaf trichome density. The feeding experiment revealed no difference in the feeding probability of mollusc herbivores between glyphosate-exposed and control plants. However, there was an interaction between glyphosate treatment and initial leaf area for leaf consumption by herbivores: leaf consumption increased with increasing leaf area in both groups, but at a lower rate for glyphosate-exposed plants than for control plants. Our results show that glyphosate residues in soil have the potential to indirectly affect aboveground herbivores through changes in leaf quality, which may have mixed consequences for folivore damage.

AB  - Livestock farming has a key role in many rural communities both economically and culturally. It plays an important role in overcoming the deficiencies of meat, milk, wool and various by-products. Pakistan has a large number of livestock, well-adapted to local conditions. and has some of the best tropical dairy breeds. Native sheep breeds stand a vital asset to the country's livestock sector because of their adaptability and unique genetic traits. However, knowledge of the genetic diversity of these sheep breeds remains limited. This study aims to investigate the genetic diversity of 10 local sheep breeds from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by analyzing the mitochondrial D-loop from 159 individual samples of females. The sequenced data from the mtDNA D-loop showed 106 different haplotypes, with a haplotype diversity of 0.9854 +/- 0.0041. Analysis of the mitochondrial D-loop revealed three distinct haplogroups (HapA, HapB, and HapC). Out of the 159 sequences, 125 (77.99%) grouped with HapA, 30 (18.87%) with HapB, and 5 (3.14%) with HapC. While HapA and HapB are commonly found in sheep breeds worldwide, the identification of 5 sequences belonging to HapC was unexpected. This haplogroup was seen in four sheep breeds: Afghani, Australian, Gauder and Waziri. Most interestingly, the two Pakistani-origin breeds, the Waziri sheep breed, from South of Waziristan and the Gauder, a crossbreed, have been identified with HapC haplogroup. This indicates that the sheep breeds of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa belong to three distinct phylogenetic lineages, suggesting a probable gene flow from the southwest to the northeast regions of the province.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) threatens natural ecosystems globally. While ALAN research is increasing, little is known about how ALAN affects plants and interactions with other organisms. We explored the effects of ALAN on plant defence and plant-insect interactions using barley (Hordeum vulgare) and the English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae). Plants were exposed to 'full' or 'part' nights of 15-20 lux ALAN, or no ALAN 'control' nights, to test the effects of ALAN on plant growth and defence. Although plant growth was only minimally affected by ALAN, aphid colony growth and aphid maturation were reduced significantly by ALAN treatments. Importantly, we found strong differences between full-night and part-night ALAN treatments. Contrary to our expectations, part ALAN had stronger negative effects on aphid colony growth than full ALAN. Defence-associated gene expression was affected in some cases by ALAN, but also positively correlated with aphid colony size, suggesting that the effects of ALAN on plant defences are indirect, and regulated via direct disruption of aphid colonies rather than via ALAN-induced upregulation of defences. Mitigating ecological side effects of ALAN is a complex problem, as reducing exposure to ALAN increased its negative impact on insect herbivores.This article is part of the theme issue 'Light pollution in complex ecological systems'.

AB  - Despite the significance of the Atlantic Forest, little is known about the biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from its tree species. This study aimed to characterize sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions from ten dominant species in a forest remnant near Sao Paulo, Brazil, using a dynamic enclosure system and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 24 SQTs were annotated, including seven oxygenated sesquiterpenes (OSQTs). Emissions ranged from undetectable in Luehea divaricata to 277.54 ng gDM- 1 h-1 in Alchornea sidifolia. Hierarchical clustering grouped species into four clusters based on emission intensity and chemical diversity: (1) high emission with low chemical diversity (A. sidifolia), (2) moderate-to-high emission with high diversity (Machaerium brasiliense and Allophylus edulis), (3) moderate emission with low (Guarea macrophylla) to moderate diversity (Machaerium nyctitans, Lithraea molleoides, and Casearia sylvestris), and (4) low emissions and low (Pittosporum undulatum) to moderate diversity (Nectandra barbellata), or undetectable emissions (Luehea divaricata). Most species predominantly emitted alpha-copaene, (3-caryophyllene, or alpha-cubebene, each linked to defensive/ecological functions like herbivore deterrence and antimicrobial activity. Species with high (3-caryophyllene emissions (A. edulis, L. molleoides) or OSQT diversity (A. sidifolia, M. brasiliense, M. nyctitans) emerged as promising candidates for bioprospecting. Conversely, from a SQT-emission perspective, low-emitting species (N. barbellata, P. undulatum, and L. divaricata) represent suitable potential candidates for urban greening due to their limited contribution to secondary pollutant formation. These findings provide a foundation for future BVOC research in the Atlantic Forest and support the strategic selection and application of species based on their SQT emission profiles.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) predicts that introduced species leave most enemies behind during the invasion process, resulting in less enemy damage and increased performance in their introduced range. In Hawai'i, introduced red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) convert open shorelines into dense mangrove forests. While previous studies show introduced mangroves harbor a lower occurrence of damage on various plant structures, it remains unknown if the magnitude of damage to mangrove leaves and metrics of performance differ between introduced and native populations. In this study, we tested some of the predictions of the ERH through leaf damage surveys and a year-long damage experiment replicated in 8-10 sites in the native (Caribbean and Florida) and introduced (Hawai'i) range of red mangroves. In each site, we (1) compared the percentage of leaf area damaged, (2) measured metrics of performance (leaf loss, leaf, twig, and propagule production), and (3) experimentally tested how rapidly necrosis spreads on artificially-damaged leaves of R. mangle. Our results were largely consistent with the ERH. Native mangroves exhibited orders of magnitude higher leaf damage than introduced mangroves, suffered nearly twice the leaf loss, and produced fewer twigs and propagules than introduced mangroves over one year. Leaf production and the expansion of necrotic area on leaves were similar. Broadly, our study demonstrates that introduced mangroves experience substantially less leaf damage and thus, may be exhibiting evidence of increased growth and fecundity. Our results may help explain why introduced mangroves continue to be so productive and are considered invasive in Hawaiian habitats.

AB  - Folk traditional knowledge and practices are very rich and popular among the tribal farmers in different agricultural practices. The community-based cross-sectional study was carried out to know about pig farming patterns, ethnoveterinary knowledge and practices among various tribal pig farmers in Karbi Anglong district of Assam, India. Various field data pertaining to pig management were collected through personnel interviews, pre-tested semi-structured questionnaires, participatory rural appraisal, group discussions and field visits. This study attempted to evaluate the potential use of medicinal plants and their by-products as feed ingredients and traditional folk medicine. A total of 40 species of ethnoveterinary medicinal plants were recorded which are principally used to cure various major and minor ailments like fracture, parasitic infestation, maggot wound, diarrhoea, fever, etc. The use of locally available feed ingredients will help in the exploration of forest resources, minimize production costs. The present study recorded a total of 21 wild plant species which are used for feeding pigs with the most frequently used species belonging to Broussonetia papyrifera, Colocasia esculenta, Alternanthera sessilis, etc. The study will help the farmers, environmentalists, researchers, and other stakeholders to identify, document, familiarize and a better understanding of the distribution of rich medicinal plants in the hill region.

AB  - Musk, a dried secretion from the sac gland near the urethral foramen of adult male forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii), has significant economic value and is extensively utilized as a valuable component in traditional Chinese medicine. In the practice of forest musk deer breeding, musk with different colors and varying moisture contents is observed during the season when the musk reaches maturity. For many years, researchers have focused mainly on musk composition and symbiotic bacteria. However, the influence of fecal fungi on the production and quality of musk is unknown. In this study, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) analysis was employed to explore the relationships between the fungal composition of musk deer fecal and the quality and production of musk produced by each individual. The results indicate that fungal genera known to cause diseases, such as Colletotrichum and Apiotrichum, are prevalent in the feces of musk deer that produce abnormal musk. Furthermore, the fecal microbiota health index (GMHI) is lower and the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis index (MDI) is greater in musk deer producing white musk than in normal individuals. Additionally, by correlating musk production with fecal fungi, we also found that Dolichousnea and Scolecoleotia were significantly positively correlated with musk production. Moreover, Metschnikowia, Ganodermataceae_gen_Incertae_sedis, Hypoxylon, Neovaginatispora, Didymella, Dothidea, and Trichoderma were negatively correlated with musk production. This study is the first to investigate gut fungi in relation to musk production/quality, establish gut health and fungal dysbiosis links, and identify candidate fungi tightly associated with musk traits. This exploratory approach is critical for exploring uncharted territories like gut fungi in musk deer and musk traits.

AB  - The wedgefishes (Rhinidae) stand out as one of the most endangered marine lineages due to the conjunction of shallow coastal habitats, slow growth, low fecundity and high fishing pressure. The Indo-West Pacific region, including Malaysia, is of particular interest as it hosts a large share of the wedgefish diversity. Here, we shed light on the species and genetic diversity of wedgefishes found in Malaysian waters. A total of 85 Rhynchobatus samples were collected at 15 locations over 7 years across Malaysia and were identified using both morphological characters and genetics. We highlight the difficulty in identifying species based on morphological characters alone, and that molecular confirmation was needed for ambiguous specimens. Rhynchobatus australiae, broadly distributed across coastal Malaysia, represented a large fraction of the samples (87%), followed by R. palpebratus (11%) and a single R. springeri individual. The occurrence of R. palpebratus is a new record for this species in Malaysia and indicates a wider distribution than previously thought. Population genetic analysis within R. australiae revealed fine-scale structuring within the Strait of Malacca, notwithstanding the fact that this is a relatively small and shallow waterway that does not obviously hinder the movement of R. australiae along the coast. These results reinforce the importance to manage and protect these species and populations in Malaysian waters.

AB  - Introduction Rainfall events can determine a cascade of plant physiological and ecological processes, and there is considerable interest in the way that rainfall modifies plant water flux dynamics.Methods The sap flow density (SF) of the planted species of Vitex negundo and Hippophae rhamnoides, on the Loess Plateau of China was monitored using the heat balance method from 2015 to 2017.Introduction<bold>:</bold> Rainfall events can determine a cascade of plant physiological and ecological processes, and there is considerable interest in the way that rainfall modifies plant water flux dynamics.
   Methods<bold>:</bold> The sap flow density (SF) of the planted species of Vitex negundo and Hippophae rhamnoides, on the Loess Plateau of China was monitored using the heat balance method from 2015 to 2017.
   Results and discussion: The results showed that SF responded differently to rainfall classes because of the changing meteorological and soil water content (SWC) conditions. For class 1: 0.2-2 mm, SF increased by 14.36-42.93% for the two species, which were mainly attributable to the effect of solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit after rainfall. For class 2: 2-10 mm, SF remained nearly stable for V. negundo and decreased for H. rhamnoides because of the relative humidity's effect. For class 3: > 10 mm, SF increased significantly because of increased SWC and the increasing response to solar radiation. The increased percentage of SF was relatively higher for V. negundo when rainfall was less than 20 mm, while the value was higher for H. rhamnoides when rainfall was greater than 10 mm. Further, V. negundo's water potential increased at the soil-root interface (psi(0)) and psi(L), indicating that the plant, which has shallower roots and a coarser of leaf and bark texture, considered as anisohydric species and used precipitation-derived upper soil water to survive. The relatively consistent psi(L) and psi(0) for H. rhamnoides, which has deep roots and leathery leaves, indicated that this species was considered as isohydric species and insensitive to the slight change in the soil water status. The differed response patter and water use strategies between the two species showed that species as V. negundo are more susceptible to frequent, but small rainfall events, while larger, but less frequent rainfall events benefit such species as H. rhamnoides. This study quantified the effect of environmental factors for SF variation. The results could help formulate a selection process to determine which species are more suitable for sustainable management in the afforestation activities under the context of more frequent and intense rainfall events.

AB  - Uncovering relationships between neuroanatomy, behavior, and evolution is important for understanding the factors that control brain function. Voluntary exercise is one key behavior that both affects, and may be affected by, neuroanatomical variation. Moreover, recent studies suggest an important role for physical activity in brain evolution. We used a unique and ongoing artificial selection model in which mice are bred for high voluntary wheel-running behavior, yielding four replicate lines of High Runner (HR) mice that run similar to 3-fold more revolutions per day than four replicate non-selected Control (C) lines. Previous studies reported that, with body mass as a covariate, HR mice had heavier whole brains, non-cerebellar brains, and larger midbrains than C mice. We sampled mice from generation 66 and used high-resolution microscopy to test the hypothesis that HR mice have greater volumes and/or cell densities in nine key regions from either the midbrain or limbic system. In addition, half of the mice were given 10 weeks of wheel access from weaning, and we predicted that chronic exercise would increase the volumes of the examined brain regions via phenotypic plasticity. We replicated findings that both selective breeding and wheel access increased total brain mass, with no significant interaction between the two factors. In HR compared to C mice, adjusting for body mass, both the red nucleus (RN) of the midbrain and the hippocampus (HPC) were significantly larger, and the whole midbrain (WM) tended to be larger, with no effect of wheel access nor any interactions. Linetype and wheel access had an interactive effect on the volume of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), such that wheel access increased PAG volume in C mice but decreased volume in HR mice. Neither linetype nor wheel access affected volumes of the substantia nigra (SN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral pallidum (VP) or basolateral amygdala (BLA). We found no main effect of either linetype or wheel access on neuronal densities (numbers of cells per unit area) for any of the regions examined. Taken together, our results suggest that the increased exercise phenotype of HR mice is related to increased red nucleus and hippocampal volumes, but that chronic exercise alone does not produce such phenotypes.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (igfbp7) is a member of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) superfamily, which is involved in the regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and insulin signal transduction. Recently, igfbp7 was found to be female-biased expressed in the gonad of Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), a marine flatfish exhibited female-biased sexual dimorphism. This study aimed to explore the roles of igfbp7 in the growth and sex differentiation of C. semilaevis. Firstly, C. semilaevis igfbp7 was cloned, and the coding sequence (CDS) was 666 bp encoding 221 amino acids. The phylogenetic and structural analyses revealed that C. semilaevis igfbp7 was clustered with Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossu shippoglossus), sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna), and so on. The subsequent temporal and spatial expression analyses showed that igfbp7 was mainly expressed in female gonad. During the different gonad developmental stages, the expression of igfbp7 displayed the highest level at 6-month. Methylome data showed that female igfbp7 exhibited lower methylation levels than male and pseudomale across the whole gene region in the gonad. Dual-luciferase experiment revealed that C. semilaevis igfbp7 promoter exhibited strong transcription activity. In addition, pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1 (POU1F1) and steroid hormone-testosterone significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of the igfbp7 promoter. In vitro transfection experiment revealed the activation of igfbp7 on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway. Finally, the activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf1r), serine/threonine kinase 1 (akt) and heat shock 60 protein 1 (hspd1) was observed in C. semilaevis ovary cells transfected by igfbp7 small interfering RNA (siRNA). These results provided causal clues for igfbp7 in growth regulation by influencing igf1r, akt and NF-kappa B signal.

AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Colpodella sp. in domestic and wild animals in Cyprus. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to report the detection of Colpodella sp. in foxes (Cyprus red fox Vulpes vulpes indutus), wild birds (Eurasian coot Fulica atra, duck Anas spp.) and goats (Capra hircus) worldwide.MethodsA total of 180 faecal samples (29 foxes, 48 Eurasian coot, 20 Eurasian teal Anas crecca, 7 duck, 44 goats - 10 from a farm and 34 free-living individuals - and 32 sheep Ovis aries) were analyzed for the parasite by nested PCR and sequencing.ResultsFour samples were positive (4/180 = 2.2%), including one goat from a farm (1/10 = 10%), one fox (1/29 = 3.4%), one Eurasian coot (1/48 = 2.1%) and one duck (1/7 = 14.3%).ConclusionThe results of this study support the evidence that Colpodella sp. can infect mammals and birds, as well as livestock and wildlife, which could act as zoonotic reservoirs of the parasite and potentially pose a risk to human and animal health.

AB  - Sustainability in animal breeding can be understood as continuous availability of breeding animals and their germinal products for commercial production, that now and in the future, meet the requirements of a broad range of stakeholders: breeders, farmers, livestock keepers, producers, consumers and others, while respecting animal welfare and promoting more sustainable agriculture. Breeding goals are established to contribute to fulfilling various aspects of sustainability: quality, diversity, acceptability, environment and economics. Government policies and strategies have major impacts on animal breeding; they provide the basis for establishing the legal landscape for national priorities for livestock sector development and provide for institutional arrangements and control measures. Implementation of international agreements supports policy development for sustainability in animal breeding and production. The Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources was prepared to directly contribute to sustainable management of livestock calling for improved characterization, monitoring, breeding and conservation. The Convention on Biological Diversity calls for the conservation of genetic diversity, including agricultural genetic resources. Animal breeding and strategies for livestock development require long-term policy perspectives, as poor decisions can have lasting detrimental effects. This paper is intended to highlight the importance of policy development in efforts to achieve sustainability in the livestock sector.

AB  - miR-129 plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including adipogenesis; however, its downstream molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-129 promotes yak adipogenesis in vitro via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Overexpression and interference of miR-129 in yak intramuscular preadipocytes (YIMAs) enhanced and inhibited cell differentiation, respectively, with corresponding changes in cell proliferation. Further investigation revealed that miR-129 enhances AKT and p-AKT activity in the AKT pathway without affecting cell apoptosis, and a specific inhibitor (LY294002) was used to confirm that miR-129 regulates YIMAs proliferation and differentiation through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our findings suggest that miR-129 promotes yak adipogenesis by enhancing PI3K/AKT pathway activity. This study provides the foundation to precisely elucidate the molecular mechanism of miR-129 in YIMAs adipogenesis and develop advanced miRNA-based strategies to improve meat nutrition and obesity-related ailments in beef production.

AB  - The coevolution of plants and their insect herbivores reflects eco-evolutionary dynamics at work - ecological interactions influence adaptive traits, which feed back to shape the broader ecological community. However, novel anthropogenic stressors like herbicide, which are strong selective agents, can disrupt these dynamics. Little is known about how the evolution of herbicide resistance may impact plant-herbivore interactions. We performed a common garden field experiment using Ipomoea purpurea (common morning glory) and the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) to investigate the ecological effects of herbicide exposure on insect herbivory patterns and assess the potential evolutionary consequences. We find that plants treated with glyphosate experienced higher levels of herbivory and altered chewing herbivory damage patterns. Additionally, we found that glyphosate resistance is positively associated with herbivory resistance, and uncovered positive selection for increased glyphosate resistance, suggesting that selection for increased glyphosate resistance has the potential to lead to increased herbivory resistance. Positive selection for glyphosate resistance, coupled with the detection of genetic variation for this trait, suggests there is potential for glyphosate resistance - and herbivory resistance via hitchhiking - to further evolve. Our results show that herbicides cannot just influence, but potentially drive the eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Excessive heat and humidity causes reduction in appetite of postpartum buffaloes which directly leads negative energy balance (NEBAL) and increases oxidative stress in animals. Betaine is a growth promoting nutritional additive used in livestock. Betaine contains three methyl groups and thus acts as a methyl donor for metabolic reactions. Betaine acts as molecular chaperone, as it repairs heat shock proteins. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of dietary betaine on heat and metabolic stress during lactation in Murrah buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). For this purpose, a total of 18 postpartum Murrah buffaloes were randomly divided into control, low betaine and high betaine groups supplemented with betaine @ 50 g/ animal/day and 100 g/animal/day respectively from day 5 postpartum and was continued up to 4 months postpartum. 5ml of blood sample was collected from animal for analysis of superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, HSP70, albumin/globulin ratio and immunoglobin G. The overall mean values of plasma superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity and immunoglobin G of high betaine group was numerically higher than other groups which differed (p<0.05) significantly between groups. The overall mean value of plasma HSP70 of high betaine group was minimum followed by low betaine group and control group had maximum mean value which differed (p<0.05) significantly between groups. The overall mean values of albumin/globulin ratio of control group were higher than the betaine groups which differed (p<0.05) significantly between groups.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the characteristics of night soil/horse manure with leaf co-composting using aerobic static composting method. Two influencing factors, including composting materials and aeration pattern, were investigated by determining the change in the principal physicochemical properties, i.e. temperature, volatile solid, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, heavy metals, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and germination index (GI). The mixture of horse manure and leaf can achieve high composting temperature, long retention time of high temperature (55 degrees C), fast organic matter degradation, and high GI under the same aeration pattern. Under the same composting materials, the intermittent aeration pattern during composting was superior to the continuous aeration pattern because the former promoted the composting process.

AB  - Simple Summary: The current study was conducted to predict the live body weight using body length, heart girth, rump height and withers height of 173 Savanna goats from a stud breeder at Bysteel, Polokwane municipality, South Africa. A multivariate adaptive regression splines algorithm was used, along with the different proportions of the test and training sets to predict body weight. The body weight was best predicted from the training dataset with body weight influenced by withers height and heart girth, respectively. The interaction of withers height and body length with withers height and heart girth also influenced body weight. In conclusion, it could be suggested that the multivariate adaptive regression splines algorithm might allow Savanna goat breeders to find the best population and examine the body measurements affecting body weight as indirect selection criteria for describing the breed description of Savanna goats and aiding sustainable meat production.
   The Savanna goat breed is an indigenous goat breed in South Africa that is reared for meat production. Live body weight is an important tool for livestock management, selection and feeding. The use of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to predict the live body weight of Savanna goats remains poorly understood. The study was conducted to investigate the influence of linear body measurements on the body weight of Savanna goats using MARS. In total, 173 Savanna goats between the ages of two and five years were used to collect body weight (BW), body length (BL), heart girth (HG), rump height (RH) and withers height (WH). MARS was used as a data mining algorithm for data analysis. The best predictive model was achieved from the training dataset with the highest coefficient of determination and Pearson's correlation coefficient (0.959 and 0.961), respectively. BW was influenced positively when WH > 63 cm and HG >100 cm with a coefficient of 0.51 and 2.71, respectively. The interaction of WH > 63 cm and BL < 75 cm, WH < 68 cm and HG < 100 cm with a coefficient of 0.28 and 0.02 had a positive influence on Savanna goat BW, while male goats had a negative influence (-4.57). The findings of the study suggest that MARS can be used to estimate the BW in Savanna goats. This finding will be helpful to farmers in the selection of breeding stock and precision in the day-to-day activities such as feeding, marketing and veterinary services.

AB  - This theoretical research study proposes a novel hybrid algorithm that integrates an improved quasi-dynamical oppositional learning mutation scheme into the Mountain Gazelle Optimization method, augmented with chaotic sequences, for the thermal and economical design of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger operating with nanofluids. The Mountain Gazelle Optimizer is a recently developed metaheuristic algorithm that simulates the foraging behaviors of Mountain Gazelles. However, it suffers from premature convergence due to an imbalance between its exploration and exploitation mechanisms. A two-step improvement procedure is implemented to enhance the overall search efficiency of the original algorithm. The first step concerns substituting uniformly random numbers with chaotic numbers to refine the solution quality to better standards. The second step is to develop a novel manipulation equation that integrates different variants of quasi-dynamic oppositional learning search schemes, guided by a novel intelligently devised adaptive switch mechanism. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the challenging benchmark functions from various CEC competitions. Finally, the thermo-economic design of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger operated with different nanoparticles is solved by the proposed improved metaheuristic algorithm to obtain the optimal design configuration. The predictive results indicate that using water + SiO2 instead of ordinary water as the refrigerant on the tube side of the heat exchanger reduces the total cost by 16.3%, offering the most cost-effective design among the configurations compared. These findings align with the demonstration of how biologically inspired metaheuristic algorithms can be successfully applied to engineering design.

AB  - Mangroves are naturally stressful habitats, with high salinity, regular flooding, strong winds, high temperatures, and muddy, hypoxic soils, requiring adaptations in plant anatomy. In this sense, we present a description of the leaf anatomy of Acrostichum aureum, a remarkable fern species growing in mangroves, focusing on novelties and the significance of the traits for adaptation to mangrove conditions. The leaves were amphistomatic with anomocytic stomata at the same level as the other epidemic cells, and there was a uniseriate hypodermis on both surfaces of the lamina. A dense spongy parenchyma was present in the lamina with limited number of intercellular spaces. We observed sclerenchyma fibers in the costae (3?5 layers) immediately below the epidermis and surrounding the vascular bundles, which were amphicrival (1) and bicollateral (4) in the costae, and collateral and bicollateral in the mesophyll (4?6). In the costae, the endodermis was uniseriate with Casparian strip. The pericycle was interrupted, uniseriate, with varied cell sizes, indicating activity. Idioblasts containing isolated calcium oxalate crystals with a prismatic shape occurred in the epidermis, hypodermis, and sclerenchyma. Some anatomical traits of A. aureum are similar to those reported to angiosperms in mangroves, such as the presence of a thick cuticle, amphistomaty, hypodermis, CaOx crystals, and intercellular spaces, indicative of ecological convergence. These traits are potentially involved in promoting resistance to water loss, enhanced photosynthesis, avoidance of photoinhibition, mechanical resistance, resistance to herbivory, homeostasis, and detoxification.

AB  - 1. Dietary studies in birds of prey involve direct observation and examination of food remains at resting and nesting sites. Although these methods accurately identify diet in raptors, they are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and associated with biases from the feeding ecology of raptors like Gyps vultures. Our study set out to estimate diet composition in Gyps vultures informed by stable isotopes that provide a good representation of assimilated diet from local systems.
   2. We hypothesized that differences in Gyps vulture diet composition is a function of sampling location and that these vultures move between Serengeti National Park and Selous Game Reserve to forage. We also theorized that grazing ungulates are the principal items in Gyps vulture diet.
   3. Through combined linear and Bayesian modeling, diet derived from delta C-13 in Gyps vultures consisted of grazing herbivores across sites, with those in Serengeti National Park consuming higher proportions of grazing herbivores (>87%). 6 13 C differences in vulture feather subsets did not indicate shifts in vulture diet and combined with blood delta C-13, vultures fed largely on grazers for similar to 159 days before they were sampled. Similarly, delta N-15 values indicated Gyps vultures fed largely on herbivores. delta(34)5 ratios separated where vultures fed when the two sites were compared. delta(34)5 variation in vultures across sites resulted from baseline differences in plant delta S-34 values, though it is not possible to match delta(34)5 to specific locations.
   4. Our findings highlight the relevance of repeated sampling that considers tissues with varying isotopic turnover and emerging Bayesian techniques for dietary studies using stable isotopes. Findings also suggested limited vulture movement between the two local systems. However, more sampling coupled with environmental data is required to fully comprehend this observation and its implications to Gyps vulture ecology and conservation.

AB  - Glandular trichomes are traditionally regarded as a defence against insect herbivores in plants. A comprehensive examination of their occurrence across an entire flora is essential for understanding how plant-herbivore interactions influence species abundance, traits, and diversity. In this study, we gathered data on the presence of glandular trichomes in a diverse flora comprising 7751 angiosperm species from the Hengduan Mountains region in southwestern China, testing the effects of plant organ, life form, leaf habit, phylogenetic position, and geographical element on the occurrence of glandular trichomes. Our results showed that 1021 species (13.2%) in the studied flora possessed glandular trichomes. Reproductive organs (88.0%) displayed a significantly higher occurrence of glandular trichomes compared to vegetative organs (59.1%). Within flowers, the calyx (81.1%) was the most defended, followed by the corolla (17.4%), and the gynoecium (12.5%). The androecium (1.8%) was the flower component least associated with glandular trichomes. Herbaceous species (14.0%) were more likely to have glandular trichomes than woody species (11.6%). For woody plants, leaf habit (deciduous/evergreen) had no significant effect on the presence of glandular trichomes on leaf blades, but had a significant effect on the occurrence of glandular trichomes on reproductive organs, with deciduous woody species (11.0%) displaying a higher prevalence compared to evergreen woody species (8.3%). Interestingly, the proportion of species with glandular trichomes was notably lower in the tropical elements (6.8%) compared to both temperate and cosmopolitan elements (15.3% and 15.6%, respectively). Our findings suggest that in the Hengduan Mountains region, the evolution of glandular trichomes exhibits distinct patterns among various life forms, plant organs, leaf habits, and geographical elements, while showing limited influence from phylogenetic relatedness, highlighting the remarkable evolutionary adaptability of this defensive plant trait.

AB  - The sika deer (Cervus nippon) is listed as a Class I National Key protected wild animal and is an endemic species in the East Asian monsoon region. Although the species as a whole is thriving, it is endangered and locally extinct in many areas of China, and the South China sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi) is one of three subspecies left in China. Diet analysis is one of the core contents in studying animal habitat requirements, and a study of their diet could provide valuable reference for species conservation and management. The metabarcoding trnL regions of the chloroplast genome from 30 fecal samples of Taohongling sika deer were amplified with universal primers and sequenced by high-throughput. We found that 28 out of 30 valid samples had a total of 677,856 valid amplified sequences with an average valid sequence of 24,209.14 +/- 323.83. A total of 326 OTUs were obtained from 28 valid samples, and the MP, SS, and NJS groups shared 222 OTUs, accounting for 68.09% of the total OTUs. OTUs alignment indicated that the forage plants of sika deer belong to 82 families, and 110 genera. An alpha diversity analysis showed that there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). The NMDS analysis found considerable overlap at the three sampling sites, and the niche breadths of SS (Fir forests), MP (The nursery base), and NJS (Nie Jiashan) were 9.593, 9.426, and 9.419, respectively. High-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding trnL could provide higher taxonomic resolution, identify more food items, and can simultaneously analyze a larger number of samples compared with traditional diet methods. This study assembled basic summer diet data and provided an important accumulation for the protection and monitoring of Taohongling sika deers, which also provides reference for the establishment of local database in the future.

AB  - Biochar is a promising alternative to agricultural productivity and climate change mitigation. However, quantitative data are needed to better understand the productivity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural fields amended with biochar. To assess the impacts of the four biochars on soil properties, forage productivity, and GHG emissions, a 1-year field experiment was conducted in a Humic Haploxerands (Andisol). Three manure-derived biochars and one wood residue biochar (all pyrolyzed at 550 degrees C) were applied at rates of 1% (equivalent to 11 t ha(-1)) in two parallel and independent experiments. The changes in (i) soil chemical properties and yield of Sorghum sudangrass (S. bicolorxS. bicolor var. Sudanese) and (ii) soil CO2 and N2O emissions were monitored. Two controls, with and without NPK, were included. The added amendments produced from residues of poultry and pig systems increased soil pH by 0.73 and 0.19 units, respectively. Increased sorghumyield were associated with fertilizer and the liming potential of the added biochar. Soil total carbon (TC) increased with the addition of different biochars, especially during the wood biochar treatment. Biochar application, regardless of the feedstock, had no significant impact on the cumulative soil CO2 emitted after a year. Soil N2O fluxes decreased (23%-50%) in treatments containing biochars with low mineral N contents and high C stability (i.e., low H:OC and Cox:TC ratios). NPK treatment resulted in the highest N2O emissions. Wood residue-derived biochar has a great potential in mitigating climate change, reducing soil N2O emissions, and promoting soil C storage. Manure-derived biochars could be instrumental in circular economy livestock systems, where pyrolyzed animal manure can satisfy the demand for nutrients and/or liming of Andisols under sustainable forage models.

AB  - Maedi-Visna-like genotype A strains and Caprine arthritis encephaltis-like genotype B strains are small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) which, for incompletely understood reasons, appear to be more virulent in sheep and goats, respectively. A 9-month in vivo infection experiment using Belgian genotype A and B SRLV strains showed that almost all homologous (genotype A in sheep; genotype B in goats) and heterologous (genotype A in goats; genotype B in sheep) intratracheal inoculations resulted in productive infection. No differences in viremia and time to seroconversion were observed between homologous and heterologous infections. Higher viral loads and more severe lesions in the mammary gland and lung were however detected at 9 months post homologous compared to heterologous infection which coincided with strongly increased IFN-gamma mRNA expression levels upon homologous infection. Pepscan analysis revealed a strong antibody response against immune-dominant regions of the capsid and surface proteins upon homologous infection, which was absent after heterologous infection. These results inversely correlated with protection against virus replication in target organs and observed histopathological lesions, and thus require an in-depth evaluation of a potential role of antibody dependent enhancement in SRLV infection. Finally, no horizontal intra- and cross-species SRLV transmission to contact animals was detected.

AB  - The contagious prion disease "chronic wasting disease" (CWD) infects mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and related species. Unchecked epidemics raise ecological, socioeconomic, and public health concerns. Prion infection shortens a deer's lifespan, and when prevalence (proportion of adults infected) becomes sufficiently high CWD can affect herd dynamics. Understanding population responses over time is key to forecasting long-term impacts. Here we describe unexpected stability in prevalence and abundance in a mule deer herd where CWD has been left unmanaged. High apparent prevalence (similar to 30%) since at least 2005 likely drove observed changes in the proportion and age distribution of wild-type native prion protein (PRNP) gene homozygotes among deer sampled. Predation by mountain lions (Puma concolor) may be helping keep CWD in check. Despite stable appearances, prion disease nonetheless impairs adult survival and likely resilience in this deer herd, limiting its potential for growth despite refuge from hunter harvest and favorable habitat and winter conditions.

AB  - The fossil record of condors in South America is relatively extensive. However, fossil specimens from the late Pleistocene of Argentina are still very scarce. Here, we describe fragmentary remains of a large sized cathartid of the condor lineage. The new specimen is represented by an incomplete ulna, radius and metacarpal belonging to the Lujanian (Late Pleistocene) of San Pedro locality, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Its large size (it is among the largest cathartids reported up to the date) and some anatomical details indicate that it belongs to a previously unrecognised taxon. The new specimen reinforces previous proposals indicating a high diversification of condors at South American lowlands, and indicates that the Pleistocene history of the clade is far from being satisfactorily known. The extinction of giant scavenger birds in South America may be not only related to the extinction of their food resources (i.e., megafauna) but also to ecological constraints that characterise large-sized birds.

AB  - Consumer-resource interactions between trophic levels are ubiquitous and important factors in shaping the diversity of insects. However, dietary patterns such as host specificity and conservatism have been insufficiently examined in fungivorous insects. Here we reconstructed the evolutionary history of host use in fungivorous ciid beetles (Coleoptera: Ciidae) and tested for host conservatism. Phylogenetic relationships among 49 species from Japan were inferred by using a large sequence data set from ultraconserved elements (UCEs). In addition, sequences of three genes (COI, 28S rRNA, 18S rRNA) were analyzed to reconstruct the phylogeny for 130 OTUs from a broader range of taxa and geographic regions using the UCE tree as a backbone topology. We found that Ciini and Orophiini are not recovered as reciprocally monophyletic groups. As previously suggested, the largest genus Cis Latreille was also not monophyletic. Ancestral-state reconstruction of host use in both datasets showed that Ciidae species were clustered by host-use group across the tree. This pattern was confirmed by the significantly lower transition rate compared with expectations under the random shift hypothesis. The observed conservatism in host use implied these beetles possess unique adaptations to specific fungal taxa, just as herbivorous insects are adapted to specific plant taxa.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of cornstalk, bagasse, and spent mushroom substrate (SMS) as auxiliary materials on the nitrogen cycling and humification during the aerobic composting of high-solids anaerobically digested residues using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing and PICRUSt2 functional prediction. Results showed that cornstalk and SMS accelerated compost warming and upregulated the expression of nitrogen-cycling-related genes (e.g. ureC, narH, and narG), thereby significantly reducing (P < 0.05) N2O and NH3 emissions and increasing the NO3--N content in the compost. Furthermore, cornstalk enriched the microbial diversity and abundance of key bacteria involved in degradation and humification (e.g. Sphingobacterium and Moheibacter), which increased the humic acid content (HA) (78.4 g/kg DM). Although bagasse promoted aerobic conditions, it had less effect on nitrogen cycling and humification. The study highlights the intricate relationship between nitrogen metabolism and humification, demonstrating how selection of auxiliary materials can optimize composting for environmental sustainability.

AB  - Wildlife agencies are becoming increasingly interested in adopting internet-based hunter harvest surveys to inform hunting regulations, though the efficacy of these surveys relative to their costs amidst technological advancements is uncertain. Our simulation of various survey methods builds off previous efforts to include cost analyses for both internet and phone-based approaches based on big game harvest surveys conducted by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. We discovered that a follow-up survey, conducted following either a simple random sample or a census, effectively minimized nonresponse bias. We recommend combining internet collection with these survey strategies for surveying larger hunter populations of 50,000 or greater. This study improves our understanding of trade-offs within accuracy and cost of internet-based big game harvest surveys compared to phone survey methods, providing insights for their use in wildlife management.

AB  - Drones have become increasingly popular tools to study marine megafauna but are underutilized in batoid research. We used drones to collect video data of manta ray (Mobula cf. birostris) swimming and assessed behavior-specific kinematics in Kinovea, a semi-automated point-tracking software. We describe a 'resting' behavior of mantas making use of strong currents in man-made inlets in addition to known 'traveling' and 'feeding' behaviors. No significant differences were found between the swimming speed of traveling and feeding behaviors, although feeding mantas had a significantly higher wingbeat frequency than traveling mantas. Resting mantas swam at a significantly slower speed and wingbeat frequency, suggesting that they were continuously swimming with the minimum effort required to maintain position and buoyancy. Swimming speed and wingbeat frequency of traveling and feeding behaviors overlapped, which could point to other factors such as prey availability and a transitional behavior, influencing how manta rays swim. These baseline swimming kinematic data have valuable applications to other emerging technologies in manta ray research.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are regarded as an indirect plant defense against herbivores, since they attract natural enemies to infested plants. On the other hand, HIPVs also affect behavioral responses of herbivores. In a previous study, Lytopylus rufipes, a parasitoid of the oriental fruit moth (Grapholita molesta), showed positive responses to pear HIPVs, but the influence of pear HIPVs on G. molesta is still unclear. To better understand these responses, we first tested oviposition preferences of G. molesta to uninfested and infested pear shoots (US and IS, respectively) and uninfested mature leaves (ML) in dual-choice bioassays using a cylindrical tube. Then, preferences to volatile components were also assessed. G. molesta females preferred US-, IS-, and ML-treated areas compared to the control area (no leaves), respectively. Subsequently, G. molesta females preferred IS over US, and US more than ML in bioassays. Furthermore, G. molesta females did not show any significant preference for individual volatile components, but more eggs were laid in an area treated with a synthetic pear HIPV blend, compared to the hexane-treated area (control). These results indicate that G. molesta females do not avoid infested pear shoots nor HIPVs. Moreover, HIPVs may recruit not only natural enemies, but also G. molesta females to the release point of HIPVs. Thus, it is important to examine responses of G. molesta females to HIPVs in the field before employing them for pest management.

AB  - Moths are a hyperdiverse taxon and contribute to important ecosystem services, including herbivory, pollination, and as food for other animals. Artificial light is an effective means by which to attract nocturnal moths for ecological study, but many traditional light-trapping approaches require the use of heavy, lead acid batteries, whereas novel light-emitting diodes (LEDs) use much lighter and energy-efficient lithium-ion batteries. Employing replicated forest stands being used for a longer-term study on the effects of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) application, we assessed how traps fitted with either black-light fluorescent (BLF) or LED lights differed in the moth assemblages they attracted. The macromoth assemblages captured by the two light sources differed significantly in their composition, with some species almost exclusively collected by a particular light type. We collected significantly more moths in the BLF traps overall. However, we found a higher diversity of species using the LED light traps but only in the Btk-treated sites. We show that, although these lights appear to attract significantly different species assemblages, LEDs represent an effective, efficient, and environmentally safer approach for attracting macromoths. More empirical studies will help elucidate which species are most attracted to various light sources and if broader phylogenetic patterns exist.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study on Lygus lineolaris, an omnivorous insect pest threatening agriculture in the Neartic region, explores how different diets affect its performance in terms of survivorship, developmental time, and adult weight and length. The results highlight the significant impact of diet source, feeding regime, and the number of diet items on its performance. Observed benefits include higher survival rates, faster development, and larger and heavier adults. Feeding on strawberry results in low insect fitness, while canola-rich diets notably improve it. Furthermore, introducing multiple diet items in phytozoophagous regimes enhances overall performance. Recognizing L. lineolaris' nutritional needs is vital for effective pest management strategies and provides valuable insights for developing biological control programs against this agricultural threat. Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) (Hemiptera: Miridae), a true omnivorous insect, poses a significant threat to agriculture in the Neartic region. Understanding the feeding behavior of L. lineolaris is crucial for developing integrated pest management strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different diets on the fitness of L. lineolaris, with a focus on the diet source, feeding regime (phytophagy, zoophagy, and phytozoophagy), and number of diet items. The experimental design in the laboratory investigated the impacts of strawberry, canola and buckwheat flowers, as well as spider mites and aphids to explore relationships found in a conventional strawberry field. Results reveal that diet source, feeding regime, and the number of diet items influence L. lineolaris performance (i.e., survivorship rate, developmental time, and adult weight and length). Improvements in fitness are indicated by higher nymphal survival, shorter developmental time, and larger adults. Immature stages of L. lineolaris show improved fitness when provided with diets rich in canola compared to strawberry flowers and spider mites. Furthermore, the inclusion of multiple diet items in phytozoophagous regimes enhances insect performance. The findings emphasize the significance of understanding L. lineolaris' nutritional requirements and the biodiversity of target ecosystems for modeling energy flows and designing effective IPM strategies against this pest. This research contributes to the knowledge base for biological control programs targeting L. lineolaris in agricultural systems.

AB  - Simple Summary Our study aimed to assess how Tuta absoluta affects different Solanaceae plant species. It was observed that susceptible plants experience diminished growth and reproduction rates, which may be a result of a physiological malfunction. Infestation by T. absoluta caused 100% crop loss to tomato plants, whereas significant yield reduction was observed for potato plants, and no significant feeding effect was observed for eggplant. The affected plants also experienced physiological impairments. This study is essential in that it demonstrates the differential risk of T. absoluta infestations on the production of the tested Solanaceae plant species. Tuta absoluta (Meyrick, 1917) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is a destructive insect pest toward crops and belongs to the Solanaceae family. Since it was first recorded in South Africa in 2016, the pest has spread extensively and caused tremendous damage to field and tunnel-grown tomato crops. This study aimed to investigate how T. absoluta affects the growth and physiology of three Solanaceae plant species: tomato, potato, and eggplant. These three crops were infested with L1 instar larvae, and their growth and physiology were assessed during insect feeding. The damage to the infested tomato host plant was severe, with T. absoluta destroying 100% of the plants. The tomato plants were distorted 15 days after infestation, that is, before the fruit set. For potato, the defoliation was moderate, but the infested plants produced fewer tubers compared to the uninfested host plants. Eggplant had fewer visible signs of feeding, resulting in no significant difference between the infested and uninfested host plants in terms of growth and physiological functions. Infested tomato and potato plants had stagnant growth, fewer and damaged leaves, a reduced chlorophyll content, a reduced photosynthesis rate, a poor transpiration rate, poor water conductance, and poor intercellular carbon dioxide concentrations. This study closes the knowledge gap on the morphological (growth) and physiological responses of different Solanaceae species to T. absoluta infestation, and it also demonstrates the differential risk of T. absoluta infestations in the production of tomato, potato, and eggplant.

AB  - Large body size, the defining characteristic of "charismatic megafauna," is often viewed as the most significant correlate of higher public interest in species. However, common, local species (many of which are not large) can also generate public interest. We explored the relative importance of body size versus local occurrence in patterns of online interest in birds using a large sample of digital human-wildlife interactions (367 million Wikipedia pageviews) that included more than 10,000 bird species and a range of cultural and geographic contexts (represented by 25 Wikipedia language editions). We compared interest in Wikipedia, as measured by pageviews, with a bird's body size and its regional observation frequency (using data from ). We found that local species (i.e., those that occur in the wild in the country responsible for the majority of a Wikipedia language edition's pageviews) attract more pageviews than global species. Both body size and observation frequency had a positive correlation with Wikipedia pageviews across languages, but eBird observation frequency explained more of the variance in pageviews on average. In a model that included both observation frequency and body size, observation frequency was a significantly better predictor of pageviews than body size in 24 of 25 languages. Our results demonstrate that the opportunity to encounter birds in the wild is a significant correlate of increased online interest in birds across multiple linguistic and geographic contexts. This relationship provides insight into why some species attract greater interest than others and emphasizes the overlooked potential of common species in conservation marketing.

AB  - Bycatch is the most significant threat to marine megafauna (sea turtles, marine mammals, elasmobranchs, seabirds) worldwide, and the leading cause of the decline of several cetacean species. The bycatch issue in the Indian Ocean is poorly understood, but high bycatch levels in gillnet fisheries have been documented for the past two decades, in both small-scale and semi-industrial fisheries. Unfortunately, methods to reduce bycatch are often unavailable, financially non-viable or socially unacceptable to fishermen. Using a network of trained boat captains in the tuna drift gillnet fishery in the Arabian Sea, targeted catch and bycatch data were collected from 2013 to 2017 off the coast of Pakistan (northern Indian Ocean). Two fishing methods using multifilament gillnets were used: surface deployment and subsurface deployment (i.e. headline of net set below 2 m depth). Predicted catch rates for targeted species did not differ significantly between the two fishing practices, although a drop in tuna (6.2%) and tuna-like (10.9%) species captures was recorded in subsurface sets. The probability of cetacean bycatch, however, was 78.5% lower in subsurface than in surface sets. Cetacean bycatch in tuna drift gillnet fisheries has the potential to be significantly reduced at a relatively low cost for fishers. However, further research with an appropriate sampling design and a large sample size is required to confirm the efficacy of the proposed mitigation method. The acceptability and adoption of subsurface setting by fishers also needs to be further investigated. Despite some limitations, this preliminary study also highlights the importance of crew-based observer data as an alternative source of data when observers cannot be deployed on fishing vessels.

AB  - Plants and their insect herbivores have been a dominant component of the terrestrial ecological landscape for the past 410 million years and feature intricate evolutionary patterns and co-dependencies. A complex systems perspective allows for both detailed resolution of these evolutionary relationships as well as comparison and synthesis across systems. Using proxy data of insect herbivore damage (denoted by the damage type or DT) preserved on fossil leaves, functional bipartite network representations provide insights into how plant-insect associations depend on geological time, paleogeographical space, and environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation. However, the metrics measured from such networks are prone to sampling bias. Such sensitivity is of special concern for plant-DT association networks in paleontological settings where sampling effort is often severely limited. Here, we explore the sensitivity of functional bipartite network metrics to sampling intensity and identify sampling thresholds above which metrics appear robust to sampling effort. Across a broad range of sampling efforts, we find network metrics to be less affected by sampling bias and/or sample size than richness metrics, which are routinely used in studies of fossil plant-DT interactions. These results provide reassurance that cross-comparisons of plant-DT networks offer insights into network structure and function and support their widespread use in paleoecology. Moreover, these findings suggest novel opportunities for using plant-DT networks in neontological terrestrial ecology to understand functional aspects of insect herbivory across geological time, environmental perturbations, and geographic space.

AB  - Floods are arguably the most impactful of natural hazards. The increasing magnitude of their effects on the environment, human life, and economic activities calls for improved management of water resources. Flood susceptibility modeling has been used around the world to reduce the damage caused by flooding, although the extrapolation problem still presents a significant challenge. This study develops a machine learning (ML) model utilizing deep neural network (DNN) and optimization algorithms, namely earthworm optimization algorithm (EOA), wildebeest herd optimization (WHO), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), satin bowerbird optimizer (SBO), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), to solve the extrapolation problem in the construction of flood susceptibility models. Quang Nam Province was chosen as a case study as it is subject to the significant impact of intense flooding, and Nghe An Province was selected as the region for extrapolation of the flood susceptibility model. Root mean square error (RMSE), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), the area under the ROC curve (AUC), and accuracy (ACC) were applied to assess and compare the fit of each of the models. The results indicated that the models in this study are a good fit in establishing flood susceptibility maps, all with AUC > 0.9. The deep neural network (DNN)-BBO model enjoyed the best results (AUC = 0.99), followed by DNN-WHO (AUC = 0.99), DNN-SBO (AUC = 0.98), DNN-EOA (AUC = 0.96), DNN-GOA (AUC = 0.95), and finally, DNN-PSO (AUC = 0.92). In addition, the models successfully solved the extrapolation problem. These new models can modify their behavior to evaluate flood susceptibility in different regions of the world. The models in this study distribute a first point of reference for debate on the solution to the extrapolation problem, which can support urban planners and other decision-makers in other coastal regions in Vietnam and other countries.

AB  - Background Mothers physiologically buffer key milk nutrient content against nutritional stress. How this is nested in upstream behavioral buffering is not well understood. Objectives The study explored whether pastoralists and agropastoralists' economic or other behavioral coping strategies against droughts, such as livestock sales and child fosterage, influence maternal risk for malnutrition or milk nutrient content. Methods Using data from 221 breastfeeding mothers in drought-stricken northern Kenya, we estimated generalized structural equation models to evaluate pathways linking behavioral coping variables to maternal malnutrition-underweight, vitamin A deficiency (VAD), and folate deficiency (hyperhomocysteinemia)-and to milk energy, retinol, and folate content directly or mediated by maternal malnutrition. Predictors of interest included land size, proportion of cattle/goat herds sold, children fostered/adopted out, and children living at home. Akaike Information Criterion guided model fit assessment. Results Land size was positively associated with maternal underweight and VAD. Child fosterage and cattle sold were inversely associated with underweight, while child fosterage and goats/sheep sold were positively associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Children living at home were inversely associated with VAD, particularly with larger land size, and positively associated with milk retinol. Milk folate was positively associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Conclusions Behavioral buffering strategies, such as fostering out children, offer incomplete protection against maternal malnutrition. The lack of effects of investigated behavioral buffering strategies on milk variables suggests physiological buffering closes the gap left by incomplete behavioral buffering. Dual behavioral-physiological buffering facilitates the drought adaptability of agropastoralists, yet heavy reliance on physiological buffering for micronutrients suggests high maternal cost.

AB  - Little is known about the impact of ticks on livestock and humans in Cameroon. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, seasonal variation, and genetic diversity of hard ticks in the country. Ticks were collected during a cross-sectional survey on domestic livestock in two markets of Yaounde in 2019 and 2020 and identified using morphological keys, 16S ribosomal DNA, (16S rDNA), and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (Cox1) genes. The infestation rates were 39.18%, 11.53%, and 2.74% in cattle, sheep, and goats respectively. Three genera of ticks were identified, Rhipicephalus, Amblyomma, and Hyalomma comprising eleven tick species. The main species were Rhipicephalus decoloratus (30.25%), R. microplus (24.43%), and Amblyomma variegatum (12.96%). Rhipicephalus spp. (81.31%) and Amblyomma variegatum (51.54%) were abundant during the rainy season, while Hyalomma spp. (83.86%) during the dry season (p-value <0.00001). Cox1 and 16S rDNA analysis showed a high level of genetic diversity among tick species with sequences close to those observed across Africa. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that our R. microplus belong to clade A and we identified R. sanguineus s.l. as R. linnea. This study shows a high tick infestation rate in cattle, while low in small ruminants with an extensive diversity of tick species, including several known vectors of important tick-borne diseases.

AB  - Biological control reduces the need for potentially hazardous insecticides and enhances sustainability of pest management but gaps in understanding of natural enemy ecology constrains its uptake and impact. Whilst direct, lethal predatory and parasitic impacts on herbivores are well-documented, non-lethal, non-consumptive effects have received very much less attention and known mechanisms of operation are confined to physical effects such as disturbance. Here we show for the first time that natural enemy-derived volatiles exert manifold negative effects on aphid biology. Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a globally significant aphid pest for which the predatory ladybird Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and the parasitoid wasp Aphidius gifuensis Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) are potentially important biological control agents. In vitro, plant-free studies showed that aphids exposed to volatiles but without direct contact with these natural enemies exhibited impaired life history traits including longevity, weight gain and fecundity. Volatiles from H. axyridis larvae were especially potent and, in olfactometer studies, caused a strong repellent effect. In whole plant studies, aphid fecundity declined and development time extended markedly when placed on leaves previously occupied by natural enemies. These findings open a new avenue in the chemical ecology of natural enemy-herbivore interactions. By highlighting the potential of volatile-mediated effects to interfere with pests such as aphids, this study offers insights that could significantly improve pest management practices, making them more effective and sustainable.

AB  - Stamp programs are a financial mechanism that can provide funding from stakeholders for conservation efforts. Sufficient funding is foundational for the management of wildlife and natural resources, especially for infectious disease control for diseases like chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer. This study uses contingent valuation in a nationwide hunter survey to evaluate the potential for state-managed stamp programs to fund CWD prevention or management efforts. Results indicate that on average hunters are willing to pay between $11.45 and $21.93 for a voluntary CWD stamp. Willingness to pay varied by geographical location, CWD concern level, education, and participation in an archery season. Based on our analysis, stamp programs to fund CWD prevention or management may be a viable avenue for state conservation agencies to pursue.

AB  - High-quality green tea is produced from developing shoots (apical buds and young leaves) of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) grown under shaded conditions. However, the removal of shade covers causes shaded tea plants to experience a sudden exposure to high light (HL). Since in ordinary tea plantation new shoots are cropped immediately following shade removal, the remaining leaves emerging from the canopy are exposed to HL. In this study, we investigated the HL response of old leaves on shaded tea plants to evaluate possible deleterious effects of HL illumination after shade removal and shoot harvesting in two years (2017 and 2018). Old leaves of both shade-grown and unshaded tea plants suffered from temporal photoinhibition caused by HL exposure after shoot harvesting but were able to recover within two weeks. Moreover, chlorophyll a/b ratios remained unchanged in old leaves experiencing shading treatment, suggesting that old leaves have a weakened capacity to respond to low light conditions. Furthermore, protein carbonyl content was elevated 3-7 days after shade removal in summer 2018. Shoot growth during the subsequent autumn season was inhibited in shaded plants relative to the control group. Taken together these results indicate that old leaves on shaded tea plants suffer from oxidative damage after shade removal in summer, and this may inhibit the growth of autumn shoots.

AB  - Synopsis Studies of predator psychology in aposematism have suggested important effects of signal detection through space and time on outcomes of attack behavior. Both the integration of aposematic signals from prey and experience state of the predator can have important effects on attack decisions. The universality of these effects however, especially as it applies to non- avian predators such as arthropods, remains poorly understood. We examined the effects of multimodal aposematic signaling and prior experience with aposematism on attack latency and attack likelihood of the Carolina mantis ( Stagmomantis carolina). Using artificial prey bearing visual and olfactory signals of the convergent lady beetle ( Hippodamia convergens), we tested 2 cohorts of mantids (representing juvenile and adult stages) across 4 groups: visual only, odor only, combined signals, and control. We then used approaches in linear modeling to test the hypotheses that (1) prior experience with aposematism alters attack behavior toward aposematic prey and (2) multimodal signals have synergistic effects on attack behavior relative to either unisensory signal presented alone. We found support for the first hypothesis in that mantids employ attack biases against visual and olfactory aposematic signals, but only after prior exposure to aposematism and only as juveniles. While support is lacking for multimodal integration by the mantids, this study is the first to suggest a response of mantids to an aposematic olfactory signal (in addition to visual signal) and may suggest a developmental window for mantid predators to develop biases toward aposematic prey that are shaped by experience.

AB  - Wildlife managers and livestock owners can choose from a multitude of interventions to prevent carnivore attacks on domestic animals, ranging from light and sound deterrents to fencing and lethal control. To guide management and make the best and most cost-effective choice of interventions, knowledge about where and when these measures are needed the most is important. By identifying spatiotemporal patterns of carnivore attacks, resources can be used more efficiently to prevent such attacks. We used a Swedish nationwide, long-term data set to identify inter- and intra-seasonal variation in probability, number, and severity (number of killed or injured per attack) of large carnivore attacks on sheep. Our results show that there are specific "times of trouble", regarding the number of attacks from golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) in late spring, and from brown bears (Ursus arctos), lynx (Lynx lynx), and wolves (Canis lupus) in late summer. Additionally, for brown bears and wolves, the severity of attacks varied throughout the grazing season with a peak in the latter part of the summer. The results can be used for guidance of temporal prioritisation of preventive interventions to reduce the probability, number, and severity of large carnivore attacks on sheep.

AB  - The description and analysis of animal behavior over long periods of time is one of the most important challenges in ecology. However, most of these studies are limited due to the time and cost required by human observers. The collection of data via video recordings allows observation periods to be extended. However, their evaluation by human observers is very time-consuming. Progress in automated evaluation, using suitable deep learning methods, seems to be a forward-looking approach to analyze even large amounts of video data in an adequate time frame.
   In this study, we present a multistep convolutional neural network system for detecting three typical stances of African ungulates in zoo enclosures which works with high accuracy. An important aspect of our approach is the introduction of model averaging and postprocessing rules to make the system robust to outliers.
   Our trained system achieves an in-domain classification accuracy of >0.92, which is improved to >0.96 by a postprocessing step. In addition, the whole system performs even well in an out-of-domain classification task with two unknown types, achieving an average accuracy of 0.93. We provide our system at so that interested users can train their own models to classify images and conduct behavioral studies of wildlife.
   The use of a multistep convolutional neural network for fast and accurate classification of wildlife behavior facilitates the evaluation of large amounts of image data in ecological studies and reduces the effort of manual analysis of images to a high degree. Our system also shows that postprocessing rules are a suitable way to make species-specific adjustments and substantially increase the accuracy of the description of single behavioral phases (number, duration). The results in the out-of-domain classification strongly suggest that our system is robust and achieves a high degree of accuracy even for new species, so that other settings (e.g., field studies) can be considered.

AB  - The rise and spread of tropical grasslands was a signal event in the Cenozoic, causing many ungulates to evolve adaptations to a diet of graminoid tissues, or graminivory. In parallel, a lineage of monkeys (Theropithecus) is distinguished among primates for its large size and commitment to graminivory, a trait expressed by species throughout the Plio-Pleistocene fossil record and T. gelada, the sole surviving species today. An open question concerns the mechanics of how fossil species of Theropithecus handled graminoid tissues. They might have exhibited preference, selecting tissues within a given tuft, or they might have practiced indiscriminate bulkfeeding in a manner similar to large grazing ungulates. To differentiate between these handling behaviors, we used time- and graminivore-calibrated carbon stable isotope values to show progressive reliance on high-throughput bulk-feeding graminivory. Variation in this behavior explains a significant amount of variation in body mass through time, and we describe these covarying traits, which peaked during the Pleistocene, as evolutionary traps. To support this characterization, we report evidence of temporal increases in strontium isotope variability among North African theropiths, a result that suggests greater lifetime travel and energetic costs in response to diminishing food resources, a probable factor in the extinction of T. oswaldi, the largest monkey that ever lived.

AB  - The aim of the trial was to evaluate the influence of diet supplementation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae on nutrient digestibility and milk and mozzarella cheese yield in buffalo cows during the transition period. Twenty buffalo cows in the last month of pregnancy were equally divided into two groups (control, C, and treated, T) homogeneous for parity and milk yield at the previous lactation. The diet of group T was supplemented with 100 g/head/day of a product containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc 47- CNCM I-4407) for 4 weeks before and after calving. Dry matter intake and the body condition score were not affected by the dietary treatment. In contrast, organic matter, protein, NDF, and ADF digestibility significantly (p < 0.01) increased. Group T showed a higher milk yield (kg 10.5 vs. 9.2, p < 0.05) but lower milk fat (g/kg 76.0 vs. 80.1, p < 0.05). The buffalo standard milk (FPCM = 740 kcal) yield was higher in the treated group (kg 16.8 vs. 15.0, p < 0.05), whereas the mozzarella cheese yield was not affected by the treatment (p > 0.05). These findings indicate that supplementation of the diet of buffaloes with Saccharomyces cerevisiae during the transition period results in notable enhancements in nutrient digestibility and milk yield. These outcomes are worthy of further investigation.

AB  - Global warming is elevating the risk of climate change which is increasing water scarcity, along with the population explosion and ever-expanding demands for food security resulting in the need for screening of drought tolerant genotypes which can be suitably grown both under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Brassica juncea (L.) Czern & Coss (Indian mustard) is one of the most important oilseed crops and is considerably affected by drought stress. In the present investigation, the impact of water stress on phys-iological and biochemical traits of advanced Indian mustard genotypes was studied. The experiment was conducted in factorial randomized block design accommodating 12 genotypes grown with two different irrigation modules, with only pre-sowing irrigation referred as rainfed /moisture stress and with two irri-gations (35 and 65 days after sowing) referred as irrigated/normal. The results revealed a significant effect of drought on indicators of plant water status, sugars and proline concentration. The photosynthetic pig-ments (chlorophyll a and b, total chlorophyll and carotenoids) declined under rainfed significantly over irrigated condition. Relative water content decreased whereas water saturation deficit and relative satu-ration deficit increased under moisture stress as compared to normal condition. The proline, sugar levels and malondialdehyde content along with the antioxidative enzymes increased in all genotypes under stress. Seed yield, oil content and oil yield declined significantly due to moisture deficit. (C) 2021 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Doxycycline (DOX) and zinc (Zn), are frequently detected in livestock manure. Untreated excrement carries a sizable load of DOX and Zn into the soil, exacerbating agricultural nonpoint source pollution. However, research on the effects of DOX and Zn on soil microbial diversity and the prevalence of resistance genes is limited. Through an 8-year field experiment coupled with 16S rRNA sequence analysis, we explored the dynamics of DOX and Zn contamination and their influence on soil microbial diversity and resistance gene expression. Our findings revealed a pronounced positive correlation between pig manure application and residual DOX and Zn levels in the soil, with the high pig manure) treatment resulting in increases of 16.42- and 1.14-fold in soil DOX and Zn levels, respectively, compared to those of the control. Soil DOX levels increased with pig and chicken manure application, whereas soil Zn levels showed divergent trends, increasing with pig manure application but decreasing with chicken manure application. As soil depth increased, the contamination risks from DOX and Zn in the soil decreased. Notably, soil DOX and Zn levels exhibited a significant positive correlation with Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The application of livestock and poultry manures amplified the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs) in the soil, with higher ARG levels in pig manure-treated soil than in soil treated with chicken manure. Conversely, a greater abundance of MRGs was found in the soil treated with chicken manure than in the soil treated with pig manure. The results of this study on the DOX and Zn levels, microbial composition, and resistance genes with the continuous application of livestock and poultry manure in China will be highly valuable for the surveillance, maintenance, and biological removal of DOX and Zn composite pollution in manure.

AB  - Artemisia monosperma is a plant with many traditional uses including some affecting smooth muscles. The A. momosperma essential oil (AMEO) prepared by hydrodistillation from fresh and dry aerial parts was compared qualitatively and quantitatively using GC/MS. The drying process affected the yield and composition of AMEO. The bronchodilator potential was explored using isolated guinea-pig trachea in ex-vivo organ bath setup. In the tracheal contractions induced by different spasmogens, AMEO was able to completely relax contractions induced by carbachol (CCh; 1 mu M) and high K+ (80 mM) at closely related doses (p > 0.05) indicating a dual inhibition of phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE) and voltage-mediated L-type Ca++ channels blocker (CCB) as papaverine. The current study provides scientific support to the medicinal use A. monosperma in respiratory disorders.

AB  - Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of extrusion devices on the available energy and nutrient digestibility of soybean meal (SBM), and further to investigate the impact of different levels of extruded SBM on the growth performance and nutrient digestibility of weaned piglets. In Exp. 1, eighteen crossbreed growing pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 32.6 +/- 2.7 kg were randomly assigned to three treatments, including a corn basal diet, SBM, and extruded SBM diets. In addition, six cannulated pigs (initial BW, 22.3 +/- 1.8 kg) were allocated across an 6 x 3 Youden square design. The experimental treatments included a N-free diet and three diets containing 40% of different SBM sources. The results indicated that extrusion reduced the anti-nutritional factors in soybean meal without affecting the digestibility of available energy and nutrients. In Exp. 2, 192 pigs (initial BW, 6.60 +/- 0.54 kg) were allocated across four diets supplemented with 0%, 3%, 6%, and 9% extruded SBM. The four treatments were randomized and each comprised six replicate pens containing four boars and four gilts. The results showed that average daily feed intake (ADFI) decreased linearly with the increase in extruded SBM levels from d 0-14 (p < 0.05), and average daily gain (ADG) increased; ATTD was higher in the GE, DM, OM, and CP of piglets in the 9% extruded SBM group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the extrusion treatment reduced ANFs in SBM, and adding 9% extruded SBM to the diet improved the growth performance of weaned piglets by increasing the digestibility of nutrients.

AB  - Most reported Diadema antillarum restocking has resulted in low survival and retention. These outcomes challenge conservation and restoration goals. A manipulative study was conducted to evaluate site retention, tandem coral-urchin restoration, and herbivory from 200 adult D. antillarum translocated to five experimental plots off Key Biscayne, Florida. Two additional plots were monitored as controls. Surveys revealed homogeneous dispersal over time, with overall retention of 94.5%, 79.5%, 56.0% and 22.5% at 1-, 7-, 84- and 267-days post-release, respectively. Rugosity significantly predicted urchin retention and plots with higher relief exhibited reduced emigration rates. Benthic image analysis revealed a significant decline in macroalgae relative to controls when urchin densities were above 0.15 m(-2) but not at 0.04 m(-2). Urchin plots experienced a 27% reduction in macroalgae from days 7 to 84. Results indicated higher long-term retention, especially within plots with greater relief, and evidence for ecologically significant herbivory following a single translocation event.

AB  - The incorporation of natural essential oils to the pigs & apos; diet in intensive production systems is a potential tool to improve gut health and prevent infections without using antibiotics. Nevertheless, different products, even containing the same compounds, coming from the same botanical species, may exert dissimilar biological effects due differences in the technological processes by which they are produced and preserved. For this reason, suitability of a given product based on natural extracts, intended for swine production must be thoroughly evaluated. In the present study, we assessed the effects of three additives containing oregano (Lippia origanoides) essential oil, alone or in combination with clover (Eugenia caryophillata) essential oil, with or without being microencapsulated, on gastrointestinal health and on some performance parameters in a commercial pig production farm. Recently weaned piglets were randomly divided in four groups, and basal diet or essential oil-supplemented diet (OCE; MOCE; MOE) was randomly assigned to each of the groups from weaning to finishing. Blood samples were collected at pre-established days after weaning. Intestinal sampling took place at 42 and 72 days of age. Pigs consuming the supplemented diets showed higher intestinal metabolic activity during the post-weaning period, decreasing the impact of weaning stress on enterocytes & apos; metabolism. Intestinal barrier function was not affected in pigs consuming microencapsulated products. All treated groups showed improved intestinal architecture, increased digestive enzymes activity and caecal VFA concentrations. The incorporation of the dietary essential oils products brought beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health that were reflected in improved performance parameters.

AB  - The disposal of animal remains resulting from breeding is a significant challenge that impacts the industry ' s growth. To address the issues with current treatment methods, such as the large space required for corpse storage, and the high energy consumption of pyrolysis. Three strains with high protease and lipase production and one strain with high keratinase production were screened. The virulence genes were evaluated, the synthesis gene clusters of degrading enzymes were mined, secondary metabolites of each strain were analyzed, and the bacterial community with both growth rate and enzyme production ability was developed. Therefore, a microbial degradation method with mild reaction conditions and rapid liquefaction of animal residues was developed. The liquid degradation of four common farm -raised animal residues (sheep, cattle, chickens, and pigs) was tested under laboratory conditions. The results showed that the liquid degradation of animal residues was achieved within 144 h, transforming the months -long anaerobic process of traditional compost fermentation process into a mere 6 days ' anaerobic process. N, P, K plant nutrients accounted for 15% of the total matrix, pH value was 5.5 - 6.7, heavy metal content was less than 0.2 mg L -1 . Designed and improved fermentation equipment, produced a 3 m 3 fermentation equipment, used in chicken, pig two types of animal residues pilot test. The emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO 2 in the entire degradation process were 1.6 x 10 4 ppm, which was 481 times less than that of composting by 7.7 x 10 6 . This study provides a solution for the treatment of dead livestock and poultry, which has promotional and practical value.

AB  - BackgroundAnthropogenic activity can modify how wildlife perceives risks and rewards across the landscape (the 'Landscape of Fear') and affect animal movement and behavior. Studying movement patterns allows researchers to infer anti-predator behaviors and their drivers that affect survival. We studied a game species, the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), to understand how hunting affects prey movement and in turn guide management decisions to maximize species abundance and hunting.MethodsWe used GPS receivers to track the movements of geese at two study sites in Pennsylvania during two hunting seasons. The hunting season in this system includes two distinct periods (hunting periods) in which hunting is permitted on alternating days (hunting days). We fitted hidden Markov models to analyze individual movement at three spatiotemporal scales and estimated how various environmental factors, such as habitat and hunting pressure, influenced the transition probabilities between behavioral states.ResultsWe found that geese were less likely to take flight during hunting periods and on hunting days, and that geese were more likely to transition to a low ambulation state on hunting days. Overall, we found that resident Canada geese employed two nested anti-predator behaviors: individuals proactively decreased their movement during hunting, but as they neared the threat, they were more likely to take flight.ConclusionsOur study provides further evidence that animals maintain a landscape of fear and a schedule of fear. We observed decreased movement during the hunting season and hypothesize that this was due to the stationary nature of risk (hunting blinds). Based on our results, we hypothesize that goose movement may be increased during hunting with an unpredictable spatial-temporal distribution of risk.

AB  - - Aesculus hippocastanum L. (European Horse -chestnut) constitutes a biogeographical relict species of the Balkan Peninsula, occurring in isolated and topographically distinct localities in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and North Macedonia. Despite its great botanical, ornamental and pharmaceutical value, a thorough investigation of Ae. hippocastanum habitat diversity in its native distribution range has not been conducted yet. The present study aims at the syntaxonomic classification and ecological features of plant communities dominated by this species across its overall native distribu- tion range. On the basis of 55 phytosociological releves, five ecologically, floristically, and spatially well differentiated clusters were identified, with the main revealed gradients of differentiation being geographic location (longitude, latitude), altitude, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. The distinct microhabitats with a special refugial character where these plant communities occur meet the species' requirement for relatively high air and soil humidity. They have allowed the preservation of Ae. hippocastanum through time highlighting their great conservational value. The last one could be useful for the implementation of some appropriate measures for effective conservation of these communities.

AB  - Determining the factors that drive the distributions of threatened species is often critical for informing effective conservation management actions. Species distribution models can be used to distinguish common habitat features shared by limited historical records and identify other areas where a species might persist. In this study, we built a species distribution model for the Endangered and cryptic Kangaroo Island dunnart (Sminthopsis fuliginosus aitkeni). We fitted generalised linear models using incidental records and presence-absence data from surveys between 1969 and 2018. In the models we included the variables rainfall, percentage native vegetation in the surrounding 2 km(2), and post-fire vegetation age. The modelling suggested that rainfall and to a lesser extent post-fire vegetation age are good predictors of dunnart occurrence, with dunnart occurrence greatest in areas of high rainfall (>600 mm) and vegetation age classes <30 years post fire. Potentially suitable habitat for the KI dunnart was predicted to be on the central-western side of Kangaroo Island. These results suggest that careful fire management could benefit the dunnart, and that decreased rainfall (as projected by Australian climate models), will be a threat in the long term. Extensive recent fires on western Kangaroo Island suggest that climate-related threats are already being realised.

AB  - Buffalo are country animals, with great adaptability, and thrive in diverse environments. The State of Par & aacute; has the largest herd of buffalo in Brazil, which can be found mainly on Maraj & oacute; Island in the northern region of the state. As a result, buffalo farming has become widespread in Brazil, and it offers several products to the consumer market. However, in the State of Par & aacute;, skin diseases stand out among the diseases that affect this species. This study reports the first case of dermatitis caused by Pelodera spp. in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) on Maraj & oacute; Island, Par & aacute;. This is the first report of parasitic granulomatous dermatitis caused by Pelodera spp. in a buffalo. The affected buffalo was about seven years old, was a female of the Murrah breed and belonged to a property located on Maraj & oacute; Island in the State of Par & aacute;. During the clinical examination, the animal was in a standing position and presented several multifocal nodular and placoid masses throughout the body, mostly on the forelimbs, hindlimbs, abdomen, mammary glands, perineum, vulva and tail. These masses were also observed on the nasal mucosa, head, neck, back and chest. On macroscopic examination, the skin had several multifocal-to-coalescent sessile nodular and placoid lesions. Histopathology of the skin showed a marked reduction in the number of hair follicles. In the superficial dermis, there was significant multifocal-to-coalescent inflammatory infiltration, consisting of macrophages, epithelioid macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and multinucleated giant cells. In the remaining hair follicles, there were numerous cross and longitudinal sections of small rhabditoid nematodes characterized by a thin cuticle, platymyarian musculature, an intestinal tract, a rhabditiform esophagus and lateral alae (morphologically compatible with Pelodera spp.). The diagnosis of parasitic dermatitis was confirmed by histopathological skin lesions associated with the presence of intralesional rhabditiform larvae morphologically compatible with Pelodera spp.

AB  - The Hezuo pig, an important native Tibetan breed in China, exhibits differences in adult body weight, with females typically heavier than males. The underlying mechanisms for this disparity remain unclear. DNA methylation changes are known to influence animal growth and development and regulate Hezuo pig growth by altering gene expression related to these processes, thus differentially affecting adult body weight between genders. This study conducted DNA methylation analysis and expression profiling using pituitary tissues from male and female Hezuo pigs at 3 and 8 months old (M3M, M3F, M8M, and M8F). In total 346, 795, 371, and 839 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified in the M3M vs. M3F, M3F vs. M8F, M3M vs. M8M, and M8M vs. M8F groups, respectively. The comparative analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) genes and DEGs (differentially expressed regions) revealed that key genes involved in growth, hormone secretion, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are primarily enriched in signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt, Hippo, and adrenergic. Further analysis combining methylation and transcriptomics identified five candidate methylated genes (CCL2, MYL2, GST, CTSH, and MCH) linked to adult body weight in Hezuo pigs. Additionally, the correlation analysis suggested that these genes influence growth and development in boars and sows by regulating the secretion and synthesis of related hormones, leading to heavier weights in females. In conclusion, variations in adult body weight between male and female pigs may stem from the impact of DNA methylation on gene expression related to growth and development. These findings offer new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of DNA methylation during weight gain in Hezuo pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Body temperature has detrimental effects on sperm quality in mammalian species, including pigs. However, the molecular mechanism of this is not yet well understood. Cryptorchidism is when one or both testes fail to descend into the scrotum, which leads the testes to be exposed to the body temperature. The aims of present study were to investigate the effect of body temperature on the histomorphometry, apoptosis and the expression of the proliferation-associated protein PCNA and the autophagy-associated protein LC3 in spontaneous unilateral cryptorchid boar testes. Our findings showed that cryptorchidism had no evident influence on the number of Sertoli cells in boars. In cryptorchid testes, spermatogonia markedly decreased and the seminiferous tubule contained only a few spermatogonia, but did not contain post-meiotic germ cells. The altered seminiferous epithelium of the cryptorchid testis showed a low proliferation of its spermatogonia, with apoptosis and autophagy like that of scrotal testis, which probably entailed a gradual degeneration of the epithelium and the impossibility of its recovery. Although the number of Sertoli cells did not change, it was likely that their functionality was altered and that this affected the proliferation capacity of spermatogonia, causing the arrest of spermatogenesis.
   Spontaneous unilateral cryptorchid boars have one testis in the abdomen or inguinal canal, causing its temperature to be at or near the body temperature, which impairs spermatogenesis, although the histomorphometry and molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the histomorphometry, proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy alterations in spermatogonia and Sertoli cells in unilateral cryptorchid, scrotal (contrascrotal), and preweaning piglet (preweaning) testes. Histomorphometrical analysis of cryptorchid testes showed that the seminiferous tubules contained only Sertoli cells and a few spermatogonia, but did not contain post-meiotic germ cells. The number of spermatogonia markedly decreased, and the number of Sertoli cells did not change remarkably in cryptorchid testes. TUNEL assay results showed that apoptosis signals were predominantly observed in spermatogonia. In cryptorchid and contrascrotal testes, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and LC3 were located in spermatogonia. The number of PCNA-positive, TUNEL-positive, and LC3-positive germ cells was low, and the protein and mRNA levels of PCNA and LC3 were significantly decreased in cryptorchid testes. Taken together, the number of Sertoli cells did not change remarkably, whereas the number of germ cells decreased in the cryptorchid testes, compared with that in the contrascrotal testes. Insufficient proliferation, excessive apoptosis, and autophagy were involved in the regulation of the decrease in spermatogonia in cryptorchid boar testes.

AB  - Estimating population density is a fundamental study in ecology and crop pest management. The density estimation of small-scale animals, such as insects, is a challenging task due to the large quantity and low visibility. An herbivorous insect is the big enemy of crops, which often causes serious losses. Feeding of insects results in changes in physiology-related chemical compositions of crops, but it is unknown whether these changes can be used to estimate the population density of pests. The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, is a serious insect pest hiding under rice canopy to suck the sap of rice stems. BPH density is a crucial indicator for determining whether the control using pesticides will be carried out or not. Estimating BPH density is still dependent on manmade survey and light-trap methods, which are time-consuming and low-efficient. Here, we developed a new method based on the physiological traits of rice leaves. The feeding of BPHs significantly decreased the contents of chlorophyll (the SPAD readings), water, silicon, and soluble sugar in rice leaves. Four ratio physiological indices based on these four physiological traits of the BPH-damaged rice leaves to those of healthy leaves were established, and they were significantly correlated with BPH density in rice plants. A rice growth stage-independent linear model based on the four ratio physiological indices and adding the other two variables, BPH damage duration and population increase rate, was developed. This model exhibited a reasonable accuracy for estimating BPH density. This new method will promote the development of density estimation of pest populations toward nonprofessionalization and automation.

AB  - Biochar is a charcoal-like substance made by the pyrolysis of organic material from agricultural and forestry waste. While biochar is well documented for altering soil physicochemical conditions, few studies have investigated its possible effects on the management of arthropod pests. Tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) are specialist and generalist insect herbivores respectively, that can cause significant defoliation in natural and agricultural ecosystems. In this study, we examined whether walnut shell biochar can affect growth and development of these herbivores. Specifically, we investigated how biochar influences parameters such as mass gain, length of pupation, pupal mass, pupal volume, deformity, duration of eclosion, wingspan, body length, thorax mass and survival. Laboratory experiments were conducted by allowing caterpillars to feed on a modified artificial diet and pupate in a pupation medium mixed with biochar. This was followed by allowing the insects to complete pupation and eclose. We found that in the generalist pest FAW, caterpillars feeding on biochar treated diet gained significantly lower mass and had lower pupal volume compared to their conspecifics feeding on normal control diet. Our results also show that biochar treatment on M. sexta pupae led to a reduction in pupal mass, and increased pupal deformity compared to the control, and these negative effects cascaded to significant reduction in adult mass. We also found that adult wingspan, body length, and survival were significantly lower in the biochar treatment when compared to the control for both species. In addition, the biochar treatments also prolonged the time to eclosion of adult moths and decreased their overall survivability. Based on these findings, we conclude that biochar negatively impacts the growth, pupation and eclosion of lepidopteran herbivores, indicating its potential use in sustainable pest management strategies.

AB  - Damage by herbivores can induce various defensive responses. Induced resistance comprises traits that can reduced the damage, while compensatory responses reduce the negative effects of damage on plant fitness. Timing of damage may be essential in determining the patterns of induced defenses. Here, we tested how timing and frequency of leaf damage affect compensatory responses in wild lima bean plants in terms of growth and seed output, as well as their effects on induced resistance to seed beetles. To this end, we applied mechanical damage to plants at different ontogenetical stages, at one time point (juvenile stage only) or two time points (seedling and juvenile stage or juvenile and reproductive stage). We found that plants damaged at the seedling/juvenile stage showed higher compensatory growth, and seed output compared to plants damaged only at the juvenile stage or juvenile/reproductive stage. Seeds from plants damaged at the juvenile and juvenile/reproductive stages had fewer beetles than seeds from undamaged plants, however this was driven by a density dependent effect of seed abundance rather than a direct effect of damage treatments. We did not find differences in parasitism rate by parasitoid wasps on seed beetles among plant treatments. Our results show that damage at the seedling stage triggers compensatory responses which implies that tolerance to herbivory is enhanced or primed by early damage. Herbivory often occurs at several time points throughout plant development and this study illustrates that, for a full understanding of the factors associated with plant induced responses in a dynamic biotic environment, it is important to determine the multitrophic consequences of damage at more than one ontogenetical stage.

AB  - Non-native small mammals are amongst the most popular species traded as pets around the world. Some of these mammals have become invasive through various pet trade releases and escapees in most countries. In South Africa, several non-native small mammals have been introduced for pet trade purposes. We assessed the sale of non-native small mammals in South Africa from September 2018 to 2019 to determine their abundance and degree of trade online and in pet shops. A total of seven websites were recorded selling 2,681 individuals representing 24 species belonging to seven taxonomic orders. For physical pet shops, 19,391 individuals representing 16 species and seven orders were recorded from 122 pet shops. Rodents and primates were the most dominant groups in both online and pet shops. The most common small mammal species traded were the Norwegian rat Rattus norvegicus, the guinea pig Cavia porcellus, the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and the house mouse Mus musculus. Prices ranged from ZAR9.00 to ZAR12,000.00, with rodents offered at relatively low prices. The most abundant species traded were relatively cheap when compared with the least abundant species and CITES species were more expensive than non-CITES species. Species with high abundances traded at low prices and have a history of invasion through pet trade releases and escapes pose an invasion risk in South Africa. Therefore, their trade should be strictly regulated.

AB  - The ratio of predator-to-prey biomass density is not constant along ecological gradients: denser ecosystems tend to have fewer predators per prey, following a scaling relation known as the 'predator-prey power law'. The origin of this surprisingly general pattern, particularly its connection with environmental factors and predator-prey dynamics, is unknown, but has been proposed to be explainable through density-dependent interactions among prey (what we call a bottom-up origin). In contrast, we combine two complementary theoretical approaches to demonstrate how sublinear predator-prey scaling can also emerge from density-dependent interactions among predators and between predators and prey (a top-down origin). First, we use phenomenological differential equations to explore the role of environmental parameters and dynamical properties behind the predator-prey ratio. Second, we simulate an agent-based model with tunable predator self-regulation to investigate the emergence of predator-prey scaling from plausible microscopic rules. While we cannot rule out alternative explanations, our results show that density-dependent mechanisms relative to predation and intraspecific predator interactions, including prey saturation, predator interference, and predator self-regulation, offer potential explanations for the predator-prey power law.

AB  - Cold-storage of semen at 5 degrees C f 1 degrees C provides a novel approach for counteracting antimicrobial resistance in artificial insemination (AI) of pigs. The first objective was to test the suitability of an AI boar population for cold semen storage. The second goal was to test cold semen storage in sow farms using the traditional cervical insemination (CAI) technique. For Experiment 1, semen from four repeated ejaculates of 20 AI boars was stored for 144h at 5 degrees C in AndroStar (R) Premium (APrem) and at 17 degrees C in Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS). Sperm kinematics and acrosome integrity were assessed to identify inter- and intra-boar variability in sperm quality traits. All 80 semen samples met the minimum requirements for use in AI after long-term storage. Two boars demonstrated lower motility in 5 degrees C semen doses compared to 17 degrees C (p < 0.05). Intra-boar variation, analyzed as a coefficient of variance, was low in both semen storage groups. For Experiment 2, semen aliquots stored at 5 degrees C in APrem and at 17 degrees C in BTS were used for CAI of 579 sows in two farms under routine AI management conditions. Non-return rates, farrowing rates, and litter sizes were high in both farms and did not vary between the two semen storage groups (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the hypothermic semen storage concept is applicable with CAI and the use of relatively low sperm numbers. The in vitro data suggest a broad suitability of AI boars for semen storage at 5 degrees C.

AB  - Although trace metal toxicity has been extensively studied in laboratory settings, its long-term effects on wildlife are poorly understood. Most wild animals are likely to be exposed to low doses of trace metals throughout their lives; however, whether such chronic exposure affects fitness-related traits in natural populations remains to be investigated. In this study, we tested the relationships between trace metal burden and sex hormones, primary and secondary sexual traits in wild male roe deer. Using samples collected from 71 hunted males, we measured the hair and liver concentrations of various toxic trace metals, faecal testosterone metabolites (FTM), testis mass and antler length. We focused on cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb) in roe deer tissues. Using linear (mixed effects) models, we found that Cd and, to a lesser extent, Co concentrations in the liver, but not in hair, were negatively associated with absolute testicular mass, a proxy of sperm production. However, metal burden, measured in either the liver or hair, was not related to antler length or FTM levels, despite their respective roles in male competitiveness for access to females and the underlying adjustments for seasonal breeding. Hence, our findings highlight the consequences of exposure to Cd and Co on male testicular function in a wild ungulate. Any alteration in male competitiveness for fertilization is expected to have lasting fitness consequences, which could subsequently alter population dynamics.

AB  - Raptors exert top-down influences on ecosystems via their effects on prey population dynamics and community composition. Most raptors are sympatric with other predators, thus complicating our understanding of their relative influence in these systems. Estimates of kill rates and prey biomass recycling have been used as predation metrics that allow quantitative comparison among species and assessment of the relative role of single species within complex food webs. Few studies have produced findings of kill rates or prey biomass recycling for raptors. We used a supervised machine learning algorithm to behaviourally classify high resolution accelerometer informed GPS locations of tagged adult non-breeding martial eagles Polemaetus bellicosus in the Maasai Mara region of Kenya to estimate kill rates and prey biomass recycling. Eagle locations classified as feeding were clustered using distance and time thresholds to identify kills and calculate kill rates. Identified kill sites were quickly ground-truthed to confirm kills and identify prey species. We estimated kill rates for martial eagles at 0.59 kills day-1 for males and 0.38 kills day-1 for females, and we estimated biomass recycling per ground-truthed kill at 1796 g for males and 3860 g for females. From our sample of identified ground-truthed kills, 'gamebirds' was the most frequently recorded prey category for male eagles and 'small ungulates' was the most frequently recorded prey category for female eagles. These results position martial eagles close to sympatric mammalian top predators in trophic pyramids and provide evidence for their classification as a top predator.

AB  - Allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (AR) is a globally relevant health disorder characterized by sneezing, rhinorrhea and sleep disturbance. Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is a plant common to North America and an important allergen. Coarse methods of measuring airborne pollen counts are used to predict seasonal allergy symptoms. This research used a longitudinal study design with a novel, model-based raster of predicted pollen counts to test associations with self-reported symptoms of AR collected from patients receiving immunotherapy for pollen allergies at an allergy clinic. Researchers visited a clinic six times over three weeks. Immunotherapy patients were asked to fill out a brief intake survey on allergic and symptomatic profiles, daytime sleepiness, housing quality, and demographics. Participants responded to a daily, emailed survey on sleepiness and asthma symptoms for 21 days. Using the date and location of responses, ragweed pollen counts were extracted from a prognostic, model based raster (25km pixels). Lag associations of pollen counts with sleepiness were tested using a logistic regression model , adjusted for housing and demographic characteristics, in a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) framework. 49 people participated in the study. 26 (52%) were female. The mean age was 37.9 years. Asthma/allergy symptoms were not associated with ragweed pollen but sleepiness was highest two days after exposure (Estimate: 0.33 [0.04,0.62]). Subjects traveled widely during the study period. Intense exposures to ragweed pollen may be associated with daytime sleepiness within small exposure windows. Model-based predicted pollen counts could be used to study health impacts of pollen in people with disease severe enough to receive immunotherapy. Daytime sleepiness can affect productivity and injury risk, and pollen season length and allergenicity may be increasing with climate change. Thus our results may have important implications for population health.

AB  - A Central Queensland University (CQU) partnership with the Queensland Government National Park management agency has developed a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) habitat managers' toolkit for vegetation health assessment. Private and public landholders use the field-based toolkit to assess habitat suitability or monitor conservation outcomes for the koala-an iconic Australian arboreal herbivorous marsupial. The toolkit was upgraded recently with instructions to process European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite-derived selected vegetation maps for areal vegetation health trend monitoring. A field campaign sought to validate the relatively coarse spatial resolution derived indices (photosynthetic health, leaf area index and leaf water content) to verify their suitability for the habitat management decision-support toolkit. Other user requirement-driven criteria for including remote sensing in the toolkit were imagery and associated processing software costs and ease of map production for habitat managers without cost-effective access to spatial science skills. Despite moderate-to-low field and image vegetation proxy correlations, discussing the results with stakeholders indicates that, at a landscape scale, the use of cost-free, suitable temporal resolution, 10-m spatial resolution imagery is satisfactory when aligned with the design outcomes of a habitat health toolkit.

AB  - Evaluating physiological responses in the context of a species' life history, demographics, and ecology is essential to understanding the health of individuals and populations. Here, we measured the main mammalian glucocorticoid, cortisol, in an elusive Antarctic apex predator, the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx). We also examined intraspecific variation in cortisol based on life history (sex), morphometrics (body mass, body condition), and ecological traits (& delta;N-15, & delta;C-13). To do this, blood samples, life history traits, and morphometric data were collected from 19 individual leopard seals off the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We found that adult leopard seals have remarkably high cortisol concentrations (100.35 & PLUSMN; 16.72 & mu;g/dL), showing the highest circulating cortisol concentration ever reported for a pinniped: 147 & mu;g/dL in an adult male. Leopard seal cortisol concentrations varied with sex, body mass, and diet. Large adult females had significantly lower cortisol (94.49 & PLUSMN; 10.12 & mu;g/dL) than adult males (120.85 & PLUSMN; 6.20 & mu;g/dL). Similarly, leopard seals with higher isotope values (i.e., adult females, & delta;N-15: 11.35 & PLUSMN; 0.69 & PTSTHOUSND;) had lower cortisol concentrations than seals with lower isotope values (i.e., adult males, & delta;N-15: 10.14 & PLUSMN; 1.65 & PTSTHOUSND;). Furthermore, we compared cortisol concentrations across 26 closely related Arctoid taxa (i.e., mustelids, bears, and pinnipeds) with comparable data. Leopard seals had the highest mean cortisol concentrations that were 1.25 to 50 times higher than other Arctoids. More broadly, Antarctic ice seals (Lobodontini: leopard seal, Ross seal, Weddell seal, crabeater seal) had higher cortisol concentrations compared to other pinnipeds and Arctoid species. Therefore, high cortisol is a characteristic of all lobodontines and may be a specialized adaptation within this Antarctic-dwelling clade. Together, our results highlight exceptionally high cortisol concentrations in leopard seals (and across lobodontines) and reveal high variability in cortisol concentrations among individuals from a single location. This information provides the context for understanding how leopard seal physiology changes with life history, ecology, and morphology and sets the foundation for assessing their physiology in the context of a rapidly changing Antarctic environment.

AB  - Global climatic changes are contaminating ground and surface water sources around the world, resulting in increased salinity. Knowing the animals' typical physiological capability for salinity tolerance without compromising their health is a necessity. The research was undertaken to determine the impacts of drinking water salinity on hemato-biochemical parameters of Black Bengal goats. A total of 40 Black Bengal goats (20 male and 20 female), age ranging from 1 to 5 years, were randomly selected and divided into 2 groups. The animals of group 1 received higher saline water (12 ppt) and those in group 2 received lower saline water (1 ppt) as regular drinking water. Blood parameters of all selected goats were mea -sured. Serum creatinine, uric acid, urea, potassium, sodium, and chloride were significantly higher (P< 0.05) in the animals of group 1 compared with group 2, although serum phosphorous was signifi-cantly lower (P < 0.05) in group 1 compared with group 2. There were no significant differences in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose, magnesium, and calcium between the animals of group 1 and 2. AST and magnesium differed significantly (P < 0.05) between young and adult goats in group 1. Glucose and urea levels were slightly higher (P < 0.05) in young goats. In both groups, male goats had significantly higher (P < 0.05) serum potassium and urea levels than female goats. The results suggest that Black Bengal goats of the coastal areas have different salt tolerance capacities based on their age and sex, and adapt to higher salinity by changing kidney functions.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Numerous penguins can propagate pathogens with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into Antarctica. However, the effects of penguin dissemination on the lake ARGs still have received little attention via guano deposition. Here, we have profiled ARGs in ornithogenic sediments subject to penguin guano (OLS) and nonornithogenic sediments (NOLS) from 16 lakes across Antarctica. A total of 191 ARGs were detected in all sediment samples, with a much higher abundance and diversity in OLS than in NOLS. Surprisingly, highly diverse and abundant ARGs were found in the OLS with a detection frequency of >40% and an absolute abundance of (2.34 x 10(9))-(4.98 x 10(9)) copies g(-1), comparable to those in coastal estuarine sediments and pig farms. The strong correlations of identified resistance genes with penguin guano input amount, environmental factors, mobile genetic elements, and bacterial community, in conjunction with network and redundancy analyses, all indicated that penguins were responsible for the dissemination and high enrichment of ARGs in lake sediments via the guano deposition, which might greatly outweigh local human-activity effects. Our results revealed that ARGs could be carried into lakes across the Antarctica through penguin migration, food chains, and guano deposition, which were closely connected with the widespread pollution of ARGs at the global scale.

AB  - China Agricultural Green Development Modern Zone (CAGDMZ) constitute a demonstration area for achieving green and sustainable development of Chinese agriculture. It plays a role in demonstrating high-quality agricultural development and environmental protection. As a result, a coordinated interaction among livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and rapid industrial livestock evolution in the CAGDMZ is of great concern to China's government. In this paper, we were the first to research the decoupling relationship between livestock GHG emissions and industrial development by using data from 165 CAGDMZ of China from 2010 to 2019 at different regional scales and long time series. On this basis, we further explored the factors affecting livestock GHG emissions by using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method (LMDI). Our analysis revealed that the amount of GHG emissions from livestock in the CAGDMZ showed a rising and then declining trend. Pigs, nondairy cattle and sheep were the main targets of livestock GHG emission reductions. There were obvious spatial differences in livestock GHG emissions. 17 provinces'CAGDMZ achieved emissions reductions, but 14 provinces' CAGDMZ increased livestock GHG emissions. The Northeast CAGDMZ had the highest livestock GHG emissions and the Eastern CAGDMZ had the largest livestock GHG deceleration. Furthermore, the decoupling status in the CAGDMZ were unstable. Most provinces or regions of the CAGDMZ maintained the economic growth of livestock while curbing the excessive growth of GHG emissions. Only a few of them achieved a win-win situation of livestock output value increase while GHG emission reduction. Moreover, the comprehensive effect showed an inverted "U " trend. Production efficiency was the most major contributor to livestock GHG emissions reductions. Economic development factor and labor scale factor were the main driving factors for increasing GHG emissions. Industrial structure factor shifted from promotion to suppression of livestock GHG emissions. Therefore, some policies to accomplish the CAGDMZ's long-term development were proposed.

AB  - Leaves of many plants are red when they are young/old, which was suggested as an adaptive strategy to reduce insect herbivory. The "coevolution hypothesis" proposes that red leaves function as a warning signal, while most herbivores in tropical and subtropical areas are known for their insensitivity to red. To examine whether young-leaf redness functioned as an effective defense to common herbivores and determine the way it works, we conducted a comparative study of leaf color and protective tissue across five forest communities in south-central China, combined with leaf surface reflective spectrum analyses. Mature/young leaves of 151 species were examined for their phylogenetic/non-phylogenetic correlation between leaf redness and mechanical protection. Reflective spectra of both adaxial/abaxial surfaces of young/mature leaves in one community were examined using a portable spectrometer. The data were transformed into a bee vision model and compared in different color groups (red/green-young-leaf species) to examine whether they could be discriminated by common herbivores in subtropical area. In our study, about half species of each community (43.3% similar to 61.1%) present red young leaves, much more than present among mature/senescent leaves. Green-young-leaf species presented a significantly higher proportion of protective tissue than red-young-leaf species in all communities. Phylogenetic analyses using Pagel's correlated evolution test found a correlation between young-leaf color and mechanical structure, indicating leaf redness might be complementary to mechanical protection. Alternatively, reflective spectrum analyses suggested that the most common insect herbivores (Lepidoptera larvae and Coleoptera) could hardly distinguish red from green leaves. Our results suggest the accumulation of anthocyanin is a common defense in spring young leaves, which likely functions in some other way beyond being a visual warning. Given that anthocyanin also plays an important role in physiological functions, it is important to consider and understand the ecological significance of anthocyanin from multiple aspects.

AB  - Crop diversification often promotes farm sustainability. However, proper management of newly introduced crops is difficult when pests are unknown. Characterizing herbivore dynamics on new crops, and how they respond to agronomic factors, is crucial for integrated pest management. Here we explored factors affecting Lygus spp. (Hemiptera: Miridae) herbivores in quinoa crops of Washington State. Quinoa is a newly introduced crop for North America that has multiple varieties and a range of agronomic practices used for cultivation. Through arthropod surveys and discussions with growers, we determined that Lygus spp. was the most abundant insect herbivore and likely contributed to low quinoa yields in previous seasons. We assessed how different varieties (Pison and QQ74), irrigation regimes (present and not), and planting methods (direct-seeded and transplanted) affected Lygus population dynamics. Lygus phenology was correlated with timing of quinoa seed-set in July and August, corresponding to a period when quinoa is most susceptible to Lygus. Both irrigation and planting manipulations had significant effects on Lygus abundance. Irrigation reduced Lygus abundance compared with nonirrigated plots in 2018. Planting method had a significant effect on Lygus populations in both 2017 and 2018, but effects differed among years. Variety had a significant effect on Lygus abundance, but only in nonirrigated plots. Overall, our study shows that Lygus is a common insect herbivore in quinoa, and careful selection of variety, planting method, and irrigation regime may be key components of effective control in seasons where Lygus abundance is high.

AB  - Seagrasses provide valuable ecosystem services, including improved water quality, carbon sequestration, and sediment stabilization. Unfortunately, these critical habitats are declining globally due to a range of anthropogenic impacts. Restoration practitioners have made efforts to mitigate loss through the introduction of seagrass transplants. However, seagrass restoration has low success rates and is plagued by water quality concerns and ecosystem degradation. Studies to improve seagrass restoration efforts have targeted different functional taxa to allow for greater stability and recovery of threatened ecosystems, and excluded macro-grazers to limit losses to newly established and restored seagrasses. We hypothesized greater seagrass (Halodule wrightii) health when restored in conjunction with hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and protected from grazers using herbivore exclusion devices (HEDs) in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida. While our study experienced high rates of seagrass mortality, we were able to observe significant differences in seagrass health between IRL sub-lagoons and observed the positive effects of HEDs on seagrass health. The observed high species mortality highlights how restoration in the IRL is hindered by biotic and abiotic stressors, site selection, and a lack of clear restoration protocols. As we see ongoing declines in water quality and loss of foundational species, informed site selection, greater understanding of grazer presence, and multi-species restoration will provide an informed approach for future seagrass restoration projects globally.

AB  - Predicting the content of heavy metals, such as copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), based on spectral modeling through Vis-NIR-SWIR spectroscopy is a challenging task, especially when the database comprises soil samples with high variations in Cu and Zn content, associated with pedological, geologic and climate diversity. The aim of this study was to assess whether DB-global stratification, which is based on physiographic region criteria, can improve the accuracy of stratified regional models to predict soil available Cu and Zn content, in comparison with nonstratified global models (GM). Furthermore, we tested the applicability of regional models (RMs) for accurately estimating Cu and Zn in vineyard soils in southern Brazil in comparison with global models. We used a DB-Global model with 1,454 samples derived from 3 different physiographic regions in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The prediction models were developed via random forest models with spectra subjected to smoothing based on Savitzky-Golay's 1st derivative. DB-Global stratification based on physiographic regions has shown that grouping the most homogeneous samples increases the prediction accuracy of regional models when they are applied to samples from the specific regions for which they are calibrated. The most accurate predictions were recorded for models calibrated with data in databases with the largest number of samples and with the lowest standard deviations of the Cu, Zn, organic matter and soil clay content. The definition for the calibration and application of a GM, in comparison with an RM, must consider soil pedological diversity in a given region.

Although body size profoundly affects the behavior, physiology, ecology, and evolution of species, how investment in functional immune defenses changes with body size across species is unknown. Here, we (1) developed a novel 12-point dilution curve approach to describe and compare antibacterial capacity against three bacterial species among >160 terrestrial species of mammals and (2) tested published predictions about the scaling of immune defenses. Our study focused on the safety factor hypothesis, which predicts that broad, early-acting immune defenses should scale hypermetrically with body mass. However, our three statistical approaches demonstrated that antibacterial activity in sera across mammals exhibits isometry; killing capacity did not change with body size across species. Intriguingly, this result indicates that the serum of a large mammal is less hospitable to bacteria than would be predicted by its metabolic rates. In other words, if metabolic rates underlie the rates of physiological reactions as postulated by the metabolic theory of ecology, large species should have disproportionately lower antibacterial capacity than small species, but they do not. These results have direct implications for effectively modeling the evolution of immune defenses and identifying potential reservoir hosts of pathogens.

AB  - The Pacific longnose parrotfish, Hipposcarus longiceps, is an important target species in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. However, its life history traits have yet to be characterized in the northern hemisphere. Thus, the age, growth, maturity, spawning season, sex structure, and sex reversal of this species were investigated for the first time in the subtropical Yaeyama region, Japan. According to the age composition of the sexes and the structure of the gonads, this species displayed diandric hermaphroditism with a primary male. The maximum fork length and ages of females, primary males, and secondary males were 506 mm and 17 years, 537 mm and 12 years, and 578 mm and 13 years, respectively. The estimated parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function for all specimens were Loo = 562, k = 0.18, and t0 = -0.81. The spawning season in the Yaeyama region was estimated to be between April and October according to the gonadal development of both sexes. Compared with previous studies on this species conducted in tropical waters, the Yaeyama population in subtropical waters lives longer, grows larger, and matures and changes sex later. However, previous studies in subtropical waters have shown similar life history parameters as those observed in this study, and spawning was inactive during the low water temperature periods. These features suggest that vulnerability to fishing pressure would be higher in subtropical populations than in tropical populations. This study also confirmed that H. longiceps has an obvious spawning period when the average water temperature is >= 24.6 degrees C. The unique features of H. longiceps in the Yaeyama region are thought to reflect the lower temperature of the region's subtropical waters. These findings suggest that the future effects of global warming could extend the spawning season of subtropical H. longiceps populations. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - For most marine organisms, including fish, species diversity is very high in the Indo-Pacific region, and it reflects how past and present environmental conditions shape a link between biodiversity and ecosystem function. The distribution of a taxon in the region is due to the establishment of morphological, genetic, behavioral, and physiological aspects of species. Despite extensive surveys in the Indo-Pacific region still, there are new species and new records especially in the case of small cryptic species such as blennies. The family Blenniidae including members of the genus Entomacrodus are mostly small fishes of less than 15 cm having an elongate and slender body with a worldwide distribution. Entomacrodus comprises herbivorous combtooth blennies with about 27 species, 7 of which occur in the western Indian Ocean. In this study, the presence, general morphology, otolith shape variation, osteology, distribution, and molecular phylogenetic affinity of the reef margin blenny Entomacrodus striatus have been documented/presented from the westernmost part of the Indo-Pacific region (the Jask Port, Oman Sea). The morphological and meristic characteristics of specimens were well fit with E. striatus. The vertebral column includes 10 abdominal and 23 caudal vertebrae, for a total vertebral count of 33. Corroborating the morphological results, DNA barcoding based on mitochondrial COI confirmed that the specimens collected from the Jask Port area are conspecific with E. striatus from other Indo-Pacific localities. Entomacrodus striatus from the Oman Sea and other Indo-Pacific regions show a distinct clade sister to a clade of E. epalzeocheilos, E. niuafoouensis, and E. randalli with a closest phylogenetic relationship to E. niuafoouensis (0.108 K2P genetic distance). The presence of E. striatus in the coastal area of the Oman Sea in the Jask coastal area represents the first record of this species for the westmost of the northern Indian Ocean and markedly expands its known geographical distribution range.

AB  - Winter camelina (Camelina sativa) is a climate-resilient oilseed crop that has received attention as a feedstock crop for advanced, low-carbon-intensity biofuels. Breeding programs working on winter camelina improvement have to contend with heterogeneous germplasm, oftentimes erroneously identified as winter biotypes, and a gene pool that is much smaller than that of spring-type camelina, the latter having motivated crosses between winter and spring biotypes. For the unequivocal differentiation of winter from spring types at an early stage, breeders require a tool to track the vernalization requirement trait in segregating breeding populations as well as in putative winter cultivars, breeding lines, and accessions to be used as parental lines. Linkage mapping in a winter ('Joelle') x spring ('SES0787LS') C. sativa biparental F2 population identified two major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for vernalization requirement on chromosomes 8 and 13. Both regions contained orthologs of Flowering Locus C (FLC), a gene known to have a significant effect on flowering time and vernalization requirement in plants. Based on the FLC gene sequences, allele-specific PCR-based markers were developed, suitable for the routine screening of C. sativa germplasm for the presence of the winter and spring alleles of all three C. sativa FLC orthologs, including a chromosome 20 locus. The analysis of the winter cultivar 'Joelle' and a diverse C. sativa germplasm panel uncovered greater than expected variability for the FLC alleles, with most lines possessing several different allele combinations and still undergoing genetic segregation. Contrary to previous reports, spring camelina lines can carry the spring and/or winter alleles of Csa.FLC.C20, indicating that this gene by itself only plays a subordinate role in the regulation of flowering and vernalization requirement. In winter C. sativa germplasm, combinations of Csa.FLC.C08 winter alleles with the winter alleles of one or both of Csa.FLC.C13 and Csa.FLC.C20 result in vernalization requirement, while winter Csa.FLC.C08 by itself leads to a semi-winter type. The results of this study and the tools developed herein are a first step to orchestrating the genes underlying vernalization requirement in C. sativa and developing winter camelina cultivars optimized for different winter environments.

AB  - In East Asia, rice is a key crop that is subject to significant insect driven crop damage often leading to wide scale reliance on insecticides. We assessed the effects of releasing conditions (including density, frequency and distribution points) of a parastic wasp (i.e., Trichogramma japonicum ) on the control efficacy it provided against two rice pest herbivores (i.e., Chilo suppressalis and Cnaphalocrocis medinalis ). Optimal control was achieved by three releases of 150,000 wasps per hectare across 75 release points within a hectare rice field. A following 2-year large-scale field experiment demonstrated that the release of parasitic wasps allowed a 60.0 % reduction in insecticide use when compared to the insecticide treatment alone. Importantly, there was also a 3.7 % increase in pest control, 2.5 % increase in rice yield, and an overall 4.5 % increase in net economic benefit when the release of parasitic wasps was combined with insecticide application. This was an improvement on the use of either parasitic wasps alone or insecticide application alone. Release of parasitic wasps had co-benefits for other invertebrate predators whose abundance was increased by 65.8 % relative to the insecticide only treatment, however, this fell to a 26.4 % increase when parasitic wasps release was combined with insecticide use. Additionally, the combined treatment group of parasitic wasps and insecticides exhibited the highest net economic benefit (40488.9 +/- 593.2 Chinese Yuan (CNY) ha -1 ), significantly surpassing both the parasitic wasps-only treatment by 8.9 % and the treatment of no parasitic wasps and no insecticide by 21.8 %. These findings suggest that parasitic wasps releasing is a feasible approach to ecological engineering to promote multiple ecosystem services linked to greater crop yield in agroecosystems.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of an EM(R)Bokashi probiotic preparation containing specific Lactobacillus and yeasts strains as a feed additive resulted in the improved slaughter value, content of macroelements (Mg, Ca, Na) and chromatic color traits (b*, C*) of meat, but diminished the technological quality (pH, drip loss, TY, shear force) of pork. It additionally resulted in a significant increase in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast counts and a decrease in the population numbers of Clostridium and Enterobacteriaceae in gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of probiotics on gut microbiota, on carcass and meat quality and on mineral contents in the longissimus lumborum (LL) muscle in pigs. The research was carried out with 120 hybrid pigs deriving from Naima sows and P-76 boars. Pigs from the experimental group received the EM(R)Bokashi probiotic (Greendland Technologia EM (R), Janowiec n/Wisla, Poland) in their feed (containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum). The study showed that EM(R)Bokashi probiotic supplementation resulted in a significantly higher count of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts in the feed, a lower number of Clostridium in the mucosa and colorectal digesta as well as a lower Enterobacteriaceae count in the colorectal digesta. The research showed that carcasses of the pigs who received the EM(R)Bokashi probiotic had a higher lean percentage and lower fat content than the carcasses of the control fatteners. Diet supplementation with the EM(R)Bokashi probiotic resulted in a lower pH and technological yield (TY) and a higher drip loss and shear force at a lower protein content in LL muscle. Moreover, the administration of the probiotic to fatteners resulted in higher yellowness (b*) and saturation (C*) and higher concentrations of Na, Mg and Se in meat.

AB  - Haemonchosis is a fatal disease of livestock caused by Haemonchus contortus (HC) - a blood-sucking parasite of the abomasum. This parasite is quite prevalent in sheep, causing mortality and production losses. The suppressor of cytokine signalling-2 (SOCS2) gene plays a vital role in sheep's immune response against gastrointestinal parasites. This study aimed to estimate the parasitic load of HC in three sheep breeds (Balkhi, Ghalji, and Michni) through faecal egg count and to identify SNPs in the SOCS2 gene associated with the susceptibility of sheep against HC. The results showed that the mean number of HC eggs per gram (EPG) was higher in the faecal samples of Ghalji (4022 +/- 1162 EPG), followed by Michni (1988 +/- 367 EPG), while the HC EPG was the lowest in Balkhi sheep (1535 +/- 552 eggs/gm). Sequencing results showed polymorphisms in the SOCS2 gene between the low-infection and high-infection categories of the three sheep breeds. A total number of six genic variants were observed, of which three were SNPs, one was insertion, and two were deletions. Polymorphisms were observed in the intronic and 3 ' UTR regions of the SOCS2 gene. A deletion (c.1083delGCA) in intron 1 and an insertion (c.3304insT) in intron 2 showed positive correlations (0.833 and 0.889, respectively) with the HC infection, while one SNP in the 3 ' UTR region showed negative correlation (-0.654). This study provides a basis for selecting resistant sheep against HC infection based on the SOCS2 gene molecular markers.

AB  - Diet specialisation is a main driver of diversification in many adaptive radiations. Therefore, identifying diet items is essential to characterise trophic specialisations and to understand the dynamics of dietary adaptations. In this study, we explored the trophic niches of 56 species from the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika, encompassing all major phylogenetic lineages and feeding specialisations. We employed a metagenomic sequencing approach to identify the food sources of the investigated species at high taxonomic resolution, sequencing over 400 digestive content samples from wild-caught individuals at around 50 million paired-end read depth per sample. Our analyses revealed Arthropoda, Chordata (fishes), Bacillariophyta and Streptophyta as the primary diet phyla of the Tanganyikan cichlids. Moreover, we confirmed the presence of other food sources and identified taxa not previously documented to be part of the cichlids' diet. Based on their dietary compositions, the Tanganyikan cichlids can be grouped into herbivores, invertivores, piscivores and mixed feeders. Further, we showed that trophic disparity in the radiation is shaped by rapid divergence and documented cases of dietary niche convergence. Diet composition correlated with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values, gut length, and body morphology. Differences in diet-such as the consumption of diatoms, streptophytes and chlorophytes versus fish and arthropods-were associated with changes in body, upper oral jaw and lower pharyngeal jaw shape. Collectively, this study presents a comprehensive and detailed diet classification of the Tanganyikan cichlids, highlighting the power of metagenomic approaches in delineating dietary adaptations.

AB  - Avobenzone (AVO), an ultraviolet (UV) filter, is frequently used as an ingredient in personal cosmetics. This UV filter has been found to be easily exposed in swimming pools and beaches, and it has been detected in human urine and blood. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated that AVO exhibits endocrine -disrupting properties. Nevertheless, the effects of AVO on male fertility have not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of AVO on various sperm functions during capacitation. First, boar spermatozoa were treated with various AVO concentrations. After treatment, sperm motility and kinetic characteristics, capacitation status, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and sperm viability were evaluated. Moreover, Western blot analysis w.as conducted to evaluate protein kinase A (PKA) activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. As a result, AVO treatment significantly decreased total motility, progressive motility, and several kinetic characteristics at high concentrations (50 and 100 mu M). Furthermore, the capacitation status dosedependently decreased. Conversely, no significant differences in acrosome reaction, cell viability, and intracellular ATP levels were observed. However, the intracellular ATP level tended to decrease. In addition, AVO dosedependently induced abnormal changes in PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. Although AVO did not directly exert a toxic effect on cell viability, it ultimately negatively affected sperm functions through abnormal alterations in PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the potential implications on male fertility must be considered when contemplating the safe utilization of AVO.

AB  - Fertilization is a critical agronomic measure for croplands in tropical regions, owing to their low fertility. However, the effects of fertilization on the quantity and chemodiversity of latosolic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in tropical regions remain largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, the variations in latosol DOM concentrations and chemodiversity induced by inorganic fertilization and the co-application of inorganic fertilization with straw return, sheep manure, biochar, and vermicompost fertilizers at a molecular level were systematically investigated using multispectral techniques and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. In line with our expectations, the results showed that combined inorganic-organic fertilization improved soil quality by increasing soil organic carbon content compared to that under inorganic fertilization. However, as the most active and bioavailable organic carbon pool, dissolved organic carbonconcentrations between the fertilization treatments were not significantly different (p = 0.07). However, the dissolved organic carbon concentrations under combined inorganic-organic fertilization treatment (NPK plus straw return, 263.45 +/- 37.51 mg/kg) were lower than those under inorganic fertilization treatment (282.10 +/- 18.57 mg/kg). Spectral analysis showed that the DOM in the combined inorganic-organic fertilization treatments had a higher degree of humification and lower autogenetic contributions. Furthermore, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the combined inorganic-organic fertilization increased the chemodiversity of latosolic DOM and promoted the production of large, oxidized, and stable molecules, including lignin, aromatic, and tannin compounds, which potentially benefits soil carbon sequestration in tropical regions. This study could provide a theoretical basis for elucidating on the potentially relevant ecological functions and environmental effects of DOM under fertilization regimes.

AB  - Simple Summary We performed SNP genotyping of indigenous goats of Mongolia to explore their demographic history in the global context and to estimate their genetic risks. Recently, these risks have become a subject of concern due to recent climatic disasters and uncontrolled massive breeding. Various clustering methods demonstrated close genetic relations among Mongolian, Russian, Chinese, and West Asian breeds. Mongolian goats themselves exhibited low to moderate estimates of genetic differentiation. We identified genetic features highlighting the distinct origin and breeding history of Mongolian goat breeds, as well as traces of artificial selection and geographic isolation. However, none of them met formal criteria to be considered as endangered. Mongolian goats are of great interest for studying ancient migration routes and domestication, and also represent a good model of adaptability to harsh environments. Recent climatic disasters and uncontrolled massive breeding endangered the valuable genetic resources of Mongolian goats and raised the question of their conservation status. Meanwhile, Mongolian goats have never been studied on genomic scale. We used Illumina Goat SNP50 to estimate genetic risks in five Mongolian goat breeds (Buural, Ulgii Red, Gobi GS, Erchim, Dorgon) and explored phylogenic relationships among these populations and in the context of other breeds. Various clustering methods showed that Mongolian goats grouped with other Asian breeds and were especially close to some neighboring Russian and Chinese breeds. The Buural breed showed the lowest estimates of inbreeding and exhibited the shortest genetic distances within the other Mongolian breeds, especially, to Ulgii Red and Gobi GS. These three breeds formed a single core group, being weakly differentiated from each other. Among them, Gobi GS displayed obvious signs of inbreeding probably resulted from artificial selection pressure. Dorgon and especially Erchim goats stand apart from the other Mongolian breeds according to various types of analyses, and bear unique features pointing to different breeding histories or distinct origins of these breeds. All populations showed strong decline in effective population size. However, none of them met formal criteria to be considered as endangered breeds. The SNP data obtained in this study improved the knowledge of Mongolian goat breeds and could be used in future management decisions in order to preserve their genetic diversity.

AB  - Background: In ruminants, physiological and nutritional changes occur peripartum. We investigated if gastro-intestinal microbiota, rumen metabolism and antioxidant status were affected around parturition and what could be the impact of a daily supplementation of a live yeast additive in late gestating ewes. Methods: Rumen, feces and blood samples were collected from 2 groups of 14 ewes one month and a few days before parturition, and 2 weeks postpartum. Results: In the control ewes close to parturition, slight changes in the ruminal microbiota were observed, with a decrease in the concentration F. succinogenes and in the relative abundance of the Fibrobacteres phylum. Moreover, a decrease in the alpha-diversity of the bacterial community and a reduced relative abundance of the Fibrobacteres phylum were observed in their feces. Control ewes were prone to oxidative stress, as shown by an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, a lower total antioxidant status, and higher glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the blood. In the yeast supplemented ewes, most of the microbial changes observed in the control group were alleviated. An increase in GPx activity, and a significant decrease in MDA concentration were measured. Conclusions: The live yeast used in this study could stabilize gastro-intestinal microbiota and reduce oxidative stress close to parturition.

AB  - During tea cultivation, diverse agroforestry is an important and established intercropping measure, with most studies concentrating on ecological service provision and economic returns. However, the response of soil nutrients and microbial community structures in long-term tea plantations with diverse agroforestry intercropping systems is poorly understood. In the present field study (2015), three intercropping agroforestry-tea patterns (Osmanthus-Tea (OT), Michelia-Tea (MT), Osmanthus-Michelia-Tea (OMT)) along with a study control (C) were examined in terms of these two knowledge gaps. Results showed that, in terms of tea cultivation, the OMT system is more suitable than the OT and MT systems. The OMT system significantly increased the total nitrogen (TN, 16.4%), total potassium (TK, 10.5%), available nitrogen (AN, 14.2%), available phosphorus (AP, 26.7%) and soil organic matter (SOM, 28.9%). The OMT system increased phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes abundance by 35.8% and 9.6%. In addition, the OMT system enhanced the abundance of class Bacteroidia (99.5%), Erysipelotrichia (96.9%), Clostridia (93.5%) and Actinobacteria (19.6%), respectively. In general, the phylum bacteria Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria accounted for the largest proportion of bacteria in all three intercropping systems. In this study, the abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were positively correlated with AN, SOM and TP. The results of the present study will help to develop a better understanding of the benefits imposed by different agroforestry intercropping systems on nutrient dynamics and microbial structural diversity during tea cultivation.

AB  - Widespread plants may provide natural models for how population processes change with temperature and other environmental variables and how they may respond to global change. Similar changes in temperature can occur along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients, but hardly any study has compared the effects of the two types of gradients. We studied populations of Anthyllis vulneraria along a latitudinal gradient from Central Europe to the range limit in the North and an altitudinal gradient in the Alps from 500 m to the altitudinal limit at 2500 m, both encompassing a change in annual mean temperature of c. 11.5 degrees C. Plant size and reproduction decreased, but plant density increased along both gradients, indicating higher recruitment and demographic compensation among vital rates. Our results support the view that demographic compensation may be common in widespread species in contrast to the predictions of the abundant centre model of biogeography. Variation in temperature along the gradients had the strongest effects on most population characteristics, followed by that in precipitation, solar radiation, and soil nutrients. The proportion of plants flowering, seed set and seed mass declined with latitude, while the large variation in these traits along the altitudinal gradient was not related to elevation and covarying environmental variables like annual mean temperature. This suggests that it will be more difficult to draw conclusions about the potential impacts of future climate warming on plant populations in mountains, because of the importance of small-scale variation in environmental conditions.

AB  - African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are obligate cooperative breeders and are generally considered mono-oestrus. As such, the birth of two litters within the same year rarely occurs, except for when pups from the initial litter are lost soon after birth. We report on a rare occurrence where a wild dog female (Vee) produced three litters of pups within a 13-month, 2-week period from March 2015 to June 2016, with surviving pups from each litter. Data on breeding females from wild dog packs in the study area (Save Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe) were used to identify whether any predictor variables (e. g. environmental or pack dynamics) could have influenced this unusual occurrence. The period over which the high number of litters were born had high prey densities and there was some evidence that it was associated with lower temperatures. High impala (Aepyceros melampus) densities during 2015 was likely to have been advantageous for the packs' hunting behaviours, while lower temperatures have been shown to increase the percentage of the day that is cool enough for wild dogs to hunt. Pack size during this period was higher in the pack that produced multiple litters (by the same female) than for other packs in the study site, which supports existing evidence that larger packs are able to produce more pups. Our results suggest that either 1) under ideal environmental and social conditions African wild dog females are capable of producing multiple litters throughout the year or that 2) this occurrence was an anomaly unique to Vee and her physiology.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced transformative paradigms into education, facilitating personalized, real-time, and interactive learning experiences. This study investigates the integration of AI-based textbooks within regular college curricula, with a specific focus on their application in ancillary engineering subjects that demand high precision. AI textbooks enable customized learning pathways, enhance student engagement through adaptive content, and provide educators with data-driven insights. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research compares the academic performance and learning experiences of two groups: the Traditional Learning Group (TLG), which utilized printed materials; and the AI Learning Group (ALG), which employed a generative AI-powered textbook based on LLama 3.1. Over a 15-week semester, data were collected through pre- and post-tests, task evaluations, platform log analyses, and satisfaction surveys. The findings reveal no statistically significant differences between the two groups in quantitative measures such as academic achievement, learning time, and overall satisfaction. However, the qualitative assessments underscore the role of AI-based learning in supporting self-directed education, while also highlighting the critical challenges, including digital equity, algorithmic biases, and data privacy concerns. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive educator training, the establishment of ethical frameworks, and the development of scalable implementation strategies to fully leverage the potential of AI textbooks. Future research should prioritize randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the long-term impacts of AI-based educational tools and develop adaptive frameworks that balance technological advancements with the emotional and motivational dimensions of human-centered education. This pioneering research lays the groundwork for advancing generative AI in higher education and fostering an innovative and equitable learning ecosystem.

AB  - When natural populations split and migrate to different environments, they may experience different selection pressures that can lead to local adaptation. To capture the genomic patterns of a local selective sweep, we develop XP-nSL, a genomic scan for local adaptation that compares haplotype patterns between two populations. We show that XP-nSL has power to detect ongoing and recently completed hard and soft sweeps, and we then apply this statistic to search for evidence of adaptation to high altitude in rhesus macaques. We analyze the whole genomes of 23 wild rhesus macaques captured at high altitude (mean altitude > 4000 m above sea level) to 22 wild rhesus macaques captured at low altitude (mean altitude < 500 m above sea level) and find evidence of local adaptation in the high-altitude population at or near 303 known genes and several unannotated regions. We find the strongest signal for adaptation at EGLN1, a classic target for convergent evolution in several species living in low oxygen environments. Furthermore, many of the 303 genes are involved in processes related to hypoxia, regulation of ROS, DNA damage repair, synaptic signaling, and metabolism. These results suggest that, beyond adapting via a beneficial mutation in one single gene, adaptation to high altitude in rhesus macaques is polygenic and spread across numerous important biological systems.

AB  - Soil erosion in Brazil is very high, and there is need to promote aggregate stability technics to increase the soil organic matter and the soil water infiltration, with a consequent decrease in erosion processes. Applications of animal manure on sandy loam soil may increase carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in soil aggregates, causing increased aggregate stability. This study aimed to evaluate the contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) as well as the physical properties of a sandy loam soil subjected to 11 years of application animal manure and mineral fertilizer. The experiment was conducted under no-tillage (NT) system with corn (Zea mays L.)/black oat (Avena strigose Schreb.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)/black oat, and corn/wheat (Triticum spp.) crops. The following treatments were used: control (no fertilization), pig slurry (PS), pig deep litter (DL), cattle slurry (CS), and mineral fertilizer (NPK). Soil aggregates were obtained from undisturbed soil samples collected at soil depths of 0 to 5, 5 to 10, and 10 to 20 cm. Applications of PS, DL, and CS on soil increased TOC and TN contents, and increasing weighted mean diameter (WMD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) in the topsoil. Use of DL and CS increased TOC at 0 to 5 cm in comparison to PS, NPK, and control. The use of animal manure also resulted in higher TN contents at 0 to 5 and 10 to 20 cm compared to control. The use of animal manure for 11 years under NT reduced the amount of mesoaggregates (2.0 > & Oslash; >= 0.25 mm) and microaggregates (& Oslash; < 0.25 mm) and increased GMD in the topsoil in comparison to the NPK and control. The animal manure promoted the dispersion of clays at 5 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm, resulting in lower soil aggregation in depth. Principal component analysis confirmed that animal manure reduced the degree of flocculation, with a consequent decrease in aggregation indexes, as it grouped the manure treatments in opposition to the NPK and control treatments.

AB  - Contents This case study describes the effects of a contamination of boar bedding material with reprotoxic compounds in an AI centre in southern Germany. The origin of the investigations was an extreme decline in the production output of the boars. In July 2021, more than 54% of boars were not in production and over 45% of ejaculates had insufficient sperm quality and quantity, which is a significant drop in comparison with the other months. This drop was accompanied by oligozoospermia (azoospermia), asthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia. Through intensive troubleshooting, the changes could be attributed to fenpropimorph, an ergosterol biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide with reprotoxic potential, which was found in the sawdust used as bedding as well as in liver samples of affected animals, reaching a concentration (mean +/- SD) between 0.20 +/- 0.36 mg/kg and 0.019 +/- 0.001 mg/kg respectively. Furthermore, autopsy findings revealed hyperaemia of the testis, histologically focal degeneration of the germinal epithelium and signs of reduced spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis.

AB  - The use of animal slurry in modern agricultural systems is receiving considerable attention, mainly due to the latest increase in chemical fertilizer prices. However, the use of raw animal slurry to fertilize horticultural crops can, on the one hand, lead to significant ammonia emissions and, on the other hand, be an important source of zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, proper treatment is required. The present study explored the modification of the pH value of pig slurry using by-products from different agro-industrial activities as a strategy to control these two problems. Three approaches were used, namely acidification and biological acidification (bio-acidification) to pH 5 and alkalization to pH 9.5. The most promising of the 14 different additives and additive combinations initially considered should be able to reach the target pH at a dose of less than 20% (m/m). The presence of Salmonella and the number of Escherichia coli colony forming units (CFU) were evaluated in the slurry for each selected treatment. To ensure that treated slurry remains of interest as an organic fertilizer, the impact of treated slurry on plant germination and nitrogen (N) availability was also assessed. The by-products from the brewing and yeast industry failed to reduce the pH to 5. In fact, the bio-acidification of pig slurry was only possible with additives rich in carbon. Although slurry sanitization (<1000 CFU E.coli g(-1) slurry) was not guaranteed by all treatments, a reduction in E.coli numbers was observed with all additives. The ammonium content of the treated slurry was significantly reduced (up to 20%) with treatments involving bio-acidification. N mineralization was evidenced for all additives used for slurry alkalinization but no N mineralization was observed when using acidification with H2SO4 or by-product spent acid. The phytotoxicity bioassay showed that most additives do not have a negative impact on germination. The results presented here suggest that agro-industrial by-products are capable of modifying the pH of pig slurry. Depending on the pH modification strategy and additive used, treated slurry may be safer and of higher fertilizing value than untreated (raw) slurry.

AB  - In a novel study, Getzin et al. (2022) have excavated 500 grasses at four regions of the Namib to systematically investigate the temporal process of how the young grasses die in fairy circles. Based on measurements of the root lengths, statistical testing, and comparative photo documentations the authors showed that sand termite herbivory did not cause the death of the freshly germinated grasses within fairy circles (FCs). Roots of those dead grasses were initially undamaged and even longer than those of the living grasses outside in the vegetation matrix, which is contrary to termite herbivory. The dying annual grasses within FCs had significantly higher rootto-shoot ratios than the vital grasses in the matrix, both of which can be attributed to the same grass-triggering rain event. This indicates that they died from water stress because the desiccating grasses invested biomass resources into roots, trying to reach the deeper soil layers with more moisture, but they failed. J & uuml;rgens and Gro <spacing diaeresis>ngro <spacing diaeresis>ft (2023) commented on our research findings. Here, we shed light on their statements by investigating the existing data evidence on the Namib fairy circles, which includes a thorough literature review about the proposed termite-feeding mechanism, as well as describing the properties of soil water within and around the FCs. Our review shows that there is no single study to date that has demonstrated with systematic field evidence in the form of root measurements and data from several regions of the Namib that the green germinating grasses within the FCs would be killed by root herbivory of sand termites. We emphasize that the top 10 cm of soil in the FCs is very susceptible to drying out. In this topsoil layer, the freshly germinated grasses with their 10 cm long roots die quickly after rainfall due to lack of water, because these small plants cannot reach and utilize the higher soil moisture content, which is only found in deeper soil layers below the dry topsoil. Based on 400 measurements of soil moisture during the rainy season 2024, we show that the topsoil in the FCs is significantly drier than in the matrix outside. Finally, we show that the soil physical conditions allow a very high hydraulic conductivity that supports the "uptake-diffusion feedback " during the first weeks after grass-triggering rainfall. During the first two weeks, the soil moisture at 20 cm depth ranged for several rainfall events between 9% and 18% within the FCs, hence way above the 6 -8% threshold below which the hydraulic conductivity strongly declines. Even 20 days after rainfall, soil moisture was still above 8%. During this biologically active period, new grasses germinate after about five days, the large perennial grasses along the FC edge resprout and strongly draw water with their established root system at 20 -30 cm depth, and the freshly germinated grasses in the FCs desiccate and die within 10 -20 days. With our continuous soil moisture measurements, we argue that the quickly greening and competitively superior grasses on the FC edge, as well as the vital matrix grasses, draw soil water from the FCs. This rapid depletion of soil water and drying out of the topsoil leads to the death of the new grasses in the fairy circles.

AB  - Alpine musk deer is critically endangered and valuable animal. Adult male Alpine musk deer secrete musk, which can be used in traditional Chinese medicine and perfume industry. Alpine musk deer has been farmed for ex-situ conservation and sustainable musk provision. As Alpine musk deer is timid and solitary species, it is likely to develop stereotypical behaviour in captive environment. Stereotypical behaviour is unnatural and harmful behaviour performed by captive animals due to many factors, such as appetite and environmental constraint. In this study, the development of stereotypical behaviour was explored in captive Alpine musk deer fawns, which were all in lactation period (1-5 months of age). The stereotypical behaviours of fawns were observed and recorded by focal sampling and all-occurrence recording. The specific value of stereotypical behaviour time and sampling time of each fawn was used to show the change in each month of age and the results showed that, the fawns of 5 months old exhibited higher stereotypical behaviour than fawns that of 1 and 2 months old (P <0.01). Fawns displayed oral stereotypical behaviour (OSB, e.g., stereotypical licking) earlier than moving stereotypical behaviour (MSB, e.g., to-fro-walking), while the MSB was higher (0.080 +/- 0.028, N = 19) than OSB (0.034 +/- 0.012, N = 28) (P = 0.059). In conclusion, stereotypical behaviour displayed in each month of age in captive Alpine musk deer fawns and this might be attributed to lactation, changes in feeding composition and environmental spatial constraints. This suggested that the lactation period was key for fawns to develop behaviour and necessary measures should be put in the conversation of musk deer fawns.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of low temperature on biogas fermentation system. Biogas fermentation inoculum was domesticated at 4 degrees C, and subsequently inoculated into pig manure feedstock in a batch biogas fermentation process. A low-temperature biogas fermentation system was maintained at 9 degrees C, and its abiotic factors, bacterial community, and archaeal community were determined. The results showed that (1) the biogas fermentation lasted for 160 days, with a total gas production of 19,150 ml, including N-2 production of 11,370 ml, CO2 production of 3,534 ml, and CH4 production of 3,031 ml. (2) The average relative abundance of the primary dominant bacterium operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was 30%, with 100% similarity to Pseudomonas caeni , atypical denitrifying bacterium. The average relative abundance of the secondary dominant bacterium OTU was 20.36%, with 99% similarity to Clostridium cellulovorans, a typical cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading bacterium. The average relative abundance of the primary dominant methanogenic archaeon OTU was 7.22%, with 99% similarity to Methanosphaera cuniculi, a typical methylotrophic methanogen, and the secondary dominant methanogenic archaeon OTU had an average relative abundance of 4.15%, with 98% similarity to Methanocorpusculum sinense, a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen. (3) The primary dominant bacterial genus Pseudomonas exhibited highly significant negative correlations with the dominant biogas-producing microorganisms such as Clostridium, Terrisporobacter, Turicibacter, Methanosphaera, and Methanocorpusculum. We concluded that (1) high concentrations of abiotic factors such as ammonia nitrogen, acetic acid, and propionic acid were important indicators of relatively poor operation of low-temperature biogas fermentation systems, while (2) high numbers of MCG archaea and Pseudomonas were important biotic factors showing comparatively poor operation of the system.

AB  - The distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) derived from compost in soil-plant systems is a serious issue. One possible remedy is the application of biochar-containing compost. In this study, cucumber quality and the abundance of ARGs in soil-cucumber systems under different compost treatments, namely, traditional pig manure and corn straw compost (PC); pig manure, corn straw, and large particle size biochar (5-10 mm) compost (PCLB); and pig manure, corn straw, and small particle size biochar (<2 mm) compost (PCSB); were investigated. The results showed that, under PCSB, the yield, vitamin C and soluble protein content of the cucumbers were the highest, while the absolute abundance of intI2 was reduced in the soil. The amount of available potassium in the soil contributed the most to changes in cucumber yield and quality. The total absolute abundance of ARGs in the soil was highest in PC, followed by PCLB, PCSB, and CK (control treatment without fertilization) treatments. Compared to CK treatments, PCLB and PCSB applications to the soil decreased the abundance of sul1 and tetG by 42-57% and 38-80%, respectively, in the cucumbers. In summary, the PCSB application was more beneficial in increasing soil nutrient content; improving cucumber yield, vitamin C, and soluble protein content; and reducing the risk of input and transport of ARGs in the soil-cucumber system.

AB  - Recreational fishing is popular worldwide, but many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing increased participation and reduced catches. Like other LMICs, the recreational fishery in Namibia is facing concerns regarding its sustainability. Empirical evidence suggested limited knowledge of the fish and fishery as one plausible cause. Herein, we used a horizon scan survey to identify critical questions by anglers and decision makers to facilitate sustainable and adaptive management strategies. Of 115 questions and concerns raised by 59 stakeholders, including fisheries managers, anglers (specialists and non-specialists), and scientists, 58 of the top research questions were organised within 11 high-priority themes, including: governance; human dimensions; regulatory actions; compliance; knowledge of fish populations; resource monitoring and data acquisition; angler outreach, education, and engagement; competing sectors/groups; bioeconomics; catch-and-release practises and perceived threats. Questions raised by non-specialist anglers differed from those raised by specialist anglers and scientists, which highlighted the potential importance of integrating fisher ecological knowledge into fishery management. Although questions were in the context of recreational fisheries, we recommend that some of the themes identified herein may be applicable to other LMICs and may also improve understanding of other fisheries, such as small-scale or commercial fisheries.

AB  - Predators elicit antipredator behaviors such as proactive and reactive movements in prey, but both are rarely investigated simultaneously. Impacts of human predation risk on antipredator behaviors can be greater than those of nonhuman predators, resulting in increased effects on populations and community structure. We compared the influence of human and nonhuman predation risk on proactive and reactive antipredator movement behaviors of male Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo, hereafter turkey). We used simultaneously collected GPS locations from 31 turkeys and 36 coyotes (Canis latrans) to investigate the antipredator behavior of turkeys to coyotes. To assess antipredator behaviors of turkeys to hunters, we used 1661 hunting tracks collected while monitoring 109 turkeys. For proactive movements, we quantified how predation risk influenced resource selection. To investigate reactive movements, we quantified changes in movement behavior of turkeys after encountering hunters and coyotes. Coyote and turkey home range overlap was high, but lack of core area overlap, encounters, and similar resource selection suggested the use of different areas on the landscape. Turkeys selected areas associated with decreased coyote risk and closer to hardwoods. Coyotes preferred shrubs and open areas, suggesting turkeys avoided coyote risk and the habitats coyotes preferred. We detected 17 coyote and turkey contacts, and the probability of contact decreased by 16.6% for every 100 m farther from a forest edge. Turkeys did not display reactive movement behaviors after a direct encounter with coyotes, as step lengths were similar prior to and after encounters, which did not differ from random step lengths. After hunting, turkeys selected areas farther from public access points and closer to private property, suggesting proactive avoidance of hunter risk. We detected 31 hunter and turkey contacts; increased step lengths after hunter contacts suggested fleeing behavior. The probability of a hunter-turkey contact decreased by 5.5% for every 100 m farther from a secondary road. Antipredator movement behaviors by turkeys suggest coyote risk to be low over a broad temporal window, while hunter risk is high for a narrow temporal window. We provide insight into how human-induced fear can cause antipredator behavioral responses greater than nonhuman fear, potentially causing changes in species distribution and community structure.

AB  - Conflict between rival groups is rife in nature. While recent work has begun exploring the behavioural consequences of this intergroup conflict, studies have primarily considered just the 1-2 h immediately after single interactions with rivals or their cues. Using a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula), we conducted week-long manipulations to investigate longer-term impacts of intergroup conflict. Compared to a single presentation of control herbivore faeces, one rival-group faecal presentation (simulating a territorial intrusion) resulted in more within-group grooming the following day, beyond the likely period of conflict-induced stress. Repeated presentations of outsider cues led to further changes in baseline behaviour by the end of the week: compared to control weeks, mongooses spent less time foraging and foraged closer to their groupmates, even when there had been no recent simulated intrusion. Moreover, there was more baseline territorial scent-marking and a higher likelihood of group fissioning in intrusion weeks. Consequently, individuals gained less body mass at the end of weeks with repeated simulated intrusions. Our experimental findings provide evidence for longer-term, extended and cumulative, effects of an elevated intergroup threat, which may lead to fitness consequences and underpin this powerful selective pressure.

AB  - Six dosages of DM (0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 10%, 15% and 20%) were added into initial mixtures for 42 days of aerobic composting to investigate the optimum added dosage of Diatomite (DM) during co-composting of pig manure and sawdust. The results showed that adding DM was beneficial for reducing CH4 emissions and greenhouse gas emission equivalent (GHGE) values by 15.63-24.25% and 14.33-69.08%, respectively. Meanwhile, the main contributor to the GHGE value was N2O (58.76-75.98%), followed by CH4 (17.22-29.16%) and NH3 (6.38-13.36%). Moreover, the maximum values in the degradation of total organic matter and the formation rate of humic acid were 20.46% and 82.19% in 10% DM added treatment (T3), respectively. Furthermore, the increase in spectral parameters, including the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), the specific UV absorbance at 280 nm (SUVA(280)) and Fourier transform - infrared parameters were facilitated by DM amendment. Additionally, the higher values of the relative abundances of Proteobacteria (50.98%) and Bacteroidetes (12.73%), and related metabolisms such as carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism, as well as the lower value of methane metabolism reported in T3, supported the difference in CH4 and humification of the two treatments. In conclusion, DM was determined to be an eco-practical additive to improve the quality of end products and reduce potential risks, and the best treatment in this study was 10% added treatment based on dry weight.

AB  - During a research on morphological diversity of gill ectoparasites on native and non-native fishes from tributaries (Palizada, El Recreo and Lacantiln rivers) of the Usumacinta River Basin in the states of Campeche, Tabasco, and Chiapas (southern Mexico), the following monogenoids were found: Icelanonchohaptor tropicalis n. sp. on Usumacinta buffalo Ictiobus meridionalis (Gunther, 1868) (Catostomidae); Heteropriapulus simplexiodes n. sp. and Heteropriapulus heterotylioides n. sp. on catfishes Pterygoplichthys pardalis (Castelnau, 1855) (Loricariidae) (type host) and Pterygoplichthys disyunctivus (Weber, 1991); Ligictaluridus mirabilis (Mueller 1937; Klassen and BeverleyBurton1985 from the southern blue catfish Ictalurus meridionalis (Gunther, 1864) (Ictaluridae); Aristocleidus mexicanus Mendoza-Franco, Tapia and Caspeta-Mandujano, 2015 on Eugerres mexicanus (Steindachner, 1863) (Gerreidae) (all monogenoidean species in the Dactylogyridae); and Diplectanocotyla megalopis Rakotofiringa and Oliver1987 (Diplectanidae) on tarpon Megalops atlanticus Valenciennes, 1847 (Megalopidae). The new species of Icelanonchohaptor and Heteropriapulus are herein described for the first time from a native catostomid and nonnative Pterygoplichthys spp., respectively. While I. tropicalis n. sp. and L. mirabilis are morphologically comparable with their congeners from the Nearctic (i.e., United States and Canada), all other monogenoids exhibited Neotropical affinities. Present study shown that the gill monogenoids on native and non-native fishes in the Neotropical Mexican transition zone of the Usumacinta River basin are equally represented by species with Nearctic and Neotropical affinities including those adapted to freshwater environment in this area from marine ancestry.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an important tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production. A prolonged retention time by adding an extra anaerobic digestion step can be utilized to further degrade the digestates, contributing to increased nitrogen mineralisation and reducing decomposable organic matter. These modifications could influence the potential N fertiliser value of the digestate and soil carbon sequestration after field application. This study investigated the effects of prolonging retention time by implementing an additional anaerobic digestion step on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the soil and soil carbon sequestration. Two digestates obtained from two biogas plants operating at contrasting hydraulic retention times, with and without an additional digestion step, were applied to a loamy sand soil. N mineralisation dynamics were measured during 80 days and C mineralisation during 212 days. After 80 days of incubation, the net inorganic N release from digestates obtained from a secondary AD step increased by 9-17 % (% of the N input) compared to corresponding digestates obtained from a primary AD step. A kinetic four-pool carbon model was used to fit C mineralisation data to estimate carbon sequestration in the soil. After 212 days of incubation, the net C mineralisation was highest in undigested solid biomass (68 %) and digestates obtained from the primary AD step (59-65 %). The model predicted that 26-54 % of C applied is seques-tered in the soil in the long-term. The long-term soil C retention related to the C present before digestion was similar for one-and two-step AD at 12-16 %. We conclude that optimizing the anaerobic digestion configurations by including a secondary AD step could potentially replace more mineral N fertiliser due to an improved N fertiliser value of the resultant digestate without affecting carbon sequestration negatively.

AB  - This study attempts to provide a deeper insight into the current genetic status of 12 Bulgarian autochthonous sheep breeds using microsatellite (SSR) markers. A total of 600 individuals from 50 flocks were analyzed using a panel of 13 SSR markers. In total, 228 alleles were found in the studied microsatellite loci. The mean number of alleles, the effective number of alleles, and the polymorphic information content (PIC) values per locus were 17.54, 5.250, and 0.799, respectively. The expected heterozygosity (He) for all breeds ranged from 0.70 to 0.82. The within-population heterozygote deficit (Fis) varied from -0.03 to 0.1, reflecting significant levels for 10 of the 12 breeds. The average genetic differentiation (Fst) was 0.046, revealing a low discrimination between the breeds. The genetic distance, principal coordinate analysis, and the structure analysis showed that two of the studied breeds-Local Stara Zagora/SZ/ and Local Karnobat/MK/-were the most distinct sheep populations. The Bayesian clustering approach suggested poor breed differentiation for the remaining 10 sheep breeds. The results suggest that proper management strategies and specific breeding policies need to be implemented in Bulgaria to avoid the intermixing of breeds and to reduce the erosion of breed purity observed in some breeds.

AB  - Proper development of the placenta, the transient support organ forms after embryo implantation, is essential for a successful pregnancy. However, the regulation of trophoblast invasion, which is most important during placentation, remains largely unknown. Here, rats, mice, and pigs are used as biomedical models, used scRNA-seq to comparatively elucidate the regulatory mechanism of placental trophoblast invasion, and verified it using a human preeclampsia disease model combined with scStereo-seq. A dual-featured type of immune-featured trophoblast (iTrophoblast) is unexpectedly discovered. Interestingly, iTrophoblast only exists in invasive placentas and regulates trophoblast invasion during placentation. In a normally developing placenta, iTrophoblast gradually transforms from an immature state into a functional mature state as it develops. Whereas in the developmentally abnormal preeclamptic placenta, disordered iTrophoblast transformation leads to the accumulation of immature iTrophoblasts, thereby disrupting trophoblast invasion and ultimately leading to the progression of preeclampsia.
   Through cross-species comparison, this study reveals the presence of a dual-featured type of immune-featured trophoblast (iTrophoblast) in invasive placentas, which regulates trophoblast invasion during placentation. Immature iTrophoblasts gradually transform into functional maturity with development, and their transformation disorder leads to the accumulation of immature iTrophoblasts, thereby disrupting trophoblast invasion and causing disease progression. image

AB  - Considering the surface of individual tree compartments, it is obvious that the main portion of bark, i.e., the largest area and the greatest bulk mass, is located on the stem. We focused on basic bark properties, specifically thickness, surface area, biomass, and specific surface mass (expressed as dry weight per square unit) on stems of four broadleaved species: common aspen (Populus tremula L.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). Based on the previous work from mature forests, we hypothesize that bark properties of young trees are also species-specific and change along the stem profile. Thus, across the regions of Slovakia, we selected 27 forest stands composed of one of the target broadleaved species with ages up to 12 years. From the selected forests, 600 sample trees were felled and stem bark properties were determined by measuring bark thickness, weighing bark mass after its separation from the stem, and drying to achieve a constant weight. Since the bark originated from trees of varying stem diameters and from different places along the stem (sections from the stem base 0-50, 51-100, 101-150, 151-200, and 201-250 cm), we could create regression models of stem characteristics based on the two mentioned variables. Our results confirmed that bark thickness, thus also specific surface mass, increased with stem diameter and decreased with distance from the stem base. While common aspen had the thickest stem bark (4.5 mm on the stem base of the largest trees) the thinnest bark from the analyzed species was found for sycamore (nearly three times thinner than the bark of aspen). Since all four tree species are very attractive to large wild herbivores as forage, besides other uses, we might consider our bark mass models also in terms of estimating forage potential and quantity of bark mass consumed by the herbivory.

AB  - Swine farms serve as critical reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), yet the frequency of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) remains poorly understood. In this study, we explored the gene exchange within the "swine farm-human-pig" network and assessed its risks. We identified 16,612 plasmid contigs from 107 field samples, revealing a significant presence of previously uncharacterized plasmid types. Notably, 52.88 % of acquired ARGs were located on plasmids, with 71.22 % containing at least one mobile genetic element (MGE). We quantified HGTs at the microbial community level among the human gut, pig gut, and swine farm environments. Among 4687 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), 3008 were involved in 11,250 HGTs. HGT linkages were most frequently identified between microbial genomes from the swine farm and the human gut microbiome. ARGs were involved in 91 HGT events, with 645 events linked to MGEs and 16 related to virulence factors, suggesting potential cross-species transmission of clinical pathogens. The detection of 32 Rank I ARGs and the identification of increased resistome risks underscore the extensive dispersion of livestock-related contaminants into more distant environmental compartments. This study elucidates the complexities of gene exchange networks in swine farm environments, underscoring the urgent need for strategies to mitigate risks associated with the antibiotic resistome.

AB  - In response to varying environments along urban and rural gradients, invasive plants may strategically allocate resources to enhance their invasiveness. However, how invasive plants balance their resources for growth, reproduction, and defense as responses to biotic and abiotic factors across these gradients remain unclear. We conducted field surveys on the growth, reproduction, and herbivory of the invasive species Phytolacca americana across diverse urban and rural habitats. Leaf samples were collected to analyze the nutritional content, primary and secondary metabolites. We found that plant growth rates, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, and concentrations of flavonoids and saponins were higher in urban habitats, while reproduction, herbivory, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios were lower than those in rural habitats. We also found a trade-off between growth rate and herbivory, as well as trade-offs among defense traits associated with herbivory (e.g., leaf mass per area, the inverse of leaf nitrogen content, and carbon-nitrogen ratio) and the production of metabolites associated with abiotic stress tolerance (e.g., soluble sugars, flavonoids, and saponins). As earlier studies showed low levels of genetic diversity within and between populations, our findings suggest that the urban-rural gradient patterns of resource allocation are primarily phenotypic plasticity in response to herbivory in rural areas and abiotic factors

AB  - Predation is the most important cause of nest failure in the Chinese Grouse (Tetrastes sewerzowi). However, no studies have been conducted to document the nest predators responsible for nest predation events. During 2012-2016, we monitored 17 nests using infrared video cameras to identify nest predators of Chinese Grouse. Six nests were preyed upon during the incubation period. We successfully identified the predators responsible for 5 depredated nests: Asian badger (Meles leucurus), hog badger (Arctonyx collaris), and Blue Eared Pheasant (Crossoptilon auritum). The Asian badger was responsible for 3 of these nest predation events. We recorded Siberian chipmunk (Tamias sibiricus) and an unidentified rodent species attempting to prey upon grouse eggs, but none of them were successful.

AB  - Animal population abundance is a significant parameter for studies on invasive species that can threaten the ecosystem. Researchers have been developing population estimation methods since the 18th century, in order to evaluate species' evolution and environmental effects. However, studies on the population density of the invasive species Callinectes sapidus are very limited. The present work, using a simulation model combined with field measurements, examines an innovative methodology for estimating the current population of the invasive species Callinectes sapidus in a shallow Mediterranean coastal lagoon. The methodology presented here builds the first stage of modeling and predicting the evolution of this species' population in marine environments. The simulation model's results are validated with an estimation of the total population based on juvenile abundance, and a curvature of the species population estimation based on cage catch is implemented. The simulation experiments presented here show the possibility of a robust prediction for blue crab population estimation.

AB  - In ant-plant mutualisms mediated by plant-based liquid resources (e.g., extrafloral and pericarpial nectar), third-party exploiters are often present. Usually, the costs of having exploiters species seem to have little to no effect on ant-plant mutualistic interaction. However, little is known about how and to what extent exploiters affect mutualistic interactions. In this study, we evaluated the cascading effects of Rhinoleucophenga myrmecophaga (Diptera) predatory larvae on the outcomes of the interaction between mutualistic ants and a pericarpial nectary (PN)-bearing plant, Cordiera elliptica (Rubiaceae). In a manipulative experiment controlling for the presence of ants and/or predatory larvae, we evaluated arthropods and larvae, plant fitness, and pericarpial nectar production. We found that: (a) the presence of larvae decreased ant abundance by 50% resulting in an increase of arthropod number by 38%; (b) the absence of ants negatively influenced larva development and survival; (c) fruits with larvae and without ants had lower volume and weight, fewer viable seeds, and a higher parasitism rate; and (d) the pericarpial nectar sugar concentration is higher in plants with larvae and without ants. We showed that the outcomes of the multitrophic relationship between ants, R. myrmecophaga larvae, and an PN-bearing plant led to costly cascading effects on this mutualistic relationship. This interaction can range from negative to positive, in which the predatory fly larvae directly and indirectly influence ants number and behavior, and consequently the plant fitness.

AB  - Investigation of soil internal nitrogen cycles is useful for unravelling the mechanisms responsible for soil nitrogen availability change. Here, gross nitrogen transformations were investigated in a subtropical karst area after 16 years of vegetation restoration. The experiment included four treatments with one control and three restoration strategies, that is: (i) maize-soybean rotation field (CR, control); (ii) restoration with Toona sinensis (TS); (iii) restoration with Guimu-1 hybrid elephant grass (GG, Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke x Pennisetum purpureum Schumach); and (iv) restoration with Guimu-1 hybrid elephant grass and Zenia insignis as a mixture (ZG). Soil NH4+ and NO3- responded differentially to three restoration strategies, resulting in no significant change of total inorganic N content following vegetation restoration. Gross nitrogen mineralization (GNM) rate increased by 124.0%, 96.8%, and 60.3% in TS, GG, and ZG, respectively, relative to CR (2.88 +/- 0.05 mg N kg(-1) d(-1)). The strongest explanatory variable was microbial biomass carbon for both GNM (R-2 = 0.82) and gross nitrification (R-2 = 0.66). Dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+ (DNRA) rate in TS or ZG, which was significantly greater than that in CR, was significantly correlated with SOC: NO3- ratio (R-2 = 0.61), implying that DNRA was limited by SOC availability. Gross NH4+ immobilization rate, which was highest in GG, and lowest in CR, was best predicted by carbon to nitrogen ratio (R-2 = 0.65). However, gross NO3- immobilization rate could not be well predicted by the measured soil properties. Our results suggest that vegetation restoration especially TS significantly enhanced soil N availability as reflected by gross N mineralization rate.

AB  - Reconstructing the conditions and circumstances under which the human lineage evolved is of great interest to those disciplines related to human evolution, especially in fields such as archaeoecology and human paleoecology. A mathematical model was presented almost a decade ago aimed to reconstructing the human populations that the Pleistocene paleoecosystems could support. This model followed a paleosynecological perspective, being focused on: (i) estimating the availability of meat resources in the paleoecosystems, as these resources are vital for human survival; and (ii) measuring the level of competition for these resources among the members of the carnivore guild, including hominins. The model has been applied since then to several Pleistocene localities of Europe, with particular emphasis on the Orce and Sierra de Atapuerca sites. In this study, we use the model for estimating predator-prey biomass ratios and compare the model outputs with the values measured in present-day African ecosystems. The results obtained confirm that our paleosynecological approach provides estimates of predator-prey biomass ratios that are broadly similar to those measured in the extant ecosystems. However, our estimates tend to be slightly higher than expected, which is probably due to the weight of species that satisfy part of their nutritional requirements with resources other than the meat from large herbivores. This allows us to assume that our model performs relatively well, although it has room for methodological improvements.

AB  - Consumer metabolism controls the energy uptake from the environment and its allocation to biomass production. In natural ecosystems, available energy in food often fails to predict biomass production which is also (co)limited by the relative availability of various dietary compounds. To date, the link between energy metabolism and the effects of food chemical composition on biomass production remains elusive. Here, we measured the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of Daphnia magna along ontogeny when undergoing various (non-energetic) nutritional constraints. All types of dietary (co)limitations (Fatty acids, Sterols, Phosphorus) induced an increase in mass-specific RMR up to 128% between highest and lowest quality diets. We highlight a strong negative correlation between RMR and growth rate indicating RMR as a promising predictor of consumer growth rate. We argue that quantifying the energetic cost imposed by food quality on individual RMR may constitute a common currency enabling the integration of nutritional and metabolic ecology.

AB  - Objectives This article presents new radiocarbon and isotopic data to provide further information about the diet of the indigenous population of La Gomera and its possible changes across time.
   Materials and methods delta C-13 and delta N-15 of 53 human and 19 faunal samples from different sites on the island have been obtained and analyzed. Of these, 52 have been radiocarbon dated to provide insight on chronological changes.
   Results Human dates range from the 3rd to 15th centuries AD, while faunal dates range from the 1st to 17th centuries AD. Stable carbon and nitrogen values are significantly different between the human and goat samples and have also a trophic increase of 3.4 parts per thousand. Although male and female delta N-15 data are not significantly different. Both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of both human and animal samples tend to discretely decrease over time.
   Discussion Radiocarbon dates from humans correlate with other dates obtained in the rest of the archipelago. Animal radiocarbon dates generally coincide except for one date, which requires further study. Isotopic delta N-15 data suggest a mix of marine and terrestrial protein consumption in humans, the latter being more abundant given the seasonality of the first. delta C-13 data also suggest a possible mixed diet in humans, with a predominance of C-3 plants, like Hordeum vulgare, the only grain found in archaeological sites so far. Variations of both delta C-13 and delta N-15 over time suggest a slight modification on the diet, which could be related to environmental changes.

AB  - The co-fertilization of nitrogen (N) and zinc (Zn) offers significant advantages in improving the growth and development of tea plants (Camellia sinensis L). However, the corresponding responses of rhizosphere microecology remain unclear. In this study, a pot experiment was performed to investigate the effects of N-Zn co-fertilization on rhizosphere soil's N availability, the rhizobacterial community and the metabolism of tea plants. N-Zn co-fertilization significantly increased the soil total of N, NH4+-N and NO3--N contents. 16S rRNA sequencing found that N-Zn co-fertilization recruited rhizobacteria associated with N cycling and Zn activation, including Proteobacteria, Acidobacteriota and Gemmatimonadota, resulting in complex rhizobacterial networks. Metabolomics analysis indicated obvious interferences in the metabolisms of lipids, amino acids and cofactors and vitamins after fertilization. PLS-PM analysis suggested that fertilization had both direct and indirect influences on the rhizobacterial community and differential metabolites. RDA models identified pH (R-2 = 0.734, p < 0.01; R-2 = 0.808, p < 0.01) and total N (R-2 = 0.633, p < 0.05; R-2 = 0.608, p < 0.01) as dominant factors influencing both the rhizobacterial community and differential metabolites. Finally, network analysis found significant associations between rhizobacteria related to N cycling and Zn mobilization and metabolic processes involved in N metabolism and responses to Zn stress. These findings underscored that appropriate N-Zn co-fertilization is crucial for the rhizosphere soil's N availability and the microenvironment of tea plants.

AB  - Although not without controversy, the cognitive map in mammals and birds (avian reptiles) is generally accepted as plausible. The evidence for similar cognitive abilities is not generally accepted in other vertebrates and invertebrates. A plethora of recent work in nonavian reptiles, however, suggests that these taxa may indeed possess advanced cognitive processing and so may, in principle, be capable of using a cognitive map. To consider the possibility that a nonavian reptile might use a cognitive map, we reexamined the movement of the semiaquatic turtle (Chrysemys picta) in our highly accessible system where turtles follow highly conserved, precise and predictable migratory routes. We determined the movement rate and tortuosity of freely migrating turtles before, during and after a pharmacological manipulation that disrupted their ability to retrieve and create spatial memories. We found that turtles moved linearly on traditional routes prior to treatment. After pharmacological treatment, turtle move-ments became highly tortuous as they moved in some cases hundreds of metres away from their migratory routes. Once turtles recovered their spatial cognitive abilities, they returned directly to their migratory paths using linear movements suggestive of deliberate and purposeful navigation. Although other processes could potentially explain observed turtle movement patterns, we were able to exclude them by new or previous data, or strong inference. What remains is a robust behavioural observation that is consistent with the use of a cognitive map by turtles in our system. As such, we urge researchers to continue to be open to the possibility of cognitive maps in nonmodel taxa, such as nonavian reptiles, to continue to expand our understanding of the evolution of cognition.

AB  - Background Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is an economically significant transboundary viral disease of sheep and goats caused by the PPRV virus, affecting annual losses of 1.45-2.10 billion US dollars globally. We designed the current study to evaluate the positive cases, molecular characterization, phylogenetic analysis, and risk factors correlated with the disease in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, with the aim of contributing to these strategies. Methods and results A total of 384 samples from three selected districts, i.e., Peshawar, Charsadda and Chitral (n = 128 each), were collected, and the virus was investigated by using the sandwich ELISA, while the N gene of the virus was used as a target for molecular detection via RT-PCR. The confirmed samples were then sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. According to our findings, the highest positive cases was found in district Peshawar (50.87%), followed by Charsadda and Chitral (24.56%), respectively, while risk factor analysis showed that certain categories, such as species, sex, and age less than two years, have higher risk (P < 0.05) in contrast to their respective categories. Furthermore, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of representative samples showed that the PPRV strains in the current study clustered in lineage IV, which is circulating in the small ruminant population of Asia, the Middle East, and African countries. Comparative residue analysis highlighted the mutation by representing 242 variable sites out of 371 locations. Conclusions PPRV has foremost importance in Pakistan because the virus was detected in a considerable number of samples, and most of which were sourced from subsidiary areas where veterinary services are not prioritized.

AB  - Plants have developed different defense mechanisms to protect themselves from the attack of herbivores. Plant defenses can be categorized into two types: constitutive, which are present before herbivore attack, and induced, which are activated upon attack. Some herbivores have developed the ability to neutralize either or both types of plant defenses, and plant defenses may act against their own interest when they negatively affect herbivore's natural enemies such predator insects and mites. Here we investigated whether herbivore-induced tomato defenses mediated by jasmonic acid (JA) affect the density of predator biological control agents and thus affect biological pest control negatively. Specifically, we assessed predator-herbivore abundances in greenhouse experiments on two tomato genotypes, a wild type (Castlemart) expressing the JA-mediated defense pathway and a mutant of the wild type (def-1) unable to activate this defense path. Plants were infested with either Bemisia tabaci, a pest that suppresses the activation of the JA defense path, or Frankliniella occidentalis, a pest species that induces JA defenses. As predators, we used four species of natural enemies, two phytoseiid mites and two predatory bugs, one of each pair able to colonize tomato crops (Typhlodromus (A.) recki, Macrolophus pygmaeus) and the other not (Amblyseius swirskii, Orius laevigatus). Results suggest that JA-mediated defenses do not have a negative impact on predator density. Instead, glandular trichomes likely contributed to the unsuccessful pest control. Yet, JA-mediated defenses are key for plant protection against herbivore species that cannot avoid this line of defense.

AB  - The extinct camelid Camelops hesternus, a prominent member of the late Pleistocene fauna of western North America, was among the megafauna that became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. The recovery of a tibia of an adult Camelops from a gravel pit near Vernal, Uintah County, Utah, adds to the 10 records of the species previously documented in Utah. Only a few radiocarbon dates are available for Camelops, so the radiocarbon date of the Vernal specimen at 28,750 +/- 190 rcy (33,760-32,225 cal year), while not close in time to the North American megafaunal extinct event, is the oldest radiocarbon date for the species and aids documenting its geographical distribution in time prior to its extinction.The extinct camelid Camelops hesternus, a prominent member of the late Pleistocene fauna of western North America, was among the megafauna that became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene.

AB  - Small wild mammals have been used to measure the damage caused by exposure to oil-contaminated soil, including deer mice. However, the study of toxic effects of crude oil using oxidative damage biomarkers in the wild rodent Calomys laucha (Vesper mouse) is absent. This investigation aimed to evaluate the effects of acute exposure to contaminated soil with different concentrations of crude oil (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8% w/w), simulating an accidental spill, using oxidative stress biomarkers in the liver, kidneys, lungs, testes, paw muscle, and lymphocytes of C. laucha. Animals exposed to the contaminated soil showed increases in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation at the highest exposure concentrations in most organ homogenates analyzed and also in blood cells, but responses to total antioxidant capacity were tissue-dependent. These results showed that acute exposure to oil-contaminated soil caused oxidative damage in C. laucha and indicate these small mammals may be susceptible to suffer the impacts of such contamination in its occurrence region, threatening the species' survival.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a pivotal process in renal fibrosis and various kidney disorders, with hypoxia recognized as a key trigger. Yaks, having adapted to high-altitude, hypoxic environments over generations, exhibit unique hypoxia adaptation mechanism. However, it remains unclear whether hypoxia promotes EMT in yak kidneys. In this study, we demonstrated that hypoxia did not induce EMT in yak kidneys. By inducing hypoxia in yak renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), we observed that chronic hypoxia inhibited the protein expression of N-cadherin and Fibronectin while upregulating E-cadherin expression. This suggests that chronic hypoxia suppresses EMT in yak kidneys. To further investigate the underlying mechanism, we conducted RNA-Seq analysis on hypoxia-treated RTECs, which revealed that the prolyl hydroxylase-2 (EGLN1) and the TGF-(31 pathway might play central roles in this process. Subsequently, we confirmed that activation of the TGF-(31 pathway can induce EMT. We also provided evidence that overexpression or knockdown of EGLN1 inhibited or enhanced, respectively, TGF-(31-induced EMT-specific protein expression in RTECs. Additionally, EGLN1 effectively suppresses RTEC migration while promoting cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions. These findings suggest that yaks may protect their kidneys from hypoxia-induced EMT by upregulating the expression of EGLN1 under chronic hypoxia.

AB  - The use of worldwide glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup (R) is growing and to date its effects on mammalian spermatozoa are controversial. This study aims to investigate the functional impact of in vitro exposure of pig spermatozoa to low concentrations of Roundup (R) Ultra Plus (RUP), similar to those present as environment contaminants, to its active ingredient glyphosate, and to the non-active component, surfactant polyoxyethyleneamine (POEA). Pig spermatozoa were incubated in Tyrode's basal medium (TBM) or Tyrode's complete medium (TCM) (1 h at 38.5 degrees C) with several RUP dilutions or equivalent concentrations of glyphosate or POEA. RUP treatment causes a significant dilution-dependent decrease in sperm motility, a significant increase in plasma membrane disorganization and reduction in GSK3 beta phosphorylation (TBM) and in two PKA substrates (TBM and TCM), whereas does not affect sperm viability or mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Equivalent glyphosate concentrations do not affect any functional sperm parameters. However, POEA concentrations equivalent to RUP dilutions mimic all RUP sperm effects: decrease sperm motility in a concentration-dependent manner, increase sperm plasma membrane lipid disorder and significantly inhibit GSK3 beta phosphorylation (TBM) and two PKA substrates without affecting sperm viability or MMP. In summary, low concentrations RUP herbicide cause sperm motility impairment without affecting sperm viability. This adverse effect could be likely due to a detrimental effect in the plasma membrane lipid organization and to inhibition of phosphorylation of both, GSK3 beta and specific PKA substrates. Importantly, our results indicate that negative effects of low RUP concentrations in pig spermatozoa function are likely caused by the surfactant included in its formulation and no by its active ingredient glyphosate.

AB  - The nutrients contained in the liquid pig slurry (PS) make this residue a potential organic fertilizer for the cultivation of tree species for the production of wood, which can promote the circular economy. This research aimed to evaluate soil chemical parameters, nutritional status, and development of hybrid eucalyptus clone urograndis from PS application for three consecutive years. The treatments evaluated were without fertilization (C); mineral fertilization (NPK) - 300 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of the 02-30-10 formulation; fertigation with PS of 200 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (FPS200); and fertigation with PS of 400 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (FPS400). Macronutrients and micronutrients from leaves and soil were evaluated. Tree development was analyzed using stem diameter at breast height (DBH) and total height (Ht). PS treatments resulted in leaves with higher accumulation of K and P and lower accumulation of N, Ca, M, S, Cu, and Fe. The treatments FPS200 and FPS400 presented DBH and Ht equal or superior to the mineral fertilization. Fertilizations with NPK, FPS200, and FPS400 resulted, respectively, in DBH increments 16, 27, and 30% higher than the control. Regarding the chemical attributes of the soil, the use of PS reduced the pH of the soil and increased the levels of P in comparison with the other treatments. The micronutrient values were adequate for fertility and no accumulation of potentially toxic elements at a level considered harmful was observed. The application of PS in eucalyptus hybrid urograndis proved to be an attractive alternative to increase wood production.

AB  - Bemisia tabaci Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) is a cosmopolitan, highly polyphagous agricultural pest, which has the capacity to displace other native insect herbivores. Here, equipped with an integrated approach, the effect of developmental stages and feeding density of whiteflies on Myzus persicae performance in tobacco plants are investigated. Bioassay results showed that B. tabaci nymphs, but not adult, pre-infestation significantly reduced survival and fecundity of M. persicae, and the strongest resistance to M. persicae was detected at the medium density (9-10 nymphs/cm(2)). Neither low nor high feeding density of B. tabaci nymphs triggered visible resistance to aphids. However, no significant results were detected in salicylate-deficient NahG plants after B. tabaci nymph infestation. In addition to performance distinctions, hormone quantification and qPCR results revealed very different effects for nymph and adult whitefly stages on the defense responses in tobacco. B. tabaci nymph infestation significantly increased SA accumulation and SA-responsive genes (PR-1a, PR-2a) expression but suppressed JA-regulated responses. In contrast, tobacco plants responded to adult infestation by slightly increasing in both SA- and JA-regulated defenses. Furthermore, higher transcription level of Bt56, coding gene of a secretory salivary effector, was recorded in nymphs vs. adults, while silencing of Bt56 by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) partly impaired the aphid resistance induced by B. tabaci nymphs. These results proved that the induction of tobacco defense responses varied with the feeding stages of whiteflies: nymphs of B. tabaci, but not adults, induced a defense response against aphids, with a density threshold for this induced resistance.

AB  - Kangaroos (Macropodoidea) display a diversity of locomotor modes, from bounding quadrupedally to hopping bipedally; but hopping has a body mass limit, which was exceeded by a number of extinct taxa. In the Pleistocene, a variety of "giant" kangaroos existed, both within the extinct subfamily Sthenurinae and the extant subfamily Macropodinae (both within the family Macropodidae). Sthenurines have been previously considered to have a type of locomotion (bipedal striding) different from extant kangaroos, but the primary locomotor mode of the large species of the extinct "giant" macropodine genus Protemnodon, closely related to extant large kangaroos, has undergone little question and has been assumed to be hopping. Here, the association between limb proportions and locomotor mode across Macropodoidea is assessed by examination of functional limb indices. We show that large (> 100 kg) Protemnodon species are unlike any other known macropodoids; their position in this functional morphospace, along with previously published evidence on humeral morphology, supports a prior hypothesis of a primarily quadrupedal mode of locomotion, likely some sort of bounding.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of illite/smectite clay (I/S) on lignocellulosic degradation and humification process via metagenomics analysis during cattle manure composting. The test group (TG) with 10% I/S and the reference group (RG) were established. The results indicated that the addition of I/S made the degradation rate of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in TG (1.56%, 29.01%, 19.95%) was higher than that in RG (1.16%, 17.24%, 13.14%). Compared with RG, the abundance values of AA2, AA10, GH1 and GH10 in TG increased by 15.18%, 29.28%, 31.08%, 21.65%, respectively. Meanwhile, humic substance (HS) content was increased by 3.49% and 7.16% during RG and TG composting. Furthermore, the microbial community in TG changed, in which the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased and Proteobacteria decreased. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the temperature was positively correlated with the abundance of AA2, AA10, GH1 and GH10, whereas the organic matter content was negatively correlated. Overall, adding I/S to the composting could stimulate microbial activity, promote the degradation of lignocellulose and humification process.

AB  - Reoccupation of European landscapes by native species causes changes in their population densities and home ranges. To test whether an increase in population density affects home range sins, we studied the strictly territorial herbivore Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber). Twenty-four beavers were radio-tracked to reveal their home ranges under varying population densities. The mean length of occupied shorelines was 2648.0 +/- 1530.6 m. We did not find any linkage between home range sizes and population densities. Our results showed that the availability of resources was significantly associated with the duration of site occupation. Thus, the space use was primarily determined by the availability of food resources, rather than by rising population density.

AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify the forage yield, determine its nutritive value, and evaluate the movement pattern, weight variation and body condition score of goats managed on sites of the Brazilian Caatinga grassland (Dry Tropical Forest) in different seasons, at the Lisboa settlement located at the south bank of Piau & iacute; river, in the towns of S & atilde;o Jo & atilde;o do Piau & iacute; and Pedro Laurentino at Capivara mountain, Piau & iacute;, Brazil, in two study sites, one constituted by shrubby Caatinga (site I) and the other by arboreal Caatinga (site II). The highest forage mass value (1,534.57 kg DM ha(-1)) was recorded on the arboreal site. The mass of forage plants found on the sites differed among plants and months. The species Senna macranthera had the highest yield in March (177.35 kg DM ha(-1)) on the shrub site, while Arrabidaea ateramnantha had the highest yield in February (710.65 kg DM ha(-1)) on the arboreal site. The litter mass differed among sites, with the greatest amount found on the shrub site (1,785.96 kg DM ha(-1)). Crude protein, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent insoluble nitrogen and in vitro dry matter digestibility contents were greater on the arboreal site. Dry matter and protein differed among months, showing an inversely proportional relationship. Litter nutritional variables did not differ (p < 0.05). In the Caatinga, goats travel an average of 6.24 km day(-1), with maximum movement of 7.36 km day(-1) in the dry season. The highest weight of the goats (33.06 kg BW) and the lowest body score (2.53) occurred in the transition season from the rainy to the dry season, and the lowest weight occurred in the dry season (26.93 kg BW). The botanical composition of the grassland determines the forage mass between months of the year. In this semi-arid region, goats follow a movement pattern defined by the herbage allowance and water availability.

AB  - Museum specimens preserve genetic information that can help resolve phylogenetic relationships of now extinct species. The Caribbean monk seal, Neomonachus tropicalis, is the only marine mammal driven to extinction in tropical seas and one of the few marine mammals to go extinct in historical times. Prior to 1700 it was widely distributed throughout the coasts of North, Central and South America, and in the Bahamas, Greater and Lesser Antilles. The species was first taxonomically placed in the genus Monachus, along with the Hawaiian and Mediterranean monk seals and it was later moved together with the Hawaiian monk seal into the newly described genus Neomonachus. Here, we present the complete mitochondrial genome of the Caribbean monk seal and a phylogenetic reconstruction, confirming its sister taxa relationship with the Hawaiian monk seal, and thus the monophyly of the genus Neomonachus. Our estimates of divergence times are contemporaneous with or predate the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama. We also identify limited genetic variation among five specimens of Caribbean monk seal.

AB  - Simple Summary Human-animal interactions may have a strong impact on animals' living conditions and are fundamental to improving farm animal welfare. Fourteen dairy goat farms located in the province of Potenza (Southern Italy) with flocks ranging in size from 67 to 450 lactating goats were used. The experimental protocol included three tests and observations in the milking parlour: avoidance distance in the pen, avoidance distance at the manger, approach test within 2 min and behavioural observations of stockmen and animals during milking. The percentage of goats allowed to be touched at the manger was higher than that found in the pen, and the avoidance distance at the manger was shorter than that recorded in the pen. The percentage of neutral stockman interactions was positively correlated with the percentage of goats moving when approached at a distance >1 m and was negatively correlated with the animals touched at the manger, in the pen and within 2 min. In conclusion, avoidance distance at the manger and in the pen are valid assessments for evaluating the human-animal connection in goats. Furthermore, avoidance at the manger may reliably replace the pen test. It is widely assumed that the quality of human-animal interactions may have a strong impact on animals' living conditions and is fundamental to improving farm animal welfare. This work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of methods for assessing and monitoring the welfare of lactating goats. In particular, attention was paid to the methods regarding the assessment of the human-animal relationship. The experimental protocol included three tests and observations in the milking parlour, namely: avoidance distance in the pen, avoidance distance at the manger, approach test within 2 min and behavioural observations of stockmen and animals during milking. Fourteen dairy goat farms located in the province of Potenza (Southern Italy) with flocks ranging in size from 67 to 450 lactating goats were used. All farms raised the Rossa Mediterranean goat breed. The percentage of goats that permitted themselves to be touched at the manger (mean & PLUSMN; SD: 12.36 & PLUSMN; 9.50) was higher than that found in the pen (9.67 & PLUSMN; 11.86) and within 2 min inside the pen (8.19 & PLUSMN; 13.78). The avoidance distance at the manger (0.63 & PLUSMN; 0.28 m) was shorter than that recorded in the pen (1.19 & PLUSMN; 0.58 m). Avoidance distance at the manger was positively correlated with that in the pen (Spearman correlation test (r(s)) = 0.607; p < 0.01), as was the percentage of goats touched at the manger and in the pen (r(s) = 0.647; p < 0.01). Approximately 60% of the stockman interactions observed during milking were neutral, while positive and negative interactions had similar values to each other, approximately 20%. The number of neutral stockman interactions was positively correlated with the percentage of goats moving when approached at a distance >1 m (r(s) = 0.799; p < 0.001) and was negatively correlated with the animals touched at the manger (r(s) = -0.607; p < 0.05), in the pen (r(s) = -0.613; p < 0.05) and within 2 min (r(s) = -0.669; p < 0.01). As regards the degree of association between the behaviour of the milker and the animals during the milking routine, the percentage of neutral interactions tended to be positively correlated only with the number of kicks performed by the animals (r(s) = 0.476; p < 0.10).
   It is concluded that avoidance distance at the manger and in the pen, as for other farm animals, are valid tests to evaluate the human-animal relationship in goats. In addition, avoidance distance at the manger may reliably replace the test performed in the pen.

AB  - Hyperthermophilic composting (HTC) with excellent disposal effect is a novel composting technology by inoculating exogenous thermophilic microorganisms. However, the role of exogenous thermophilic microorganisms in HTC remains debated, especially for the applicability of different compost feedstocks. In this study, the role of Parageobacillus toebii during HTC using chicken and pig manure was investigated. The addition of P. toebii could raise the maximum temperature to 78.2 degrees C and obviously enhanced maturation effect in chicken manure composting. However, the enhancement effect of P. toebii was weaker in pig manure compost, and the maximum temperature only reached 73 degrees C. Addition of P. toebii could stimulated functional microbial communities for C&N transformation, increased temperature, and promoted the growth of thermophilic microorganisms in chicken manure composting. Component analyses showed that chicken manure had higher bioavailability compared to pig manure. Correlation analysis indicated that P. toebii activated as a "leader", stimulating metabolic activity among functional microbial communities and enhancing organic matter degradation for heat release, while its activation depended on the bioavailability of the raw material. This study provides important insights into the role and application of exogenous microorganisms in promoting HTC.

AB  - In the breeding process of Exopalaemon carinicauda from the same family, noticeable differences often occur in growth characteristics under the same conditions. To investigate this issue, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis to identify the critical genes involved in weight gain and compared the intestinal flora to screen for potential intestinal probiotics. In total, we identified 1311 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 735 genes, including troponin C, chitinase, cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and trypsin, were upregulated exclusively in the fast growth group. Several DEGs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR and assigned to the ribosome, phagosome, apoptosis, purine metabolism, and Hippo signaling pathways. The microbiome community richness and diversity of the fast-growing individuals (FGIs) were higher than those of the slowgrowing individuals (SGIs). In the current study, the intestinal microflora was mainly distributed in the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota. The species with significant differences (P < 0.05) between the FGI and SGI groups included the iron-reducing bacteria, Nitrospira moscoviensis, Sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans, and Alpha proteobacterium. Our results provided insights towards revealing the mechanism underlying the growth differences in E. carinicauda.

AB  - Minimising the unintended capture of fish, marine mammals, reptiles, seabirds and other marine organisms is an important component of responsible fisheries management and for stabilising declines and rebuilding populations of threatened species. The analyses presented were designed to establish the first quantitative baseline of historical catches, catch rates and species composition for the dominant tuna fisheries operating in the western and central Pacific, the world's largest in terms of tuna catch. Using records from 612,148 fishing events collected by independent 'at sea' observers, estimates for finfish, billfish, elasmobranchs, marine mammals and sea turtles show that the composition and magnitude of catches varied considerably by fishery type and practice for the period 2003-2019. Simulations indicated that precision in longline estimates would be improved by monitoring a proportion of fishing sets from all fishing trips rather than full coverage from a proportion of all fishing trips. While attributing reasons for temporal trends in estimated bycatch was difficult due to the confounding impacts of changing abundances and fishing practices, the trends identified the nature of potential relationships for species that are not accurately quantified, or not covered, by fishing vessel logbooks. The trends in catch estimates, and the catch rate models, have utility in identifying species which may require targeted additional analyses and management interventions, including species of conservation interest (either due to their threatened status or vulnerability to fishing) such as elasmobranchs and sea turtles. Moreover, the estimates should support future evaluations of the impact of these industrial-scale fisheries on bycatch species.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zimbabwe is a key biodiversity domain in sub-Saharan Africa and ethnoveterinary medicines play an integral role in livestock health. However, knowledge on whether plants are used by only a small proportion of people or whether similar uses exist in different communities and in a more regional context is incompletely documented. Aim of the study: Firstly, the study documented plant-based complementary medicines used for managing goat ailments. Secondly, culturally important medicinal plant species with highest use-reports (UR) as well as botanical and therapeutic consistency were computed. Thirdly, details on whether similar ethnobotanical practices exist in different communities as an indicator of information exchange were explored. Materials and methods: A total of 200 informants from Gutu, Chikomba, Murewa and Mwenezi districts of Zimbabwe were interviewed. Plant identification was done at the National Herbarium and Botanic Gardens of Zimbabwe. Use-reports were generated and subjected to analysis using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) in IBM SPSS statistical software. Results: The impact of parasites and diseases was ranked as the major goat production constraint. A total of 160 homemade remedies were documented, 151 of which comprised a single plant species (Homemade Single Species Herbal Remedy Reports, HSHR). The 151 HSHR prepared using 75 plant species belonging to 34 families referred to 401 UR. The foremost used medicinal plant species were from the Fabaceae family (28 HSHR, 19%). Cassia abbreviata was the most cited plant species (6 HSHR, 4%). The category of ecto- and endoparasites had the highest number of UR out of a total of 9 categories (136 UR, 34%). The most frequently used plant species for this category were Solanum campylacanthum (8 UR, 6%) and Strychnos spinosa (6 UR, 4%). Almost similar numbers of UR were computed across communities for 6 disease categories. Nine different combinations (9 HR, 9 UR) comprising mostly of three plant species were reported for various ailments. Baccharoides adoensis and Terminalia sericea were often reported in these combinations for January disease. Highest levels of therapeutic consistency were computed for Aloe vera and Lippia javanica against ectoparasites (10 out of 24 local studies). Interestingly, 28 new medicinal plant species were documented for the first time in Zimbabwe. Again, these were mostly used for ecto-and endoparasites (8 plant species, 29%). Conclusions: Ethnoveterinary medicines play a pivotal role in management of livestock ailments in rural communities of Zimbabwe. However, attention is warranted to ensure transparency in use practices, as well as to conserve and scientifically validate culturally important medicinal plant species such as Aloe vera and Lippia javanica.

AB  - Understanding how animals use information about their environment to make movement decisions underpins our ability to explain drivers of and predict animal movement. Memory is the cognitive process that allows species to store information about experienced landscapes, however, remains an understudied topic in movement ecology. By studying how species select for familiar locations, visited recently and in the past, we can gain insight to how they store and use local information in multiple memory types. In this study, we analyzed the movements of a migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) population in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, United States to investigate the influence of spatial experience over different time scales on seasonal range habitat selection. We inferred the influence of short and long-term memory from the contribution to habitat selection of previous space use within the same season and during the prior year, respectively. We fit step-selection functions to GPS collar data from 32 female deer and tested the predictive ability of covariates representing current environmental conditions and both metrics of previous space use on habitat selection, inferring the latter as the influence of memory within and between seasons (summer vs. winter). Across individuals, models incorporating covariates representing both recent and past experience and environmental covariates performed best. In the top model, locations that had been previously visited within the same season and locations from previous seasons were more strongly selected relative to environmental covariates, which we interpret as evidence for the strong influence of both short- and long-term memory in driving seasonal range habitat selection. Further, the influence of previous space uses was stronger in the summer relative to winter, which is when deer in this population demonstrated strongest philopatry to their range. Our results suggest that mule deer update their seasonal range cognitive map in real time and retain long-term information about seasonal ranges, which supports the existing theory that memory is a mechanism leading to emergent space-use patterns such as site fidelity. Lastly, these findings provide novel insight into how species store and use information over different time scales.

AB  - The Mongolian sheep, emblematic of the Inner Mongolian grasslands, is renowned for its exceptional stress resistance and adaptability to harsh environments, drawing considerable attention. Recent research has unveiled the novel role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in combating oxidative stress. This investigation examined how GABA impacts renal-cortex and medulla cells from Mongolian sheep exposed to high-glucose stress conditions, utilizing gene expression analysis and non-targeted metabolomics. Elevated glucose levels significantly reduced the viability of Mongolian sheep renal cells and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Conversely, the introduction of GABA notably enhanced cell viability, reduced ROS production, and stimulated the expression of antioxidant genes (e.g., Gpx, SOD, CAT) in the renal cortex. In the renal medulla, CAT expression increased, while Gpx gene expression showed mixed responses. Metabolomics analysis indicated that high-glucose exposure altered various metabolites, whereas GABA alleviated the metabolic stress induced by high glucose through modulating glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In Mongolian sheep renal cells, GABA effectively mitigated oxidative damage triggered by high-glucose stress by upregulating antioxidant genes and regulating metabolic pathways, revealing insights into its potential mechanism for adapting to extreme environments. This finding offers a fresh perspective on understanding the stress resilience of Mongolian sheep and may provide valuable insights for research across diverse disciplines.

AB  - Catch-and-release ice angling is a popular recreational activity, but little is known about the postrelease behavior of fish in the winter. Cold water temperatures and an ambush hunting strategy may constrain Northern Pike Esox lucius, limiting their postrelease movements to a small area near the capture location. We used manual acoustic telemetry to track 15 Northern Pike ranging from 56 to 98.5 cm total length for up to 7 d after catch-and-release ice angling in Buffalo Pound Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada. All of the fish but one moved unexpectedly long distances of several km over the tracking period. For the fish that were tracked over all 7 d, path lengths traveled ranged from 1.4 to 18.4 km. The minimum daily distance traveled ranged from 0 to 4.6 km and varied significantly by tracking day; the fish moved shorter distances on day 4 postrelease. There was a significant interaction between fish size and day postrelease; larger fish moved shorter minimum daily distances and dispersed shorter distances from the release site over the first 2 d of tracking. In contrast, by 5 d after release, both the largest and smallest fish had dispersed the longest distances from the release site and intermediate-sized fish dispersed the least. The cumulative path length traveled by day 5 of tracking did not reveal any significant size-based patterns. Our study raises the possibility that relatively large movements may be common for Northern Pike in the winter despite cold water temperatures and their expected foraging behavior. In addition, postrelease behavior varies with fish size. Habitat and space requirements for Northern Pike in the winter can encompass much larger areas and more habitat features than has been previously envisioned.

AB  - Metastrongylus sp. is a lungworm with worldwide distribution in wild boars and other suids. In Switzerland, two wild boar populations are geographically divided by the Alps. We investigated 84 wild boars, 52 from north and 32 from south of the Alps, different in sex and age (juveniles, subadults, adults), shot between September and December 2018. The lungs were macroscopically examined and dissected for the detection of Metastrongylus specimens. Additionally, faecal samples were obtained from 55 animals and analysed by sedimentation/flotation and the mini-FLOTAC (R) method. Overall, 12'774 Metastrongylus sp. specimens were isolated: prevalence was 77.4% and mean burden 196.5 (range: 1-2589), with no significant differences between north (80.8%, 218.0) and south (71.9%, 157.4) nor between sexes and age groups. Macroscopically, dense nodular lesions associated with Metastrongylus sp. were present in 19 out of 65 (33.9%) positive lungs. Five Metastrongylus sp. were detected: M. pudendotectus (67.9%), M. salmi (63.1%), M. confusus (56%), M. apri (44%) and M. asymmetricus (17.9%), with a significant difference (p = 0.012) between north (32.7%) and south (62.5%) for M. apri. The lungworm population was female biased. The number of Metastrongylus sp. eggs in faecal samples did not correlate with worm burdens. Furthermore, the following endoparasites were detected: Isospora suis/Eimeria sp. (74.5%), Strongyloides suis (27.3%%), Trichuris suis (20.0%), Hyostrongylus rubidus/Oesophagostomum sp. (18.2%), Globocephalus sp. (9.1%), Capillaria sp. (7.3%), Ascaris suum (3.6%), Giardia sp. (3.6%) and Balantidium coli (1.8%), with significant differences for S. suis (north 36.1% > south 10.5%) and Globocephalus sp. (only south, 26.3%). Although geographically separated, both Swiss wild boar populations share similar parasite spectra, while also showing some regional idiosyncrasies partially explained by ecological and climatic factors. Despite their clinical relevance being unknown, accurate knowledge concerning the distribution of endoparasites in the wildlife reservoir is relevant to better understand risk factors for the domestic pig population.

AB  - Ocean warming and deoxygenation are already modifying the habitats of many aerobic organisms. Benthic habitat in the Northeast Pacific is sensitive to deoxygenation, as low oxygen concentrations occur naturally in continental shelf bottom waters. Here, we examine the potential impacts of deoxygenation and ocean warming on the habitat distribution of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), one of the most commercially important groundfish in North America. We combine fisheries-independent Pacific halibut survey data (1998-2020) with oceanographic measurements and a regional ocean circulation model to investigate current and future (end of 21st century) influences of deoxygenation and warming on optimal Pacific halibut habitat. We use the observations and model output to derive a metabolic index of Pacific halibut-specific suitable habitat. Our results show high Pacific halibut counts in regions where the metabolic index is greatest and demonstrate that interannual variability in Pacific halibut abundance is coherent with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Working with model projections, we examine potential future changes in suitable Pacific halibut habitat by the end of the century under a high carbon dioxide emissions scenario. These projections indicate that suitable Pacific halibut habitat may largely disappear off the coast of Washington state, retreating approximately 5 degrees latitude northward. In bottom waters along coastal British Columbia and Alaska continental shelf, Pacific halibut habitat is projected to decrease by about 50%. Such habitat changes may potentially drive a northward shift in Pacific halibut, with significant implications for commercial fisheries.

AB  - Tibetan antelope is the only genus of large mammal endemic to the Tibetan Plateau. In the past decades, the antelope population has been significantly affected by human activities, including massive illegal hunting, followed by strict protection policies and establishments of natural reserves. Various techniques and many efforts have been devoted to monitoring antelope population fluctuation and migration in past decades. However, it remains unclear how the antelope population changed in the past, and how it varied with climate and environment. Here, we presented sedimentary records at Lake Zonag, one of the major calving grounds for the Tibetan antelope, to study past changes in antelope population and its response to environment in past 9000 years. The sedimentary fecal sterols, produced by antelopes, captured the sudden decrease in antelope population due to illegal hunting in 1980s, as well as the recent recovery because of protection. The antelope population varied significantly during the past 9000 years, generally following environment changes revealed by geochemical elements in the same sediment core. Large antelope population likely lived in environment with relatively warm and humid condition, while small antelope population occurred in adverse environment with relatively cold and dry condition. Two periods with notably low antelope population were observed at 5.1-4.5 and 4.1-3.7 ka. The increase in antelope population in the past 400 years likely resulted from wildlife protection from early Tibetans. This study provides a promising method to reconstruct past changes in antelope population, to study its response to environment changes, and to provide historical comparison for wildlife protection.

AB  - This study investigates the ecotoxicological impacts of the Fundao dam rupture, one of the major environmental disaster that occurred in Brazil and in the world mining industry history, through multi-biomarkers responses and metals bioaccumulation in the fish community of different trophic levels. Specimens of the fishes (omnivorous/herbivorous and carnivorous) were collected along the Doce River channel and its affluent Guandu River, and in different lakes and coastal lagoons adjacent to the river channel, in the Espirito Santo State, Southeast of Brazil. Four sampling collections were carried out over two years (2018 to 2020, during dry and rainy seasons). For both trophic groups the biomarkers responses indicated physiological alterations related to metals exposure and showed strong seasonal variations. The principal component analysis and integrated biomarker response index showed that DNA damage and lipid peroxidation were more associated with dry season 2 (Sep/Oct 2019) and the oxidative damage in proteins, metallothioneins concentration and the activity of superoxide dismutase in the gills showed a greater association with rainy season 2 (Jan/Feb 2020). On the other hand, the enzymes of energy metabolism, catalase and histological damage in the liver and the gills, were more associated with the dry and rainy campaigns of the first year of monitoring. The multivariate approach also suggested a temporal intensification in the bioaccumulation of metals and biological effects in the lacustrine environments. Thus, these results demonstrate that the release of mineral residues from the rupture of the Fundao mine dam affects the health status of the fish from the Doce River basin, provoking metals bioaccumulation, hepatic and branchial damage in the fish besides inducing of enzyme activity related to metal contamination, even four years after the rupture.

AB  - Artificial insemination has been a predominant technique employed in goat husbandry for breeding purposes. Subsequent to artificial insemination, sperm can elicit inflammation in the reproductive tract, resulting in substantial the accumulation of neutrophils. Recognized as foreign entities, sperm may become entrapped within neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by neutrophils, thereby exploiting their properties of pathogen elimination. Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), which is known for disintegrating NETs and causing loss of function, has been utilized to ameliorate liver and brain damage resulting from NETs, as well as to enhance sperm quality. This study investigated the mechanism of sperm-induced NETs and further explored the impact of DNase I on NETs. Sperm quality was evaluated using optical microscopy, while the structure of NETs was observed through immunofluorescence staining. The formation mechanism of NETs was examined using inhibitors and PicoGreen. The findings revealed that sperm induced the formation of NETs, a process regulated by glycolysis, NADPH oxidase, ERK1/2, and p38 signaling pathways. The composition of NETs encompassed DNA, citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), and elastase (NE). DNase I protects sperm by degrading NETs, thereby concurrently preserving the integrity of plasma membrane and motility of sperm. In summary, the release of sperm-induced NETs leads to its damage, but this detrimental effect is counteracted by DNase I through degradation of NETs. These observations provide novel insights into reproductive immunity in goats.

AB  - Management strategies for chronic wasting disease (CWD) across tribal lands have varied in response to changing dynamics of CWD risk. As CWD continues to spread across the United States, concerns associated with the disease are increasing. We interviewed 19 natural resource managers representing Anishinaabe and Dakota tribes in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin with goals of understanding needs and opportunities for CWD engagement, surveillance, and outreach on tribal lands; the implementation of natural resources policy and management across tribal nations; and opportunities for tribal partnership-development to control CWD. Qualitative data analyses of interview responses revealed substantial variation in the number of tribal hunters, hunter regulation, and huntable tribal lands across our study area. Proximity of tribal lands in relation to CWD detections impacted tribal agency management strategies for CWD. Our results indicate a desire for CWD outreach and surveillance, mutually beneficial collaborations, and a need for incorporating cultural knowledge into CWD management strategies. We conclude that tribal CWD management and surveillance plans will be enhanced through strategic and thoughtful CWD outreach methods. Moreover, partnerships must recognize tribal sovereignty and respectfully integrate tribal values, knowledge, and worldview.

AB  - Thiloa glaucocarpa is a toxic plant as a food item for bovine cattle. However, dry leaves are frequently collected to cultivate the symbiotic fungi of several colonies of Atta sexdens throughout the Caatinga Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest biome in Brazil and such behavior is not clear. In this study, we analyzed the removal of T. glaucocarpa leaves for A. sexdens and tested the hypothesis that the preference for removal of dry leaf material over fresh leaves may be related to the decay of chemical defenses. Dried leaf discs of T. glaucocarpa were offered to laboratory-raised colonies of A. sexdens. Overall, there was a lower consumption of T. glaucocarpa than the previous report, but it is possible to observe a preference for mature and fresh leaves removal, contradicting initial predictions. Probably, the removal of dried leaves is a specific solution learned by natural colonies to reduce the number of secondary compounds and guarantee diet availability in a highly seasonal and food-poor environment. The preference for mature leaves is not usual and is probably the result of a higher production of secondary compounds in young leaves, which could guarantee protection for leaves against herbivory in early rains and improve the productivity of T. glaucocarpa at the beginning of the rainy season.

AB  - Biochar provides a suitable microenvironment for the growth of microorganisms. It may directly or indirectly affect changes in the population of microorganisms, thus affecting heavy metal bioavailability. This study aims to explore the effects of microbiological inoculation with and without biochar on microorganisms and on the bioavailability of heavy metals during pig manure composting. Three composting experiments were conducted under various conditions including no treatment (CK), only microbiological inoculation (TA), and integration with biochar (TB). Compared with raw materials before compost, TA reduced the bioavailability of Cu by 25.1%, Zn by 25.64%, and both Pb and Cr by 1.75%. TB reduced the bioavailability of Cu by 35.38%, Zn by 19.34%, Pb by 0.81%, and Cr by 3.9%. Furthermore, correlation analysis demonstrated that Debaryomyces were the primary fungi, possibly controlling the passivation of Cr. Bacillus, Fusarium, Pseudogracilibacillus, Sinibacillus, and Botryotrichum were the primary bacteria and fungi potentially governing the passivation of Zn, Lastly, Debar-yomyces and Penicillium were the primary bacteria and fungi potentially controlling the passivation of Pb and Cu, respectively. Overall, we demonstrated that pig manure added to the microbial inoculum and biochar effectively reduced the bioavailability of heavy metals, thereby offering an applicable technology for reducing heavy metal contamination during pig manure composting.

AB  - The degradation of agricultural residues and their bioconversion to methane is still hampered by the search for pre-treatment strategies due to the lignocellulosic content that limits the process efficiency. Adding an enriched microbial consortium could be an alternative for the biological treatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, during the degradation process, it is necessary to study the dynamics and structure of the microbial community. The objective of this study was to evaluate the addition of an enriched microbial consortium and its effect on the methane-producing prokaryotic community during the anaerobic co-digestion of rice straw and swine manure. Two 10 L semi-continuous stirred tank reactors were used (control and bioaugmentation), during 70 days at 35 +/- 2 degrees C, increasing organic loading rates up to 1.8 g VS/L/d. The diversity and dynamics of the microbial community were analyzed and taxonomic identification was obtained by Ion Torrent metagenomic technique. A higher production was achieved in the bioaugmented reactor (approx. 344 LN/kgVS) concerning the control reactor, increasing the methane yield by 40% (v/v). The metagenomic method allowed the identification down to the genus and species level of the microbial consortium and the prokaryotic community of the reactors, which enabled the assumption of possible metabolic pathways. In both reactors, species diversity decreased over time, indicating a greater specialization of the microbial community. Cellulolytic and methanogenic acetoclastic microorganisms were favored, which supported the higher methane production obtained. The results demonstrate that the consortium could be used as a bioproduct to treat agricultural wastes for energy purposes.

AB  - Invasive slugs are a menace from the agricultural point of view apart from the impact on the native biota and the ecosystems. Subsequent to the observations of the marsh slug, Deroceras laeve in West Bengal, India, an attempt was made to confirm the species identity and the species distribution modelling considering the Himalayas of West Bengal and adjacent regions as the geographical distribution of the species. Assessment of the DNA bar-coding of the COI gene confirmed the species as D. laeve with 99.84% similarity with a specimen of Canada. Owing to its record from the concerned regions, the prospective spread and the invasion of the species in similar regions were modelled using Maxent species distribution modelling. The result of species distribution modelling indicated that precipitation seasonality, precipitation of the driest month, snow coverage, elevation, and her-baceous vegetation had the most influence on the occurrence of D. laeve. The possible spread of the species can be expected in the future if congenial conditions are available in the extended geographical regions. As an invasive species, D. laeve may affect agricultural productivity apart from altering the habitat conditions and imposing competitive interactions with the native species. Based on the present observation, appropriate strategies may be framed for monitoring and regulating the spread of the invasive slug.

AB  - Joint attention, the ability for interlocuters to coordinate their attentional state on an aspect of the environment or behaviour of mutual interest, is considered one of the key capacities underlying human cooperation. Originally considered unique to primates, emerging evidence in diverse taxa now suggests it may have convergently evolved in response to similar socioecological pressures. Here, we examine a previously undescribed visual signal in the plains zebra, Equus quagga: the 'headbob'. Headbobs are flexibly produced in two major contexts: initiating joint travel and initiating social behaviour between partners. We investigated whether this signal meets three key criteria used to infer joint attention in nonhuman animals: first-order intentional communication, sensitivity to receiver attentional state and common ground. In response to a headbob, receivers modified their behaviour to facilitate joint engagement in a coordinated act. We found that behaviour was more synchronized between social partners following a headbob and that travel initiations were more likely to result in coordinated travel than those without a headbob. These preliminary findings suggest this behaviour may serve as a joint attention mechanism, warranting further and more detailed investigation. This study illuminates the importance of including understudied taxa, such as ungulates, in the study of advanced sociocognitive and communicative capabilities.

AB  - Root-knot nematodes (RKN) cause extensive damage to grapevine cultivars. RKN-resistant grapevine rootstocks remain vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses. This study aimed to determine the influence of composted animal manures (CAMs) [chicken manure (CM), cow manure (CowM), and sheep manure (SM)] with or without plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on the population of Meloidogyne incognita, free-living nematodes (FLNs) and predaceous nematodes (PNs) residing in the soils of vineyard cultivars (Flame, Superior and Prime). The nematodes were isolated from grapevine roots and rhizosphere soils, then the absolute frequency of occurrence (FO), relative FO, prominence value (PV), and population density (PD) were assessed. The impact of CAMs and PGPR on the growth parameters, fruit output, and quality of three grapevine varieties was subsequently evaluated. Eight treatments included a control without CAMs or PGPR amendments, the CAMs alone, or CAM treatments combined with PGPR. The results showed that FLNs and PNs were more abundant in Prime than Flame or Superior cultivars when poor sandy loam soils were supplied with CAMs. Among all tested manures, CM was the best treatment as a nematicide. This was evident from the decreased numbers of M. incognita and increased numbers of FLNs and PNs in grapevine fields. Compared to the soil-applied oxamyl (a systemic nematicide), which was efficiently suppressive on M. incognita for two months, CM significantly (P < 0.05) decreased PD of the phytonematodes for five months, improved soil structure and enhanced the soil biological activities. There were significant (P < 0.05) increases in the number of leaves/vines by 79.9, 78.8, and 73.1%; and total fruit weight/vine by 76.9, 75.0, and 73.0% in Flame, Superior, and Prime varieties, respectively, compared to untreated vines. Regardless of the cultivar, soils amended with CM + PGPR achieved the lowest number of M. incognita among all other treatments, followed by SM + PGPR and CowM + PGPR. It was concluded that CAMs amendment, mainly CM, along with PGPR in poor sandy soils of temperate areas, is considered a sustainable approach for reducing parasitic nematodes and improving agricultural management.

AB  - Marine algae are thought to be a source of various metabolites that have a wide range of positive effects on human health. The pharmacological properties of algal metabolites, including their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cholesterol homeostasis, protein clearance, and anti-amyloidergic effects, lend credence to their protective efficacy against oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired proteostasis, all of which are involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. There are currently no clinical trials on the effects of marine algae on neuroinflammation; however, considering the significant biological activities that have been established by in vitro and animal research, we expect that there will be clinical trials on this topic in the not-too-distant future. The most recent and important findings on the potentially neuroprotective effects of the anti-inflammatory properties of marine algae were chosen for this study. Next, we conducted a literature review on the neuroprotective potential of algal compounds, along with the underlying pharmacological mechanism, and finally, we evaluated recent advances in therapeutics.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a significant conservation issue for Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and an environmental and socioeconomic crisis in elephant range countries, including Sri Lanka. Approximately 14,897 HEC incidents were recorded in Sri Lanka between 2015 and 2021. In this study, we present a Sri Lanka-wide analysis to explore the impact of greenery change on HEC. Our sources were official government data, and land use and land cover maps developed using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. We applied the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and object-based image analysis classifications to classify land cover into six categories. This classification scheme also considered the differences observed in Sri Lanka's woody vegetation, consisting of forest, open forest, paddy fields, homestead gardens, and other crops. Analysis of the accuracies of the three types of classifiers confirmed that the supervised classification with two machine learning algorithms, RF and SVM, delivered a higher level of precision in land cover classification. RF was the best option, with a 97.34% overall accuracy and a 0.94 kappa coefficient, while SVM recorded a 94.68% overall accuracy and a 0.89 kappa coefficient. According to the findings, most HEC incidences were recorded in open forests (54%), while 62% were recorded within 2 km of the forest edge. Results indicated that HEC coincides with the human-occupied changed landscape adjacent to forest reservations and patches. The findings could be valuable for HEC management by identifying areas where elephants are most likely to conflict with humans, and the government may declare these as protected areas. Also, we propose an early warning system as an effective approach that helps detect and monitor elephant herds' movement. Therefore, implementing long-term land use planning is crucial for protecting the forest and natural habitats, restoring elephant habitats, and mitigating HEC by minimizing human encroachment and promoting sustainable land use practices.

AB  - The present study determined the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) parasites in small ruminants kept in smallholder farms in Phitsanulok, Northern Thailand. A total of 885 goats from 31 smallholder farms were selected randomly between May 2019 to January 2020. Fecal samples were collected to estimate fecal egg counts and oocysts counts using the modified McMaster technique. Furthermore, pooled fecal samples from each of the farms were cultured in order to differentiate third-stage larvae of nematode. Examination of fecal samples revealed that 885 were positive for one or more parasites, giving an overall prevalence of 87.2 %, of which 38.6 % were infected with one and 48.6 % with multiple parasite. Strongyles and Eimeria oocysts were the most prevalent. Haemonchus contortus and Strongyloides papillosus were the predominant species based on the percentage of larvae in fecal cultures. Tapeworm eggs were encountered in 14.2 % of all samples. No significant difference in gastrointestinal parasite prevalence was associated with sex of the host. Infection was significantly (P = 0.009) highest in poor body conditioned goats (72.0 %) as compared to moderate (48.9 %) and good body conditioned (50.0 %) goats. This report on prevalence of GI parasites of small ruminants in smallholder farms in Northern Thailand reveals a high endoparasitic infections that appeared well-adapted to environmental conditions. Further studies on endoparasite control are required to establish the impact of parasitism on productive performance, including monitoring control parasite programs are needed for better health and productivity.

AB  - Stomata perform important functions in plant photosynthesis, respiration, gas exchange, and interactions with environments. However, tea plant stomata development and functions are not known. Here, we show morphological changes during stomata development and genetic dissection of stomata lineage genes regulating stomata formation in tea developing leaves. Different tea plant cultivars displayed clear variations in the stomata development rate, density and size, which are closely related to their tolerance against dehydration capabilities. Whole sets of stomata lineage genes were identified to display predicted functions in regulating stomatal development and formation. The stomata development and lineage genes were tightly regulated by light intensities and high or low temperature stresses, which affected stomata density and function. Furthermore, lower stomatal density and larger size were observed in triploid tea varieties as compared to those in diploid plant. Key stomata lineage genes such as CsSPCHs, CsSCRM, and CsFAMA showed much lower expression levels, whereas negative regulators CsEPF1 and CsYODAs had higher expression levels in triploid than in diploid tea varieties. Our study provides new insight into tea plant stomatal morphological development and the genetic regulatory mechanisms on stomata development under abiotic stresses and genetic backgrounds. The study lays a foundation for future exploring of the genetic improvement of water use efficiency in tea plants for living up to the challenge of global climate change.

AB  - Rising temperature has been associated with increased occurrence of herbivorous insect outbreaks, explained by several direct and indirect mechanisms. Whereas natural enemies are known key drivers of forest-defoliating insect cycles, indirect effects of temperature on insect's ability to defend against pathogens and parasitoids (e.g., immunocompetence), as well as the interaction with other mechanisms (e.g., diet), remain less explored. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of temperature and diet on the performance and immune response of the model lepidopteran system Ormiscodes amphimone (Saturniidae) and its host plants Nothofagus spp. (Nothofagaceae). Larvae of O. amphimone were reared under two temperature conditions (ambient 18:6 degrees C and warmed, 21:6 degrees C; light: dark, 14:10 h) and on leaves of two of their preferred Nothofagus host plants, which vary in quality (lower N. antarctica-higher N. pumilio). We measured developmental time, female pupal weight as a proxy of fitness, relative growth rate, nutritional indices and melanisation of a monofilament as a proxy of immune response. Results showed that an average rise of 2 degrees C favours larval immunocompetence, potentially decreasing mortality exerted by parasitoids. Moreover, depending on diet, an increase in temperature can either maintain (on more nutritious N. pumilio leaves) or enhance (on less nutritious N. antarctica leaves) larval nutritional efficiency, performance and female pupal weight. Hence, an increase in temperature could enhance O. amphimone population growth, through attenuating differences caused by diet and enhancing immunocompetence, favouring outbreak frequency, severity and area.

AB  - In this study, two cruises were conducted across the mainstream of the Kuroshio off eastern Taiwan before and after the passage of Typhoon Saola in summer 2012. The continuous underway pCO(2) (i.e., partial pressure of CO2) measurements revealed that surface seawater pCO(2) (SS pCO(2)) displayed spatial variations in response to typhoon passage. The simulated results showed that the mixed-layer deepening after typhoon passage had a minor effect on SS pCO(2) variation because pCO(2) decrease driven by temperature dropdown and enhanced biological production fueled by nutrients input was largely compensated by pCO(2) increase caused by salinity increase and dissolved inorganic carbon input from the subsurface layer. By contrast, the advection pattern showed significant change before and after the typhoon, which could play a major role in controlling the variation of SS pCO(2). In the exit area of the cyclonic eddy, SS pCO(2) decreased, while in the area of its arrival, SS pCO(2) increased. Besides, the discharge of freshwater and the intrusion of the South China Sea subsurface could result in SS pCO(2) increase in the nearshore area. The present study highlights that more advection changes need to be considered to better understand the impact of the typhoon on SS pCO(2), especially in the strong current area, such as the Kuroshio.

AB  - The area of Donji Kamenjak (Istria, Croatia) is locus typicus for the species Octodrilus istrianus Mr & scaron;i & cacute;, 1991. However, the whole earthworm fauna has not been investigated. Given that O. istrianus is an endemic species to the Istrian region, this fact inspired our research in this small, but unique location. Field samplings were conducted over a two-year period (2020-2021), with biannual collections in both spring and autumn. In total, we identified nine earthworm species, including eight from the Lumbricidae family and one from the Acanthodrilidae family. We confirmed the presence of O. istrianus Mr & scaron;i & cacute;, 1991 and, for the first time in Croatia, documented the presence of Microscolex dubius (Fletscher, 1887). The most abundant species was Octodrilus kvarnerus Mr & scaron;i & cacute;, 1987, also an endemic species for this area. The endemic species O. istrianus in this surveyed area faces threats from habitat degradation, mechanical land cultivation practices, wild boars foraging and the impact of tourism during the majority of the year.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to public health, and the gut microbiota of livestock (e.g., pigs) are considered a crucial reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), contributing to the long-term persistence of AMR. However, there is still a lack of relevant research on the composition and diurnal fluctuation of ARGs, and their correlation with nutrient substrates in the gut of pigs. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized the antibiotic resistome structure, and circadian oscillations in 45 colonic metagenomically sequenced samples, covering 9-time points within 24 h, from growing pigs. We identified 227 unique types of ARGs, which belonged to 35 drug resistance classes. Tetracycline resistance and antibiotic target protection were the most enriched class and mechanism of drug resistance in colon samples, respectively. The relative abundance of ARGs fluctuated over time within 24 h, with the total abundance peaking at T21 (sampling time at 21:00 p.m.) and the total numbers reaching the peak at T15. A total of 70 core ARGs were identified, which contributed to 99 % of all ARGs. Rhythmicity analysis revealed that 50 out of 227 ARGs and 15 of 49 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) exhibited rhythmic patterns. TetW was the most abundant ARG with circadian rhythm frequently found in Limosilactobacillus reuteri. The concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the colon was significantly correlated with the host genera of rhythmic ARGs. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) analysis indicated that rhythmic ARGs were significantly correlated with bacterial community, MGEs, and colonic ammonia nitrogen. This study provides new insight into the diurnal fluctuation of ARG profiles in the colon of growing pigs, which was likely driven by the dynamic change of the availability of colonic nutrients substrates.

AB  - Sperm cryodamage caused by cryopreservation limits the use of frozen yak spermatozoa in artificial insemination (AI). However, the proteomic changes involved in the cryodamage of yak spermatozoa have not been investigated to date. Therefore, this study aimed to identify proteins related to freezing tolerance. Tandem mass tag (TMT) were used in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for identifying differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between high-motility (HM) and low-motility (LM) frozenthawed yak spermatozoa. A total of 116 DEPs were identified (>1.5-fold, P < 0.05); of which, 104 proteins were upregulated in HM spermatozoa and 12 proteins were upregulated in LM spermatozoa. The results of functional annotation analysis revealed that the DEPs were mainly involved in metabolic processes. A total of 20 DEPs that were abundantly expressed in HM spermatozoa were strongly associated with carbohydrate metabolism. The results of KEGG analysis revealed that the DEPs were enriched in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and Ras signaling pathway. In addition, many antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD1), peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), and Parkinson disease protein 7 (PARK7) were upregulated in HM spermatozoa, suggesting that these enzymes affect the motility of spermatozoa by regulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in frozen-thawed spermatozoa. Altogether, the findings of this study elucidate the mechanisms through which cryopreservation affects the movement of yak spermatozoa and offer a novel basis for refining freezing techniques and modifying cryopreservation extender components.

AB  - The rapid development of cartographical methods has led to cognitive differences in the user experience, presenting a new challenge to microscale research on geoinformation. Prior studies have been constrained by methodologies, and how the human brain represents geoinformation with different levels of abstraction across geographic scales remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a cognitive experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging with thirteen participants to explore the neural representations of geoinformation abstraction levels and spatial scales. Univariate analysis was utilized to examine the task-state brain imaging representations, and representational similarity analysis was employed to quantify the correlation between two variables and brain signals. We found that the increase in the geoinformation abstraction level decreases the activity of working memory processing, and 3D image induces users to organize geoinformation using egocentric spatial references. Extremely high or low levels of abstraction can hinder effective visual attention allocation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the neural representation of geoinformation's abstraction levels and spatial scales, offering new neuroimaging evidence for the theoretical framework of cartography and providing an empirical spatial cognition foundation for future cartographic design.

AB  - Skeletal muscle comprises a large, heterogeneous assortment of cell populations that interact to maintain muscle homeostasis, but little is known about the mechanism that controls myogenic development in response to artificial selection. Different pig (Sus scrofa) breeds exhibit distinct muscle phenotypes resulting from domestication and selective breeding. Using unbiased single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis (scRNA-seq), the impact of artificial selection on cell profiles is investigated in neonatal skeletal muscle of pigs. This work provides panoramic muscle-resident cell profiles and identifies novel and breed-specific cells, mapping them on pseudotime trajectories. Artificial selection has elicited significant changes in muscle-resident cell profiles, while conserving signs of generational environmental challenges. These results suggest that fibro-adipogenic progenitors serve as a cellular interaction hub and that specific transcription factors identified here may serve as candidate target regulons for the pursuit of a specific muscle phenotype. Furthermore, a cross-species comparison of humans, mice, and pigs illustrates the conservation and divergence of mammalian muscle ontology. The findings of this study reveal shifts in cellular heterogeneity, novel cell subpopulations, and their interactions that may greatly facilitate the understanding of the mechanism underlying divergent muscle phenotypes arising from artificial selection.
   To date, little is known about the mechanism that controls muscle phenotype modification in response to artificial selection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, authors delineate panoramic muscle-resident cell profiles with identification of novel cell subpopulations and cellular interactions in pigs (Sus scrofa) representing divergent muscle phenotypes. The findings should greatly facilitate the understanding of the mechanism of divergent muscle characteristics formation.image

AB  - South American camelids (SAC) have occupied a central role in the development of Andean societies. They are widely distributed in South America and since ancient times are an important factor in Andean economies and social and ritual life. The archaeological site Punta de Pena 4 (PP4) is located in Antofagasta de la Sierra Basin (Southern Puna of Argentina). PP4 is a rock overhang and presents a large occupational sequence (early Holocene until historic times). The aim of this contribution is to study parasite diversity and the relationship among parasites and SAC through holocenic times in the Southern Puna of Argentina. Besides, differences in parasite egg preservation in the site were discussed. A total of 65 coprolites assigned to SAC were rehydratated, homogenized, filtered, allowed to spontaneous sedimentation and examined for parasite remains. Given the morphology of the coprolites, the biogeographic origin and the presence of coccidian oocysts of Eimeria macusaniensis in some of them, a camelid origin of the coprolites is suggested. This is the first paleoparasitological study from PP4, an archaeological site of Antofagasta de la Sierra, a key region in northwestern Argentina and Central Andes. Eleven taxa of parasites were found belonging to Apicomplexa, Platyhelminthes, and Nematoda. Specific parasite species of SAC were found, such as E. macusaniensis and Lamanema chavezi/Nematodirus lamae. A remarkable finding was the presence of Moniezia sp. and Strongyloides sp. in coprolites from different levels of PP4, pointing out the presence of these genera in native artiodactyls of the region previous to the arrival of Hispanic societies. Results displayed a change in the number of parasite taxa present in SAC through time. The parasite-SAC relation through time and differences in parasite egg preservation between levels and sectors (covered and uncovered) of the site are discussed.

AB  - An alternative in an attempt to minimize the effects triggered by intravenous (IV) bolus administration of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists are continuous rate infusions (CRI). The requirement for sedation protocols in sheep for procedures to be performed without physical restraint and with reduced adverse effects, commonly observed with bolus use, justifies the study of CRI. The aim of study was to compare the cardiopulmonary and sedative effects of IV bolus injection and CRI of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in sheep. Six adult male sheep (38.3 +/- 7.6 kg) received DEX as a bolus (5 mu g kg(-1), DEXbolus treatment) or CRI (5 mu g kg(-1) h(-1) for 1 h, DEXCRI treatment). We recorded heartrate (HR), respiratory rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, pulse oximetry, hemodynamic parameters, blood gases and sedation scores over 120 min. HR was significantly lower in DEXbolus at 5 and 15 min than in DEXCRI, with HR reduction observed for 30 min in DEXbolus. Hypoxemia was noted in DEXbolus at 10 and 30 min. Pulmonary vascular resistance index increased at 5 min, and cardiac index (CI) decreased at all timepoints compared with baseline in DEXbolus. In DEXCRI, CI decreased only at 45 min. Sedation scores were higher in DEXbolus at 15 and 30 min. DEX CRI administration resulted in fewer cardiorespiratory and hemodynamic changes compared with bolus injection and lower sedation scores (<4/10), which would not allow animal handling without a reaction. The load dose used in CRI was a limitation to constant infusion.

AB  - Elephants frequently raid crops within their ranges in Africa and Asia. These raids can greatly impact agricultural productivity and food security for farmers. Therefore, there is a need to explore cost-effective measures that would reduce the susceptibility of crops and agricultural fields to elephant raiding, and further promote sustainable human-elephant coexistence. Previous studies have examined the susceptibility of crop fields to elephant raids using field characteristics such as field size and proximity to water sources. However, there are limited studies investigating how different crop types, individually and in their combinations, influence crop susceptibility to elephant raiding. This study utilized data collected from crop fields raided by the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) between 2008 and 2018 in the eastern Okavango Panhandle, northern Botswana. Data on crops grown, number of crop-raiding incidences for each crop, and elephant raiding incidences were recorded for each field assessed. Incidence risks (IR) and field risk value (RV) were computed using an adaptive epidemiological approach. The results showed that elephant raiding incidents varied significantly amongst crop types over space and time (p < .0001). Cereal crops (millet: Eleusine conaracana, maize: Zea mays) incurred a higher number of crop-raiding incidents compared with leguminous crops (cowpea: Vigna unguiculata; groundnut: Arachis hypogea). Field RVs significantly varied depending on which crop was present in the field. There was a significant negative correlation between the number of crop types and the susceptibility of the field to raiding (r = -0.680, p < .0001). Our results suggest that the susceptibility of the fields to elephant raids could be minimized by selecting crop types and combinations less susceptible to elephant damage, thus enhancing food security for local subsistence farmers.

AB  - Spray technology is an efficacious method to improve the indoor environments of poultry houses. In this study, two kind intensive enclosed poultry houses are sprayed with different spray additives in order to explore the effects and control mechanisms of spray processes on ammonia, particulate matters and aerosol bacterial com-positions and investigate the fecal contributions to aerosol bacteria. The results show that the ammonia elimi-nation rates through spray treatment by tap water (TP treatment), by EM microbial agent (EM treatment) or by glutaraldehyde-decamethonium bromide solution (HX treatment) are 67.0%, 85.4% and 96.9% in brood hen house and 60.7%, 76.0% and 94.8% in laying houses. The reductions of ammonia are mainly due to the decreased pH values caused by the increased Lactobacillus in chicken manure rather than the effects of aerosols after spraying. Spray processes reduce the contents of particulate matters while increase the proportions of PM10 and PM2.5 in TSP. The aerosol bacterial compositions after spraying alter mildly. Humidity is the main physi-cochemical factor leading to the variations of core bacteria in aerosols. The fecal transmission is the major source of aerosol bacteria in poultry houses and the spray processes merely present a relatively small impact on the fecal contribution to aerosol bacteria. The findings are conductive to optimize the breeding environment, enhance the ability of disease prevention and finally achieve the green and efficient cultivation.

AB  - Dermacentor hunteri is a tick species that parasitizes bighorn sheep (Ovis canadiensis) and is an important vector of pathogens such as Anaplasma marginale Bartonella, Borrelia, Rickettsia, and Francisella; however, other obligate endosymbionts have been reported in this genus. We aimed to investigate the bacterial microbiome of D. hunteri males and females by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify their endosymbionts and possible bacteria pathogenic to humans or animals. Thus, 183 adult ticks were collected from four bighorn sheep from Sonora, Mexico. The final library was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Alpha-diversity analyses were performed using QIIME. Francisella tularensis represented 73.4% and 99.8% of the tick microbiome in males and females, respectively. Other species with a significant percentage in the male D. hunteri microbiome were Sphingobium yanoikuyae (5.3%), Sphingomonas adhaesiva-ginsenosidimutans (2.7%), Janthinobacterium agaricidamnosum (4.1%), and Vibrio alginolyticus-proteolyticus (4.7%). Vibrio parahaemolyticus represented 0.1% in females and 1.6% in males. This study provided the first overview of the complex microbiota associated with D. hunteri collected from bighorn sheep, characterized by F. tularensis. However, more research is needed to assess the presence of zoonotic cycles and O. canadensis as possible wild reservoirs that may endanger local wild mammals or human population health.

AB  - Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, caused by bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting bovines, and clinically characterized by pyrexia, inappetence, respiratory distress, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, and sometimes abortions. In the present study, buffalo dairy farm having high mortality was investigated. The buffaloes were suffering from high rectal temperature, conjunctivitis, severe respiratory distress, and nasal discharge. Tissue samples from upper respiratory tract were collected aseptically following post-mortem examination of died buffaloes. Tracheal tissue samples were then processed for histopathological examination and DNA isolation. The presence of BHV-1 in the tissue samples was confirmed by nested polymerase chain reaction using glycoprotein B gene primers. The present study reported for the first time the clinical signs, post-mortem lesions, histopathological evidence, and detection of DNA of BHV-1 glycoprotein B gene through nested polymerase chain reaction assay during an active outbreak in buffaloes in India. The findings of this study are crucial for improving the diagnosis of BHV-1 and ultimately reducing financial losses within dairy industry. (c) 2025 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Babesiosis is a significant tick-borne disease that causes varying degrees of losses to animals and humans, as well as a severe economic impact. In Nigeria, there have been several reports on the prevalence of Babesia infection in sheep; however, to date, there is no documented report on the molecular characterization of Babesia ovis in sheep. Here, we determined the prevalence of Babesia infection in sheep using microscopy and PCR and further characterized Babesia ovis in sheep in Nigeria. In this study, 198 blood samples were collected from Abuja and Abeokuta, Nigeria. Microscopic and polymerase chain reactions were used to detect the presence of B. ovis in sheep. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples, and generic RLB forward and reverse primers were used to amplify the 18S rRNA segment of B. ovis. Sequence analysis of the generic molecular marker was used to determine the genetic characteristics of B. ovis in sheep in Nigeria. The prevalence of B. ovis infection using microscopy and PCR was 61.1% and 36.9%, respectively. There was a higher prevalence of Babesia infection in Abeokuta (38.4%) than in Abuja. Study animals of one and half years to three years had the highest percentage (45.8%) of Babesia infection, and higher infection of B. ovis was recorded in male animals (37.5%), balami breeds (40.0%), white coat colors (44.4%), emaciated animals (75.0%), and polycythaemic animals (57.1%). Sequencing analysis indicated that B. ovis 18S rRNA from southwestern Abeokuta and north-central Abuja, Nigeria, showed 90-95% identity of documented isolates from other countries. BioEdit and MEGAX software was used to clean sequences and construct a phylogenetic tree to show evolutionary relationships. In conclusion, the findings from this study offer significant information on the molecular characteristics of B. ovis infection for the first time in Nigeria, as well as its present prevalence status. Furthermore, sheep have been identified as a potential reservoir for this tick-borne pathogen; thus, the information from this study can serve as a basis to formulate effective control strategies for tick-borne pathogens circulating amongst the ruminant population in Nigeria and Africa by extension.

AB  - Introduction: The study of herbivory is fundamental in ecology and includes how plants invest in strategies and mechanisms to reduce herbivore damage. However, there is still a lack of information about how the environment, plant density, and functional traits influence herbivory in aquatic ecosystems. Objective: To assess if there is a relationship between herbivory, environmental variables, and plant traits two species of Montrichardia, a neotropical aquatic plant. Methods: In September 2018, we studied 78 specimens of Montrichardia arborescens and 18 of Montrichardia linifera, in 18 sites in Melgaco, Para, Brazil. On each site, we measured water depth, distance to the margin, and plant density. From plants, we measured plant height and leaf thickness, and photographed the leaves to calculate the specific leaf area and percentage herbivory. To identify anatomical structures, we collected fully expanded leaves from three individuals per quadrat. Results: For M. arborescens, plants with thicker leaves and higher specific leaf area have less herbivore damage. For M. linifera, plants from deeper sites and with thicker leaves had more herbivore damage, while plants that grew farther from the margin had less damage. We found anatomical structures related to defense, such as idioblast cells with phenolic compounds, and cells with solid inclusions that can contribute to avoiding severe damage. Conclusions: Herbivory in these Montrichardia species can be explained by a combination of plant and environmental traits (patch isolation and water depth). The main plant traits are leaf thickness and area, but chemical compounds and solid inclusions also help Montrichardia to sustain less damage than other macrophytes.

AB  - Simple Summary: Latoia consocia Walker is an important herbivorous pest that has severely invaded North China in recent years. This study utilized the MaxEnt model system to investigate the impact of climate conditions on its distribution. The results show that the optimum temperature range of L. consocia is 5 similar to 14.5 degrees C, and the optimum annual precipitation range is 1980 similar to 2580 mm. With the warming of the climate, the potential habitat area of L. consocia will decrease in the future. These findings help to provide a scientific basis for pest control and inform scientific management strategies.
   Latoia consocia Walker is an important phytophagous pest that has rapidly spread across North China in recent years, posing a severe threat to related plants. To study the impact of climatic conditions on its distribution and to predict its distribution under current and future climate conditions, the MaxEnt niche model and ArcGIS 10.8 software were used. The results showed that the MaxEnt model performs well in predicting the distribution of L. consocia, with an AUC value of 0.913. The annual precipitation (Bio12), the precipitation of the driest month (Bio14), the temperature annual range (Bio7), and the minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6) are key environmental factors affecting the potential distribution of L. consocia. Under current climate conditions, L. consocia has a highly suitable growth area of 2243 km(2) in China, among which Taiwan has the largest high-suitable area with a total area of 1450 km(2). With climate warming, the potential habitat area for L. consocia shows an overall decreasing trend in future. This work provides a scientific basis for research on pest control and ecological protection. A "graded response" detection and early warning system, as well as prevention and control strategies, can be developed for potentially suitable areas to effectively address this pest challenge.

AB  - Microplastics in marine environments can act as vectors for pathogenic bacteria, increasing the risk of infection and physiological stress in marine organisms. Seahorses, which inhabit coastal ecosystems, may be vulnerable to the combined effects of microplastics and bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio harveyi. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of microplastic and bacteria co-exposure on big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis). Microbeads (MBs) were introduced via water exposure, while V. harveyi was administered by injection. Seahorses were exposed to microbeads (MBs; concentration; 50 beads/L; size, 0.2 and 1.0 mu m), V. harveyi (1 x 103 CFU/mL), and a combination of both for 4 days to evaluate oxidative stress responses. Tissue sampling was performed at 0, 1, 2, and 4 days. Notably, MB accumulation in the gills and intestine was significantly higher in the group co-exposured to MB and bacteria than in the single exposure groups. V. harveyi copy number in the liver was significantly higher in the co-exposure groups, especially in the Vh + MB1.0 group. Compared with the control group, MB and V. harveyi co-exposure significantly upregulated antioxidant response, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxin mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide levels and DNA damage were elevated in the Vh + MB1.0 group, indicating enhanced oxidative stress and genotoxicity. In conclusion, MB and V. harveyi co-exposure induces oxidative stress and DNA damage in seahorse, suggesting potential ecological risks associated with simultaneous exposure to microplastics and marine pathogens in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The geochemistry of copper (Cu) is generally assumed to be controlled by organic matter in soils. However, the role of clay and iron oxide minerals may be understated. Soil density fractionation, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were combined to assess the long-term behavior of Cu in an agricultural soil subject to organic waste application. Two unprecedented molecular environments of natural Cu (i.e. Cu inherited from the parent rock) in soils are reported: Cu dimer in the interlayer of vermiculite and Cu structurally incorporated within hematite. Moreover, the soil naturally containing Cu-vermiculite, Cu-hematite, but also Cu-kaolinite (Cu-total = 122 mg.kg(-1)) was amended over 11 years with Cu-rich pig slurry in which Cu was 100 % Cu(I) sulfide. Natural Cu associated with clay and iron oxide minerals persisted in the amended soil, but the exogenous Cu(I) sulfide was unstable. The increase in Cu concentration in the amended soil to 174 mg.kg(-1) was accounted for the increase of Cu sorbed to kaolinite and Cu bound to organic matter. These results are important for better understanding the natural occurrence of Cu in soils and for assessing the environmental impacts of organic waste recycling in agricultural fields.

AB  - Estimating the capacity of cover crops (CC) to capture soil nitrogen (N) and to transfer captured N to subsequent crop remains a challenge because CC biomass production, N content and decomposition rate vary depending on environmental conditions and management practices. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare biomass production and N accumulation by a mixture of red and white clovers intercropped with barley, and oat, field pea and oilseed radish grown as catch crops after barley harvest, (2) to determine the capacity of different CCs to catch and transfer fertilizer N (mineral or pig slurry) to subsequent wheat and the soil reserve, and (3) to determine the influence of CC type on yield of spring wheat in the next year. A 2-y crop rotation (barley ? wheat) was repeated twice on a sandy loam using 15N-labelled fertilizers applied at the time of CC establishment. Fertilization increased above-ground biomass yield in oat and oilseed radish, but had little effect on legume CCs. The legume CCs accumulated more total N in their biomass (63?127 kg N ha-1) than non-legume CCs (47?68 kg N ha-1). However, oat and oilseed radish were more efficient at capturing the applied fertilizer 15N (33?51 %) than legume CCs (2?36 %). Intercropped clovers resulted in the largest increases in subsequent wheat yields (23?92 %), followed by oilseed radish and field pea. At the end of the 2-y rotation (wheat harvest), the recovery of fertilizer 15N by subsequent wheat was < 10 %, whereas 26?60 % were still present in the 0-30 cm soil layer. We conclude that non-legume CCs have a good capacity to capture applied fertilizer N, whereas legume CCs (especially clovers) had a limited capacity. Nevertheless, clovers CC resulted in the greatest wheat yields in the following year, likely due to efficent transfer of symbiotically fixed N and improved soil quality, whereas fertilizer N captured by non-legume CCs was mainly routed to the soil N reserve, with potential to supply N to subsequent crops through a legacy effect.

AB  - Wild Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), which are native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding areas, have been kept in captivity as an effective way to conserve musk deer ex situ and sustainably utilize musk resources. From 1 November to 31 December of 2019, the behaviors of 40 captive Alpine musk deer in Xin-glongshan Musk Deer Farm (XMDF) in Gansu Province of western China were sampled by focal sampling and the all-occurrence recording method. Moreover, harvested musk was analyzed for muscone using gas chromatog-raphy (GC), and the adrenal cortisol metabolite levels of fecal samples were detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The effects of social housing modes (solitary deer per enclosure [SE] or group enclosures [GE]) on the behavior, hormones, and musk secretion of musk deer were investigated. The results showed that most captive male musk deer (75.0%) in the XMDF exhibited stereotypic behavior, with an average duration of stereotypic behaviors of 8.8% ( +/- 0.5%) of the total observation time. The fecal cortisol metabolite level of musk deer with stereotypic behavior (48.1 +/- 4.3 ng/g) was significantly higher than that of musk deer without stereotypic behavior (33.5 +/- 6.6 ng/g). The proportion of stereotypic behavior was significantly lower in SE musk deer (50.0%) than in GE musk deer (83.3%), and the duration of stereotypic behavior (7.3% +/- 0.3%) and fecal cortisol metabolite level (29.9 +/- 3.1 ng/g) of the SE deer were significantly lower than those of GE (9.2% +/- 0.6%; 49.4 +/- 4.5 ng/g). There was no significant difference in musk yield and muscone content between SE musk deer (5.8 +/- 1.4 g, 1.5% +/- 0.3%) and GE musk deer (7.4 +/- 0.8 g, 1.0% +/- 0.1%). The results showed that the social housing mode is not significantly related to musk yield, muscone, or other performance indicators. It also showed that the stereotypic behavior and cortisol metabolites are significantly lower in SE musk deer. Therefore, we concluded that the animal welfare of captive musk deer can be improved through changes in social housing modes.

AB  - Simple Summary Duroc boars were supplemented by sodium selenite or selenium nanoparticles at the dose of 0.3 mg Se/kg/day for 126 days. Sampling was carried out at days 0, 42, 84 and 126. Sperm qualitative parameters and antioxidant activity were compared with those of the control group (without selenium supplementation). The findings indicate that SeNPs slightly improved GPx activity, and both SeNPs and sodium selenite influenced the antioxidant capacity of semen. This research also showed that both treatments did not affect semen qualitative parameters based on comparisons with the control group. Selenium is an essential compound which can influence the fertility of boars by a greater margin. In past decades, research was mainly focused on a bioavailability of various selenium forms and the effect on semen quality. Recently, nanotechnology has expanded the possibilities of selenium supplementation research. Twenty-one Duroc boars (three groups with seven boars each) were included in this experiment with the first group being a control group with no selenium supplementation, and the second group being supplemented with 0.3 mg Se/kg of selenium in inorganic form of Na2SeO3. The third group was supplemented with selenium nanoparticles (100 nm) at the same dose as that of the second group. The experiment lasted for 126 days (three spermatogenesis cycles of boars) and the antioxidant parameters of boar semen were analysed at 42, 84 and 126 days, respectively. The antioxidant parameters (DPPH, FRAP, DMPD, GSH, GSSG) were not influenced by both Se2NO3 and selenium nanoparticle supplementation during this experiment. At the end of the monitored period, significantly higher (p < 0.004) antioxidant readings were observed by using the ABTS method but not the DPPH, DMPD and FRAP methods on the supplemented groups compared to the control. Moreover, selenium-nanoparticle-supplemented groups showed elevated glutathione peroxidase activity in the seminal fluid (p < 0.008). However, the selenium nanoparticle supplementation has not shown an improving effect on sperm quality. This could be considered as a safe alternative to inorganic selenium as well as having a potential to enhance the antioxidant properties of the semen of boars.

AB  - The Santa Elina rock shelter (Central Brazil) stands out with two human occupation layers with ground sloth fossil remains from the Late Pleistocene. Here, we explore the palaeontological aspect of this site. We update the taxonomic assignment of the ground sloth found in the shelter to Glossotherium phoenesis. Radiocarbon dating performed on bioapatite (C-14(bioapatite)) from two tooth specimens reveal the minimum ages of 14 944-15 239 cal a bp (unit II2) and 22 339-22 534 cal a bp (unit III4), which were converted to collagen using a novel approach and presented the calibrated ages of 17 450-17 906 cal a bp (C-14(collagen) = 14 547 & PLUSMN; 40) and 25 994-26 396 cal a bp (C-14(collagen) = 22 042 & PLUSMN; 40). We reinforce the chronology of the oldest unit of Santa Elina with material culture in association with megafauna bones to the Last Glacial Maximum. Carbon isotopic signatures suggest a mixed feeding diet for both specimens. The most recent ground sloth presents a higher isotopic value (& delta;C-13 = -1.8 & PTSTHOUSND;) and narrower niche breadth (B-A = 0.50) than the oldest one (& delta;C-13 = -3.3 & PTSTHOUSND;; B-A = 0.74). We conclude that G. phoenesis lived in an arboreal savanna habitat during the phases studied. Slightly different oxygen isotopic values (& delta;O-18 = 26.2 & PTSTHOUSND; and 27.9 & PTSTHOUSND;) might suggest a decrease in humidity over time. Our results provide insights into the palaeoecology of the tropical Pleistocene G. phoenesis and the palaeoenvironmental setting of Santa Elina when occupied by early humans and megafauna during the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - Simple Summary The high consumption of water by livestock is a major drawback from an environmental point of view. In addition, the fact that arid or semi-arid areas have water with high salinity can decrease the quality of the products derived from these animals. Therefore, the present work is proposed with the objective of understanding how the supply of water with different salinities can affect the quality of milk. Therefore, the results of this work will derive important conclusions of vital importance for farmers in these areas. Due to its necessity and magnitude, water is essential for animal nutrition. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of increasing levels of water salinity on the quality of goat milk in the Brazilian semiarid region. Twenty-four multiparous Alpine goats, with an average live weight of 38.0 +/- 4.0 kg and an average lactation period of 30 days, distributed entirely at random, were used. The experiment lasted 64 days including an initial period of 14 days of adaption to the diet. The experimental treatments consisted of water with different levels of total dissolved solids (TDS): 640, 3188, 5740, and 8326 mg L-1, obtained using sodium chloride (NaCl). Increasing the levels of TDS in drinking water from 640 to 8326 mg L-1 did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect the production and the physicochemical composition of the milk. There was a linear increase (p < 0.05) in the water consumption and acidity variables as a function of the total dissolved solid levels. The mineral composition of the milk was not altered with increasing levels of TDS in water from 640 to 8326 mg L-1. There was no negative effect (p > 0.05) for any of the sensorial attributes analyzed in relation to the treatments. Therefore, as a general conclusion, based on the analyses carried out in this experiment, it was found that water with total dissolved solids, when supplied for short periods of up to 48 days, does not alter the production, physicochemical characteristics, or the organoleptic properties of goat's milk.

AB  - The humic acid (HA) possesses a more recalcitrant structure, making it crucial carbon components that improve carbon sequestration. Moreover, ferrous ions could improve microbial activity and enhance compost humification, and their oxidation into iron oxides could adsorb carbon components for sequestration. Based on the advantages of low cost and easy availability of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), this study investigated the effect of FeSO4 on carbon sequestration during composting. Chicken manure (CM) and food waste (FW) composting were carried out in four treatments, namely control (CM, FW) and 5% (w/w) FeSO4 treated groups (CM+, FW+). Results indicated that FeSO4 increased HA content, improved organic carbon stability. Carbon loss for CM, CM+, FW and FW + treatments were 48.5%, 46.2%, 45.0%, and 40.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, FeSO4 enhanced the function of bacterial taxa involved in HA synthesis in CM + treatment, and improved the number of core bacteria significantly associated with formation of HA and iron oxide. SEM analysis verified that role of FeSO4 was significant in promoting HA synthesis during CM + composting, while it was remarkably in enhancing HA sequestration during FW + composting. This article provided fundamental theoretical backing for enhancing HA production and improving carbon sequestration during different materials composting.

AB  - The island syndrome hypothesis (ISH) stipulates that, as a result of local selection pressures and restricted gene flow, individuals from island populations should differ from individuals within mainland populations. Specifically, island populations are predicted to contain individuals that are larger, less aggressive, more sociable, and that invest more in their offspring. To date, tests of the ISH have mainly compared oceanic islands to continental sites, and rarely smaller spatial scales such as inland watersheds. Here, using a novel set of genome-wide SNP markers in wild deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) we conducted a genomic assessment of predictions underlying the ISH in an inland riverine island system: analysing island-mainland population structure, and quantifying heritability of phenotypes thought to underlie the ISH. We found clear genomic differentiation between the island and mainland populations and moderate to high marker-based heritability estimates for overall variation in traits previously found to differ in line with the ISH between mainland and island locations. F-ST outlier analyses highlighted 12 loci associated with differentiation between mainland and island populations. Together these results suggest that the island populations examined are on independent evolutionary trajectories, the traits considered have a genetic basis (rather than phenotypic variation being solely due to phenotypic plasticity). Coupled with the previous results showing significant phenotypic differentiation between the island and mainland groups in this system, this study suggests that the ISH can hold even on a small spatial scale.

AB  - Diagnostics of the gastrointestinal strongiloidosises in ruminants requires methods that are characterized by high analytical sensitivity and accuracy, are easy to replicate, and quickly detect parasite eggs. At the first stage of the study, we tested the analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and precision of the method of quantitative helminthocoproscopic examination, modified McMaster technique, and Mini-FLOTAC (combined with Fill-Flotac). The faecal samples were collected from animals in Kirovohrad and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. The known numbers of eggs isolated from bovine or sheep faeces were added to the egg-free bovine and sheep cattle stool samples to obtain the values of 10, 50, 200, and 500 eggs per gram of faeces. The objective of the study was assessment of the performances of the coprological diagnostic methods for the egg-spiked samples and samples from naturally-infested ruminants. The method of quantitative helminthocoproscopic examination proved effective in the case of a low concentration of eggs (10-50 EPG), exerting 100% analytical sensitivity. The number of eggs in 1 g of faeces detected using Mini-FLOTAC was not significantly different from the expected estimates at any level of egg density. With increase in the number of eggs to over 200 per 1 g of faeces from cows and sheep, we observed a statistical difference (Tukey's Test) among the three methods. Using a new method of quantitative helminthocoproscopic examination, we were able to detect the highest number of naturally infested animals (54.8% of the cattle, 59.2% of the sheep, and 68.7% of the goats). Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was the highest for sheep between the method of Quantitative Helminthocoproscopic Examination and the modified McMasters technique (CCC = 0.93). The provided data indicate the possibility of using the method we proposed in the case of low intensity of animal infestation (3-5 EPG). The prospects for future studies lie in testing the efficiency of Quantitative Helminthocoproscopic Examination on other species of animals and also in cases of their infestations with protozoa, cestodes, and trematodes.

AB  - The susceptibility of seven species of chestnuts to the horse chestnut leaf miner was studied in the arboretum of the Main Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences (MBG RAS), taking into account their interspecific characteristics. Using pheromone delta traps, the highest number of Cameraria ohridella moths was shown for Aesculus hippocastanum and the lowest for Aesculus chinensis. A number of anatomical parameters of leaves were investigated, such as the thickness of the epidermal cell wall and the thickness of the palisade and spongy parenchyma layers. As a result, it was shown that the most infected chestnut species had a greater thickness of the nutritious parenchyma tissue. No dependence was found between the degree of susceptibility to the horse chestnut leaf miner and such indicators as the content of chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids in the leaves of seven species of chestnuts. Nevertheless, resistance of different species of the genus Aesculus to Cameraria ohridella under increased tannin content in leaves has been shown. Evaluation of phenolic compounds and flavonoids has not established their reliable role as repellents. The high levels of carbohydrates found during the study contributed to increased susceptibility to the horse chestnut leaf miner.

AB  - Female northern elephant seals ( Mirounga angustirostris ) are migratory animals that form colonies along the coasts of California and the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. A recent decline in abundance has been recorded in this species Mexican distribution, which is an important reason to investigate the different ecological processes operating in these colonies. The aim of this study was to determine values of stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in pup fur as foraging maternal indicators. During the same breeding season (2015), pup fur samples were collected to investigate these foraging variations between the two major Mexican colonies-Guadalupe Island (GI) and the San Benito Archipelago (SBA). Isotopic areas were built using the 'SIBER' package in R , and a custom hierarchical Bayesian model was used to compare the values from both localities. Mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) delta C-13 values for individuals from GI and the SBA were -16.9 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand and -17.3 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand, respectively, while delta N-15 values were 17.4 +/- 1.1%o and 16.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand , respectively. The difference between the posterior means indicated a high probability (P > 99%) of GI having higher stable isotope ratio values than the SBA. For the posterior SDs, there were highly probable differences (P = 100%) only for delta C-13, where GI had a higher dispersion. Such differences explained why GI presented a wider isotopic niche area than the SBA, indicating more diverse foraging habits along GI's offshore -inshore gradient. Additionally, GI showed higher delta N-15 values than the SBA. Although this could be related to a slightly higher trophic position for GI individuals, the latitudinal effects of foraging grounds with distinct isotopic baselines remain a plausible explanation for the variations in both isotope ratios, suggesting that individuals from the SBA foraged in a more northerly location than those from GI. This study provides valuable knowledge about how females from both colonies partition resources, especially regarding habitat use.

AB  - Veterinary antibiotics are widely used in many countries worldwide to treat diseases and protect the health of animals. However, the effects of sulfonamide antibiotics introduced via manure and wastewater irrigation on nitrogen (N) loss in the soil-plant system remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a pot experiment to assess the effects of sulfamethazine (SMZ) and its degradation product (2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine, ADPD) at four concentration gradients (i.e., 0, 1, 10, 100 mg kg(-1)) on nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) emissions, and the abundances of N-cycling functional genes and sulfonamide resistance genes. We also collated 350 observations from 62 published papers and performed a meta-analysis of antibiotic addition effects on N2O emission and soil net nitrification and de-nitrification. Antibiotics additions showed an inhibitory effect on N2O emissions, which accords with the trend of our meta-analysis showing a significant decrease of 32%. The decreased N2O emissions were attributed to the significant reduction in the abundances of total bacterial communities, ammonia oxidizers, and nir-type denitrifiers and to the resultant changes in soil inorganic N. N2O emissions did not differ between non-environmentally relevant concentrations for SMZ but lowered with increasing ADPD concentrations. This discrepancy can be explained by differential responses of the gene abundances of ammonia oxidizers and nirK-type denitrifiers and the development of antibiotic resistance genes in the highest concentration following antibiotic additions. Antibiotic additions increased soil NH3 volatilization but did not affect vegetable yield. Therefore, these findings provide insight into how the prevalence of antibiotics in soils could alter the N-cycling process and associated gas emissions, with implications for understanding the ecological risks of antibiotics in agriculture.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of sheep manure and cow dung in wet (TS 8 %) and dry (TS 20 %) conditions with five SM/CD ratios (4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, and 0:4) using batch processes. The results demonstrated that the dry AD system with an SM/CD ratio of 1:3 (DP4) exhibited a high degradation rate of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and maintained optimal methane (CH4) production, compared to all treatments in wet AD. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that DP4 promoted the relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria (e.g., Clostridium sensu stricto), acidogens (e.g., Terrisporobacter), and syntrophic acetogens (e.g., Petrimonas). These microbial communities actively facilitated organic biodegradation, VFAs generation, and conversion. Additionally, co-occurrence network analysis showed stronger syntrophic relationships between bacteria and methanogens within the dry AD system especially in DP4 compared to the wet AD system. The symbiotic relationship, connected by the mediators, especially Petrimonas, facilitated the conversion of VFAs and H2/CO2 into CH4 through acetoclastic pathway dominated by Methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic pathways dominated by Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera, respectively. This study highlights the potential of maximizing CH4 production in dry AD with specific feedstock ratio through positive microbial interactions.

AB  - Background Family Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats), Hipposideridae (leaf-nosed bats) and Rhinonycteridae (trident bats) are exclusively distributed in the Old-World, and their biogeography reflects the complex historic geological events throughout the Cenozoic. Here we investigated the origin of these families and unravel the conflicting family origin theories using a high resolution tree covering taxa from each zoogeographic realm from Africa to Australia. Ancestral range estimations were performed using a probabilistic approach implemented in BioGeoBEARS with subset analysis per biogeographic range [Old-World as whole, Australia-Oriental-Oceania (AOO) and Afrotropical-Madagascar-Palearctic (AMP)]. Result Our result supports an Oriental origin for Rhinolophidae, whereas Hipposideridae originated from the Oriental and African regions in concordance with fossil evidence of both families. The fossil evidence indicates that Hipposideridae has diversified across Eurasia and the Afro-Arabian region since the Middle Eocene. Meanwhile, Rhinonycteridae (the sister family of Hipposideridae) appears to have originated from the Africa region splitting from the common ancestor with Hipposideridae in Africa. Indomalaya is the center of origin of Rhinolophidae AOO lineages, and Indomalayan + Philippines appears to be center of origin of Hipposideridae AOO lineage indicating allopatric speciation and may have involved jump-dispersal (founder-event) speciation within AOO lineage. Wallacea and the Philippines may have been used as stepping stones for dispersal towards Oceania and Australia from the Oriental region. Multiple colonization events via different routes may have occurred in the Philippines (i.e., Palawan and Wallacea) since the Late Miocene. The colonization of Rhinolophidae towards Africa from Asia coincided with the estimated time of Tethys Ocean closure around the Oligocene to Miocene (around 27 Ma), allowing species to disperse via the Arabian Peninsula. Additionally, the number of potential cryptic species in Rhinolophidae in Southeast Asia may have increased since Plio-Pleistocene and late Miocene. Conclusion Overall, we conclude an Oriental origin for Rhinolophidae, and Oriental + African for Hipposideridae. The result demonstrates that complex historical events, in addition to species specific ecomorphology and specialization of ecological niches may shape current distributions.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) in the atmosphere frequently affects plant growth, ecological stoichiometric equilibrium, and homeostasis stability. However, the effect of N addition application on the growth of Hippophae rhamnoides seedlings remains ambiguous. We investigated the effects of N addition on the ecological stoichiometry and homeostatic characteristics of H. rhamnoides seedlings. Greenhouse cultivation experiments were conducted at five N application levels: 0 kg ha-1 yr-1(CK), 100 kg ha-1 yr-1 (N10), 200 kg ha-1 yr-1 (N20), 400 kg ha-1 yr-1 (N40), 800 kg ha-1 yr-1 (N80). The results showed that pH and available phosphorus (AP) significantly decreased with increasing N, whereas soil C:P and N:P ratios significantly increased under the N40 and N80 treatments. The leaf C:N ratio significantly decreased with increasing N, whereas the N:P ratio increased. With N addition, the C:N ratio of plant stems and roots significantly decreased, whereas the C:P and N:P ratios significantly increased. N addition was significantly correlated with the ecological stoichiometry of plant leaves and soil properties (0.38 and 0.84, respectively). Homeostasis of the organs of H. rhamnoides seedlings exhibited an absolute steady state. The C, N, and C:P ratios of the roots exhibited insensitive states under the N40 treatment. N addition significantly modified both the soil ecological stoichiometry and the stoichiometry of H. rhamnoides seedlings. However, it did not demonstrate a pronounced negative effect on the homeostasis of H. rhamnoides seedlings. This study offers new insights into the ecological adaptation process of H. rhamnoides, , particularly concerning its nutrient distribution, utilization strategies, and stability.

AB  - The use of organic nutrient regimes is regarded as holistic and ecological approach for agricultural sustainability. It offers improved soil health, increased crop growth and enhanced fruit quality, whilst minimizing costs and sustaining the use of natural resources. The present investigation was conducted over two consecutive seasons, viz. 2021-22 and 2022-23 at Mizoram University, Aizawl, India to study the effect of different combinations of organic manures along with consortium of biofertilizers on leaf and soil characteristics of purple passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims). The investigation comprises of fourteen treatments of various combinations of organic manures along with consortium of biofertilizers, viz. farmyard Manure (FYM) vermicompost (VC) pig manure (PIM), poultry manure (POM), Azospirillum, phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), potash solubilizing bacteria (KSB), and vesicular arbascular mycorrhiza (VAM). The results demonstrated that the use of organic amendments in combination with biofertilizers enhanced leaf nutrient status as well soil properties in the passion fruit orchard. Among the different treatment combinations used in the investigation, POM + Azospirillum + PSB + KSB + VAM was the most efficient in improving the leaf and soil nutrient status of passion fruit. This consortium may achieve high microbial load, high nutrient availability for soil which results in better growth of the crop. This treatment may therefore be recommended as an alternative option to meet the demand for long term maintenance of soil fertility as well agro-ecosystem conservation and sustainability.

AB  - Microgramma, a neotropical group, is little explored in the literature on the anatomy, histochemistry, and secretory structures, especially about coexisting species in environments with high biodiversity. This study selected two more abundant and coexisting Microgramma species as models in a Conservation Unit of the Amazon rainforest. By emphasising secretory structures, this study aims to provide insights about (1) anatomical traits most related to resistance to herbivory in the selected species, (2) the similarities and divergences of the secretory structures and their exudates, and (3) structural and histochemical novelties for the group. The sterile leaves were collected following light and scanning electron microscopy protocols, and evaluating herbivory levels. Both species had glandular trichomes, dispersed in M. lycopodioides, and clustered under scales in M. reptans. The trichomes had positive histochemical results for phenolic compounds, total lipids, acidic mucilages, alkaloids, proteins, and polysaccharides. Hydathodes were recorded for the first time in M. reptans, with mucilages and alkaloids, an unusual composition. Leaf herbivory was low in both species and significantly higher in M. lycopodioides than in M. reptans. The association formed by scales and glandular trichomes and the presence of heterogeneous compositions in the hydathodes of M. reptans could help in the protection against herbivores.

AB  - Simple Summary Moringa oleifera and Chlorella vulgaris microalgae have a good balance of amino acids with high protein contents; however, complementary and synergic effects between proteins can improve their nutritive value compared to the individual additive. Replacing a concentrate mixture at 20% to 40% levels with a mixture of M. oleifera and microalgae improved nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation characteristics, milk production, composition and the fatty acid profile of goats. Inclusion of M. oleifera and microalgae mixture to partially replace concentrates may enhance milk production performance and milk quality without affecting animal health. Exploring suitable alternatives for high-cost concentrate feeds is a critical factor for successful livestock production. The present experiment aimed to evaluate the dietary inclusion of Moringa oleifera silage and Chlorella vulgaris microalgae (at 1% of total diet, DM basis) in a quintuplicate 3 x 3 Latin square design for milk production performance, nutrient utilization and ruminal fermentation in Damascus goats. Fifteen lactating Damascus goats were divided into three groups to be fed a diet composed of a concentrate mixture and rice straw at 60:40 (DM basis) in the control group and fed for 30 days in each period. The concentrate mixture in the control treatment was replaced with M. oleifera silage and C. vulgaris microalgae at 20% (MA20 treatment) or 40% (MA40 treatment). Treatments did not affect total feed intake but increased (p < 0.01) crude protein (CP) and fiber intakes while decreasing nonstructural carbohydrates intake. The digestibility of CP and acid detergent fiber increased due to silage supplementation compared to the control treatment. Treatments increased (p < 0.05) ruminal pH and the concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, acetate, and propionate; however, they decreased (p < 0.05) the concentrations of ammonia-N. Treatments increased (p < 0.05) the concentrations of serum glucose and antioxidant capacity. Both MA20 and MA40 treatments increased the daily milk production, the concentrations of milk fat and lactose, and feed efficiency compared to the control treatment. Additionally, MA20 and MA40 treatments increased the proportions of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and total conjugated linoleic acids. It is concluded that the concentrate feed mixture in the diet of lactating goats can be replaced up to 40% (equals to 24% of total diet) with M. oleifera silage to improve feed intake and nutrient utilization, and milk production performance.

AB  - Composting has been recognized as an environmentally acceptable method for treating animal carcasses. This field-scale study was designed to investigate the feasibility of dead pigs in a forced aeration composting system with dimension of 3.92 m length x 5.0 m width. Pig carcass composting was conducted during different seasons to determine the effect of different ambient temperatures on pig carcass degradation. Results showed that the forced aeration composting system was effective in disposal of dead pigs. High degradation of mortalities (> 91.4%) occurred in all treatment after 49 d composting periods. All flesh was completely degraded and only fragments of bones can be found. The days when compost pile temperature of trials in autumn, summer, next autumn and winter was above 50 degrees C were 32, 47, 34 and 31 days, respectively. In our study, cold season had no significant influence on the carcass decomposition rate, and ambient temperature of < 0 degrees C did not hinder the use of forced aeration system for the disposal of dead pigs. Turning during composting can promote the complete degradation of pig carcasses.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the hypothesis that BDNF modulates the activity of the gonadotrophic axis in sheep. Central infusions of BDNF were administered to sexually mature Polish Merino sheep. The sheep were randomly divided into three groups: the control group received intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusions of the vehicle, the BDNF 10 group received ICV infusions of BDNF at 10 mu g/480 mu L/day, and the BDNF 60 group was infused with BDNF at 60 mu g/480 mu L/day. A series of four infusions on three consecutive days was performed. Blood samples were collected on days 0 and 3 of the infusions. Immediately after the experiment, all the sheep were slaughtered, and selected structures of the hypothalamus and pituitaries were collected for Real Time RT-qPCR analysis. The collected plasma samples, as well as parts of pituitaries were stored for radioimmunoassay analysis of LH and FSH.
   Central treatment with exogenous BDNF stimulated GnRH mRNA expression in the preoptic area, as well as GnRH-R mRNA in the pituitary. Furthermore, substantial changes in the KNDy mRNA expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus were observed after the ICV BDNF administration. Additionally, central BDNF infusion caused a decrease in LH concentration and a simultaneous increase in FSH concentration in peripheral blood. Neither pulse amplitude nor pulse frequency for any gonadotrophin was affected in both groups of sheep that received BDNF infusion.
   Our results revealed that exogenous BDNF affects GnRH and KNDy gene expression and changes in the LH and FSH pituitary cell secretory activities. These findings suggest that BDNF may participate in the mechanism modulating the activity of the gonadotrophic axis at the central level in female sheep.

AB  - Migratory ungulates are thought to be declining globally because their dependence on large landscapes renders them highly vulnerable to environmental change. Yet recent studies reveal that many ungulate species can adjust their migration propensity in response to changing environmental conditions to potentially improve population persistence. In addition to the question of whether to migrate, decisions of where and when to migrate appear equally fundamental to individual migration tactics, but these three dimensions of plasticity have rarely been explored together. Here, we expand the concept of migratory plasticity beyond individual switches in migration propensity to also include spatial and temporal adjustments to migration patterns. We develop a novel typological framework that delineates every potential change type within the three dimensions, then use this framework to guide a literature review. We discuss broad patterns in migratory plasticity, potential drivers of migration change, and research gaps in the current understanding of this trait. Our result reveals 127 migration change events in direct response to natural and human-induced environmental changes across 27 ungulate species. Species that appeared in multiple studies showed multiple types of change, with some exhibiting the full spectrum of migratory plasticity. This result highlights that multidimensional migratory plasticity is pervasive in ungulates, even as the manifestation of plasticity varies case by case. However, studies thus far have rarely been able to determine the fitness outcomes of different types of migration change, likely due to the scarcity of long-term individual-based demographic monitoring as well as measurements encompassing a full behavioral continuum and environmental gradient for any given species. Recognizing and documenting the full spectrum of migratory plasticity marks the first step for the field of migration ecology to employ quantitative methods, such as reaction norms, to predict migration change along environmental gradients. Closer monitoring for changes in migratory propensity, routes, and timing may improve the efficacy of conservation strategies and management actions in a rapidly changing world.

AB  - Oomycetes, represented by Phytophthora, are seriously harmful to agricultural production, resulting in a decline in grain quality and agricultural products and causing great economic losses. Integrated management of oomycete diseases is becoming more challenging, and plant derivatives represent effective alternatives to synthetic chemicals as novel crop protection solutions. Biologically active secondary metabolites are rapidly synthesized and released by plants in response to biotic stress caused by herbivores or insects, as well as pathogens. In this study, we identified groups of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from soybean plants inoculated with Phytophthora sojae, the causal agent of soybean root rot. 4-Ethylphenol was present among the identified VOCs and was induced in the incompatible interaction between the plants and the pathogen. 4-Ethylphenol inhibited the growth of P. sojae and Phytophthora nicotianae and had toxicity to sporangia formation and zoospore germination by destroying the pathogen cell membrane; it had a good control effect on soybean root rot and tobacco black shank in the safe concentration range. Furthermore, 4-Ethylphenol had a potent antifungal activity against three soil-borne phytopathogenic fungi, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium graminearum, and Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici, and four forma specialis of Fusarium oxysporum, which suggest a potential to be an eco-friendly biological control agent.

AB  - Simple Summary Healthy sperm viability, the core of male fertility, affects the sustainability of livestock breeding. Several studies have shown a strong link between male sperm motility and gut microbial regulation of the host metabolome, testicular function, and gut microbiota. However, few studies have examined the association between the gut microbiome, host metabolome, and testicular function. In this study, the microbiome and metabolome of adult sheep with significantly different sperm viabilities were analyzed. Our results confirm that gut microorganisms and metabolites differ significantly in sheep with different sperm viabilities and are strongly correlated among themselves and with sperm viability. Thus, our study provides new insights into weak spermatozoa in rams. A close association exists among testicular function, gut microbiota regulation, and organismal metabolism. In this study, serum and seminal plasma metabolomes, and the rumen microbiome of sheep with significant differences in sperm viability, were explored. Serum and seminal plasma metabolomes differed significantly between high-motility (HM) and low-motility (LM) groups of sheep, and 39 differential metabolites closely related to sperm motility in sheep were found in seminal plasma metabolomes, while 35 were found in serum samples. A 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that the relative abundance of HM and LM rumen microorganisms, such as Ruminococcus and Quinella, was significantly higher in the HM group, whereas genera such as Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Lactobacillus were enriched in the mid-LM group. Serum hormone assays revealed that serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and MT levels were significantly lower in the LM group than in the HM group, whereas serum glucocorticoid (GC) levels were higher in the LM group than in the HM group, and they all affected sperm motility in sheep. Ruminococcus and other rumen microorganisms were positively correlated with sperm motility, whereas Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with FSH and GCs levels. Our findings suggest that rumen microbial activity can influence the host metabolism and hormone levels associated with fertility in sheep.

AB  - Humans are ubiquitously exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), substances that interfere with endogenous hormonal signaling. Exposure during early development is of particular concern due to the pro-gramming role of hormones during this period. A previous epidemiological study has shown association between prenatal co-exposure to 8 EDCs (Mixture N1) and language delay in children, suggesting an effect of this mixture on neurodevelopment. Furthermore, in utero exposure to Mixture N1 altered gene expression and behavior in adult mice. In this study, we investigated whether epigenetic mechanisms could underlie the long term effects of Mixture N1 on gene expression and behavior. To this end, we analyzed DNA methylation at regulatory regions of genes whose expression was affected by Mixture N1 in the hippocampus of in utero exposed mice using bisulfite-pyrosequencing. We show that Mixture N1 decreases DNA methylation in males at three genes that are part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: Nr3c1, Nr3c2, and Crhr1, coding for the glucocorticoid receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor, and the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the decrease in Nr3c1 methylation correlates with increased gene expression, and that Nr3c1, Nr3c2, and Crhr1 methylation correlates with hyperactivity and reduction in social behavior. These findings indicate that an EDC mixture corresponding to a human exposure scenario induces epigenetic changes, and thus pro-gramming effects, on the HPA axis that are reflected in the behavioral phenotypes of the adult male offspring.

AB  - To explore the effect of low temperature on the anaerobic digestion of pig manure, the anaerobic digestion experiment was carried out under the conditions of inoculum concentration of 30% and TS of 8%. Five low-temperature gradients of 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 degrees C were set to study the activities of gas production, pH, solluted chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), volatile fatty acids (VFAs), coenzymes F-420 and archaea community composition in the digestion process. The results were demonstrated: as the temperature decreased, the more unstable the gas production became, the less gas production produced, and the later the gas peak occurred. There were no significant peaks at either 4 degrees C or 8 degrees C, and the SCOD was unstable over time. From 12 degrees C, the SCOD increased over time, and the higher the temperature, the faster the growth trend. The pH was always greater than 7.6. 8, 12, 16, 20 degrees C had different degrees of VFAs accumulation at the late digestion stage. The higher the temperature, the greater the amount of volatile acid accumulation. When the VFAs of each reactor reached the maximum, the proportion of acetic acid also reached the highest. The digestion system of the five treatment groups was dominated by hydrogen-nutrient methanogenic pathway. The results could provide a further reference for the mechanism of anaerobic digestion of pig manure at low temperatures.

AB  - Regulation of insect pests by predators is an integral component of biological pest control. However, predatorprey interactions often reach a stable state leading to coexistence, which can be problematic for plant protection if the persisting herbivores exceed a damage threshold. Consequently, understanding the factors mediating this stability is crucial for successful biocontrol. Here, we investigated the predator-prey interaction of an important apple pest, the woolly apple aphid (WAA) (Eriosoma lanigerum Hausm.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and its predator, the omnivorous common earwig (Forficula auricularia L.) (Dermaptera: Forficulidae). To this end, we introduced increasing densities of earwigs in gauze-bagged branches harbouring defined amounts of WAA and recorded predation on individual WAA colonies for almost one month. We showed that the spatial complexity of the predation environment and the earwig density determined the predation efficiency on WAAs. Earwigs could eradicate WAAs regardless of density on short apple branches without lateral twigs (first trial). However, on longer, more complex branches (second trial), stable states of WAAs and earwigs were observed. Only the highest earwig density could completely consume WAA regardless of branch complexity. We introduce a conceptual model to describe the searching capability of earwigs, which determines their efficiency in locating prey. Our model predicts that searching capability is reduced by environmental complexity; this effect is alleviated by increased earwig density, as more predators possess a higher searching capability. Conclusively, our model explains why only the highest earwig density could completely consume WAA irrespective of complexity and illustrates how predator density and environmental complexity jointly influence predation. Thus environmental characteristics not inherent to our predator-prey interaction were a decisive factor for effective predation on gauze-bagged branches. Based on these results, reducing tree complexity by pruning or augmenting earwig populations in orchards can increase biocontrol of the WAA.

AB  - The industry has been paying more attention to the quality of excipients since they play a funda-mental role in the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of pharmaceutical products. However, in the case of topical products synthetic compounds have been a concern for consumers, since they can lead to sensitization reactions, disturbance of the microbiota, and impairment in the skin barrier function. Consequently, the pharmaceutical industry has been looking for safer, cheaper, more ef-fective, and more eco-friendly alternatives, and so natural raw materials (or natural ingredients) are good candidates to meet this demand. This narrative review aims to present studies that use natural excipients and describe their advantages, disadvantages and overall performance. In topi-cal formulations, natural ingredients can be found in the form of emulsifiers, emollients, preserv-atives, gelling agents, humectants, and permeation enhancers. The studies show that they fulfill their role in formulations, demonstrating rheological and stable characteristics, as well as not be-ing toxic to skin cells and the microbiota. Moreover, many natural raw materials are biodegrad-able, being less harmful to the environment. More studies are still needed to effectively replace synthetic excipients with natural ones, while maintaining quality control. These raw materials present themselves as a potential alternative and there are vast resources still little explored, and those already used are highly effective and safe.

AB  - Brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) supports neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation and is involved in forms of hippocampus-dependent and independent learning, as well as hippocampus-dependent learning. Extinction learning comprises active inhibition of no-longer relevant learned information, in conjunction with a decreased response of a previously learned behavior. It is highly dependent on context, and evidence exists that it requires hippocampal activation. The participation of BDNF in memory processing is experience-dependent. For example, BDNF has been associated with synaptic plasticity needed for spatial learning, and it is involved in acquisition and extinction learning of fear conditioning. However, little is known about its role in spatial appetitive extinction learning. In this study, we evaluated to what extent BDNF contributes to spatial appetitive extinction learning in the presence (ABA) or absence (AAA) of exposure to the acquisition context. Daily training, of BDNF+/--mice or their wildtype (WT) littermates, to reach acquisition criterion in a T-maze, resulted in a similar performance outcome. However, extinction learning was delayed in the AAA, and impaired in the ABA-paradigm compared to performance in WT littermates. Trial-by-trial learning analysis indicated differences in the integration of the context into extinction learning by BDNF+/--mice compared to WT littermates. Taken together, these results support an important role for BDNF in processes that relate to information updating and retrieval that in turn are crucial for effective extinction learning.

AB  - Central European dry grasslands represent extrazonal patches of the Eurasian steppe biome. They suffer from severe habitat alterations due to land-use changes, abandonment, or inappropriate management. The butterflies Chazara briseis (Linnaeus, 1764) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), Polyommatus damon (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), and Polyommatus dorylas (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), specialized inhabitants of these steppe patches, are all swiftly disappearing from Central Europe. We reviewed data on the recent history of their population retractions in the region, including conservation efforts. Using samples from their whole distribution ranges, we sequenced and analyzed COI and wingless genes and together with Species Distribution Modelling reconstructed their biogeographic histories. Populations of C. briseis expanded over the Eurasian steppe biome, where large ungulates maintained extensive grasslands with short open sward. Polyommatus damon became widespread in the steppes during glacial times, and retracted during interglacials, resembling cold-adapted species. It is limited by too dry weather, and it requires disturbed grassland followed by temporal abandonment. Its present genetic structure was induced by the major Pleistocene Mountain glaciations. Polyommatus dorylas prefers an oceanic climate and populated Central Europe from the Balkans during the Holocene. The species depends on disturbed ground. Currently, all three species inhabit only a few remnant sites in Central Europe, and their populations have been further declining in recent years. Targeted conservation actions, including habitat management at remaining sites, ex situ breeding, and (re)introductions, are being taken in Austria, the Czech Republic, and Germany.

AB  - Animal distribution maps are a key tool for wildlife conservation, guiding high-profile decisions, such as legally designating priority habitat or building highway crossing structures. GPS tracking data enhances these efforts but requires balancing statistically robust sample sizes with minimizing researcher impacts on wildlife and costs. Nevertheless, rigorous guidelines that leverage a priori information are still lacking on how to determine the optimal number of tracked animals (i.e. sample size) for accurately mapping migration corridors and seasonal ranges at the population level, particularly in the context of ungulate conservation. We used a cumulative curve resampling approach to evaluate the consequences of reduced animal sample size, assessed sample size sufficiency and extrapolated where sample size sufficiency might occur outside of the observed data. We illustrate our approach with simulated data. We then compiled GPS data from 77 ungulate populations and aggregated individuals' spatial distributions in each study area to create population-level migration and seasonal distributions and examined whether known explanatory variables (e.g. population abundance, environmental metrics) could predict sufficient sample sizes to map population distribution. Our simulated and empirical analyses to assess and model sample size sufficiency demonstrated that sample size varies depending on the species, season, population-level percent volume contour of interest and population abundance. For example, for migration distributions at the 95% volume contour, the interquartile range for number of individuals needed to reach an adequate sample was 10-23 for bighorn sheep, 51-93 for elk and 58-164 for mule deer. Practical implication. For existing datasets, the resampling approach quantifies the sensitivity of population distribution maps to sample size. To guide study design for future GPS tracking projects aimed at mapping population distributions, our models provide specific sample size recommendations incorporating known population covariates. If adequate model training data are available, our approach can be extended across a wide range of taxa and populations to inform sample size requirements for estimating robust distribution patterns.

AB  - Assessments of historical contingency have advanced our understanding of adaptive radiation and community ecology, but little attention has been given to assessing the importance of historical contingency in population ecology. An obstacle has been the unmet need to conceptualize historical contingencies for populations in a manner that allows for their explanatory power to be assessed and quantified so that it can be directly compared with the explanatory power of statistical models representing other hypotheses or theory-based explanations. Here we conceptualize historical contingencies as a series of random events characterized by (1) significant legacy effects that are comparable in length to the waiting time between such events, and (2) the disparate nature of individual events in the series. From that conceptualization, we present a simple quantitative framework for assessing the explanatory power of historical contingencies in population ecology and apply it to an existing long-term dataset on the predator-prey system in Isle Royale National Park. The population-level phenomenon that we focused on was predation rate because it is a synthesis of three basic elements in population ecology (predator abundance, prey abundance and kill rate). We also compared the explanatory power of models of the historical contingency hypothesis to a wide-range of alternative, theory-based, statistical models used to assess underlying mechanisms or forecast future dynamics. Models of the historical contingency hypothesis explained over half of the interannual variation in predation rate and performed similarly, or better than, the vast majority of alternative, theory-based, models. Those findings highlight the potential value of reconsidering the way that population ecologists traditionally attempt to explain phenomena. We also discuss how this new conceptualization of the historical contingency hypothesis can also be valuable for synthesizing several other important ecological concepts of broad significance, especially reddened spectra, tipping points, alternative stable states, and ecological surprises. If the historical contingency hypothesis were found to be broadly applicable, then it would likely explain why ecologists are conspicuously poor at forecasting future dynamics.

AB  - In this work, the removal of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the industrial-scale pig manure management system has been investigated. Additionally, the implications of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and microbial community structure have been discussed. During the whole period of manure management, 19 ARGs and 7 MGEs were obtained from the system. The results identified that the 9 ARGs and 2 MGEs were removed from the pig manure-based materials after composting, while 5 ARGs and 2 MGEs were still remained, indicating that the ARGs/MGEs could not be removed completely as contaminants by composting. The pig farm without additional antibiotics in-feed was still faced with the risk of ARGs/MGEs from outside. Microbial community analysis illuminated that a greater decrease in the abundance of norank_f__JG30-KF-CM45, Corynebacterium, Terrispor-obacter, Truepera, Salinispora and Clostridium, was responsible for the removal of ARGs/MGEs. The genes, including tnpA-01, tnpA-02, tnpA-05, Tp614, tetQ, tetM-01, tetR-02, tetX, cfxA, floR, dfrA1 and ermF exhibited significantly positive correlation with fungal communities. Fungal community analysis verified that a remarkable decrease in the abundance of Aspergillus and Thermomyces after composting was responsible for the ARGs/MGEs removal. The results elucidated the crucial roles of the related bacterial and fungal communities in the removal of ARGs/MGEs. The compound microbial agent assisted the temperature rise of composting, thereby changing the related microbial community structure and resulting in ARGs/MGEs removal.

AB  - Simple Summary Particulate matter (PM) is the most important hazardous pollutant and seriously affects the respiratory tract health of both animals and humans. Nowadays, the development of intensive animal husbandry not only increases PM pollution in the atmospheric environment but also harms the health of animals and ranch workers. The concentration of PM in poultry houses is higher than that for other animals, such as in pig and cow houses. However, there are few studies on the effect of fine particulate matter on pulmonary microbiota in poultry. This study aims to explore the effect of fine particulate matter on pulmonary microbiota in broilers.Abstract (1) Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) seriously affects the respiratory tract health of both animals and humans. Growing evidence indicates that the pulmonary microbiota is involved in the development of respiratory tract health; however, there is still much that is unknown about the specific changes of pulmonary microbiota caused by PM2.5 in broilers. (2) In this experiment, a total of 48 broilers were randomly divided into a control group and PM-exposure group. The experiment lasted for 21 days. Microbiota, inflammation biomarkers, and histological markers in the lungs were determined. (3) On the last day of the experiment, PM significantly disrupted the structure of lung tissue and induced chronic pulmonary inflammation by increasing IL-6, TNF & alpha;, and IFN & gamma; expression and decreasing IL-10 expression. PM exposure significantly altered the & alpha; and & beta; diversity of pulmonary microbiota. At the phylum level, PM exposure significantly decreased the Firmicutes abundance and increased the abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. At the genus level, PM exposure significantly increased the abundance of Rhodococcus, Achromobacter, Pseudomonas, and Ochrobactrum. We also observed positive associations of the above altered genera with lung TNF & alpha; and IFN & gamma; expression. (4) The results suggest that PM perturbs the pulmonary microbiota and induces chronic inflammation, and the pulmonary microbiota possibly contributes to the development of lung inflammation.

AB  - Microbial deodorization is a novel strategy for reducing odor in livestock and poultry feces. Herein, 12 strains of ammonia (NH3) and 15 hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removing bacteria were obtained with a removal efficiency of 65.20-79.80% and 34.90-79.70%, respectively. A novel bacteria deodorant named MIX (Bacillus zhangzhouensis, Bacillus altitudinis, and Acinetobacter pittii at a ratio of 1:1:2) were obtained. MIX can shorten the temperature rising stage by 2 days and prolong the thermophilic stage by 4 days. The ability of MIX to remove NH3, H2S, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and the underlying removal mechanism were analyzed during pig feces fermentation. MIX can significantly reduce the concentrations of NH3 and H2S by 41.82% and 66.35% and increase the concentrations of NO3--N and SO42- by 7.80% and 8.83% (P < 0.05), respectively, on the 25th day. Moreover, the concentrations of acetic, propionate, iso-valerate, and valerate were significantly reduced. The dominant bacteria communities at the phylum level were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes. B. zhangzhouensis and B. altitudinis could convert NH4+-N to NO3--N, and A. pittii could transfer H2S to SO42-. This study revealed that bacteria deodorant can reduce the concentrations of NH3, H2S, and VFAs in pig feces and increase those of NH4+, NO3-, and SO42- and has excellent potential in deodorizing livestock and poultry feces composting.

AB  - The pollution problems of manure and wastewater in large-scale pig farms are becoming more and more serious with the rapid development of the pig industry. Using straw featuring a large specific surface area as filter media for filtering pig farm wastewater can effectively reduce the concentrations of pollutants, such as pig feces, pig urine, and feed residues in the wastewater, alleviating the subsequent treatment burden. However, the remaining straw filter residues with pollutants and high moisture content lack further recycling approaches. Aerobic composting could be favorable for simultaneously processing the straw filter residues and the pig manure. However, nitrogen losses and harmful gas emissions through ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) volatilizations remain during aerobic composting due to the high ammonia-nitrogen content of swine manure and the anaerobic reactions occurring under insufficient aeration. The coaerobic composting characteristics of straw filter residues and pig manure were investigated by adding phosphorus and magnesium salts based on the mechanisms of magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitation. Although the additives decreased the temperature and shortened the high-temperature duration to some extent, the NH3, N2O, and CH4 emissions were significantly reduced during aerobic composting, realizing the efficient retention of nitrogen and reducing the emissions of harmful gases. Calcium dihydrogen phosphate [Ca(H2PO4)2] combined with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) were optimal additives. Under the optimal conditions, the maximal temperature, duration over 50 degrees C, and seed germination index reached 61.24 degrees C, 15 days, and 95.21%. Meanwhile, the total organic carbon and total nitrogen losses and the NH3, N2O, and CH4 emissions were decreased by 1.55%, 21.65%, 69.83%, 33.18%, and 31.34% compared to the blank control without additives. Straw filtration of wastewater and then co-composting of straw filter residues and manure would be a competitive approach for intensive pig farms to dispose of solid-liquid mixed organic pollutants.

AB  - Phosphorus fertilizer is indispensable in agricultural production. In this study, we focused on pig slurry-treated foamed glass (FGpig), a porous material made of waste glass. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of FGpig as a P fertilizer on different plants compared to that of a conventional P fertilizer, calcium superphosphate (CSP). The percentage of available P, which consists of Truog P, was 91.6% in CSP, while it ranged from 6.5% to 20.8% in FGpig, depending on the lot. Komatsuna and wheat were fertilized with FGpig or CSP at the same rate of total P and with urea and potassium sulfate and grown in a glasshouse. In two times repeated experiments, the dry weight of the komatsuna shoot in FGpig was greater by 413% and 2140% in FGpig than in control (no P fertilizer). The dry weight of wheat shoot was also greater by 96.6% and 87.8% in FGpig than in control. In addition, the dry weights of komatsuna and wheat shoot in FGpig were comparable and slightly lower (from 80% to 120% and 70% to 80%, respectively) to those in CSP (100%). These results suggested that FGpig had a P fertilizer effect in spite of the low available P content. Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that the P accumulation by komatsuna shoot was significantly higher in FGpig than in CSP, while P accumulation by wheat was significantly lower in FGpig than in CSP. When foamed glass without P enrichment (FG) was used as a soil amendment with CSP, P accumulation in the komatsuna shoot was significantly greater in CSP+FG by 20.2% than in CSP. These results suggest that FGpig is a promising material for recycling P in pig slurry. FG without P enrichment and with a high amount of available Si might have a potential to increase P accumulation.

AB  - Simple Summary beta-lactams and quinolones are major groups of antibiotics that are commonly used for the treatment of severe infection both in animals and humans. Little is known about their resistance mechanisms in animals. Our results revealed high resistance rates against both groups in Gram-negative bacteria recovered from small ruminants suffering from respiratory disease. Phenotypically, 9.2% of the isolates were multidrug-resistant, and 11.8% and 6.6% of the isolates were positive for AmpC and ESBL production, respectively. Genetic characterization identified different beta-lactamase-encoding genes such as bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(CTX-M) which are responsible for beta-lactam resistance. Furthermore, the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrS, was identified to be associated with quinolone resistance. Our results regenerate interest in the wise use of antimicrobials in animal fields as well as to apply a One Health approach to prevent and/or mitigate their dissemination to the human environment. During the last decade's increase of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animals, animal-human transmission has become a major threat. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the genetic basis of AMR in Gram-negative bacteria recovered from sheep and goats with respiratory disease. Nasal and ocular swabs were collected from 69 diseased animals, and 76 Gram-negative bacterial isolates were identified from 59 animals. All isolates were checked phenotypically for resistance and genotypically for different resistance mechanisms, including beta-lactam, quinolone, and aminoglycoside resistance. Our results demonstrated that 9.2% (95% CI 4.5-17.8%) of the isolates were multidrug-resistant, with high resistance rates to beta-lactams and quinolones, and 11.8% (95% CI 6.4-21%) and 6.6% (95% CI 2.8-14.5%) of the isolates were phenotypically positive for AmpC and ESBL, respectively. Genotypically, bla(TEM) was the most identified beta-lactamase encoding gene in 29% (95% CI 20-40%) of the isolates, followed by bla(SHV) (14.5%, 95% CI 8.3-24.1%) and bla(CTX-M) (4%, 95% CI 1.4-11%). Furthermore, 7.9% (95% CI 3.7-16.2%) of the isolates harbored plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene qnrS. Our study revealed for the first time to our knowledge high beta-lactam and quinolone resistance associated with the bacteria recovered from sheep and one goat with respiratory disease. Furthermore, different antimicrobial resistant determinants were identified for the first time from animals in Africa, such as bla(LEN-13/55), bla(TEM-176) and bla(TEM-198/214). This study highlights the potential role of sheep and goats in disseminating AMR determinants and/or resistant bacteria to humans. The study regenerates interest for the development of a One Health approach to combat this formidable problem.

AB  - Speciation is a process whereby the evolution of reproductive barriers leads to isolated species. Although many studies have addressed large-effect genetic footprints in the advanced stages of speciation, the genetics of reproductive isolation in nascent stage of speciation remains unclear. Here, we show that pig domestication offers an interesting model for studying the early stages of speciation in great details. Pig breeds have not evolved the large X-effect of hybrid incompatibility commonly observed between "good species." Instead, deleterious epistatic interactions among multiple autosomal loci are common. These weak Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities confer partial hybrid inviability with sex biases in crosses between European and East Asian domestic pigs. The genomic incompatibility is enriched in pathways for angiogenesis, androgen receptor signaling and immunity, with an observation of many highly differentiated cis-regulatory variants. Our study suggests that partial hybrid inviability caused by pervasive but weak interactions among autosomal loci may be a hallmark of nascent speciation in mammals.

AB  - Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) has gained significant attention for its exceptional processing properties and biodegradability. However, PBAT displays low biodegradability in natural environment. Many studies found degradable microorganisms in wastewater sludge, soil, compost, etc., but most are harmful to humans. This work aimed to explore the potential degradation of PBAT by probiotics. We screened 47 kinds of safety microbes for PBAT degradation, five probiotics showed positive degradation effects on PBAT. Among these, Lactobacillus paracasei T1-9 exhibited superior ability to degrade PBAT, achieving the highest percentage of weight loss at 1.77 +/- 0.08 %, along with highly efficient growth in liquid culture. The biodegradability of PBAT was evaluated by using a multifaceted approach encompassing techniques including SEM, FTIR, XPS, and LC-MS. To improve the degradation efficiency, various factors (pH, the addition of gelatin and carbon source) were investigated. The additional gelatin improved the degradation of PBAT at a 3.43 +/- 0.1 % weight loss. As the carbon source in medium, 1, 4-butanediol contributed the highest biodegradation effect compared to the other two monomers of PBAT. Interestingly, the supernatants of T1-9 incubated with PBAT displayed the highest lipase activity with 3.99 +/- 0.03 U/mL. In conclusion, the probiotic T1-9 processed excellent capabilities in degrading PBAT, with the primary enzyme hypothesized to belong to the lipase group.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are one of the environment-friendly organisms that enhance plant performance. AMF affect the herbivorous insect community by indirectly modifying host plant nutrient uptake, growth, and defense, also known as priming. In the current study, under greenhouse conditions, the effects of inoculating tomato seedlings with four species of AMF, i.e., Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizophagus intraradices, Rhizophagus irregularis, and Glomus iranicus, were studied in relation to tomato plant growth parameters, plant defense enzymes, and total phenol content, and additionally, the life table of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) feeding on these plants was determined. The results demonstrated that the growth parameters of tomato plants, including plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, root volume, leaf surface area, weight of the root, and aerial organs (containing the leaves and stem), were greater and larger in the AMF-inoculated plants compared to the non-inoculated plants. Furthermore, there were higher defense enzyme activities, including peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase and polyphenol oxidase, and also higher total phenol contents in the AMF-inoculated plants. The whitefly life table characteristics were decreased in the group feeding on the AMF-inoculated plants. All together, the AMF colonization made the tomato plants more resistant against B. tabaci by improving plant growth and increasing defense enzymes. The degree of priming observed here suggests the potential of AMF to have expansive applications, including their implementation in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Organic amendments exert important effects on the migration and transformation of cadmium in soils. However, the adsorption capacities of different types of organic amendment and the stability of the adsorbed cadmium, especially during the decomposition process, are poorly understand. Here, using adsorption kinetics, isotherm analysis and functional group analysis methods we aim to investigate the adsorption behavior of cadmium on fresh and aged (six-month-old) commercial organic fertilizers produced from sheep manure, chicken manure and tobacco waste compost. Results showed chemical adsorption was the predominant cadmium adsorption process on the organic fertilizers, especially ion-exchanged Cd (59.7% to 78.0%) and hydrogen-bonded Cd (16.5% to 37.9%). The maximum cadmium adsorption capacity occurred on the tobacco waste compost (44.7 mg g(-1)) due to the high pH and surface organic functional groups, with values of 36.6 and 18.5 mg g(-1), respectively, on the sheep and chicken manures. Similarly, increased contents of organic functional groups resulted in a higher adsorption cadmium capacity on the aged compost (50.3 mg g(-1)) than on the fresh tobacco compost (44.7 mg g(-1)), indicating that the decomposition process increased the cadmium adsorption capacity of the compost within six months. Our results suggest that aging of tobacco compost could improve its capacity for the adsorption of cadmium. Thus, application of organic fertilizer derived from tobacco waste compost would be feasible as a stable technique for the remediation of cadmium contaminated soil due to its high and persistent cadmium adsorption capacity.

AB  - Understanding the dispersal ability of insects is critical for conservation efforts, as well as for preventing economic and health risks, such as the spread of bluetongue disease or African swine fever (ASF). However, knowledge of the dispersal ability of a wide range of insect species is limited. One highly unpredictable resource in space and time is carcasses, which provide an ephemeral habitat for the necrophilous insect community. In 2021 and 2022, we marked more than 5000 specimens of the carrion beetle Necrodes littoralis (L. 1758, Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Silphinae) and released them within a forested landscape with experimentally placed cadavers to test two hypotheses. Our first question was how far N. littoralis could disperse; we hypothesised that the beetles are highly mobile and disperse over more than 3 km, which is the distance currently used for buffer strips around wild boar carcasses infected by ASF. Our second question was if wind affected the colonisation of cadavers by N. littoralis. As beetles locate carrion using olfactory cues, we hypothesised that the probability of cadaver colonisation by insects increases when positioned up-wind. Based on recapture rates of 4%-7% per year, we estimated a mean distance between release and carrion of 6 km using a dispersal kernel. Some individuals were recaptured at distances exceeding 30 km. The probability of colonising an experimental cadaver increased when the resource was placed up-wind, but colonisation probability did not increase consistently over both years with the body mass of the carcasses. Our findings support previous work suggesting high dispersal ability of the carrion beetle N. littoralis, as an adaption to colonising highly ephemeral necromass resources. From a conservation perspective, these results suggest that there are limited dispersal barriers for carrion insects within a management region. From the perspective of disease control, however, these results also indicate that buffer strips of 3 km, as used in ASF mitigation, may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of pathogens by insects.

AB  - The boundary between the two regional Middle Miocene stages (the Badenian and Sarmatian) of the Central Paratethys is associated with the largest faunal turnover event in the Paratethys realm. A recent study performed in the northern Polish Carpathian Foredeep revealed that the Badenian/Sarmatian boundary is coeval with a major change in benthic and planktonic foraminiferal assemblages that occurs a few metres below the beginning of the Anomalinoides dividens Interval Zone in our section. The lowermost Sarmatian biozone is the Elphidium angulatum Partial Range Zone, and its lower boundary corresponds to the disappearance of almost all Badenian foraminiferal species. Detailed analysis of a fully cored borehole in southern Poland using micropalaeontological tools (foraminifera and palynology) and a range of (inorganic and organic) geochemical methods indicated that during the late Badenian and almost the entire profile of Anomalinoides dividens Zone, oxic or suboxic sedimentary conditions prevailed. In the Elphidium angulatum Zone and the lowest part of the subsequent Anomalinoides dividens Zone, suboxic and anoxic conditions dominated the sea bottom. This research indicated that the sudden disappearance of marine Badenian species in the Polish Carpathian Foredeep was caused by a rapid change in basin chemistry although not necessarily it implies open marine conditions changing to brackish water environments.

AB  - The present article deals with recording ethnomedicinal plants used by the people living in and around Dhaka city and also focuses on the plant species used during the pandemic to get relief from COVID-19. The information was gathered using open-ended and semi-structured questionnaires from 348 informants belonging to different classes of life. The survey has resulted in the recording of a total of 160 medicinal plant species belonging to 62 families and used for 157 ailments through 250 different formularies. Azadirachta indica A. Juss. was the most cited species in the study area. The highest factor informant consensus (FIC) was found in the Cuts and Wounds category, and Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. is the most cited species for this category. Acmella calva (DC.) R.K. Jansen was the culturally bound species attaining 100% Fidelity Level (FL) value. Among the ethnomedicinal plants, 40 species were found in the survey that were used by people to get relief from COVID-19. This interesting ethnomedicinal use is a new record for these 40 species. Most notable species are Ocimum tenuiflorum L., Justicia adhatoda L., Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, Citrus aurantifolia (Christm. & Panzer) Swingle, Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & L.M. Perry, Mentha arvensis L., Zingiber officinale Rosc., Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, and Nigella sativa L. Since ancient times, these species have been very popular and used to treat several ailments. The use of these species during the pandemic is a new hope for COVID-19 management. But this is a preliminary report. Further long-term study is needed to confirm the claim of these plants' use against COVID-19. Due to excessive use during COVID-19, these species have been scarce in the habitats in and around Dhaka city. Conservation measures should be applied to save these species from extinction.

AB  - This study introduced a carbon footprint (CF) method based on a life cycle assessment to analyze greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions derived from pig production system in China by using national statistical data during 2000-2016. Results showed that the CF of pig production in China was showing a reduction trend. Specifically, the average CFs of unit mass alive pig in the backyard, specialized, medium scale and large-scale farms in China were 1.78 kg CO2-eq/kg, 1.55 kg CO2-eq/kg, 1.65 kg CO2-eq/kg and 1.65 kg CO2-eq/kg, respectively, during 2000-2016. Therein, the feedstuffs production and manure management are the main GHG sources in pig production system in China. The total GHG emissions of the Chinese pig system were slightly decreasing from 128.37 million tons (Mt) CO2-eq in 2000 to 127.08 Mt CO2-eq in 2016, while the pig production quantity was increased by 35.12% during the study period. It implied that the pig production system in China had developed toward a positive effect on GHG emissions reduction in recent years. Moreover, this study also estimates the possible quantity of GHG emissions of Chinese pig sector in 2030 through scenario analysis. The simulated results were ranging from 18.48 to 176.42 Mt CO2-eq/yr, reflecting that the Chinese pig sector still had considerable mitigation potential for GHG emissions. The shift towards intensive pig production, improved feed crop cultivation and manure management systems would be the key points to reduce the GHG emissions of pig production system. This study would contribute to the development of the pig production system in China with a cleaner production approach. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Symbiotic marine invertebrates can be small, hidden or difficult to find, hampering the understanding of their distribution and ecological roles. Haplosyllis anthogorgicola is a polychaete inhabiting the gorgonian Anthogorgia bocki, where it lives in high densities within the host's coenenchyme and occupies burrows formed by host tissue near coral polyps. This study provides the first records of H. anthogorgicola since its description in 1956, from colonies of Anthogorgiidae in southern Japan. We observed that host gorgonians were also inhabited by the pygmy seahorse Hippocampus bargibanti, a popular species to observe and photograph among SCUBA divers. Therefore, we examined photographic records of H. bargibanti available on the citizen science website iNaturalist and screened for structures associated with infestation by H. anthogorgicola to gather information on this elusive species. Our analyses confirmed that this polychaete and/or similar species are widespread in the central Indo-Pacific region. In addition, we observed some polychaete behaviours, raising questions about the nature of the relationships between H. anthogorgicola, its gorgonian hosts and the pygmy seahorse. Our study demonstrates that citizen science can contribute to our knowledge not only on the distribution and behaviour of well known and charismatic species but also inadvertently on overlooked and neglected taxa.

AB  - Diatoms are key primary producers across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. They are responsible for photosynthesis and secondary production that, in part, support complex food webs. Diatoms can produce phytochemicals that have transtrophic ecological effects which increase their competitive fitness. Polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) are one class of diatom-derived phytochemicals that are known to have allelopathic and anti-herbivory properties. The anti-herbivory capability of PUAs results from their negative effect on grazer fecundity. Since their discovery, research has focused on their production by pelagic marine diatoms, and their effects on copepod egg production, hatching success, and juvenile survival and development. Few investigations have explored PUA production by the prolific suite of benthic marine diatoms, despite their importance to coastal trophic systems. In this study, we tested eight species of benthic diatoms for the production of the bioactive PUAs 2,4-heptadienal, 2,4-octadienal, and 2,4-decadienal. Benthic diatom species were isolated from the Salish Sea, an inland sea within the North Pacific ecosystem. All species were found to be producers of at least two PUAs in detectable concentrations, with five species producing all three PUAs in quantifiable concentrations. Our results indicate that production of PUAs from Salish Sea benthic diatoms may be widespread, and thus these compounds may contribute to benthic coastal food web dynamics through heretofore unrecognized pathways. Future studies should expand the geographic scope of investigations into benthic diatom PUA production and explore the effects of benthic diatoms on benthic consumer fecundity.

AB  - Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), miR-23a, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), autophagy and apoptosis play crucial roles in follicular development. However, their role in yak granulosa cells (GCs) remains unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect of miR23a, ASK1, FSH, and LH on apoptosis, autophagy, and the release and reception of some steroid hormones in these cells. Our results showed that miR-23a overexpression significantly increased the abundance of Beclin1, the LC3II/I ratio, and the number of Ad-mRFP-GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosomes, and decreased p62 abundance. Additionally, Bax abundance and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxynucleotide triphosphate nick end labeling-positive cells were reduced, while Bcl2 expression was increased. Overexpression of miR-23a also significantly increased the abundance of estradiol receptor alpha (ER-alpha) and beta (ER-beta) and the concentrations of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) in yak GCs. Here, treating yak GCs with miR-23a decreased ASK1 expression, which regulates ASK1/JNK-mediated apoptosis, autophagy, E2 and P4 levels, and ER-alpha/beta abundance. In contrast, treatment of yak GCs with FSH (10 mu g/mL) and LH (100 mu g/mL) increased miR-23a abundance, regulating the subsequent effect on ASK1/JNK-mediated apoptosis, autophagy, ER-alpha/beta abundance, and E2 and P4 concentrations. In conclusion, miR-23a enhances autophagy in yak GCs, attenuates apoptosis, and increases ER-alpha/beta abundance and E2 and P4 concentrations by downregulating ASK1. Additionally, FSH and LH can regulate these effects of miR-23a by altering its expression. These results provide important insights that can inform the development of strategies to reduce abnormal follicular atresia and improve the reproductive rate of yaks.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate if early administration of progesterone immediately after ovulation affects corpus luteum lifespan in llamas. Female llamas (n = 16) were induced to ovulate by Buserelin injection in the presence of an ovulatory follicle (Day 0). On Day 2, ovulation was confirmed and animals were randomly divided into two groups: treated animals (n = 8) received an intravaginal device containing 0.3 g of progesterone from Day 2 to Day 6 post-induction of ovulation and control group (n = 8) received a device with 0 g of progesterone. Blood samples were collected daily to determine plasma progesterone concentration and trans-rectal ultrasonographies were performed from Day 7 to Day 12 post-induction of ovulation. Mean maximum diameter of the corpus luteum was significantly lower and was reached before in the treated group than in the control group. The mean highest plasma progesterone concentration and the day that concentration was achieved were similar between groups. However, mean plasma progesterone concentration was significantly higher in the treated group than in the control group on Days 3 and 4 and lower on Days 8 and 9 post-induction of ovulation. The day that plasma progesterone concentration returns to 1 ng/ml differed between groups, occurring earlier in the treated group. In conclusion, the early increase of plasma progesterone concen-tration during the luteal phase, promoted the premature activation of the luteolytic process affecting corpus luteum function in llamas as it was previously reported in other species.

AB  - Hormones are known to be involved in life-history trade-offs as systemic signals that establish functional links among traits and regulate key behavioural and physiological transitions between states in organisms. Although major functions of many steroid hormones such as testosterone are conserved among vertebrates, circulating concentrations vary widely both within and across species, and the degree to which observed hormone concentrations mediate life-history responses to environmental variation is less understood. In this study, we investigated how faecal testosterone metabolite (FTM) concentrations varied with extrinsic and intrinsic factors. To do so, we took advantage of a 6-year period of longitudinal sampling of FTM, indicators of stress and oxidative status in a semi-captive population of Asian elephants (n = 3163 samples from 173 individuals) in Myanmar. We determined how the variation in FTM is associated with age, sex, origin (captive-born or wild-caught), seasonality of the environment, individual stress level [measured by faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L)] and oxidative status (reactive oxygen metabolite concentrations and superoxide dismutase activity). We reported that FTM increased with age from juvenile to adulthood for both sexes, with higher FTM concentrations in males than females. Moreover, elephants showed significantly higher FTM concentrations during the hot season and monsoon than in the cold season. However, for the physiological indicators, we found contrasting results. While FTM concentrations were strongly positively correlated with FGM concentrations, FTM concentrations were not related to H/L ratios. Finally, we found no relationship between FTM and the oxidative status of individuals. Our study provides new insights on the factors associated with variation in testosterone concentrations-a key hormone for reproduction and fitness of individuals-in Asian elephants living in their natural environment, which has relevance for effective conservation measures of this endangered species.

AB  - Interactions between plants and natural enemies of insect herbivores influence plant productivity and survival by reducing herbivory. Plants attract natural enemies via herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), but how water availability (WA) influences HIPV-mediated defences is unclear. We use tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, tomato fruitworm, Helicoverpa zea and two natural enemies, the parasitoid wasp, Microplitis croceipes and the predator spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris, to investigate the effect of WA on HIPV emission dynamics and associated plant defence. We show that low WA initially increases total HIPV emission by tomato on the first day of herbivore exposure and, in contrast, reduces HIPV emission on the second day. Low WA enhances HIPVs that are mostly found in tomato trichomes. Notably, some volatiles inhibited by low WA are known attractants of natural enemies. Evidence from Y-tube and in-cage behavioural assays indicates that changes in HIPV emissions by low WA compromise the ability of tomato plants to attract natural enemies. Synthesis. Based on our results, we propose a hypothesis where plants respond to low WA by enhancing repellent HIPV emissions and reducing the emission of HIPVs that attract natural enemies, which disrupts natural enemy-mediated plant indirect defences, but enhances plant direct defence against herbivores.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to heat can lead to environment-induced heat stress (EIHS), which may jeopardize human health, but the extent to which EIHS affects cardiac architecture and myocardial cell health are unknown. We hypothesized EIHS would alter cardiac structure and cause cellular dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, 3-mo old female pigs were exposed to thermoneutral (TN; 20.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C; n = 8) or EIHS (37.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C; n = 8) conditions for 24 h, hearts were removed and dimensions measured, and portions of the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) were collected. Environment-induced heat stress increased rectal temperature 1.3 degrees C (P < 0.01), skin temperature 11 degrees C (P < 0.01) and respiratory rate 72 breaths per minute (P < 0.01). Heart weight and length (apex to base) were decreased by 7.6% (P = 0.04) and 8.5% (P = 0.01), respectively, by EIHS, but heart width was similar between groups. Left ventricle wall thickness was increased (22%; P = 0.02) and water content was decreased (8.6%; P < 0.01) whereas in RV, wall thickness was decreased (26%; P = 0.04) and water content was similar in EIHS compared to TN. We also discovered ventricle-specific biochemical changes such that in RV EIHS increased heat shock proteins, decreased AMPK and AKT signaling, decreased activation of mTOR (35%; P < 0.05), and increased expression of proteins that participate in autophagy. In LV, heat shock proteins, AMPK and AKT signaling, activation of mTOR, and autophagy-related proteins were largely similar between groups. Bio-markers suggest EIHS-mediated reductions in kidney function. These data demonstrate EIHS causes ventricular -dependent changes and may undermine cardiac health, energy homeostasis, and function.

AB  - Follistatin (FST), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, has been identified as an inhibitor of follicle-stimulating hormone. Previous studies showed that it plays an important role in animal reproduction. Therefore, this study aims to investigate its effect on the maturation of buffalo oocytes in vitro, and the underlying mechanism of FST affecting oocyte maturation was also explored in buffalo cumulus cells. Results showed that FST was enriched in the ovary and expressed at different stages of buffalo ovarian follicles as well as during oocyte maturation and early embryo development. The FST expression level was up-regulated in MII buffalo oocytes compared with the GV stage (p < .05). To study the effects of FST on buffalo oocytes' maturation and early embryonic development, we added the pcD3.1 skeleton vector and PCD3.1-EGFP-FST vector into the maturation fluid of buffalo oocytes, respectively. It was demonstrated that FST promoted the in vitro maturation rate of buffalo oocytes and the blastocyst rate of embryos cultured in vitro (p < .05). By interfering with FST expression, we discovered that FST in cumulus cells plays a crucial role in oocyte maturation. Interference with the FST expression during the buffalo oocyte maturation did not affect the first polar body rate of buffalo oocyte (p > .05). In contrast, the location of mitochondria in oocytes was abnormal, and the cumulus expansion area was reduced (p < .05). After parthenogenetic activation, the cleavage and blastocyst rates of the FST-interfered group were reduced (p < .05). Furthermore, RT-qPCR was performed to investigate further the underlying mechanism by which FST enhances oocyte maturation. We found that overexpression of FST could up-regulate the expression level of apoptosis suppressor gene Bcl-2 and TGF-beta/SMAD pathway-related genes TGF-beta, SMAD2, and SMAD3 (p < .05). In contrast, the expression levels of SMAD4 and pro-apoptotic gene BAX were significantly decreased (p < .05). The FST gene could affect buffalo oocyte maturation by regulating the oocyte mitochondria integrity, the cumulus expansion, cumulus cell apoptosis, and the expression levels of TGF-beta/SMAD pathway-related genes.

AB  - The six species of mountain frogs (Philoria: Limnodynastidae: Anura) are endemic to south-eastern Australia. Five species occur in headwater systems in mountainous north-eastern New South Wales (NSW) and south-eastern Queensland (Qld), centred on the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area. A previous molecular genetic analysis identified divergent genetic lineages in the central and western McPherson Ranges region of Qld and NSW, but sampling was inadequate to test the species status of these lineages. With more comprehensive geographic sampling and examination of the nuclear genome using SNP analysis, we show that an undescribed species, P. knowlesi sp. nov., occurs in the central and western McPherson Ranges (Levers Plateau and Mount Barney complex). The new species is not phylogenetically closely related to P. loveridgei in the nuclear data but is related to one of two divergent lineages within P. loveridgei in the mtDNA data. We postulate that the discordance between the nuclear and mtDNA outcomes is due to ancient introgression of the mtDNA genome from P. loveridgei into the new species. Male advertisement calls and multivariate morphological analyses do not reliably distinguish P. knowlesi sp. nov. from any of the Philoria species in northeast NSW and southeast Qld. The genetic comparisons also enable us to define further the distributions of P. loveridgei and P. kundagungan. Samples from the Lamington Plateau, Springbrook Plateau, Wollumbin (Mt Warning National Park), and the Nightcap Range, are all P. loveridgei, and its distribution is now defined as the eastern McPherson Ranges and Tweed caldera. Philoria kundagungan is distributed from the Mistake Mountains in south-eastern Qld to the Tooloom Scrub on the Koreelah Range, southwest of Woodenbong, in NSW, with two subpopulations identified by SNP analysis. We therefore assessed the IUCN threat category of P. loveridgei and P. kundagungan and undertook new assessments for each of its two subpopulations and for the new taxon P. knowlesi sp. nov., using IUCN Red List criteria. Philoria loveridgei, P. kundagungan (entire range and northern subpopulation separately) and P. knowlesi sp. nov. each meet criteria for "Endangered" (EN B2(a)(b)[i, iii]). The southern subpopulation of P. kundagungan, in the Koreelah Range, meets criteria for "Critically Endangered" (CE B2(a)(b)[i, iii]). These taxa are all highly threatened due to the small number of known locations, the restricted nature of their breeding habitat, and direct and indirect threats from climate change, and the potential impact of the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis. Feral pigs are an emerging threat, with significant impacts now observed in Philoria breeding habitat in the Mistake Mountains.

AB  - Open manure storage contributes to the release of ammonia (NH3) into the atmosphere. Tank floating covers represent an effective technique to reduce NH3 emissions and biochar has been gain attention as a floating cover and as manure additive. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in the process still need to be elucidated since they are influenced by the biochar specific properties, application methods and dose. This work aims to study: (i) the biochar adsorption performances in an NH3 aqueous solution under conditions relevant to manure storage and (ii) the effect of different biochar application methods and dosage on NH3 emissions from buffalo digestate storage. The results show that a 43% reduction in NH3 emissions can be achieved by using biochar as a floating cover of 2 cm rather than as an additive. Moreover, the results show that the biochar produced at 550 degrees C acts as an adsorbent material for both NH4+ and NH3, by being adsorbed on the biochar surface in the form of NH4+ after H+ abstraction from the acid groups. A minimum cover height of 2 cm is required to give compactness and provide an additional resistance to the gas transfer, which is even more relevant than the adsorption in reducing NH3 emissions.

AB  - West coast steenbras Lithognathus aureti is an overexploited coastal Sparid in the northern Benguela ecosystem, Namibia. They are believed to consist of two genetically distinct highly resident stocks, one in northern Namibia (17-24 degrees S) and one in southern Namibia (24-26 degrees S). Here, Von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) parameters were obtained and compared using bootstrapped length-frequency-analysis, LFA (ELEFAN_GA_boot, n = 29 monthly length-frequency-distributions of 20,090 individuals), tag-and-recapture (grotag_boot, n = 80 growth increments) and length-at-age, LAA (grolenage_boot, based on n = 104 otoliths northern stock and n = 155 southern stock) methods in the "fishboot" R package. For the first time, these three methods were combined and compared within a standardized, robust bootstrap framework. The results indicated an extremely slow body growth, with similar median "optimum" results for K and Lao , but smaller median Phi ' for LAA (otolith readings) than from other methods. LAA was the most precise method, especially when large-sized individuals were captured (northern stock). No differences in growth between stocks or sexes (males, females, hermaphrodites) were detected. The bootstrapped VBGF model that best explained the data, combining results from different methods (southern stock), had extremely slow growth with intermittent recruitment occurring every 4 years (in 2000, 2004, and 2008), with the following median values: K = 0.066 y(-1) (from otoliths, 95 % CI: 0.0067-0.12 y(-1)), Lao = 77.29 cm (from otoliths, 95 % CI: 55.48-400.26 cm), Phi ' = 2.62 (95 % CI: 2.52 -2.74), t(anchor)= 0.50 (95 % CI: 0.18-0.87), C = 0.53 (95 %CI: 0.19-0.87), and ts = 0.47 (95 %CI: 0.14-0.88) from LFA. This makes L. aureti even more vulnerable to overfishing as well as climate change. There is an urgent need for the development and application of new management strategies for this endangered, longevous species (maximum age from otolith readings: 38 years), considering its irregular reproduction, recruitment, and extremely slow growth. Also, our study evidences the need to develop new software tools for LFA, that should be able to explicitly consider intermittent recruitment.

AB  - Simple Summary Copper sulfate and copper glycinate have been used as additives for copper supplementation and growth promotion in the swine feed industry. However, their effects on the gut microenvironment, especially for the fecal microbiota and metabolites, still remain unclear, which are the important indicators of gut health. As well as the nutrient digestibility and physiological and biochemical indices of pigs, the effects of copper sulfate and copper glycinate on fecal microbial communities and metabolic profiles were investigated to understand it better in the present study. Our results suggested that copper sulfate and copper glycinate could differentially affect fecal microbiota and metabolites, by which dietary copper glycinate exerted more beneficial effects on the gut health of pigs. This study aims to compare the fecal microbiome-metabolome response to copper sulfate (CuSO4) and copper glycinate (Cu-Gly) in pigs. Twelve Meishan gilts were allocated into the CuSO4 group and the Cu-Gly group (fed on a basal diet supplemented with 60 mg/kg copper from CuSO4 or Cu-Gly) paired in litter and body weight. After a two-week feeding trial, the Cu-Gly group had a higher copper digestibility, blood hemoglobin, and platelet volume and higher levels of plasma iron and insulin-like growth factor-1 than the CuSO4 group. The Cu-Gly treatment increased the abundance of the Lachnospiraceae family and the genera Lachnospiraceae XPB1014, Corprococcus_3, Anaerorhabdus_furcosa_group, Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4B4_group and decreased the abundance of the Synergistetes phylum and Peptostreptococcaceae family compared to the CuSO4 treatment. Moreover, the Cu-Gly group had a lower concentration of 20-Oxo-leukotriene E4 and higher concentrations of butyric acid, pentanoic acid, isopentanoic acid, coumarin, and Nb-p-Coumaroyl-tryptamine than the CuSO4 group. The abundance of Synergistetes was positively correlated with the fecal copper content and negatively correlated with the fecal butyric acid content. The abundance of the Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group genus was positively correlated with the plasma iron level and fecal contents of coumarin and butyric acid. In conclusion, Cu-Gly and CuSO4 could differentially affect fecal microbiota and metabolites, which partially contributes to the intestinal health of pigs in different manners.

AB  - This review addresses advances, directions and opportunities for research on sheep reproduction in the context of the global challenges of food security and climate change, and demand for 'clean, green and ethical' (CGE) animal management. The foundation of CGE management is an understanding of the physiological processes through which the reproductive system responds to changes in the animal's environment. These days, to the main environmental factors (photoperiod, nutrition, pheromones), we need to add stress from extreme weather events. With respect to nutrition in rams, we now have a deeper understanding of the responses of the brain centres that control gonadotrophin secretion (the kisspeptin system). At testis level, we have found that nutrition affects non-coding RNAs in Sertoli cells and germ cells, thus affecting the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. This proliferation-apoptosis balance is also affected during prenatal development, when undernutrition or stress in pregnant ewes seems to elicit epigenetic changes in developing gonads that could affect offspring fertility in adult life. With respect to nutrition in ewes, metabolic signals act directly on ovarian follicles, and thus change ovulation rate, but the variety of signals now includes the adipokines. An early concern was that nutritional supplements that increase ovulation rate would also increase embryo mortality but we now know that embryo survival is improved under field conditions. Finally, we had always thought that the efficiency gains from early puberty in lambs could only be achieved by accelerating fat accumulation, but we now know that faster muscle growth will achieve the same goal, offering two advantages in meat production systems. With respect to pheromones ('ram effect'), we have a deeper understanding of the brain responses (kisspeptin system) but, most importantly, a realization that the response of ewes to the ram signal involves cell division in memory centres. Many opportunities remain.

AB  - Bailong Cave (Bailongdong), dating back to the Middle Pleistocene, is a very important Palaeolithic site in southern China with some hominin remains and substantial mammalian fossils unearthed. Cervid fossils are one of the most common elements in this site, and antler fossils from Bailong Cave were preserved in a better condition than any other Pleistocene site in southern China. Here, we describe the materials of Elaphodus cephalophus, Muntiacus reevesi, Muntiacus muntjak, Cervavitus ultimus and Cervus grayi, while the remains of Rusa unicolor have been described separately in previous paper. The antler fossil of E. cephalophus represents the earliest and undisputed record of this species known currently. The fossils of C. ultimus represent the latest occurrence of this species according to the current knowledge. Overviewing the geological distribution of Quaternary cervids based on 19 sites in southern China, we can find that there was a significant turnover on deer fauna around Mid-Pleistocene Transition in southern China.

AB  - Colletotrichum spp. are well-known and highly significant plant pathogenic fungi worldwide. It is widely distributed across tropical, subtropical and temperate regions, where it causes the anthracnose disease in various forest plants. This devastating fungal infection results in detrimental consequences such as defoliation, fruit drop, branch dieback and in severe cases, even plant mortality. In this study, morphological characteristics combined with multi-gene phylogenetic (ITS, act, , gapdh, , chs-1, , his3, , tub2, , sod2, , cal, , apmat, , and gs ) analyses were used to study 169 Colletotrichum strains isolated from 972 forest plants specimens collected in 12 provinces of China. The results revealed the presence of 23 distinct species, which include eight new species, i.e. C. cunninghamiae, , C. guiyangense, , C. hubeiense, , C. jixiense, , C. lunanense, , C. parthenocissigenum, , C. subplurivorum, , and C. wenzhouense, , one new record from China, and 14 known species, among them, 11 host species were reported for the first time. Furthermore, there are seven species reduced to synomymies in this study, i.e C. spicati and C. celtidis are reduced to synomymies under C. karsti, , C. citrulli is reduced under C. gloeosporioides, , C. analogum under C. camelliae, , C. mengyinense under C. fructicola, , C. yulongense under C. henanense, , and C. simulanticitri under C. nymphaeae. . Pathogenicity tests were conducted, revealing that the newly discovered species C. luanense, , along with C. aenigma, , C. gloeosporioides, , and C. siamense, , there are recorded on the new host plants, exhibited high rates of infestation and infectivity across various hosts. Contrarily, C. pseudomajus was exclusively isolated from branches of Camellia sinensis, , demonstrating a remarkable host-specificity. The comparative genomics analysis revealed that C. pseudomajus possesses two specific carbohydrases, GT61 and AA14, which may explain its organ-specificity towards Camellia sinensis branches. This study provides valuable insights into the diversity of Colletotrichum species affecting forest plants, laying the foundation for effective control strategies against forest anthracnose.

AB  - Simple Summary How ovarian hormones affect goat lactation by regulating cell-cell junctions is still unclear. Through the in vivo and in vitro assays, we found that ovarian hormones could elevate cell-cell junction protein expression, which may affect the intercellular space and molecule transportation between the goat mammary epithelial cells. Our assessment suggests that ovarian hormones may affect goat milk production by regulating the cell-cell junction protein expression between mammary epithelial cells. The sex hormones of estrogen and progesterone (P-4) play a vital role in mammary gland development and milk lactation in ruminants. The tight junction (TJ) between adjacent secretory epithelial cells is instrumental in establishing the mammary blood-milk barrier. However, whether estrogen and P-4 exert their effect on mammary function via regulating TJ remain unclear. Here, to clarify the role of 17-beta estradiol (E-2) and P-4 in the regulation of TJ in goat mammary gland, we first explored the relationships between the concentrations of E-2, P-4, and the protein expression of claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin, and ZO-1 during the mammary gland development in goat. Then, we further explored the mRNA and protein expression of claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin, and ZO-1 in the goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) in vitro under different concentrations of E-2 and P-4. The results demonstrated that the protein expression of claudin-1 decreased, but occludin and ZO-1 increased with the decline in E-2 and P-4 during the transition from pregnancy to lactation. In the in vitro studies, E-2 exerted a positive effect on the mRNA expression of claudin-1, and accelerated the proteins' expression of claudin-1 and ZO-1 in GMECs; P-4 upregulated the mRNA expression of claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin, and ZO-1, and also improved the protein expression of claudin-1, claudin-3, and ZO-1 in the GMECs. The results demonstrated that E-2 and P-4 play an important role in regulating the expression of the mammary TJ components, which may ultimately affect the mammary gland development and milk lactation.

AB  - Over recent years, pyrolysis has grown into a mature technology with added value for producing soil improvers. Further innovations of this technology lie in developing tailor-made products from specific feedstocks (or mix-tures thereof) in combination with adjusted mixing ratio-temperature regimes. In this context, co-pyrolysis of pig manure (PM) and the invasive plant Japanese knotweed (JK) at different mixture ratios (w/w) of 3:1 (P3J1), 1:1 (P1J1), and 1:3 (P1J3) and varying temperatures (400-700 C-circle) was studied to address the low carbon properties and heavy metals (HMs) risks of manure-derive biochars and beneficially ameliorate the bio-invasion situation by creating value from the plant biomass. Co-pyrolysis of PM with JK increased by nearly 1.5 folds the fixed carbon contents in the combined feedstock biochars obtained at 600 C-circle compared with PM-derived biochar alone, and all combined feedstock biochars met the requirements for soil improvement and carbon sequestration. The total HMs in PM biochars were significantly reduced by adding JK. The combined feedstock biochar P1J1 generated at 600 C-circle was the most effective in transforming Cu and Zn into more stable forms, accordingly reducing the associated environmental risk of heavy metal leaching from the biochar. In addition, the accumulation of macronutrients can be an added benefit of the co-pyrolysis process, and P1J1-600 was also the biochar that retained the most nutrients (P, Ca, Mg, and K).

AB  - Rapid and interacting change poses an increasing threat to livelihoods and food production, and pastoralists in Nordland, northern Norway, are at a crossroads both economically and culturally. Some of these changes are localized and pertain to changing weather and grazing conditions caused by climate change and land fragmentation. Others, driven by national management policies and governance specifically related to predators, are poorly adjusted for the different and localized contexts. The pastoralists are inherently adaptive and have a long history of responding well to variable changing conditions. This is now changing with the continued increasing pressures from many directions. The central government systematically ignores pastoralists' traditional knowledge and enforces narrow sector policies to be implemented at regional and local levels. We address the effect of how institutional, physical, and societal constraints challenge pastoralists' prospects for sustainable adaptation. Our results show how pastoralists' livelihoods become compromised and potentially threatened because they are forced to respond in ways that they know are counterproductive in the long run. Adaptation outcomes are affected by different approaches and epistemologies that are situated across scale and context in terms of regional and national regulations versus local empirical reality among the pastoral communities. This study concludes that radical change is needed toward a more holistic governance in which multiple knowledge systems are integrated to ensure sustainable adaptation at all levels. This study is based on extensive and long-term fieldwork among reindeer herders and sheep farmers in Nordland, through a collaborative process of knowledge coproduction.

AB  - In an attempt to generate g.A746G substitution in the BMPR-IB gene, we unexpectedly obtained BMPR-IB homozygous knockout piglets (BMPR-IB-/-) and heterogeneous knockout piglets with one copy of the A746G mutation (BMPR-IB-/746G) via CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing revealed complex genomic rearrangements in the target region. All BMPR-IB-disrupted piglets showed an inability to stand and walk normally. Both BMPR-IB-/- and BMPR-IB-/746G piglets exhibited severe skeletal dysplasia characterized by distorted and truncated forearms (ulna, radius) and disordered carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones in the forelimbs. The piglets displayed more severe deformities in the hindlimbs by visual inspection, including fibular hemimelia, enlarged tarsal bone, and disordered toe joint bones. Limb deformities were more profound in BMPR-IB-/- piglets than in the BMPR-IB-/746G piglets. Proteomic analysis identified 139 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the hindlimb fibula of BMPR-IB-/746G piglets compared to the wild-type (WT) controls. Most DEPs are involved in skeletal or embryonic development and/or the TGF-beta pathway and tumor progression. Gene Ontology (GO) and protein domain enrichment analysis suggested alterations in these processes. Of the top 50 DEPs, a large proportion, e.g., C1QA, MYO1H, SRSF1, P3H1, GJA1, TCOF1, RBM10, SPP2, MMP13, and PHAX, were significantly associated with skeletal development. Our study provides novel findings on the role of BMPR-IB in mammalian limb development.

AB  - Damage to plant communities imposed by insect herbivores generally decreases from low to high latitudes. This decrease is routinely attributed to declines in herbivore abundance and/or diversity, whereas latitudinal changes in per capita food consumption remain virtually unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the lifetime food consumption by a herbivore individual decreases from low to high latitudes due to a temperature-driven decrease in metabolic expenses. From 2016 to 2019, we explored latitudinal changes in multiple characteristics of linear (gallery) mines made by larvae of the pygmy moth, Stigmella lapponica, in leaves of downy birch, Betula pubescens. The mined leaves were larger than intact leaves at the southern end of our latitudinal gradient (at 60 degrees N) but smaller than intact leaves at its northern end (at 69 degrees N), suggesting that female oviposition preference changes with latitude. No latitudinal changes were observed in larval size, mine length or area, and in per capita food consumption, but the larval feeding efficiency (quantified as the ratio between larval size and mine size) increased with latitude. Consequently, S. lapponica larvae consumed less foliar biomass at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes to reach the same size. Based on space-for-time substitution, we suggest that climate warming will increase metabolic expenses of insect herbivores with uncertain consequences for plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Biotic resistance from native consumers can reduce the abundance and impacts of introduced species. Previous studies documented the escape of the introduced alga Kappaphycus alvarezii from abandoned farms in Bocas del Toro, Panama. Both attached and unattached aggregations of this invasive alga accumulated on and smothered native corals and seagrasses. However, native urchins and parrotfish were also observed feeding on the alga in the field suggesting that native herbivores may act as agents of biotic resistance. In this study, we conducted an herbivore-exclusion experiment in the field to determine the effect of native herbivory on K. alvarezii and a laboratory experiment to measure the rate of herbivory on the introduced alga by two common native urchins (Lytechinus variegatus and Echinometra lucunter). Consistent with the biotic resistance hypothesis, native herbivores rapidly consumed algae in both field and lab studies. Loss of algal biomass was approximately nine times higher in herbivore-exposed treatments than in herbivore-exclusion treatments in the field. Lab experiments revealed L. variegatus ate 3.5 times more algae than E. lucunter. While K. alvarezii was abundant in surveys during 2014, we did not detect any remaining individuals in our field sites during a return visit one year later. Thus, both native urchins consume K. alvarezii and, along with other herbivores, are likely important agents of biotic resistance. However, longer-term studies are needed to test if native herbivores can control the introduced algae still escaping from active farms.

AB  - Aims Soil abiotic factors influence plant defensive traits by shaping the costs of defence production and these bottom-up effects on plants can in turn affect insect herbivory. However, few studies have disentangled direct and indirect effects of soil abiotic factors on plant defences and insect herbivory. Methods To address this gap, we tested the influence of soil abiotic factors on seed predation via changes in plant defences for sea fennel (Crithmum maritimum), a common coastal plant in southern Spain whose seeds are consumed by specialist caterpillars (Aethes species). To this end, we estimated seed predation on plants across several sea fennel populations, as well as measured different types of putative chemical seed defences (phenolics, terpenes) and soil abiotic factors (macro- and micro-elements, physicochemical variables). Results We found a positive association between seed chemical defences (terpenes such as alpha-thujene, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, beta-myrcene, alpha-terpinene, y-terpinene, and thymol methylether) and seed predation. In addition, a few macro- and micro-elements such as Ca, S and Sr negatively correlated with seed defences; other macro- and micro-elements or physicochemical variables had no detectable association with defences. Despite observed effects of soil abiotic factors on defences and of the latter on seed predation, there was no detectable indirect effect of soil abiotic factors on seed attack. Conclusions Our findings suggest that variation in a few key soil macro- and micro-elements in coastal environments can exert an important influence on seed chemical defences in sea fennel, with potential consequences for interactions between sea fennel and seed predators.

AB  - Phytosterols (PSs) are widely present in plants, particularly abundant in plant oils and seeds. PSs are reported to have various biological activities, such as lowering cholesterol, alongside antioxidant and antibacterial activities. This research examined the effects of PSs in finishing pigs, including growth performance, serum biochemistry, and fecal bacteria. Two treatment groups (each treatment group consisted of five biological replicates, and each replicate comprised five pigs housed communally) were randomly assigned to the fifty finishing pigs (equally divided by sex) of "Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire" three-way cross with 79.76 +/- 1.29 (kg) body weight. The control group (CON) was given basic food, while the experimental group was given basic food containing 300 mg PS/kg (PS). Dietary PS supplementation markedly raised the levels of average daily feed intake (ADFI) and apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), and gross energy (GE) in comparison to the CON (p < 0.05). Additionally, PSs also significantly boosted the concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total protein (TP), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), immunoglobulin G (IgG), motilin (MTL), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (p < 0.05), and lowered the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (p < 0.05). Both at the phyla and genus levels, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Streptococcus increased significantly, and the relative abundance of Acinetobacter decreased significantly when adding phytosterols (p < 0.05).

AB  - Climate-smart and sustainable crops are needed for the future. Engineering crops for tolerance of both abiotic and biotic stress is one approach. The accumulation of trehalose, controlled through trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) or OtsA and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) or OtsB genes in microbes, is known to provide protection for many microbial and fungal species against abiotic stress. The effect of trehalose accumulation in plant species is less understood. Here, we studied the heterologous expression of Escherichia coli OtsB in potato (Solanum tuberosum var. 'Desiree') with regards to stress tolerance. The performance of transgenic lines was assessed in both growth chambers and greenhouse mesocosms. Overexpressing potato OtsB lines significantly increased resilience to heat, photoperiod, herbivory, and competition when compared with wildtype plants. Most strikingly, when subjected to high temperatures, transgenic lines exhibited a significantly lower reduction in tuber yield ranging from 40% to 77%, while wildtype plants experienced a 95% decrease in tuber yield. When exposed to competitors in a selected StSP3D::OtsB line, tuber yield was 1.6 times higher than wildtype. Furthermore, transgenic lines performed significantly better under low-nutrient regimes: under competition, yield increased by 1.5-fold. Together, these results demonstrate that increased trehalose has the potential to create more resistant and stable crop plants.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to discover new natural remedies for controlling insect vectors, stored sheep wool was tested for its attractiveness to mosquitoes. The volatile compounds from the wool were collected. A total of 52 compounds were detected; many of them known to have mosquito attractant activity against various species. The most abundant compound in the sheep wool hydrodistillate was not attractive for female adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in small-scale lab evaluations. Comparative evaluations of raw sheep wool in two semi-field, large, screened outdoor cages each with bait equipped with a U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) trap, revealed the bait with vibrated sheep wool was the best attractant for female adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes compared to the setups without wool or not vibrated. It was concluded that sheep wool, an easily available, affordable, and environment-friendly material, could be considered as a potential tool to be used in dynamic bait setups for mosquito management and surveillance. To discover new natural materials for insect management, commercially available stored sheep wool was investigated for attractancy to female adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The volatiles from sheep wool were collected by various techniques of headspace (HS) extractions and hydrodistillation. These extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) coupled with GC-MS. Fifty-two volatile compounds were detected, many of them known for their mosquito attractant activity. Seven compounds were not previously reported in sheep products. The volatile composition of the extracts varied significantly across collections, depending on the extraction techniques or types of fibers applied. Two types of bioassay were conducted to study attractancy of the sheep wool volatiles to mosquitoes: laboratory bioassays using glass tubes, and semi-field bioassays using large, screened outdoor cages. In bioassays with glass tubes, the sheep wool hydrodistillate and its main component, thialdine, did not show any significant attractant activity against female adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Semi-field bioassays in two large screened outdoor cages, each equipped with a U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) trap and the various bait setups with Vortex apparatus, revealed that vibrating wool improved mosquito catches compared to the setups without wool or with wool but not vibrating. Sheep wool, when vibrated, may release intensively volatile compounds, which could serve as olfactory cues, and play significant role in making the bait attractive to mosquitoes. Sheep wool is a readily available, affordable, and environment-friendly material. It should have the potential to be used as a mosquito management and surveillance component in dynamic bait setups.

AB  - Ungulate species have consistently been a major focus of reintroductions to their native ranges. Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are an ecologically sensitive species, and have experienced population declines throughout their historic range; bighorn sheep inhabited the Black Hills region of South Dakota but were extirpated from the area due to anthropogenic impacts in the early 1900s. To continue to restore populations to the area, we translocated 26 bighorn sheep from Alberta, Canada to the Deadwood Region of the Black Hills. Bighorn sheep were fitted with VHF or GPS collars and monitored throughout the duration of the study (Feb 2015-Jan 2017). Our objectives were to evaluate movement patterns post-release of bighorn sheep in the translocated Deadwood bighorn sheep herd. We utilized 3 types of home-range analyses based on collar data; kernel density estimation (KDE), minimum convex polygon (MCP), and Brownian Bridge Movement Models (BBMM) were used to estimate home-ranges year 1, year 2, and for the duration of the study. Home-range size utilizing KDE (95%; (x) over bar =41.41 km(2), SE = 10.50), minimum convex polygon (95%; (x) over bar =55.73 km(2), SE =15.04), and BBMM (95%; (x) over bar =32.95 km(2) , SE =4.67) differed among methods. Year 1 home-range sizes (95% BBMM; (x) over bar= 40.01 km(2)) were larger than year 2 (95% BBMM; .(x) over bar= 4 .08 km(2)) home-range sizes. Travel distances were also larger in year 1 ((x) over bar = 431.80 km) than year 2 ((x) over bar = 368.77 km). Our results indicate that after an acclimation period, which included individual dispersal, the translocated Deadwood bighorn sheep herd settled into smaller home-ranges near the release site.

AB  - Line-transect distance sampling is widely used to estimate population densities using distances of observed targets from transect lines to model detectability. When the target taxa are high density, the frequent measuring of distances may make the method seem impractical. We present a method that improves the efficiency of distance sampling when the target species occurs at high density. Only a proportion of targets are measured to model the detection function, and the time saved on the survey is then used to cover a longer total length of transect and accrue a larger 'count only' sample. This approach can improve the precision of the population density estimate when the cost of measuring the distance to a detected target is more than half the cost of walking to the next target.
   We find the optimal proportion of distances to measure that minimises the variance of the density estimate for a fixed survey budget. We quantify how much this optimised strategy increases the precision of the density estimate compared with conventional line-transect distance sampling. We then use simulated distance sampling data to test our expressions, and illustrate circumstances under which the optimised approach would be beneficial using distance sampling data on high-density plants.
   The simulations indicate that the optimised method delivers benefits in precision, but the magnitude of the benefit is lower than predicted from our expressions, which are based on an asymptotic approximation of the variance. We apply an adjustment to the predicted benefit equation to account for this difference, and show that, in all three plant case studies, the optimised approach could improve the precision gained from a distance sampling survey between 20% and 50%.
   This new approach could broaden the ecological contexts in which distance sampling is applied, to include estimation of densities of abundant taxa where plots are conventionally used. The method may have interesting applications for other survey types, including multispecies surveys or those using cues or signs that occur at high density.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the superovulation response and pregnancy rates of fresh and vitrified-thawed embryos after transfer in Angora goats with comparing transfer at the beginning (BS) and end (ES) of the breeding season. Nine Angora goats were used as donors in both periods. Donor goats were synchronized and superovulated with the FSH and mated with five fertile bucks. At 156 hr following mating, embryos were collected surgically. Recipient Angora goats were divided into two groups at the beginning (fresh, n = 15; vitrified-thawed, n = 15) and end (fresh, n = 8; vitrified-thawed, n = 8) of the breeding season. Fresh or vitrified-thawed grade I embryos (early blastocyst/blastocyst) were transferred surgically to synchronized recipients. On the 30th, 60th and 90th day of transfer, goats were examined by ultrasonography. The number of corpora lutea (CL), total oocyte/embryo and transferable embryos obtained in BS was found to be statistically higher than ES. On the 30th day of transfer, pregnancy rates were 73.30% and 75.00% in the fresh transfer groups in both BS and ES periods; while, rates of 20.00% and 37.50% were found in the vitrified-thawed group, respectively. The embryo survival rates of fresh transfers were 55.55% and 31.25% at BS and ES, respectively. The number of CL, total oocyte/embryo and transferable embryos in the BS was higher than ES following superovulation. Also, fresh embryo transfer can be successfully carried out during the breeding season in Angora goats. Moreover, although pregnancies were obtained following the transfer of vitrified-thawed embryos, they did not sustain on the 60th and 90th days. So, further studies are needed for the vitrified-thawed embryos. (C) 2021 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Structural variations (SVs) play crucial roles in the evolutionary adaptation of domesticated animals to natural and human-controlled environments, but SVs have not been explored in Tibetan cattle, which recently migrated and rapidly adapted to the high altitudes of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In this study, a de novo chromosome-level genome assembly for Tibetan cattle is constructed. It is found that using a lineage-specific reference genome significantly increased variant detection accuracy and completeness. Analysis of long-read sequencing data from 36 high-altitude QTP and 48 low-altitude cattle identified 222 528 SVs and 259 SV hotspot regions. Positively selected SVs in high-altitude cattle are related to energy metabolism erythropoiesis and angiogenesis, and peroxisomal metabolism. A 102-bp intronic deletion in GNPAT likely upregulated its expression. It is distinguished 7293 SVs that may be introgressed from yak, including variants upstream of the hypoxia-inducing gene EGLN1. Finally, a approximate to 2-Mb heterozygous inversion and two translocations on chromosome 6 are likely associated with the cattle gray coat via regulatory effects on the KIT gene. The results confirm the importance of SVs in evolutionary adaptation and the contribution yak-introgressed SVs to the rapid acclimatization of QTP cattle.

AB  - The Live Fluorescently Labelled Algae (LFLA) technique has been used numerous times to estimate microzooplankton herbivory. Yet, it is unknown how mixoplankton (i.e., single-cell organisms that can combine phototrophy and phagotrophy) affect the outcome of this technique. Hence, we conducted a broad-spectrum assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the LFLA technique, using several mixoplanktonic and protozooplanktonic grazers. Species from different taxonomic groups and different feeding mechanisms were tested in short-term experiments (ca. 5 h) in the laboratory, at different prey concentrations and during light and dark periods of the day. Overall, our findings suggest that the LFLA technique, due to its short-term nature, is an effective tracker of diel ingestion and digestion rates, and can detect new mixoplanktonic predators. We recommend that, irrespective of the prey concentration, incubations to measure grazing rates with this technique should generally be concluded within 1 h (adaptable to the environmental temperature). Nevertheless, our results also call for caution whenever using LFLA in the field: feeding mechanisms other than direct engulfment (like peduncle feeding) may provide severely biased ingestion rates. Furthermore, size and species selectivity are very hard to circumvent. To reduce the effects of selectivity, we propose the combined use of two distinctly coloured fluorochromes (i.e., distinct emission spectra). With this modification, one could either label different size ranges of prey or account for species-specific interactions in the food web.

AB  - An earthworm checklist has produced 78 nominal taxa (species/subspecies) of earthworm reported to date in Venezuela. The list of nominal taxa was obtained through literature review and the distribution maps were plotted by ecoregion. The 78 species/subspecies are divided into 24 genera and 6 families. Native earthworm species were more widely distributed than peregrine and exotic and are more associated with the conserved areas. Exotic species had been collected mainly in the north of the country in areas with at least some disturbance history. The peregrine species P. corethrurus is also widely distributed but with a preference for disturbed areas or related to its native natural grassland condition near the Guayana's shield. This is the first accurate assessment of Venezuela's earthworm species and subspecies in the last 14 years.

AB  - GPS collars are a technology that is used extensively to monitor livestock due to its versatility. In this study, the main objective was to confirm whether they can detect the circadian rhythmicity that modulates the behavior of free-grazing sheep. The Churra-breed flock that was monitored grazed an approx. 166-ha fenced area within a dehesa ecosystem in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. Geolocations were recorded every 30 min for two years. Animal activities were categorized based on the speed; an animal was "moving " if the speed was > 0 m/s (the analyzed category), and "resting " if the speed was 0 m/s. Sheep grazing activity in terms of their speed, azimuth, and distance traveled, was subjected to a circadian adjustment derived from the online Cosinor tool. Results reveal that the flock activity, whether based on speed, distance traveled, or azimuth, fit a circadian rhythmicity (p < 0.05). In the summer, particularly July and August, sheep exhibited a significant advance in the acrophase (the time at which the peak of a rhythm occurs), which might have been caused by day length and temperature. In all seasons, flock activity was significantly higher in the diurnal period, while the lowest activity was found in all cases at night, although in the summer sheep activity was high at dawn. In addition, in the day, sheep activity was significantly higher in the fall than it was at other times of the year. The preferred grazing direction of the sheep was non-random, since it was modulated by the contour orientation and the limits of the grazing area. It could be concluded that GPS geolocations allow to demonstrate that free-grazing sheep activity is modulated by a circadian rhythmicity.

AB  - Characterization of molecular responses in real and complex field environments is essential for understanding the environmental response of plants. Field transcriptomics prediction consists of modeling of transcriptomes in outdoor fields with various environmental variables: Meteorological parameters, atmospheric gases, soil conditions, herbivores, management, etc. It is the most comprehensive method of studying gene expression dynamics in complex environments. However, it is not clear what factors influence the accuracy of field transcriptome models. In this study, a novel simulation system was developed. Using the system, we performed a large-scale simulation to reveal the factors affecting the accuracy of the models. We found that the factors that had the greatest impact on the accuracy are, in order of importance, the expression pattern of the gene, the number of samples in the training data, the diurnal coverage of the training data, and the temperature coverage of the training data. Validation using actually measured transcriptome data showed similar results to the simulations. Our simulation system and the analysis results will be helpful for developing efficient sampling strategies for training data and for generating simulated data for benchmarking new modelling methods. It will also be valuable to dissect the relative importance of various factors behind transcriptome dynamics in the real environment.

AB  - Repressor elements significantly influence economically relevant phenotypes in pigs; however, their precise roles and characteristics are inadequately understood. In the present study, we employed H3K27me3 profiling, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with highthroughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data across six tissues derived from three embryonic layers to identify and map 2 034 super repressor elements (SREs) and 22 223 typical repressor elements (TREs) in the pig genome. Notably, many repressor elements were conserved across mesodermal and ectodermal tissues. SREs exhibited tight regulation of their target genes, affecting a limited number of genes within a specific genomic region with pronounced effects, while TREs exerted broader but weaker regulation over a wider range of target genes. Furthermore, in neuronal tissues, genes regulated by repressor elements started to be repressed during the differentiation of stem cells into progenitor cells. Notably, analysis showed that many repressor elements exhibited cooperative and additive effects on the modulation of KLF4 expression. This research provides the first comprehensive map of pig repressor elements, serving as an essential reference for future studies on repressor elements.

AB  - Hyperthermophilic pretreatment composting (HPC) has the advantages of enhanced composting efficiency and accelerated humic substance (HS) over conventional composting (CC). However, the mechanisms towards the accelerated humification process by HPC are still not clear. By means of sterilization technology, the roles of abiotic and biotic components on the formation of HS can be distinguished. The study investigated the humification degree and the succession of microbial community during HPC of pig manure. The mechanisms underlying the accelerated humification by HPC was identified using gamma sterilization. Results showed that HS content increased significantly by 13.72% in HPC and 29.93% in sterilized HPC inoculated with 1% CC (HPC_I), compared with 8.76% increase in CC and 7.12% increase in sterilized CC inoculated with 1% HPC during composting (CC_I). Compared with CC and CC_I, stronger intensities of HA-like and fulvic acid-like components were observed in HPC and HPC_I. Results showed that physicochemical properties, especially pH, were the key factors in accelerating the humification in HPC, while both physicochemical properties and microbial community contributed to the HA formation in CC. The study contributed to a better understanding of the mechanism towards the accelerated humification degree in HPC.

AB  - Grasslands cover a large proportion of global agricultural landmass used to feed herbivores and ruminants and link the environment to the food chain via animals onto humans. However, most scientific studies of antimicrobial resistance and microbiomes at the environmental - animal nexus have focused on soil or vegetables rather than grasslands. Based on previous microbiome phyllosphere-soil studies we hypothesised that the microbiome and resistomes across soil and grass would have a core of shared taxa and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), but that in addition each would also have a minority of unique signatures. Our data indicated grass contained a wider variety and higher relative abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) than soil with or without slurry amendments. The microbiomes of soil and grass were similar in content but varied in the composition proportionality. While there were commonalities across many of the ARGs present in soil and on grass their correlations with MGEs and bacteria differed, suggesting a source other than soil is also relevant for the resistome of grass. The variations in the relative abundances of ARGs in soil and on grass also indicated that either the MGEs or the bacteria carrying the ARGs comprised a higher relative abundance on grass than in soil. We conclude that while soil may be a source of some of these genes it cannot be the source for all ARGs and MGEs. Our data identifies grass as a more diverse and abundant reservoir of ARGs and MGEs in the environment than soil, which is significant to human and animal health when viewed in the context of grazing food animals.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation threaten biodiversity, particularly for carnivores whose dispersion and population viability are compromised by reduced available habitat and anthropogenic elements in the landscape, such as roads and crops. The world's grasslands have experienced considerable degradation and replacement by crops and are currently limited to natural patches scattered throughout the region. In Argentina, the last remaining grassland remnants that persist are associated within the Pampean mountain systems, which act as crucial refuges for the species that inhabit them in the region. Our objectives were to identify and map priority sites and areas that can act as ecological corridors between highland grassland patches of high conservation priority. We performed connectivity analyses using least-cost path models and circuit theory. To do this, we generated habitat suitability models by combining environmental and anthropic variables, from which resistance surfaces were generated. We highlight areas of high habitat suitability for carnivores in the Pampas ecoregion, with particular emphasis on highland grassland. We identified potential corridors and least-cost paths for five carnivore species, obtaining multi-species corridors which highlight the importance of landscape connectivity for maintaining healthy populations. Centrality analyses revealed crucial grassland remnants and valuable corridors. These findings address the challenges associated with habitat fragmentation in the Pampas ecoregion and provide guidelines for future research and carnivore conservation actions.

AB  - The article describes the paleobiogeographic history of the modern subfamilies so-called "crown deer" of the family Cervidae (Artiodactyla, Mammalia) in the world from the late Miocene to the late Pleistocene. The study overviews the taxonomic diversity and evolutionary radiation of Cervidae from all zoogeographic realms where this systematic group is present in the paleontological record. The evolutionary diversification of the fossil Cervidae is based on the estimations of species body masses that are regarded here as a proxy of occupied ecological niches. The study reveals two important evolutionary radiations of Cervidae during the late Miocene of Eurasia that gave the origin of the modern subfamilies Cervinae and Capreolinae. The evolutionary radiation of Capreolinae during the Pleistocene in South America shows a range of diversity comparable to the late Miocene radiations of Old World deer and provides multiple examples of evolutionary convergences with Eurasian Pleistocene cervids. The article discusses factors that shaped the modern biogeographic distribution of representatives of the subfamilies Cervinae and Capreolinae.

AB  - Elephants are highly intelligent animals with a huge capacity for social cognition, living in large, long-lived, related herds. In captivity, it is extremely difficult to meet all of the species' ecological needs, as well as those required individual by individual, but improvements are continually being made. After identifying impaired welfare, one collection made the decision to relocate four female African Elephants (Loxodonta africana) to a different facility. As the worlds' largest land mammal, many safety, welfare, and logistical considerations were undertaken. The elephants travelled in two pairs, a mother-daughter pair and an older unrelated female and a younger unrelated female with a strong social bond. As a result, there was a short gap in between transports, allowing for further habituation to transport crates and the heat of summer. The changes in both social and individual behaviours of the two females remaining when their group was temporarily reduced from four to two were investigated using one-zero sampling. The study determined the daily activities of the elephants comparing 'before transport' to 'after transport' for the two remaining elephants to establish any changes in their behaviours as a result of this disturbance. Post transport, there was an increase in both human-audible vocalisations and temporal gland secretions, and hugely decreased play behaviour was observed. The dynamic between the remaining pair was also altered with more tactile behaviours from mother to daughter seen but more submission from daughter to mother. This led to the conclusion that the elephants, although mostly unrelated and living in an 'unnatural' captive setting, had the same signs of stress and behavioural change as would a highly related group if separated.

AB  - Volatile cues can play a significant role in the location and discrimination of food resources by insects. Dung beetles have been reported to discriminate among dung types produced by different species, thereby exhibiting behavioral preferences. However, the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in dung localization and preference remains largely unexplored in dung beetles. Here we performed several studies: firstly, cage olfactometer bioassays were performed to evaluate the behavioral responses of Bubas bison (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) to VOCs emanating from fresh horse, sheep, and cattle dung; secondly, concurrent volatilome analysis was performed to characterize volatilomes of these dung types. Bubas bison adults exhibited greater attraction to horse dung and less attraction to cattle dung, and they preferred dung from horses fed a pasture-based diet over dung from those fed lucerne hay. Volatilomes of the corresponding dung samples from each livestock species contained a diverse group of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, phenols, and sulfurous compounds, but the composition and abundance of annotated VOCs varied with dung type and livestock diet. The volatilome of horse dung was the most chemically diverse. Results from a third study evaluating electroantennogram response and supplementary olfactometry provided strong evidence that indole, butyric acid, butanone, p-cresol, skatole, and phenol, as well as toluene, are involved in the attraction of B. bison to dung, with a mixture of these components significantly more attractive than individual constituents.

AB  - The lack of data on distribution of juvenile marine species can limit conservation efforts. As hatchlings, marine turtles are too small to track using satellite telemetry, so their at-sea distribution remains unknown. This knowledge gap is critical, as hatchlings already experience high mortality in coastal zones. In addition, further risks to their survival may occur beyond these areas, linked to threats associated with in-water artificial infrastructure and/or attraction to artificial lights and thus increased mortality from higher risk of predation or exhaustion from disorientation. To fill this gap, we used particle tracking forced by an ocean circulation model to predict the dispersal of flatback turtle Natator depressus hatchlings from 12 nesting sites off the coast of Western Australia. We used the model outputs to calculate the distribution of these 'virtual hatchlings' and infer the core area of hatchling use over 3 dispersal phases (1-4, 10-15 and 25-30 d). We then calculated the overlap between core areas and 2 anthropogenic threats (in-water artificial infrastructure and light pollution). Core areas were predominately located on the continental shelf during all dispersal phases, supporting the hypothesis that flatback turtles remain in neritic areas. Most (70-80%) of the core area during early dispersal (Days 1-4 and 10-15) contained at least one threat. However, less than half of the area used between Day 25 and 30 was exposed to threats. In the absence of empirical data on hatchling distribution, our results have predicted the core areas used by early life stage flatback turtles to assist in conservation management of these threatened species.

AB  - Sex-specific nutritional requirements, mating behavior, and parental care can potentially affect food selection and consumption in animals. However, relatively little is known about how sex and reproduction influence food use by aquatic herbivores. We measure male:female ratios in the field and studied sexual differences in algal food choice and feeding rates for the amphipod Gammarus aequicauda from a desert saline lake, where it is the most abundant mesograzer during the colder months. We also assessed the effects of precopulatory pairing and female egg development on feeding behavior. Males were more numerous than females over two sampling periods and significantly preferred one algal species in each of three pairwise food-choice combinations tested. Females were moderately less selective, expressing a preference in only two of these experiments, but showed significantly higher total consumption and feeding rates than males in most assays. When males and females expressed similar preferences, the magnitude of these preferences (% differences in consumption between the algae offered) was statistically equivalent for both sexes. Patterns of compensatory feeding on less nutritious algae were significant and similar for both sexes. Mated pairs had reduced feeding rates compared to unpaired females, but not unpaired males. In contrast, no short-term differences in feeding rates were detected for males and females separated from precopula or between females at two stages of egg development. Variations in population sex ratios and reproductive cycles can potentially modulate interactions between aquatic consumers and their food sources.

AB  - The genus Macaca belongs to Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys), Cercopithecinae, Papionini. The presence of Macaca in North Africa is well known from the Late Miocene to the Late Pleistocene. However, the diet of fossil Macaca has been poorly described in the literature. In this study, we investigated the feeding habits of Macaca cf. sylvanus (n = 4) from the Plio-Pleistocene site Guefait-4.2 in eastern Morocco through multiproxy analysis combining analyses of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes from tooth enamel, buccal microtexture, and low-magnification occlusal dental microwear. For both microwear analyses, we compared the macaques with a new reference collection of extant members of Cercopithecoidea. Our occlusal microwear results show for the fossil macaque a pattern similar to the extant Cercocebus atys and Lophocebus albigena, African forest-dwelling species that are characterized by a durophagous diet based mainly on hard fruit and seed intake. Buccal microtexture results also suggest the consumption of some grasses and the exploitation of more open habitats, similar to that observed in Theropithecus gelada. The delta C-13 of M. cf. sylvanus indicates a C-3 based-diet without the presence of C-4 plants typical of the savanna grassland in eastern Africa during this period. The high delta O-18 values of M. cf. sylvanus, compared with the contemporary ungulates recovered from Guefait-4.2, could be associated with the consumption of a different resource by the primate such as leaves or fresh fruits from the upper part of trees. The complementarity of these methods allows for a dietary reconstruction covering a large part of the individual's life.

AB  - Exposing pigs to heat stress (HS) provokes higher death of intestinal cells, resulting in elevated endogenous intestinal losses (EIL) of amino acids (AA) and damage to intestinal epithelia. Arginine (Arg) is precursor for the synthesis of polyamines, which are involved in proliferation of intestinal cells and restoration of the intestinal epithelia. Thus the effect of adding L-Arg to diets for HS pigs on the EIL of AA was analyzed. Twelve pigs (23.1 +/- 1.1 kg body weight) implanted with T-type cannulas at the end of ileum were individually housed and allowed 15-days for surgery recovery under thermoneutral (TN) conditions (22 +/- 2 degrees C). Following, the pigs were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: TN pigs fed a semi-purified, corn starch-3% casein basal diet (TN-B); HS pigs with the basal diet (HS-B); HS pigs consuming the basal diet supplemented with 0.20% L-Arg (HS-Arg). The experiment consisted of two 9-day periods; each period included 7-days of adaptation to their respective diet, followed by a 2-day ileal digesta collection period. Digesta was collected during 12 consecutive hours each day. The pigs were fed twice a-day. Ambient temperature (AT) inside the TN and HS rooms ranged from 18.6 to 27.6 degrees C and from 29.5 to 40.7 degrees C, respectively. Body temperature followed a pattern similar to that of AT. The daily EIL of indispensable AA increased (P < 0.01) in the HS-B pigs compared to both the TN-B and the HS-Arg pigs, however, there was no EIL difference between the TN-B and the HS-Arg pigs (P > 0.05). Likewise, with the exception of serine, daily losses of endogenous dispensable AA in the HS-B pigs were higher (P < 0.01) in comparison with those of TN-B and HS-Arg pigs. In summary, HS exposure compared to TN conditions increases the loss of endogenous AA, but dietary supplementation with L-Arg helped to counteract the negative HS effect.

AB  - Cattle-yak, the hybrid offspring of yak and taurine cattle, exhibits male sterility with normal female fertility. Spermatogenesis is arrested in adult cattle-yak, and apoptosis is elevated in spermatogenic cells. Currently, the mechanisms underlying these defects remain elusive. Sertoli cells are the only somatic cells that directly interact with spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules and play essential roles in spermatogenesis. The present study was designed to investigate gene expression signatures and po-tential roles of Sertoli cells in hybrid sterility in cattle-yak. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the 5 mC and 5hmC signals in Sertoli cells of cattle-yaks were significantly different from those of age -matched yaks (P < 0.05). Transcriptome profiling of isolated Sertoli cells identified 402 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cattle-yaks and yaks. Notably, niche factor glial cell derived neuro-trophic factor (GDNF) was upregulated, and genes involved in retinoic acid (RA) biogenesis were changed in Sertoli cells of cattle-yak, suggesting possible impairments of spermatogonial fate decisions. Further studies showed that the numbers of proliferative gonocytes and undifferentiated spermatogonia in cattle-yak were significantly higher than those in yak (P < 0.01). Exogenous GDNF significantly promoted the proliferation of UCHL1-positive spermatogonia in yaks. Therefore, we concluded that altered GDNF expression and RA signaling impacted the fate decisions of undifferentiated spermatogonia in cattle-yak. Together, these findings highlight the role of Sertoli cells and their derived factors in hybrid sterility. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Bycatch poses a severe challenge to global fishery management. Although studies have focused on marine megafauna bycatch, research on relevant issues regarding invertebrates is limited, particularly for the threatened horseshoe crabs. In this study, the distribution of fishing gears and the bycatch intensity of Asian horseshoe crabs in the intertidal zones of the northern Beibu Gulf that harbors the most abundant juvenile Asian horseshoe crabs populations in China were evaluated. Seven intertidal nursery habitats for Tachypleus tridentatus and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda were surveyed from May to July in 2021. A transect that crossed the tidal creeks and tidal flats between the high tide embankment/vegetation and low tide line of a given habitat was surveyed during the ebb tides. The type, number, and GPS of fishing gears were recorded when sighted, and the number and prosomal width of each horseshoe crab species were measured. Bycatch intensities differed among habitats, ranging from 0.3 to 18.4 and 1.2 to 22.7 individuals per kilometer of transect for T. tridentatus and C. rotundicauda, respectively. Among the three identified fishing gear types, ground cages and stick net sets caused a stronger bycatch pressure on these two species. Most T. tridentatus bycatch and C. rotundicauda bycatch were large individuals in late juvenile and adult stages. Therefore, the ground cages and stick net sets along/near the tidal creeks, mangrove fringe, and low tide line should be regulated and removed to ensure the functionality of the intertidal zone as the spawning corridor and nursery habitat of Asian horseshoe crabs.

AB  - Individual differences in behavioral and physiological traits among members of the same species are increasingly being recognized as important in animal research. On the group level, shaping of behavioral and hormonal phenotypes by environmental factors has been reported in different taxa. The extent to which the environment impacts behavior and hormones on the individual level, however, is rather unexplored. Hormonal phenotypes of guinea pigs can be shaped by the social environment on the group level: pair-housed and colony-housed males differ systematically in average testosterone and stressor-induced cortisol levels (i.e. cortisol responsiveness). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether repeatability and individual variance components (i.e. between- and within-individual variation) of hormonal phenotypes also differ in different social environments. To test this, we determined baseline testosterone, baseline cortisol, and cortisol responsiveness after challenge in same-aged pair-housed and colony-housed guinea pig males over a period of four months. We found comparable repeatability for baseline cortisol and cortisol responsiveness in males from both social conditions. In contrast, baseline testosterone was repeatable only in males from colonies. Interestingly, this result was brought about by significantly larger between-individual variation of testosterone, that was not explained by differences in dominance rank. Individualized social niches differentiated under complex colony, but not pair housing, could be an explanation for this finding.

AB  - Gall-inducing insects are a classic example of how insects can impact the morphology and physiology of their host plants by forming galls which act as nutrient sinks. An 8-months laboratory study was conducted to determine the impact of the galls induced by Polymorphomyia basilica oviposition and or the subsequent larval feedingon the growth and reproduction of Chromolaena odorata. Three treatment levels were used, viz. control: 0% of the shoots were exposed, low infestation: 50% of shoots were exposed, and high infestation, where 100% of the shoots were exposed for P. basilica to oviposit for 48 h each month. Results showed that P. basilica oviposition and or the subsequent feeding by larvae reduced the height and flower production of C. odorata plants but promoted lateral growth by increasing the number of shoot tips. Basal stem diameter was not affected by the presence of the galls. The presence of galls also decreased the leaf and root dry biomass on the treated plants but had no significant impact on stem biomass. The difference between the low- and high-infestation treatments was only significant for root biomass, suggesting that more galls are required for the roots to be affected. Overall, the study showed that P. basilica meets the requirements of an effective biocontrol agent against C. odorata in South Africa. Its release should complement the already released agents in reducing the fitness and productivity of C. odorata.

AB  - Plants would encounter various biotic and abiotic stresses during the growth and development. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) as plant-specific TFs, play an important role in responding to various adverse circumstances. Despite some advances were achieved in functional studies of WRKY TFs in tea plants, systematic analysis of the involvement of CsWRKY TFs when facing cold, salt, drought stresses and pathogen and insect attack was lacked. In present study, a total of 78 CsWRKY TFs were identified following the genomic and transcript databases. The expression patterns of CsWRKYs in various organs of tea plants and the expression profiles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses were investigated by examining representative RNA-seq data. Moreover, the effects of hormone treatments (SA and MeJA) on the transcription levels of WRKY TFs were also investigated. The phylogenetic tree of CsWRKY TFs from different species indicated the functional diversity of WRKY TFs was not closely related to their protein classification. Concurrently, CsWRKY70-2 TF was identified as a positive regulator in response to drought stress. This study provided solid and valuable information, helping us better understand the functional diversity of CsWRKY TFs, and laid the foundation for further research on the function of key WRKY genes in tea plants.

AB  - Analyses of the diets of frog species in a range of different habitats have shown that these amphibians feed primarily on arthropods. In general, frogs are not selective predators, but may vary in their capture mode along a continuum between active and passive foraging. In the present study, we assessed the diet of two bromeliad-breeding frogs of the genus Ololygon (= Scinax) through taxonomic and functional identification (trophic guilds). We innovate in use of trophic guilds of frogs' preys and use the phytophagous consumption as proxy for favoring bromeliads by frogs. We also assessed the potential relationship between the size of the frogs and that of the prey they ingest, whether consumption rates varied seasonally, and the foraging mode. The results indicated a diet composed predominantly of phytophagous arthropods for both Ololygon species (O. littorea and O. perpusilla). Most of the arthropods consumed belonged to the orders Hemiptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. We found no significant differences among the number of arthropods ingested in the rainy and in the dry seasons in either Ololygon species, nor significant relationship found between the frog size and corresponding prey ingested by individual frogs. The foraging mode of frogs was restricted only to vegetative parts of bromeliads and they did not feed on any potential pollinators. Taken together, these results suggested that frogs may favor the host bromeliad and suggest a potential trophic cascade among frogs, bromeliads, and phytophagous arthropods.

AB  - Simple Summary The 2010 European Declaration aimed at abandoning surgical castration and switching to alternative methods. With an intention to facilitate the internal trade, the European Union (EU) was initially in favor of a single alternative. Immunocastration, as an active vaccine against the Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone, was proposed as a potential solution. However, its market potential is not yet well understood. This study applied the method of scenario analysis to examine whether and under what conditions immunocastration could be the general solution sought by the EU. Specifically, it developed two extreme scenarios. Both scenarios suggest that it is unlikely that immunocastration will become a single solution for all producers in the EU. Painful castration of male piglets to avoid boar taint can potentially be replaced by three more ethical alternatives: entire male production in combination with a detection method, immunocastration (an active vaccination against the gonadotrophin-releasing factor, GnRF), and castration with pain relief (anesthesia and/or analgesia). With the aim of abandoning piglet castration and facilitating internal trade, the European Union (EU) was initially in favor of a single alternative. Immunocastration was proposed as a potential solution, but it has not yet been sufficiently assessed regarding its market potential. To address this point, this paper uses scenario analysis to examine whether and under what conditions immunocastration could be the general solution sought by the EU. The study constructs two extreme scenarios: one in which all uncertain elements negatively influence the growth of immunocastration; another in which all uncertain elements have positive influences. These scenarios provide insights into the variance in possible futures for the implementation of immunocastration. The results show that it is unlikely that immunocastration will become a single solution for all producers in the EU, because it is not the optimal solution for all types of EU pork production systems (i.e., cost-efficiency oriented, quality oriented, animal-friendly oriented, import dependent). Rather than debating and looking for evidence about which single method is the best for the entire EU, EU authorities are advised to allow the co-existence of all alternatives and to develop protocols for applying them in the pork industry.

AB  - The experiments were to study the effects of Se-yeast on immune and antioxidant in Selenium(Se)-deprived Pishan red sheep in Southern Xinjiang, China. The samples of soil, forage, and animal tissues were collected, and used for measuring mineral content, physiological parameter, and biochemical values. These findings showed that the Se contents in affected soil and forage were markedly lower than those from unaffected soil and forage (P < 0.01). Se in affected blood and wool were also extremely lower than those from healthy Pishan red sheep (P < 0.01). The hemoglobin, packed cell volume, platelet count, Glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity in the affected Pishan red sheep were markedly lower than those from healthy ones too (P < 0.01). The levels of malondialdehyde, total nitric oxide synthase, and lipid peroxide in Pishan red sheep from affected pastures were extremely higher than those from healthy ones (P < 0.01). The levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, Interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 from serum were markedly decreased in affected Pishan red sheep(P < 0.01). The Pishan red sheep in Se-deprived pasture were treated by orally with Se-yeast, the amount of Se in the blood markedly increased in treated animals. Meanwhile, the immune and antioxidant indicator was returned to the healthy values. Consequently, our findings were indicated that Se-deprived forage caused oxidative damage, and a serious threat to the immune function in animals. The Se-yeast is more effective in the Se-deficient Pishan red sheep including blood Se content, immune function and the antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Specialist insect herbivores make up a substantial fraction of Earth's biodiversity; however, they exploit a minority of plant lineages. For instance, in the eastern United States and Canada, similar to 25% of bee species are pollen specialists, but they are hosted by a small fraction of the native, animal-pollinated angiosperms in the region: Only 6% of plant genera and 3% of families support pollen-specialist bees. It is unclear why some plant lineages host specialist bees while others do not. We know that at least some specialist bees use plant taxa that are avoided by generalists, suggesting that specialist bees favor plants with low-quality pollen, potentially as a strategy to escape competition or obtain protection from natural enemies. There is also evidence that specialist bees prefer superabundant host plants. Here we investigate whether pollen quality and plant abundance predict patterns of host use by specialist bees in eastern North America. Through field observations, we find that plants hosting specialist bees are frequent sources of pollen for generalists, suggesting that their pollen is not generally avoided by bees due to poor pollen quality. In addition, our analysis of a large citizen-science data set shows that regional abundance strongly predicts which plant genera in the eastern United States host pollen-specialist bees. Our results show that bees specialize on regionally abundant-but not necessarily low-quality-plant lineages. These plant lineages may provide more opportunities for the evolution of specialists and lower likelihood of specialist extinction.

AB  - The increasingly frequent and severe regional-scale compound heatwave-drought extreme events (CHDEs), driven by global warming, present formidable challenges to ecosystems, residential livelihoods, and economic conditions. However, uncertainty persists regarding the future trend of CHDEs and their insights into regional spatiotemporal heterogeneity. By integrating daily meteorological data from observations in 1961-2022 and global climate models (GCMs) based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, the evolution patterns of CHDEs were compared and examined among three sub-catchments of the Yangtze River Basin, and the return periods of CHDE in 2050s and 2100s were projected. The findings indicate that the climate during the 2022 CHDE period was the warmest and driest recorded in 1961-2022, with precipitation less than 154.5 mm and a mean daily maximum temperature 3.4 degrees C higher than the average of 1981-2010, whereas the characteristics in the sub-catchments exhibited temporal and spatial variation. In July-August 2022, the most notable feature of CHDE was its extremeness since 1961, with return periods of similar to 200-year in upstream, 80-year in midstream, and 40-year in downstream, respectively. By 2050, the return periods witnessed 2022 CHDE would likely be reduced by one-third. Looking towards 2100, under the highest emission scenario of SSP585, it was projected to substantially increase the frequency of CHDEs, with return periods reduced to one-third in the upstream and downstream, as well as halved in the midstream. These findings provide valuable insights into the changing risks associated with forthcoming climate extremes, emphasizing the urgency of addressing these challenges in regional management and sustainable development.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the differentiation among three goat breeds - the autochthonous Carpathian goat and the cosmopolitan Alpine and Anglo-Nubian breeds - based on information from microsatellite markers. Blood samples of 64 goats were collected from three farms located in southern Poland. The population structure of the collected goats was investigated using the Bayesian approach, implemented in STRUCTURE 2.3.4. The Pairwise Population Fst analysis revealed that the largest genetic distinction was between the Anglo-Nubian and the Alpine breeds. In each of the analyses carried out, it was observed that the Carpathian breed is genetically more similar to the Alpine breed, while the Anglo-Nubian breed is a separate, much more distinct cluster. It therefore seems reasonable to carry out further research in the context of the genetic relationship between the two goat breeds (Carpathian and Alpine) adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous areas.

AB  - Direct reuse of biogas residue (BR) has the potential to contribute to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Although high-temperature composting has been demonstrated as an effective method for the harmless treatment of organic waste, there is few researches on the fate of ARGs in high-temperature composting of BR. This research examined the impact of adding 5% chitosan and 15% peat on physicochemical characteristics, microbial communities, and removal of ARGs during BR-straw composting in 12 Biolan 220L composters for 48 days. Our results showed that the simultaneous addition of chitosan and peat extended the high- temperature period, and increased the highest temperature to 74 degrees C and germination index. These effects could be attributed to the presence of thermophilic cellulose-decomposing genera ( Thermomyces and Thermobifida). ). Although the microbial communities differed compositionally among temperature stages, their dissimilarity drastically reduced at final stage, indicating that the impact of different treatments on microbial community composition decreases at the end of composting. Peat had a greater impact on aerobic genera capable of cellulose degradation at thermophilic stage than chitosan. Surprisingly, despite the total copy number of ARGs significantly decreased during composting, especially in the treatment with both chitosan and peat, intl1 gene abundance significantly increased 2 logs at thermophilic stage and maintained high level in the final compost, suggesting there is still a potential risk of transmission and proliferation of ARGs. Our work shed some lights on the development of waste resource utilization and emerging contaminants removal technology.

AB  - Captive breeding programs play an important role in preserving the genetic diversity of endangered species. It is of utmost importance to conduct genetic assessment for captive populations in order to develop scientific breeding plans and conservation management strategies. Here, we genotyped 10 microsatellite loci and sequenced 368 bp of mitochondrial DNA control region for the golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) from eight captive populations in China, and compared the genetic indices of captive populations with a wild population. Meanwhile, we performed paternity tests to verify the genealogical records and established genetic lineages. A total of 157 individuals were identified from 161 fecal samples, including 135 captive individuals (approximately 25% of captive individuals in China). Microsatellite analysis showed that the nine populations had moderate levels of genetic diversity, with polymorphism information content (PIC) ranging from 0.43 to 0.542; the genetic diversity of captive populations (average PIC: 0.503) was slightly higher than that of the wild population (PIC: 0.438). The Structure analysis indicated that individuals of the eight captive populations contained two different genetic components. We conducted either single-blind or double-blind paternity testing on 40 offspring of captive individuals and found that five offspring from two zoos (Nanjing Hongshan Forest Zoo and Shanghai Wild Animal Park) showed discrepant kinships from their pedigree records, probably due to the inaccuracies in pedigree records. By constructing genetic pedigrees, inbred offspring were found in Beijing Zoo, Shanghai Zoo, Hangzhou Zoo, and Chengdu Zoo. Analysis based on mitochondrial DNA showed a high level of genetic diversity in the eight captive populations (mean nucleotide diversity: 0.047). However, no nucleotide diversity was found in the wild population. This study conducted a genetic survey for captive golden snub-nosed monkeys and will significantly benefit the genetic conservation management for captive populations in the future.

AB  - Transport stress prior to slaughter frequently induces a stress response, negatively affecting meat quality. This study investigated the impact of dietary potassium magnesium sulphate (PMS) supplementation during the fattening stage on the stress response and meat quality in finishing pigs subjected to transport stress. The experiment involved two phases. Initially, 48 finishing pigs (68.00 +/- 0.40 kg) were randomly allocated into two groups: a control group receiving a basal diet (CON) and a PMS-supplemented group receiving the basal diet with 0.50% PMS. Each group was housed in six pens, with four pigs per pen. After 60 days of feeding, in the second phase, two pigs from each pen were randomly selected for slaughter, with one pig subjected to a 4 h transportation stress prior to slaughter. Pigs were categorized into four treatment groups based on diet and stress: (1) control without transport stress, (2) control with transport stress, (3) PMS-supplemented without transport stress, and (4) PMS-supplemented with transport stress. Serum, jejunum, and longissimus thoracis muscle (LM) samples were collected. The results indicated that dietary PMS supplementation did not significantly affect growth performance during the fattening stage (p > 0.05). However, following transport, the PMS pigs showed a reduction in norepinephrine and cortisol concentrations (p = 0.09, p < 0.05) and a significant increase in serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PMS supplementation significantly increased serum catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p < 0.05), while significantly reducing cholesterol (CHO) levels (p < 0.05). Transport stress adversely affected the intestinal health of finishing pigs, as evidenced by a decrease in intestinal villus height (0.05 < p < 0.1), a condition ameliorated by PMS supplementation. Additionally, transported pigs exhibited a higher drip loss24h in LM (p < 0.05), which was also alleviated through PMS supplementation. In conclusion, PMS supplementation mitigates transport stress and improves meat quality in finishing pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary The nutritional and economic value of buffalo meat is being recognized more and more, but the quality and yield of buffalo meat still need to be improved. MiRNAs play important roles in skeletal muscle development, but their regulatory role in buffalo muscle is unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of miRNAs on the proliferation and differentiation of buffalo myoblasts and discussed their relationship with inflammation in muscle injuries. The results suggest that bbu-miR-493-5p, which is differentially expressed during the proliferative and differentiation stages of buffalo myoblasts, can regulate buffalo skeletal muscle development and may act as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory responses to muscle injury. These findings provide a basis for the future use of miRNAs for buffalo selection and improved animal health.Abstract In recent years, the meat and dairy value of buffaloes has become a major concern in buffalo breeding, and the improvement of buffalo beef quality is key to protecting buffalo germplasm resources and solving the problem of beef supply. MiRNAs play a significant role in regulating muscle development. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate the development of buffalo skeletal muscles remains largely unexplored. In this study, we examined miRNA expression profiles in buffalo myoblasts during the proliferation and differentiation stages. A total of 177 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, out of which 88 were up-regulated and 89 down-regulated. We focused on a novel miRNA, named bbu-miR-493-5p, that was significantly differentially expressed during the proliferation and differentiation of buffalo myoblasts and highly expressed in muscle tissues. The RNA-FISH results showed that bbu-miR-493-5p was primarily located in the cytoplasm to encourage buffalo myoblasts' proliferation and differentiation. In conclusion, our study lays the groundwork for future research into the regulatory role of miRNAs in the growth of buffalo muscle.

AB  - Lamb production in Brazil has the state of Sa & SIM;o Paulo as its largest consumer market, but due to competition for area with other agricultural activities, sheep farming in Sa & SIM;o Paulo underwent an intensification of the production system to achieve better economic profitability. This intensification can compromise the sustainability of the system. There is no research concerning about emergy evaluation on lamb production systems applied in Brazil, so this is the first paper to discuss the sustainability of lamb production systems using this method. Therefore, this article proposes to discuss the importance of considering environmental aspects in the economic analysis of production systems, aiming at the sustainable development of the sector. This study assessed the economic and emergy performance of three different sheep farms in Brazil managed under different levels of technology: Intensive, Semi-intensive, and Feedlot. Results show that from an economic perspective, the Feedlot system is more attractive (9,800 US$/yr for net profit) than Intensive and Semi-intensive ones, while emergy synthesis show that Semi-intensive system (30% for renewability) should be prioritized. On the other hand, when emergy is analyzed from an economic perspective based on Emdollars (Em$, with an 'm'), the economic advantage regarding the production cost of Feedlot on the Semi-intensive system becomes less evident. The Intensive system obtained the worst performance for economic, and emergy indicators. More than contributing to the discussions about the importance in considering a systemic perspective when quantifying the economic performance of production systems, this study also (i) establishes the most sustainable sheep farm system that could be supported in Brazil, and (ii) make available new unit emergy values that would enrich the existing emergy databases.

AB  - Zingiberene is an allelochemical found in wild Solanum species and plants resulting from crosses between these and S. lycopersicum. This sesquiterpene is known to reduce the performance of pest herbivores. Diabrotica speciosa has been identified as a potential tomato pest in important producing regions in Brazil, causing damage to leaves and fruits. Therefore, in this study, we investigated how zingiberene, found in advanced tomato genotypes, can affect the food preference, oviposition and longevity of South American corn rootworm, D. speciosa. The feeding behavior of adults was evaluated in bioassays with and without choice. Additionally, a damage scale for tomato plants was constructed to estimate consumption levels in each genotype. Longevity data and the number of eggs deposited on leaflets were obtained from females kept in cages and fed with tomato leaves from each genotype individually. High levels of zingiberene affected the host selection behavior for feeding and the number of eggs deposited by D. speciosa, so that high levels of the compound increased mortality and reduced adult oviposition, which implies the first record of the action of this compound on this insect. These results can guide breeding programs to obtain genotypes that express high levels of zingiberene, which will present greater resistance to the insect, reducing insecticide applications.

AB  - Each dietary analysis method has its own strengths and limitations and provides different perspectives for understanding the trophic biology of aquatic organisms. In this study, we used an integrative, multi-tool approach to comprehensively investigate the dietary differences of eight nominally herbivorous fishes from five feeding guilds in the Nansha Islands (N: 8 & DEG;51 & PRIME;10 & DEG;57', E: 112 & DEG;50 & PRIME;115 & DEG;35') of the South China Sea. The methods used in this study included 18S rDNA metabarcoding, standard gut content analysis, and stable isotope analysis. DNA metabarcoding revealed diverse algae categories (Ochrophyta, Rhodophyta, and Chlorophyta) in the gut contents of sampled fishes with high taxonomic resolution, and some microscopic and cryptic taxa, such as dinoflagellates and microinvertebrates, were precisely identified. The overlap of 95% prediction isotopic niche remained below 30% between different feeding guilds, and nearly 70% of the 107 genera detected in the gut contents were not shared by two or more fish species or feeding guilds. By combining stable isotope analysis and morphological identification with gut content metabarcoding, we found that the dietary overlap detected by metabarcodng between Ctenochaetus striatus and other fishes may be due to interference from debris of algae or other organisms. While each method has its own limitations in dietary analysis, our study suggests that an integrative, multi-tool approach can remedy the limitations of one method by utilizing the strengths of another. Our results indicate that a wide spectrum of resources on coral reefs could be utilized by different fish species in a complementary manner.

AB  - Wool (sheep) and cashmere (goat) fibres have unique biological, physical, and chemical properties and these fibres are becoming more important as the demand for natural products increases. However, these complex protein fibres are at times compromised by natural variability in their properties, and this can impact their use and value. Genetic improvement via selection and breeding can partly overcome this problem, enabling the farming of sheep and goats that produce more desirable fibre. This review explores the challenges in improving wool and cashmere fibre characteristics using genetics, with a focus on improving our understanding of the key protein components of fibres, wool keratins and keratin-associated proteins (KAPs). Despite progress in our knowledge of these proteins, gaining a better understanding of them and how they affect these fibres remains an ongoing challenge. This is not straight-forward, given the large number of similar yet unique genes that produce the proteins and the gaps that remain in their identification and characterisation. More research is required to clarify gene and protein sequence variability and the location and patterns of gene expression, which in turn limits our understanding of fibre growth and variation. Several aspects that currently hinder our progress in this quest include the incomplete identification of all the genes and weaknesses in the approaches used to characterise them, including newer omics technologies. We describe future research directions and challenges, including the need for ongoing gene identification, variation characterisation, and gene expression analysis and association studies to enable further improvement to these valuable natural fibres.

AB  - Inadequate management of solid organic waste can lead to the spread of diseases and negatively affects the environment. Fermentation and vermicomposting of organic waste could have dual benefits by generating earthworm biomass for a source of animal feed protein, and, at the same time, turning the organic waste into readily used compost. This study investigated the effect of an organic waste source (as a sole source or blended with others) totaling 24 media for the cultivation of the earthworm Eisenia foetida. Eight media sources were applied, namely cow manure, horse manure, goat manure, broiler chicken manure, market organic waste, household organic waste, rice straw, and beef rumen content. E. foetida was cultivated for 40 days, then the number of cocoons, earthworms, and the total biomass weight were measured at the end of the cultivation. Results demonstrated that the media source affected E. foetida earthworm cultivation. The most effective media were those containing horse manure that led to the production of the highest earthworms and the highest biomass. The produced cocoons and earthworms were poorly correlated with an r-value of 0.26 and p-value of 0.21. Meanwhile, the number and weight of the earthworms correlated well with an r-value of 0.784 and p-value of <0.01. However, the average numbers and weights of the produced earthworms in the media containing horse manure, cow manure, goat manure, and non-blended organic waste were insignificant. Overall results suggest that blended organic wastes can undergo composting to produce nutrient-rich earthworm biomass while turning the solid organic waste into readily used compost.

AB  - The detrimental effects of climate change require countries and regions to use green and low-carbon strategies as the basis for economic development. Agriculture and livestock industry have become among the main industries that emit greenhouse gases. Yongchang County is suitable for the development of large-scale livestock operations due to its unique geographical advantages. However, the potential effects of the carbon dioxide emissions and the environmental impact potential of various farming and animal husbandry farming models on human well-being need to be considered. The purpose of this paper is to use life cycle assessment (LCA) to comprehensively assess the carbon emissions and environmental impact of circular agriculture and livestock industry and to provide important decision support for the establishment of a low-carbon circular agriculture and animal husbandry model. It uses a 75 kg dairy sheep as a functional unit to combine a noncircular farming model (S1) and a circular farming model (S2). The degree of carbon emissions, environmental impact potential and human well-being environmental effects are compared. The results show that the carbon dioxide emission of S1 is 891.3 kg, while the emission of S2 is 647.3 kg, and the difference between the two is 244 kg. S2 has a lower global warming potential than the S1 model; hence, the S2 model, which uses biogas for power, has lower carbon emission than the S1 model. From the perspective of human well-being and environmental benefits, the S2 model of biogas power generation is a low carbon emission and high-benefit model. The biogas power generation model lays the foundation for the realization of the "peak carbon dioxide emissions" and "carbon neutralization" goal, strengthens ecological protection on the north side of the Qilian Mountains and improves human well-being in the region.

AB  - Mixed-species herbivory, along with prescribed fire, is one of the most effective ways of controlling woody plant encroachment in the southern Great Plains and comes with the added benefits of maintaining grazing efficiency and rangeland productivity. Despite its experimental stage success, most landowners in the southern Great Plains have not fully adopted mixed-species herbivory as a range management tool. This study aimed to understand the barriers to the adoption of mixed-species herbivory by soliciting information from rangeland owners in the southern Great Plain states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. We found that more than 40% of landowners in the southern Great Plains are not aware of mixed-species herbivory and < 10% of them have adopted the practice. Landowners who were previously aware of mixed-species herbivory were less likely to think that it provides lower returns compared with traditional grazing. Many landowners, however, reported a lack of sufficient infrastructure, labor, or equipment as barriers to adoption. We suggest that extension efforts and outreach campaigns focused on the needs and concerns of landowners can change perceptions around the effectiveness of mixed-species herbivory as a land management tool to enhance the resiliency of rangeland ecosystems in the southern Great Plains.

AB  - Many studies have focussed on niche differentiation at the population level to explain the coexistence of similar species. However, information on how individual-level processes across multidimensional niches shape community dynamics and species coexistence, especially for nocturnal, small and highly mobile animals, is limited. In this study, we employed a combination of metabarcoding and GPS tracking technologies to investigate the coexistence mechanisms between two sympatric bat species, Hipposideros armiger and H. pratti, by analysing individual niche responses to competition across temporal, spatial and dietary dimensions. Results showed that (1) traditional population-level analysis revealed no significant niche partitioning along single dimensions. However, (2) individual-level analyses uncovered sophisticated coexistence mechanisms through asymmetry responses to interspecific competition via temporal and dietary dimensions within limited habitat ranges. (3) This asymmetry response ensures stability of complementary relationships through coordinated interactions across three dimensions. (4) Intraspecific competition contributes to species asymmetry stabilization by modifying temporal activity patterns of both species, thereby reducing interspecific competition and facilitating coexistence. In conclusion, H. armiger and H. pratti achieved stable coexistence through coordinated responses across all three niche dimensions, with individuals demonstrating complementary patterns between dietary utilization and temporal activity, rather than single-dimensional partitioning. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how individual-level multidimensional niche adjustments and asymmetric competitive responses facilitate stable coexistence in sympatric species.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - We analyze fossil footprints and trackways from the middle to late Miocene Vinchina Formation of La Rioja Province, northwestern Argentina. Ichnofossils are preserved in floodplain deposits of anastomosing and meandering fluvial systems and in ephemeral lake facies deposited under arid and semi-arid conditions. The tridactyl ungulate tracks are assigned to the novel ichnotaxa, Macrauchenichnus troyana and Llastaya yesera. Based on comparisons with phylogenetic character states observable on the postcrania of functionally tridactyl ungulates, the trackmaker of M. troyana was a litoptern macraucheniid whereas early toxodontids produced L. yesera. Based on the isometric relationship of footprint area and body mass in modern unguligrade mammals, we propose body mass estimate for these extinct ungulates. Facies analysis of this fossil footprint assemblage reveals that this previously undocumented fauna inhabited mixed grassland-woodland ecosystems developed under warm and seasonal climates in mid-palaeolatitudes. Findings support the idea of a faunal link between high and low latitude ecosystems of South America during the middle to late Miocene.

AB  - One of the world's most recognizable domestic animals is the rabbit, domesticated from the European rabbit. Domestication can drive morphospace expansion into novel phenotypes not observed in their wild counterparts; the consequences of feralization are less understood. Through these processes, we examine how humans have inadvertently driven great morphological change in this species. Characterizing skull morphological variation in a global sample of 912 wild, feral and domesticated specimens, we show that both domestication and feralization of rabbits have resulted in novel morphologies that leverage evolutionary patterns ubiquitous in the leporid clade: allometry and facial tilt are the principal axes of variation in rabbits as seen across species of Leporidae. However, rabbits diversified into regions of morphospace not explored by other species of their family. Although feralization of rabbits cannot be regarded as a 'reversal' to the wild form, we found they occupy an intermediate position, as well as their own allometric trajectory. Such insights from human-induced and environmentally driven morphological change of domestics and feral animals, respectively, reveal how novel morphologies can evolve at the macroevolutionary level. Future studies may elucidate the evolutionary, functional and developmental drivers and constraints of the cranial patterns observed in the rabbit.

AB  - Chronic and acute stress differentially affect behavior as well as the structural integrity of the hippocampus, a key brain region involved in cognition and memory. However, it remains unclear if and how the facilitatory effects of acute stress on hippocampal information coding are disrupted as the stress becomes chronic. To examine this, we compared the impact of acute and chronic stress on neural activity in the CA1 subregion of male mice subjected to a chronic immobilization stress (CIS) paradigm. We observed that following first exposure to stress (acute stress), the spatial information encoded in the hippocampus sharpened, and the neurons became increasingly tuned to the underlying theta oscillations in the local field potential (LFP). However, following repeated exposure to the same stress (chronic stress), spatial tuning was poorer and the power of both the slow-gamma (30-50 Hz) and fast-gamma (55-90 Hz) oscillations, which correlate with excitatory inputs into the region, decreased. These results support the idea that acute and chronic stress differentially affect neural computations carried out by hippocampal circuits and suggest that acute stress may improve cognitive processing.

AB  - Simple Summary: With the rapid expansion of large-scale dairy goat farming in China, Saanen goats have become the preferred choice for farmers due to their strong reproductive capacity and high milk production. However, there is a lack of information on the growth and development patterns of the body and visceral organs. To our knowledge, this is the first report documenting the allometric growth of tissues and organs in Saanen dairy goats. This study not only explores developmental trajectories of dairy goats at this growing stage, helping to optimize feeding management strategies and feed formulation, but also provides a fundamental benchmark for developing comprehensive nutrient requirements for dairy goats. This study aimed to investigate the effect of feeding level on the growth and slaughter performance, and allometric growth of tissues and organs in female growing dairy goats. The trial included 10-20 and 20-30 kg weight stages with 48 female goat kids. The 24 goat kids in each stage were divided into 8 blocks based on weight, with 3 kids per block. Then, three kids from each block were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments, namely ad libitum (AL100), 70% of ad libitum (AL70), or 40% of ad libitum (AL40). The slaughter trial was conducted when the AL100 kids reached the target weight of 20 or 30 kg. The results showed that the ADG and feed conversion rate showed a linear decline as the feed level decreased (p < 0.05). Compared with the AL70 and AL100 groups, the AL40 group exhibited lower shrunk body weight, empty body weight, hot carcass weight, net meat rate, carcass meat rate, and visceral fat weight (p < 0.05) in both stages. Moreover, the AL40 group showed lower weights for skin and mohair, blood, rumen, small intestine, large intestine, mammary gland, and uterus than the AL70 and AL100 groups (p < 0.05) in both stages. However, feeding level did not affect organ indices in the two stages (p > 0.05). The bone, skin and mohair were isometric (b approximate to 1), but the muscle, visceral fat, and most internal organs were positive (b > 1) in both stages. In conclusion, feeding level affects the growth and development of dairy goats, which vary depending on the body weight stage and specific tissues and organs.

AB  - We examined the extent that hunters' perceptions of risks related to chronic wasting disease (CWD) and trust in state wildlife agencies to address CWD were related to their demographic (sex, age, education, residence) and hunting (CWD presence, type of hunter, years hunting in state, harvest) characteristics. Demographic and hunting characteristics have been suggested by some managers and researchers to be strongly related to perceived risks and trust in wildlife agencies. We obtained data from a mail survey (n = 9,567) of hunters in 8 states (2004). Demographic and hunting characteristics were statistically related to both risk and trust, but the relationships were complex for several reasons. First, although the demographic variables were significantly related to both risk and trust in 11 of the 15 tests, almost all of the effect sizes (eta) were minimal ((X) over bar = 0.051). For the hunting characteristics, 11 of the 12 tests were significant (P <= 0.038), but the average effect size was only 0.059. Second, hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that although 65% of the beta coefficients (another effect size indicator) were significant (P < 0.001), the average standardized regression coefficient was only 0.066 (minimal). Third, not all demographic and hunting characteristics were related to risk and trust in the same manner. For example, in the regression models, sex was never statistically significant. Other variables (resident of the state, education, harvest) were always significant. Finally, all R-2 (explained variance) were <5%. The weak relationships between demographic and hunting characteristics and both risk and trust suggest that managers should be cautious when targeting communication messages about CWD to specific subgroups of hunters based on these characteristics.

AB  - Although artificial insemination in pig production is widespread, many farms rely on natural mating (NM). For NM to be successful, adequate sexual behaviour and a sufficient libido level in boars is crucial for appropriate reproductive performance. Therefore, this observational study evaluated the libido level of 59 boars of different breeds used for NM by a scoring system ranging from 0 (no libido) to a maximum of 23 points (perfect libido) and analysed their general and andrological health as well as housing and management factors influencing the libido.
   The boars showed a mean libido score of 16.7 (SD +/- 2.3). Crossbreed (median: 17.5, min: 14.0, max: 21.0) (p < 0.01) and Landrace (median: 17.5, min: 17.0, max: 21.0) (p < 0.05) boars showed significantly higher libido scores compared to Pie?train boars (median: 14.0, min: 13.0, max: 17.0). A non-slippery mating area was found to be positively associated with libido (p < 0.05), whereas disorders such as lameness showed a negative correlation (p < 0.01). In winter, significantly higher libido values (median: 17.0, min: 14.0, max: 21.0) were recorded compared to spring (median: 16.0, min: 11.0, max: 21.0) (p < 0.05). In addition, high number of supports by farmers during natural mating and frequency of use for NM and for stimulation of artificially inseminated sows did not negatively influence the libido score. No significant correlation between the satisfaction of the farmer about the libido level of the boars and the evaluated libido score was detected.
   This is the first study investigating the effect of housing conditions and management procedures on the libido of boars used for NM under field conditions. The findings may therefore help to establish a successful mating management for herds applying NM on a regular basis. A systematic evaluation of the libido score is needed to detected boars with low libido levels, because it is often overlooked by the farmers. Moreover, genetics, general health condition and flooring in mating areas turned out to be critical parameters that influence the libido score of boars used for NM and therefore should be considered when examining natural mating on farm.

AB  - The experiment was performed on 20 male Alpine goat kids that were weaned at 30 +/- 3 days of age, and were divided into a control group (C, n=10) and an experimental group (E, n=10). During a 60-day rearing period, all animals were fed identical diets composed of milk replacer, supplementary feed mix and haylage. The diet for group E was supplemented with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) in the amount of 50 mg/kg body weight. The kids were slaughtered at 90 +/- 3 days of age. Carcass quality was evaluated, and the chemical composition, physicochemical parameters, and sensory attributes of the quadriceps femoris muscle (musculus quadriceps femoris) were determined. It was found that group E animals were characterized by higher (p <= 0.05) values of live weight at slaughter, warm carcass weight, weights of the neck, middle neck, and flank with ribs, as well as higher (p <= 0.05) values of leg length, loin eye height and area. An analysis of meat quality revealed that meat from kids administered HMB was characterized by lower (p <= 0.05) water-holding capacity, and lower (p <= 0.05) juiciness and tenderness, as confirmed by shear force values. In comparison with group C, the intramuscular fat of group E kids had a lower (p <= 0.05) content of linolenic acid and a higher (p <= 0.05) content of eicosapentaenoic acid. The results of this study indicate that HMB dietary supplementation has a positive effect on increasing the body weight and thus the carcass weight and improves some carcass quality indicators of kids.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aims to explore whether drinking heated water is able to increase the performance of yak calves. We collected and analyzed data from a two-month experiment on yak calves. The results show that compared with drinking cold water, drinking heated water significantly improved the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and ruminal fermentation function. In addition, we found that heated water significantly improved the immune function of the body through serum indexes, and the nutrients in the blood were significantly increased compared with cold water. Furthermore, the serum hormones were also changed by heated water, with higher levels of hormones related to growth. Overall, drinking heated water in the cold season could increase the performance of yak calves in terms of better ATTD, ruminal function and immunity. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of heated water intake on the growth performance, serum biochemical indexes, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and ruminal fermentation function of yak calves in winter. A total of 24 yaks (59.09 & PLUSMN; 3.181 kg) were randomly selected and divided into a cold water (fluctuated with the temperature of test sites at 0-10 & DEG;C) group (CW) (58.58 & PLUSMN; 3.592 kg) and a heated water (20 & DEG;C) group (HW) (59.61 & PLUSMN; 2.772 kg). After 2 months of the experiment, body weight, serum biochemical indexes, ruminal fermentation characteristics and ATTD were measured. The results showed that drinking heated water increased (p < 0.05) the total weight gain and average daily gain of yaks compared with those drinking cold water. Heated water increased (p < 0.05) the levels of immune globulin M, interleukin-6, triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine and growth hormone compared with cold water. In addition, yaks drinking heated water showed higher (p < 0.05) ATTD of crude protein and ether extract, as well as increased (p < 0.05) content of total protein, albumin and urea nitrogen in serum than those drinking cold water. Compared with cold water, heated water showed increased (p < 0.05) total volatile fatty acids, acetic acid and propionic acid, and a reduced (p < 0.05) acetic acid to propionic acid ratio (p < 0.05). In conclusion, drinking heated water at 20 & DEG;C could improve performance via increasing nutrient digestibility and ruminal fermentation function in yak calves.

AB  - Sperm infertility or subfertility is detrimental to the precious highland germplasm like yak whose population has been gradually declining in India. Understanding the 'omic' landscape of infertile or subfertile yak sperm can reveal some interesting insights. In an attempt to do the same, this study considered the semen of infertile or subfertile yak bulls for whole-genome and transcriptome evaluations. DNA sequencing revealed that the yak sperm genome contains the necessary genes to carry out all the important biological processes related to the growth, development, survival and multiplication of an organism. Interestingly, RNA Seq results highlighted that genes like VAMP7, MYLK, ARAP2 and MARCH6 showed increased expression, while biological processes related to immune response (GO:0043308, GO:0002447, GO:0002278, GO:0043307, GO:0043312, GO:0002283, GO:0043299 and GO:0002446) were significantly overrepresented. These findings hint at a possible role played by immune system in regulating infertility or subfertility in yaks. Further, in-depth studies can validate these findings and help in improving our biological understanding in this area.

AB  - The silver pomfret (Pampus argenteus) is a commercially valuable marine fish species in China. Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae (PDD) is an opportunistic pathogen in aquaculture environments and has become a serious bacterial pathogen of the aquacultural industry in recent years. In this study, two functional fragments originated from histone-derived peptides (H2A and H4) of the silver pomfret, and were identified and designated as spH2A.2 and spH4. In addition, the full-length cDNA of H2A from silver pomfret (SPH2A) consists of 387 base pairs (bp) coding sequence (CDS) that encodes 128 amino acids (aa), while the full-length cDNA of SPH4 consists of 312 bp CDS and encodes 103 aa. Tissue distribution analysis showed that SPH2A had a higher expression pattern in the head kidney and intestine, while SPH4 was mainly expressed in the spleen. After PDD infection, both histone gene expression levels were significant upregulated at 1 day post-infection (dpi) (P < 0.01) in the liver. Furthermore, spH4 and spH2A.2 peptides had potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, with the MIC value ranging from 24 to 95 <mu>M and 66-133 mu M, respectively. Cytotoxicity of spH4 and spH2A.2 was tested in silver pomfret primary cells (liver, spleen and head kidney), and the results showed that spH4 had no cytotoxicity, while spH2A.2 displayed cytotoxic activity on silver pomfret cells. Additionally, scanning electronic microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that spH4 and spH2A.2 could destroy the PDD cell wall structure. Overall, the spH4 and spH2A.2 peptides were likely prone to exert the antimicrobial activity and may be useful to defend against PDD in silver pomfret aquaculture.

AB  - The adaptive nature of the galler habit has been tentatively explained by the nutrition, microenvironment, and enemy hypotheses. Soil attributes have direct relationships with these three hypotheses at the cellular and macroecological scales, but their influence has been restricted previously to effects on the nutritional status of the host plant on gall richness and abundance. Herein, we discuss the ionome patterns within gall tissues and their significance for gall development, physiology, structure, and for the nutrition of the gallers. Previous ecological and chemical quantification focused extensively on nitrogen and carbon contents, evoking the carbon-nutrient defence hypothesis as an explanation for establishing the plant-gall interaction. Different elements are involved in cell wall composition dynamics, antioxidant activity, and regulation of plant-gall water dynamics. An overview of the different soil-plant-gall relationships highlights the complexity of the nutritional requirements of gallers, which are strongly influenced by environmental soil traits. Soil and plant chemical profiles interact to determine the outcome of plant-herbivore interactions and need to be addressed by considering not only the soil features and galler nutrition but also the host plant's physiological traits. The quantitative and qualitative results for iron metabolism in gall tissues, as well as the roles of iron as an essential element in the physiology and reproduction of gallers suggest that it may represent a key nutritional resource, aligning with the nutrition hypothesis, and providing an integrative explanation for higher gall diversity in iron-rich soils.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to investigate boar-to-boar variations in the quality characteristics of sperm from the sperm-rich fractions (SRFs) and whole ejaculates (WEs) following freezing-thawing. Several sperm attributes, such as motility patterns analyzed by the computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system, mitochondrial function, membrane integrity, and DNA fragmentation were used to compare the cryo-survival of sperm from SRFs and WEs from boars with good and poor semen freezability (GSF and PSF, respectively). In this study, boars with post-thaw total motility (TMOT) more than 30% (>30%) were classified as having GSF, while those with post-thaw TMOT less than 30% (<30%) were classified as having PSF. Principal component analysis 1 (PCA1), which is the main component of the sample variation, explained approximately 75% of the variance between the GSF and PSF groups, reaffirming the reliability of post-thaw TMOT as a reliable criterion used to classify the animals. Most of the post-thaw sperm parameters of the SRFs and WEs were positively correlated. Furthermore, scatter plot analyses show stronger relationships between the analyzed post-thaw parameters of the frozen-thawed (FT) sperm of SRFs than those of WEs. Individual boar variations or the sperm source had marked effects on the quality characteristics of FT sperm. The higher TMOT, velocity straight line (VSL), and velocity average path (VAP) of FT sperm were more enhanced in the SRFs compared with the WEs of the PSF group. Furthermore, the mitochondrial function, membrane integrity, and DNA fragmentation of FT sperm were markedly higher in the SRFs than in the WEs, particularly for the poor freezability boars. We suggest that the freezability potential of sperm of the GSF group does not differ significantly between the SRFs and WEs, reaffirming that boar variability is an important factor that affects the cryo-survival of sperm.

AB  - In Abashiri, Hokkaido, northern Japan, composted sewage sludge (CSS) containing a large amount of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) is used as fertilizer in agriculture. The local environmental risks of Cu and Zn from such organic fertilizers were studied. The study area, especially the brackish lakes located near the farmlands, is important for inland fisheries. The risks posed by heavy metals to the brackish-water bivalve, Corbicula japonica, was therefore investigated as an ex-ample. First, the long-term effect of CSS application in agricultural fields was monitored. Second, using pot cultivation, factors influencing Cu and Zn availability in the presence of organic fertilizers were evaluated under different scenarios of SOM content. In addition, the mobility and availability of Cu and Zn in organic fertilizers were evaluated in a field experiment. In the pot cultivation, both organic and chemical fertilizers increased the availability of Cu and Zn with a decrease in pH, possibly caused by nitrification. However, this decrease in pH was inhibited by higher SOM content, i.e. SOM mitigated the heavy metal risk from organic fertilizer. In the field experiment, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) was cultivated using CSS and pig manure (PM). As observed in the pot cultivation, the applied chemical and organic fertilizers increased the soil-soluble and 0.1 N HCl-extractable Zn with increased nitrate. Considering the habitat and the LC50 values of C. japonica that were lower than the concentration of Cu and Zn in the soil solution phase, there is no significant risk from heavy metals in the organic fertilizers. However, the Kd values for Zn were significantly lower for CSS or the PM-applied plot in the field experiment soil, indicating a higher Zn desorption rate from organi-cally fertilized soil particles. The potential risk of heavy metals from agricultural lands under changing climate condi-tions must therefore be monitored carefully.
