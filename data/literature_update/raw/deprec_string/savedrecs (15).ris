AB  - Measuring ammonia inside livestock buildings poses many challenges that hinder the incorporation of this variable into environmental control systems. The aim of this study was to measure various microclimate variables inside a weaned piglet building and analyse their interactions with NH3 concentrations for setpoint temperatures of 26 and 25 & DEG;C, in order to control NH3 concentrations based on other easily measurable variables. The experimental test was conducted on a conventional farm in Northwest Spain. NH3 concentrations in the animal zone were best correlated with CO2 concentrations in the animal zone (R = 0.91 and R = 0.55) and velocity of air extracted through the fan (R = 0.72 and R = 0.65) for setpoint temperatures of 26 and 25 & DEG;C, respectively. Similarly, strong correlations were found with relative humidity in the animal zone and temperature of inlet air. Because NH3 concentration in the animal zone is related to the performance of the ventilation system, strong positive correlations were found between NH3 concentration and temperature of inlet air whereas negative correlations were found between NH3 concentration and ventilation rates. Linear regression models based on CO2 concentrations in the animal zone and temperature of inlet air are recommended, because they provide a good fit for both setpoint temperatures using variables that can be readily measured.</p>

AB  - Hydrological forecasting is of great importance for water resources management and planning, especially given the increasing occurrence of extreme events such as floods and droughts. The physics-informed machine learning (PIML) models effectively integrate conceptual hydrologic models with machine learning (ML) models. In this process, the intermediate variables of PIML models serve as bridges between inputs and outputs, while the impact of intermediate variables on the performance of PIML models remains unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, this study aims to encompass the construction of PIML models based on various hydrologic models, conduct comparative analyses of different intermediate variables based on a case study of 205 CAMELS basins, and further explore the relationship between the performance of PIML models and catchment characteristics. The optimal ML model for constructing PIML is first selected among four ML models within the 205 basins. The PIML models are then developed based on five monthly water balance models, namely TM, XM, MEP, SLM, and TVGM. To quantify the potential impact of difference in intermediate variables, two sets of experiments are further designed and performed, namely S1 with actual evapotranspiration as the intermediate variable and S2 with soil moisture as the intermediate variable. Results show that five PIML models generally outperformed the optimal standalone ML models, i.e., the Lasso model. Specifically, regardless of the choice of intermediate variables, the PIML-XM model consistently outperformed the other models within the same basins. Almost all constructed PIML models are affected by the intermediate variables in monthly runoff simulations. Typically, S1 exhibited better performance compared to S2. A greater impact of aridity index, forest fraction, and catchment area on model performance is observed in S2. These findings improve our understanding of constructing PIML models in hydrology by emphasizing their excellent performance in runoff simulations and highlighting the importance of intermediate variables.

AB  - Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a popular dietary strategy whereby daily food intake is limited to a < 12h window. As little is known about the effects of TRF on cognitive and behavioral measures, the present study examined the effects of time-restricted (8h/day; zeitgeber time [ZT]12-20) or continuous access to a high-fat, high-sugar cafeteria-style diet (Caf; Caf and Caf-TRF groups; n = 12 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats) or standard chow (Chow and ChowTRF groups) on short-term memory, anxiety-like behavior, adiposity and gut microbiota composition over 13-weeks with daily food intake measures. TRF significantly reduced daily energy intake in Caf- but not chow-fed groups. In Caf-fed groups, TRF reduced the proportion of energy derived from sugar while increasing that derived from protein. Caf diet significantly increased weight gain, adiposity and fasting glucose within 4 weeks; TRF partially reduced these effects. Caf diet increased anxiety-like behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze in week 3 but not week 12, and impaired hippocampal-dependent place recognition memory in week 11; neither measure was affected by TRF. Global microbiota composition differed markedly between chow and Caf groups, with a small effect of TRF in rats fed chow. In both chow and Caf diet groups, TRF reduced microbiota alpha diversity measures of Shannon diversity and evenness relative to continuous access. Results indicate only limited benefits of TRF access to an obesogenic diet under these conditions, suggesting that more severe time restriction may be required to offset adverse metabolic and cognitive effects when using highly palatable diets.

AB  - Background The Canadian prairie ecosystem presents a rich source of natural products from plants that are subjected to herbivory by grazing mammals. This type of ecological competition may contribute to the production of natural products of interest in cell biology and medical research. We provide the first biological description of the sesquiterpene lactone, pulchelloid A, which we isolated from the prairie plant, Gaillardia aristata (Asteraceae) and report that it inhibits mitosis in human cells. Methods and results We found that G. aristata (Blanket flower) extracts were cytotoxic to human cell lines and used phenotypic assays to characterize the bioactivity of extracts. Before dying, cells were characterized by a rounded morphology, phospho-histone H3 signals, mitotic spindles, and active Cdk1. By biology-guided fractionation of Gaillardia extracts, we isolated a sesquiterpene lactone named pulchelloid A. We used immunofluorescence microscopy and observed that cells treated with pulchelloid A have phospho-histone H3 positive chromosomes and a mitotic spindle, confirming that they were in mitosis. Treated cells arrest with an unusual phenotype; they enter a prolonged mitotic arrest in which the spindles become multipolar and the chromosomes acquire histone gamma H2AX foci, a hallmark of damaged DNA. Conclusions We propose that pulchelloid A, a natural product present in the prairie plant Gaillardia aristata, delays cells in mitosis. There is a growing body of evidence that a small number of members of the sesquiterpene lactone chemical family may target proteins that regulate mitosis.

AB  - The cough-suppressing effect of honey was demonstrated for the first time using a guinea pig model whereby cough was induced by citric acid and capsaicin, and a new pyrrolyl pyridoindole, 1-(5-(hydroxymethyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-carboxylic acid (1), named melpyrrole, and flazin (2) were identified as the active principle components. The structures of 1 and 2 were estimated using a combination approach of an activity-guided survey and LC-MS/MS multivariate analysis and were finally established by total synthesis of 1 and comparison with an authentic standard for 2. Both compounds showed antitussive activity comparable to that of dextromethorphan in guinea pigs. Their antitussive effects were unaffected by an opioid antagonist and reversed by a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, indicating that these natural products do not act directly on opiate receptors but through the NO signaling pathway.

AB  - Effective treatment for cognitive dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is lacking in clinical practice. Increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in cognitive circuits can significantly alleviate cognitive dysfunction in animal models of TBI. Selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6 (5-HT6R) agonists significantly increase BDNF expression and improve cognitive function. Therefore, we evaluated the protective effect of a highly selective 5-HT6R agonist, WAY-181187, on cognitive dysfunction after TBI. We established a controlled cortical impact model of moderate TBI in rats and performed drug intervention for five consecutive days. Rats had spatial reference memory impairment in the Morris water maze one and four weeks after TBI. BDNF expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus decreased two and five weeks after TBI. Additionally, five weeks after TBI, decreases in neuronal dendritic spine density and the proportion of thin, mushroom-shaped dendritic spines and an increased proportion of stubby-type dendritic spines were observed. WAY-181187 administration (3 mg/kg) for five consecutive days after TBI significantly alleviated cognitive dysfunction at one and four weeks (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01), upregulated BDNF expression in the mPFC and hippocampus at two (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05) and five (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001) weeks and increased the dendritic spine density and the proportions of thin, mushroom-shaped dendrites in the mPFC (P < 0.05, P < 0.001 and P < 0.01) and hippocampus (P < 0.05, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) at five weeks after TBI. Our results confirm that WAY-181187 administration (3 mg/kg) in the acute phase alleviated cognitive dysfunction after TBI, possibly by upregulating BDNF expression in the mPFC and hippocampus, enhancing neuroplasticity.

AB  - Here, we investigated the impact of different turning frequency (TF) on dynamic changes of N fractions, NH3 emission and bacterial/archaeal community during chicken manure composting. Compared to higher TF (i.e., turning every 1 or 3 days in CMS1 or CMS3 treatments, respectively), lower TF (i.e., turning every 5 or 7 days in CMS5 or CMS7 treatments, respectively) decreased NH3 emission by 11.42-18.95%. Compared with CMS1, CMS3 and CMS7 treatments, the total nitrogen loss of CMS5 decreased by 38.03%, 17.06% and 24.76%, respectively. Ammonia oxidizing bacterial/archaeal (AOB/AOA) communities analysis revealed that the relative abundance of Nitrosospira and Nitrososphaera was higher in lower TF treatment during the thermophilic and cooling stages, which could contribute to the reduction of NH3 emission. Thus, different TF had a great influence on NH3 emission and microbial community during composting. It is practically feasible to increase the abundance of AOB/AOA through adjusting TF and reduce NH3 emission the loss of nitrogen during chicken manure composting.

AB  - Italian pigs for slaughter weigh between 150 and 170 kg, and their breeding is strictly regulated by the Protected Designation of Origin. Intensive production raises environmental concerns, in particular, nitrogen (N) emissions. To address these issues, low-crude-protein diet strategies have been proposed. However, few experiments have tested the effects of very low crude protein levels on performance and nitrogen efficiency, above all, in heavy pigs. The aim of our study was to explore new feeding solutions, compared to traditional ones, in accordance with PDO regulations, from 50 kg live weight to slaughtering: (1) traditional diet based on soy and maize; (2) iso-protein diet protein that is pea-based; and (3) low-crude-protein (-24.5% vs. C and T1 diets) diet that is cereal-based. Our results show that the use of different protein sources and the very low crude protein levels did not influence the technical efficiency and quality parameters; instead, a highly significant difference (p < 0.01) was recorded in the nitrogen efficiency of the cereal-based diet both in terms of nitrogen excretion and efficiency, achieving -28% and +21%, respectively.

AB  - An option for ecological engineers is to increase the yield of the agroecosystem with the reuse of nitrogen through the application of vermicomposting with Eisenia fetida prepared by using crop residues and wetlands plants jointly. The experiment was designed considering recycling and reuse of the agricultural crop (Zea mays) residues and wetland plants (Canna indica, Cyperus alternifolius, Acorus calamus, and Hydrocotyle vulgaris) and pig manure found in the Sichuan Basin, China. A total of fourteen treatments (V1-V14) were prepared, and the experiment for V1 to V4 treatments was setup in cemented plots, and separate experiments were set-up for V5-V8 and V9-V14 in containers for three months (September to December 2017). The amount of total nitrogen (TN) improved in all the treatments (V1-V14) throughout the experimental period of 90 days. In case of group 1, considering major parameters like TOC, C:N ratio and TN, combination of Zea mays and Canna indica (V3) can be regarded as most suitable combination for vermicomposting. In the second group, V6 treatment [(Cyperus alternifolius (60%): Pig manure (40%)] was found to be suitable based on TN recovery. The mixture of combined Zea mays (50%), Cyperus alternifolius (5%), Acorus calamus (5%) and pig manure (V13) increased 76% TN and can be regarded as best in group 3 based on percent change. Results indicated that ditch plants and crop residues could be used as substrates in vermicomposting for nutrient recovery.

AB  - The pineal gland regulates the aging process via the hormone melatonin. The present report aims to evaluate the effect of pinealectomy (pin) on behavioral and oxidative stress-induced alterations in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (SM) levels in young adult, mature and aging rats. Sham and pin rats aged 3, 14 and 18 months were tested in behavioral tests for motor activity, anxiety, and depression. The ELISA test explored oxidative stress parameters and SM in the hippocampus, while total cholesterol was measured in serum via a commercial autoanalyzer. Mature and aged sham rats showed low motor activity and increased anxiety compared to the youngest rats. Pinealectomy affected emotional responses, induced depressive-like behavior, and elevated cholesterol levels in the youngest rats. However, removal of the pineal gland enhanced oxidative stress by diminishing antioxidant capacity and increasing the MDA level, and decreased SM level in the hippocampus of 14-month-old rats. Our findings suggest that young adult rats are vulnerable to emotional disturbance and changes in cholesterol levels resulting from melatonin deficiency. In contrast, mature rats with pinealectomy are exposed to an oxidative stress-induced decrease in SM levels in the hippocampus.

AB  - Due to their advantageous nutrient composition and high feed conversion efficiency, insects may be an alternative protein source for human and animal nutrition. Recently authorised for feeding purposes in the European Union, silkworm pupae are vastly and cheaply available by- products from sericulture that have been successfully replacing fish meal in aquaculture feed. In order to enable silkworm detection by official control, we firstly identified potential, easily detectable peptide targets from dried silkworm pupae subjected to a standard mass spectrometry (MS)-based bottom-up proteomic workflow. Secondly, a targeted method with an optional immunoaffinity enrichment (IAE) step was developed. Method validation provided a highly reproducible limit of detection of 0.05% (w/w) silkworm pupae in various feeds (aquaculture, poultry, pig) that proved independent from the experimenter and whether IAE was included in sample preparation or not. Furthermore, the method ' s specificity and robustness were assessed.

AB  - C. vulgaris has a positive effect on the removal of nutrients from pig farm biogas slurry. However, swine wastewater often contains heavy metal ions, such as Cu (II), which may have impacts on the nutrient removal performance of C. vulgaris. Additionally, the heavy metal ions in wastewater can be adsorbed by microalgae. In this study, the stress effect of Cu (II) on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris, the Cu (II) removal by microalgae, and the effect of different concentrations of Cu (II) on the nutrient removal efficiency of C. vulgaris in biogas slurries were explored. The results showed that the microalgae biomass of microalgae on the sixth day of the experiment was the highest in the treatment with a Cu (II) concentration of 0.5 mg/L, which was 30.1% higher than that of the 2.5 mg/L group. C. vulgaris had higher removal efficiencies of Cu (II) at a Cu (II) concentration of 0.1 similar to 1.5 mg/L. The-OH, C=O, -COOH, and C-O groups on the surface of the algal cells play a significant role in the removal of Cu (II). The removal rates of COD, NH3-N, TN, and TP by C. vulgaris at a Cu (II) concentration of 0.5 mg/L were the highest, which were 89.0%, 53.7%, 69.6%, and 47.3%, respectively.

AB  - In recent years, the demand of people for medicinal and aromatic plants has dramatically increased. For this reason, a large number of researches are being conducted to make these plants more quality. In this sense, this study explored the effects of domestic peat, bat guano, chicken and sheep manures, and vermicompost on the growth, quality traits, and nutrient contents of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.). For this purpose, an experiment in greenhouse conditions was arranged in a completely randomized design with four replications. The treatments included control (100% Peat/Perlite) and three doses (2%, 4%, 6%) for each of four organic manures. In total, there were 13 treatments. The study showed that there were significant differences among treatments for aesthetic appearance score, height, and fresh and dry weights of plants with the exception of crown width. Control and "94% Peat/Perlite + 6% Bat guano" had the lowest and highest values of all growth and quality traits. Overall, it concluded that "94% Peat/Perlite + 6% Bat guano" should be used in planting basil. Further studies including different organic manures and their combinations are required to obtain better growth and quality traits as well as physiological traits of basil.

AB  - Simple Summary In the different livestock production systems, forage is the main feed resource. However, the availability and quality of the forage fluctuate throughout the year due to variable environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, location, or lack of rainfall. In semiarid regions, this fact is even more critical. The option for forage plants adapted to the semiarid climate, such as cactus cladodes, becomes indispensable for the sustainability of the systems. Nonetheless, it is necessary to combine the cactus with high-fiber-content feeds (silage, hay, and agroindustry residues, among others) to increase fiber contents in the diet to promote ideal rumen conditions. Based on the knowledge that cactus cladodes (Opuntia spp. and Nopalea spp.) are one of the most viable crops in semiarid regions, the association with a by-product rich in NDF proves to be a more feasible alternative in terms of price and availability, with the producer making the final decision. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the cactus cladodes Nopalea cochenillifera (L). Salm-Dyck. (NUB) and cactus cladodes Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw. (OUB), both combined with sugarcane bagasse (SB) plus urea, Tifton hay (TH), corn silage (CS), and sorghum silage (SS) plus urea on nutrient intake and digestibility, ruminal dynamics, and parameters. Five male sheep, fistulated in the rumen, were assigned in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. The NUB provided a higher intake of dry matter (DM) and any nutrients than SS. TH provided larger pools of DM and iNDF. The OUB and CS provided a higher DM degradation. CS provided a higher NDF degradation rate. OUB provided a lower ruminal pH. Depending on the collection time, the lowest pH value was estimated at 3.79 h after the morning feeding. There was an interaction between treatments and collection time on VFA concentrations. Due to the high degradation rate, greater energy intake, less change in rumen pH, greater volatile fatty acid production, and feasibility, we recommend using cactus associated with sugarcane bagasse plus urea in sheep diets.

AB  - Due to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, antibiotic residues accumulate in natural environments, leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs). The presence of ARBs in bodies of water poses health hazards to the surrounding community. This study focused on Laguna Lake, the largest lake in the Philippines, which serves as a water source for agriculture and domestic purposes. We aimed to detect the presence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli from the lake waters and potential reservoirs of resistance as well as determine the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indices of the isolates. E. coli (n = 450) was isolated from fecal-associated samples (chicken, cow, pig, human, sewage) and water samples (sites in Laguna Lake and selected river tributaries). The isolates were subjected to an antibiotic resistance assay using VITEK 2 (R). Among the 16 antibiotics tested, the isolates exhibited varying resistance to 14, but complete susceptibility to amikacin and tigecycline was observed. Isolates were most frequently resistant to ampicillin (196/450, 43.6%). Among fecal-associated samples, chicken isolates exhibited the highest MAR index (0.174), whereas samples from Pila River exhibited the highest MAR index (0.152) among water samples. The results of this study demonstrate the presence of multidrug-resistant E. coli in samples collected around Laguna Lake and reveal fecal and sewage sources as potential reservoirs of ARBs in the water body. With this information, the public is urged to use antibiotics responsibly to help mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - To evaluate the potential suitability of x-ray irradiation as a physical control method for invasive Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB) (Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus 1758; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), either through sterile insect technique (SIT) or through direct irradiation of naturally infested materials in the field, we recorded longevity of eggs, larval and adult life stages of CRB irradiated with different doses of x-rays emitted from a tube energized at 92 kV. Eggs and larvae were highly susceptible to radiation at all tested doses (down to about 2-5 Gy), though adults required larger doses (at least 50 Gy) to render them incapable of reproducing. At exposures near 50 Gy sterilized adults nevertheless were observed to survive for more than a month, suggesting SIT may be a viable control approach for this beetle. Similarly, these results may facilitate the discovery of hidden breeding sites in the wild by tagging and releasing sterilized adults. While larvae were highly susceptible to x-ray irradiation, irradiation would probably not be an effective tool for field control due to rapid attenuation of radiation energy (exponential decay coefficients ranging from about 0.3-0.6 cm(-1)) in the organic nesting materials we tested, and the tendency for CRB adults to burrow and oviposit deep in mulch (1 m or more).

AB  - Unlike monogastric animals, ruminants exhibit significantly lower starch digestibility in the small intestine. A better understanding of the physiological mechanisms that regulate digestion patterns in ruminants could lead to an increased use of starch concentrates. Here we show more robust pancreatic exocrine function in adult goats (AG) than in neonatal goats (NG) by combining scRNA-seq and proteomic analysis. Our findings suggest that inadequate amylase activity could be a limiting factor in starch digestion in ruminants. In addition, we show that insufficient starch hydrolysis in adult goats might be associated with low expression of a CCKBR receptor in the acinar cells. On top of that, the low expression of CCKBR in adult goats, in conjunction with a low distribution of the CCK-I cells in the duodenum, may jointly lead to a slow response of the intestinal-pancreatic reflex and induce an asynchronous process of food entering the small intestine and releasing of digestive enzymes, which ultimately limits the starch digestibility. Overall, the present findings generate a resource that can provide better insight into the mammalian pancreas.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a hypermnesic condition that develops in a subset of individuals following exposure to severe trauma. PTSD symptoms are debilitating, and include increased anxiety, abnormal threat generalization, and impaired extinction. In developing treatment strategies for PTSD, preclinical studies in rodents have largely focused on interventions that target post-encoding memory processes such as reconsolidation and extinction. Instead, here we focus on forgetting, another post-encoding process that regulates memory expression. Using a double trauma murine model for PTSD, we asked whether promoting neurogenesis-mediated forgetting can weaken trauma memories and associated PTSD-relevant behavioral phenotypes. In the double trauma paradigm, consecutive aversive experiences lead to a constellation of behavioral phenotypes associated with PTSD including increases in anxiety-like behavior, abnormal threat generalization, and deficient extinction. We found that post-training interventions that elevate hippocampal neurogenesis weakened the original trauma memory and decreased these PTSD-relevant phenotypes. These effects were observed using multiple methods to manipulate hippocampal neurogenesis, including interventions restricted to neural progenitor cells that selectively promoted integration of adult-generated granule cells into hippocampal circuits. The same interventions also weakened cocaine place preference memories, suggesting that promoting hippocampal neurogenesis may represent a broadly useful approach in hypermnesic conditions such as PTSD and substance abuse disorders.

AB  - Resource selection functions (RSFs) are among the most commonly used statistical tools in both basic and applied animal ecology. They are typically parameterized using animal tracking data, and advances in animal tracking technology have led to increasing levels of autocorrelation between locations in such data sets. Because RSFs assume that data are independent and identically distributed, such autocorrelation can cause misleadingly narrow confidence intervals and biased parameter estimates. Data thinning, generalized estimating equations and step selection functions (SSFs) have been suggested as techniques for mitigating the statistical problems posed by autocorrelation, but these approaches have notable limitations that include statistical inefficiency, unclear or arbitrary targets for adequate levels of statistical independence, constraints in input data and (in the case of SSFs) scale-dependent inference. To remedy these problems, we introduce a method for likelihood weighting of animal locations to mitigate the negative consequences of autocorrelation on RSFs. In this study, we demonstrate that this method weights each observed location in an animal's movement track according to its level of non-independence, expanding confidence intervals and reducing bias that can arise when there are missing data in the movement track. Ecologists and conservation biologists can use this method to improve the quality of inferences derived from RSFs. We also provide a complete, annotated analytical workflow to help new users apply our method to their own animal tracking data using the ctmm R package.

AB  - Simple Summary Arion vulgaris has become a major invasive pest slug in Europe, causing extensive damage to many crops. To control this pest, the use of chemical molluscicides remains the most important. However, despite the proved efficacy, they still have detrimental environmental effects. We performed two double-replicated laboratory studies testing molluscicide pellets with metaldehyde (3% and 5%) and iron phosphate (1%) and found the reluctance of slugs to eat a full lethal dose regardless of whether the poison is stronger or weaker. As a consequence, slugs remain alive and only reduce their herbivory by half; the remaining granules or their parts are the main source of toxic effects of molluscicides in the environment. Moreover, a higher metaldehyde content of the pellets does not lead to lower herbivory. The results showed that a new application of molluscicides could be useful; the application rate should be decreased according to the ability of slugs to eat a certain amount of molluscicide pellets. Arion vulgaris are mostly controlled using chemical molluscicide products, and the detrimental environmental effects of these molluscicides can be reduced by decreasing the number of pellets applied per unit area. The objective of this study was to compare three slug control methods during two double-replicated seven-day laboratory experiments, in which slugs could choose the number of pellets with metaldehyde (3% or 5%) or iron phosphate (1%) and different types of food: leafy plants (lettuce), root vegetables (carrot), a cereal-based diet (oatmeal), or an animal-based diet (dry cat food). Slugs were irrigated and allowed to recover. We found a reluctance of slugs to eat big amounts of pellets and, therefore, to reach a full lethal dose, which resulted in low mortality (the rate was only 2.1%), regardless of whether the poison was stronger or weaker. Herbivory of slugs was in some cases reduced by half, but no treatments resulted in slugs to stop eating. Pellets with 3% metaldehyde were significantly more acceptable than pellets with 5% metaldehyde (uneaten pellets were left). The results showed that the new application of molluscicides could be useful; the application rate should be decreased according to the slugs number and ability of slugs to eat a certain amount of molluscicide pellets.

AB  - In invaded regions, the introduced non-native plants Reynoutria japonica and Impatiens glandulifera show little grazing damage, most likely due to the absence of specialized herbivores and the deterrent effect of secondary metabolites on generalist herbivores. The low degree of grazing damage has been explained by the non-mutually exclusive enemy-release and novel weapon hypotheses. We tested assumptions of these hypotheses by conducting a series of preference tests in which leaf samples from R. japonica, I. glandulifera, and the native Urtica dioica were offered to five species of generalist gastropods (the native Arianta arbustorum, Cepaea nemoralis and Fruticicola fruticum, and the non-native invasive Hygromia cinctella and Arion vulgaris). In addition, we determined the C/N-ratio and total phenolic compounds (as a surrogate of secondary metabolites) of the plant species. In the choice experiment with fresh leaf samples, all snail species showed a preference for U. dioica, with the exception of the non-native invasive slug A. vulgaris, which ate leaf tissue from I. gladulifera almost as much as from U. dioica. The snails' preference of U. dioica was even more pronounced when the fresh weight of leaf material eaten was considered. No-choice tests with either fresh or dead R. japonica leaves showed that most individuals of all species ate small amounts of fresh leaves, but less of dead leaves. In contrast, no-choice tests with either fresh or senescent I. glandulifera leaf tissue showed that individuals of all five gastropod species consumed larger amounts of senescent leaves than fresh leaves, probably because secondary compounds have been broken down or leached or the leaf texture has changed. The low susceptibility of these non-native invasive plants to the gastropods can most likely be explained by a combination of chemical and physical plant characteristics.

AB  - Hippocampal pyramidal neuron activity underlies episodic memory and spatial navigation. Although extensively studied in rodents, extremely little is known about human hippocampal pyramidal neurons, even though the human hippocampus underwent strong evolutionary reorganization and shows lower theta rhythm frequencies. To test whether biophysical properties of human Cornu Amonis subfield 1 ( CA1 ) pyramidal neurons can explain observed rhythms, we map the morpho-electric properties of individual CA1 pyramidal neurons in human, non -pathological hippocampal slices from neurosurgery. Human CA1 pyramidal neurons have much larger dendritic trees than mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons, have a large number of oblique dendrites, and resonate at 2.9 Hz, optimally tuned to human theta frequencies. Morphological and biophysical properties suggest cellular diversity along a multidimensional gradient rather than discrete clustering. Across the population, dendritic architecture and a large number of oblique dendrites consistently boost memory capacity in human CA1 pyramidal neurons by an order of magnitude compared to mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons.

AB  - Air pollution is associated with many neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders in human populations. Rodent models show similar neurotoxic effects of urban air pollution ultrafine particulate matter (UFPs < 100 nm (PM0.1)), collected by different methods or from various sources. Exposure to ultrafine particulate matter (UFPs < 100 nm (PM0.1)) can be adversely impacting the central nervous system (CNS) by the activation of proinflammatory pathways and reactive oxygen species associated with air pollution particulate matter. We investigated hippocampal inflammatory cytokines, neurobehavioral alteration, and neuronal morphology following exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) in mice. Male mice were DEPs exposed for 14 weeks. Mice exposed to DEPs showed more disorders in spatial memory and learning and depressive-like responses than control mice. Expression of hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokine was increased among DEPs exposure mice. The density of neurons in hippocampus CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) regions decreased in DEPs mice. Overall, these findings show that prolonged exposure to DEPs in the world's major cities can alter neurobehavioral and impair cognition.

AB  - Wuzhishan (WZS) pigs, which are minipigs native to Hainan Province in China, are characterized by strong resistance to extreme hot temperatures and humidity. The relationship between their immune response and growth still needs to be clarified. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to detect variations within 37 WZS pigs, 32 Large White (LW) pigs, and 22 Xiangxi black (XXB) pigs, and similar to 2.49 GB of SNPs were obtained. These data were combined with those of two other pig breeds, and it was found that most of the genes detected (354) were located within the distinct genetic regions between WZS pigs and LW pigs. The network that was constructed using these genes represented a center including 12 hub genes, five of which had structural variations (SVs) within their regulatory regions. Furthermore, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data for 12 genes were primarily consistent in liver, spleen, and LDM tissues. Notably, the expression of HSPs (HSPD1 and HSPE1) was higher while that of most genes involved in the JAK3-STAT pathway were lower in liver tissue of WZS pigs, compared with LW pigs. This likely not only reduced inflammation-related immune response but also impaired their growth. Our findings demonstrated the role of HSPs in the connection between inflammation and growth rate, while also providing the fundamental genetic selection of the adaptability of WZS pigs.

AB  - Plants are often attacked sequentially by multiple enemies. Pathogen sequential co-infections can lead to indirect interactions mediated by plant induced responses whose outcome is contingent on differences in the magnitude and type of plant induced defences elicited by different species or guilds. To date, however, most studies have tested unidirectional effects of one pathogen on another, not discerning between conspecific vs. heterospecific infections, and often not measuring plant induced responses underlying such outcomes. To address this, we conducted a greenhouse experiment testing for the impact of initial infection by two leaf pathogens (Alternaria solani and Phytophthora infestans) on subsequent infection by each of these pathogens on potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants, and also measured induced plant defences (phenolic compounds) to inform on interaction outcomes. We found contrasting results depending on the identity of the initially infecting pathogen. Specifically, initial infection by A. solani drove induced resistance (lower necrosis) by subsequently infecting A. solani (conspecific induced resistance) but had no effect on subsequent infection by P. infestans. In contrast, initial infection by P. infestans drove induced resistance to subsequent infection by both conspecifics and A. solani. Patterns of plant induced defences correlated with (and potentially explained) induced resistance to conspecific but not heterospecific (e.g., in the case of P. infestans) subsequent infection. Overall, these results further our understanding of plant-mediated pathogen interactions by showing that plant-mediated interactions between pathogen species can be asymmetrical and in some cases not reciprocal, that pathogen species can vary in the importance of conspecific vs. heterospecific effects, and shed mechanistic insight into the role of plant induced responses driving such interactions.

AB  - Tail adipose deposition in sheep is an economically significant trait that has an impact on meat quality and reproductive performance. This study elucidates the regulatory mechanism of FGFBP1 in the proliferation and differentiation of ovine tail-derived preadipocytes. Overexpression and knockdown methods were used to establish gain- and loss-of-function models, and the biological effects of FGFBP1 on adipocyte dynamics were systematically assessed. FGFBP1 overexpression significantly inhibited cellular proliferation by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and, at the same time, promoted adipocyte differentiation by upregulating key adipogenic markers (PPAR gamma, Adiponectin, C/EBP alpha, and FABP4). In contrast, gene silencing enhanced the proliferative capacity and decreased lipid droplet accumulation, confirming its inhibitory role in adipogenesis. Our findings indicate that FGFBP1 is a key regulator of tail adipogenesis. This discovery enhances our understanding of the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and provides theoretical bases and potential therapeutic targets for optimizing lipid deposition traits in livestock production.

AB  - Turfgrass is susceptible to changes in water availability, and its effects could cascade through multiple trophic levels. In some years, turfgrass is exposed to short drought spells. It is unclear if this short period of water deprivation would cascade to predator performance on herbivory on bermudagrass. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of water deprivation on predation by Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) on Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) when mediated by drought-tolerant 'TifTuf' and drought-susceptible 'Tifway' bermudagrass. Neonates of S. frugiperda and adults of O. insidiosus were caged on bermudagrass in greenhouse conditions. Treatments were three factors: 1) water deprivation at three levels - fully, moderately, and sparsely watered; 2) predator at two levels - present or absent; and 3) bermudagrass at two levels - drought tolerant and susceptible cultivars. The survival of S. frugiperda larvae was reduced when O. insidiosus adults were present regardless of water deprivation levels and bermudagrass cultivars. Reduced larval weight, body length, and head capsule width of S. frugiperda larvae were observed with predators compared to without predators. S. frugiperda larval mortality was significantly greater with predator's absence for the sparsely-watered treatment than for the fully and moderately-watered treatments. The levels of water deprivation had a partial impact on the survival of S. frugiperda larvae, whereas bermudagrass cultivars did not affect the survival and development of S. frugiperda larvae. Thus, during at least short-term dry spells, O. insidiosus predation can potentially reduce the S. frugiperda population on bermudagrass.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The alfalfa plant bug, Adelphocoris lineolatus (Goeze) (Hemiptera: Miridae), is a serious agricultural pest in China. Previous studies have shown that olfaction plays a crucial role in the survival and reproduction of herbivorous insects, such as A. lineolatus, and OBPs (odorant-binding proteins) are involved in the initial steps of olfaction. Due to the complex intracellular environment in insects, detection of the expression of OBP genes by conventional methods is limited in vitro. In this study, we developed a PNA-GO- (peptide nucleic acid and graphene oxide) based mRNA biosensor that allows detection of the expression of the AlinOBP14 gene in A. lineolatus. We demonstrate that AlinOBP14 is expressed in the adult head, which is consistent with previous research on the expression profiles of AlinOBP14 in A. lineolatus using quantitative real-time PCR. The results demonstrate that the method we developed is both feasible and reliable. In addition, this method exhibited good stability and specificity in detection of chemically synthesized targets in vitro as well as the expression of the target OBP gene in vivo.
   OBPs play a crucial role in the recognition of ligands and are involved in the initial steps of semiochemical perception. The diverse expression of OBP genes allows them to participate in different physiological functions in insects. In contrast to classic OBPs with typical olfactory roles in A. lineolatus, the physiological functions of Plus-C OBPs remain largely unknown. In addition, detection of the expression of insect OBP genes by conventional methods is difficult in vitro. Here, we focused on AlinOBP14, a Plus-C OBP from A. lineolatus, and we developed a PNA-GO-based mRNA biosensor to detect the expression of AlinOBP14. The results demonstrated that AlinOBP14 plays dual roles in A. lineolatus. The AlinOBP14 is expressed beneath the epidermis of the vertex and gena in heads of A. lineolatus, and it functions as a carrier for three terpenoids, while AlinOBP14 is also expressed in the peripheral antennal lobe and functions as a carrier for endogenous compounds such as precursors for juvenile hormone (JH) and JHII. Our investigation provides a new method to detect the expression of OBP genes in insects, and the technique will facilitate the use of these genes as potential targets for novel insect behavioral regulation strategies against the pest.

AB  - Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) has been reported to be involved in various cellular functions by regulating programmed cell death (PCD). However, the specific mechanism and function of CIRBP in regulating mitochondrial autophagy are still unclear. In this study, we found that CIRBP induced mitophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway to improve the function of yak cumulus cells (YCCs). We observed that low temperatures (32 degrees C) activated autophagy, increased E2 and P4 secretion, and up-regulated CIRBP expression. CIRBP overexpression activated mitophagy in YCCs, promoted cumulus diffusion, enhanced E2 and P4 synthesis and secretion, and inhibited apoptosis. CIRBP overexpression significantly attenuated the dysfunction of YCCs induced by the inhibition of mitophagy, whereas the activation of mitophagy exerted the same effect as CIRBP overexpression. DOX HCL is an AMPK/mTOR pathway inhibitor. CIRBP overexpression can successfully alleviate the inhibition of mitophagy caused by DOX HCL inhibiting the AMPK/mTOR pathway and can significantly enhance the mitophagy induced by AMPK/mTOR pathway activation in YCCs. Furthermore, we found that the increased expression of CIRBP protein alleviated the apoptosis caused by AKT pathway activation. In summary, CIRBP promoted mitophagy by activating AMPK/mTOR pathway, thereby promoting the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones and cumulus diffusion in YCCs and enhancing YCCs survival through activating autophagy and AKT signaling pathway, and then improve the function of YCCs. Our research provided new perspectives on CIRBP's regulation of cell death and highlighted its potential role in female reproductive systems.

AB  - Simple Summary The in vitro maturation of oocytes is important for animal husbandry and assisted reproductive technology, but due to the higher oxidative stress in the in vitro environment compared with the in vivo environment, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of this process by alleviating in vitro oxidative stress. Eupatilin is a flavonoid compound with various activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-tumoral activities. It is currently unclear whether it can reduce oxidative stress and improve the efficiency of the in vitro maturation of oocytes. The results of this study indicate that adding eupatilin to the in vitro maturation medium can alleviate oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and DNA damage in oocytes, further stimulating the maturation rate and embryo rate of porcine oocytes. It is expected to improve in vitro maturation efficiency and improve the composition of the medium.
   Eupatilin (5,7-dihydroxy-3 ',4 ',6-trimethoxyflavone) is a flavonoid derived from Artemisia plants that has beneficial biological activities, such as anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the protective effects of eupatilin against oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in porcine oocyte maturation are still unclear. To investigate the effect of eupatilin on the development of porcine oocytes after in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation, we added different concentrations of eupatilin in the process of porcine oocyte maturation in vitro, and finally selected the optimal concentration following multiple comparisons and analysis of test results using SPSS (version 17.0; IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) software. The results showed that 0.1 mu M eupatilin supplementation did not affect the expansion of porcine cumulus cells, but significantly increased the extrusion rate of porcine oocyte polar bodies, the subsequent blastocyst formation rate, and the quality of parthenogenetically activated porcine embryos. Additionally, it reduced the level of reactive oxygen species in cells and increased glutathione production. Further analysis revealed that eupatilin supplementation could reduce apoptosis, DNA double-strand breaks, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In conclusion, supplementation with 0.1 mu M eupatilin during in vitro maturation improved oocyte maturation and subsequent embryo development by reducing oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

AB  - Conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used to treat animal manure, but pathogen inactivation remains a significant challenge. Thermophilic and hyperthermophilic hydrolysis pretreatment was thus introduced as a hygienization step in a two-stage anaerobic digestion process. Results from 100-day experiments showed culturable Escherichia coli (E. coli) reduction was up to 6.9 log(1)0 through a hygienization step, but RTqPCR tests showed much less reduction in viable E. coli. The difference between viable and culturable cells revealed the complexity in pathogen inactivation. High-throughput sequencing indicated that the second stage in the two-stage AD further reduced the relative abundance of pathogens, including Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Acinetobacter, while Clostridium_sensu_stricto still exhibited high relative abundance. Thermophilic hygienization induced a 6.7% increment in methane production, while hyperthermophilic pretreatment showed minimal effect on methane production. Focusing on the energy recovery and environmental safety point of view, the introduction of an integrated system incorporating the thermophilic and two-stage anaerobic process is recommended.

AB  - Animal re-identification based on image data, either recorded manually by photographers or automatically with camera traps, is an important task for ecological studies about biodiversity and conservation that can be highly automatized with algorithms from computer vision and machine learning. However, fixed identification models only trained with standard datasets before their application will quickly reach their limits, especially for long-term monitoring with changing environmental conditions, varying visual appearances of individuals over time that differ a lot from those in the training data, and new occurring individuals that have not been observed before. Hence, we believe that active learning with human-in-the-loop and continuous lifelong learning is important to tackle these challenges and to obtain high-performance recognition systems when dealing with huge amounts of additional data that become available during the application. Our general approach with image features from deep neural networks and decoupled decision models can be applied to many different mammalian species and is perfectly suited for continuous improvements of the recognition systems via lifelong learning. In our identification experiments, we consider four different taxa, namely two elephant species: African forest elephants and Asian elephants, as well as two species of great apes: gorillas and chimpanzees. Going beyond classical re-identification, our decoupled approach can also be used for predicting attributes of individuals such as gender or age using classification or regression methods. Although applicable for small datasets of individuals as well, we argue that even better recognition performance will be achieved by improving decision models gradually via lifelong learning to exploit huge datasets and continuous recordings from long-term applications. We highlight that algorithms for deploying lifelong learning in real observational studies exist and are ready for use. Hence, lifelong learning might become a valuable concept that supports practitioners when analyzing large-scale image data during long-term monitoring of mammals.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether premature luteolysis can be alleviated by substituting the ovulation inducing agent hCG for GnRH. Seventy-two hours after the end of artificial insemination (AI), pluriparous Awassi ewes were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups of 13 ewes each. First group received 37.5 mu g of the GnRH analog Lecirelin, the second 1000 I.U hCG and the third group served as a control (received 1 ml of physiological saline solution). Blood samples were collected at daily intervals after GnRH treatment and analysed for plasma oestradiol and progesterone concentrations. Ovarian follicles were monitored ultrasonically at the time of GnRH administration, 60 hr and 84 hr later. Pregnancy was diagnosed ultrasonically at Day 35 after AI. Number and size of ovarian follicles did not differ (p > .05) among treatment groups. Onset and duration of oestrus were not affected by treatment (p > .05). No significant differences (p > .05) were recorded in oestradiol and progesterone concentrations between the treatment groups during the inspection period. Premature luteolysis became evident in ewes with longer oestrous durations by Day 6.25 after AI and amounted to 7.69%, 18.18% and 23.07% in GnRH, hCG and Control groups respectively. Pregnancy rates increased to 92.31% and 81.82% in GnRH and hCG groups, compared to 76.92% in the Control group. The results indicate that GnRH was more effective in reducing premature luteolysis than hCG. Substituting hCG for GnRH as an ovulation inducing agent was of no avail.

AB  - Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is an important surface molecule of activated T cells that has a strong affinity with the B7 molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Among these molecules, the CTLA-4 extracellular region (CTLA-4 IgV) may be used as a novel immune adjuvant molecule for delivering antigens and inducing strong humoral and cellular immune responses. In this study, bioinformatics analysis was performed to determine and clone the extracellular region of Xinjiang sheep CTLA-4 (NM_001009214). The CTLA-4 IgV gene was amplified and ligated into the pMD19-T vector, and the positive bacteria were screened by blue-white spots for sequencing and comparison. The correctly sequenced CTLA-4 IgV was digested and then ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a(+). The plasmid pET30a-CTLA-4 IgV was constructed to induce the expression of the recombinant protein CTLA-4 IgV. Thereafter, CTLA-4 IgV was identified. Clustal X multiple sequence alignment revealed that the protein sequence of Xinjiang sheep CTLA-4 IgV was different from that of the known CTLA-4 extracellular region. The 3D protein structure of Xinjiang sheep CTLA-4 IgV was constructed via the bioinformatics method. Subsequently, molecular docking between the Xinjiang sheep CTLA-4 IgV protein and the B7 molecule was conducted. Results revealed multiple binding sites in the extracellular region of Xinjiang sheep CTLA-4, and two multiple interactions ensured stable binding after docking. The functionality of the Xinjiang sheep CTLA-4 IgV protein was further verified by fusing the CTLA-4 extracellular V region with EgG1Y162, a protective protein from Echinococcus granulosa, and the purified recombinant protein CTLA-4 IgV-EgG1Y162 was expressed with the mouse bone marrow-derived. The addition of the Xinjiang sheep CTLA-4 IgV protein at the amino terminus promoted the binding of EgG1Y162 to dendritic cells (DCs) and increased the maturation rate of these cells, further indicating that the protein could effectively improve the antigen presentation ability of DCs. The CTLA-4 extracellular domain protein of Xinjiang sheep is unique and has the potential to promote the presentation of the fusion protein by DCs as an adjuvant. The cloning and expression of this gene provide new measures and ideas for the preparation of the Xinjiang sheep vaccine to prevent zoonotic diseases.

AB  - Improvement of the intestinal health of piglets at weaning is a principal objective in pig farming in terms of performance and welfare benefits. Early indicators of disease are indispensable for evaluating animal health and the efficacy of interventions such as feed additive supplementation. This study evaluates behavioural changes in weaned piglets that are orally challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4, and which receive or not two different in-feed additives. Two independent trials were performed with early-weaned piglets in pens of three animals, which were fed a plain diet (N = 32) or one supplemented with sodium butyrate (N = 16; Trial 1) or sodium heptanoate (N = 16; Trial 2) and protected with coconut distillates. After one week of adaptation, piglets were challenged with a single oral dose of E. coli F4 (minimum 1.4 x109 cfu). Scan-sampling was used to evaluate individual behaviour (location in the pen, postures, contact with pen mates, and activities) on the day before (d-1) and two days post-inoculation (d+2 and d+3) at 2-min intervals. Behaviours were recorded in mornings (8 am to 10 am) and afternoons (4 pm to 6 pm). Faecal consistency was also recorded for each animal. Diarrhoea peaked at d+ 2. Regarding behaviour, on d+ 2 there was greater frequency of the animals lying inactively under the heat lamp, in contrast to d-1 when they were more frequently present in the feeder, standing and active (P < 0.05). Around the feeder, standing and active behaviour increased at d+ 3, especially in the afternoon (PDayxTime of day < 0.05). Piglets fed sodium heptanoate spent less time around the feeder (P < 0.05). The weight of the animal at weaning was also observed to have an impact on the effect of time or diet on behaviour. Medium size piglets spent more time lying with pen mates in the afternoon (PSizexTime of day < 0.01) and the smallest piglets increased their feeding behaviour when receiving the supplemented diets (PSizexDiet < 0.05). In conclusion, a lethargic response among piglets after the E. coli F4 challenge was evidenced, this response being slightly modified by the supplementation of in-feed additives and the size of the animals. These results are evidence of the potential of behavioural indicators as a useful tool to assess the health status of piglets at weaning and their responses to in-feed supplementation, but they should be regarded with caution before any transfer to farm conditions due to the limitations of experimental models.

AB  - Cryopreservation of semen renders artificial insemination easier and cheaper compared to use of fresh semen. However, the cellular oxidative stress, toxicity of cryoprotectants, and osmotic imbalance may lead to a decline in semen quality and fertilization ability during the process of cryopreservation. L-carnitine and L-proline have been demonstrated to possess effective antiox-idant properties in cryopreservation, with the latter also exhibiting excellent permeability and thus being utilized as a permeable cryoprotectant in the field. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LC and LP on cryopreservation of semen of dairy goats. After thawing, sperm motility, membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity rate of cryopreserved semen treated with LC (50 mM) were significantly higher compared to the untreated control samples. Based on this premise, we conducted experiments to assess the cryoprotective efficacy of different con-centrations of LP. The findings demonstrated that the inclusion of 50 mM LP resulted in improved sperm motility compared to other concentrations. Furthermore, the levels of damaging reactive oxygen species and the malonyldialdehyde marker for oxidative stress were significantly lower in goat semen treated with these concentrations of LC and LP compared to semen exposed to other treatments. Semen treated with LC and LP also exhibited good fertilization ability during both in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination. Thus, LC (50 mM) and LP (50 mM) improve cry-oprotection of dairy goat sperm which suggests that addition of these compounds will be highly beneficial to the development of dairy goat breeding.

AB  - Zoonotic leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira bacteria that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Animals, especially wild and domestic mammals, are reservoir hosts that carry and excrete the bacteria in their urine. A retrospective analysis of the incidence of leptospirosis in animals and humans in Ukraine from 2003 to 2022 was conducted based on reports from regional state laboratories of veterinary medicine and the Center for Public Health. GIS mapping was used to analyze and visualize the data. The incidence and prevalence of leptospirosis among different animal species, including farm, domestic and wild animals, were analyzed. These studies included a retrospective analysis of blood serum samples from different animal species for leptospirosis and analysis of the results to determine the level of seropositivity. The study analyzed a total of 6,543,934 samples, with an overall seropositivity rate of 3.3%. Among cattle, 4.1% of the samples were positive. For pigs, 2.1% were positive. Horses had a seropositivity rate of 7.9%, while dogs and cats had seropositivity rates of 17.5% and 13.1% respectively. Wild boars showed a positivity rate of 2.2%. The number of seropositive animals of different species in Ukraine showed different dynamics from 2003 to 2022. The highest number of positive cases was found among cattle, pigs and horses. However, the number of positive cases decreased significantly after 2015, which coincides with a significant reduction in the number of farm animals. Trends of increasing seropositivity among dogs and cats in the period 2007-2015 indicate that these species are also active carriers of Leptospira , as are the leading agricultural species. Wildlife species with stable seropositivity serve as both sources and reservoirs of Leptospira. Wild pigs are becoming the main bacterial carriers in all regions of Ukraine. There is a marked disproportion between the number of positive cases among farm animals and wildlife, indicating that seropositivity in these populations exists largely autonomously. A total of 7,937 people were infected in Ukraine between 2003 and 2022. Certain regions, such as Lviv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, and Vinnytsia, account for a larger share of the total number of cases, ranging from 4.8% to 7.3%. The incidence of human leptospirosis has fluctuated over the years, peaking at 473 cases in 2014, followed by a decline: 301 cases in 2015, 323 cases in 2016 and 330 cases in 2017, and in subsequent years the number of cases remained relatively stable, ranging from 142 to 295 cases per year. The study emphasizes the need to improve preventive measures and raise public awareness of the disease, especially in rural areas. It is important to adopt a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach involving collaboration between veterinary medicine, public health and environmental authorities to better understand and address the complexities of leptospirosis transmission and reduce its impact on animal and human health.

AB  - Obtaining reliable estimates of population abundance is of utmost importance for wildlife research and management. To this aim, camera-traps are increasingly used, as this method has the advantage of being non-invasive and allows for continuous monitoring. Camera traps can be used to estimate abundance in combination with traditional capture-recapture techniques, as well as with estimators that do not require marked individuals. Here, we investigated the use of camera-based mark-recapture methods applied to an Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) population in the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park (eastern Italian Alps). We compared abundance estimates derived from a traditional capture-mark-recapture (CMR) framework and camera trap mark-resight (CTMR) over three consecutive years. CMR models estimated a population size of n = 19 individuals (95% CI = 18-27), n = 15 (14-22) and n = 24 (22-32) in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. CTMR returned an estimated population size of n = 24 (95% CI = 18-30), n = 20 (17-24) and n = 22 (21-24) for the same years. The difference between the estimate of these two methods was significant only in 2020, with CMR returning a lower estimate than CTMR (95% CI = -9.4--0.6). This difference was not significant for 2019 (95% CI = -10.9-0.9) and 2021 (95% CI = -1.8-5.9). Based on our results, the use of CTMR techniques is promising in the estimation of absolute population size of marmots, and the estimator was slightly more precise than CMR. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of CTMR with reduced capture effort.

AB  - Stress is considered a crucial determinant influencing health capacity in modern society. Long-term stress makes individuals more susceptible to mental dysfunctions, among which depression and anxiety are two major mental disorders. The success of using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to treat these two disorders highlights the involvement of the central serotonergic (5-HT) system. Later studies suggest both presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT profiles should be considered for the effects of SSRIs, making it difficult to interpret the etiological and therapeutic mechanisms underlying depression and anxiety. The present study aims to examine whether the intervention of escitalopram (Es, 5 mg/kg daily for 14 days) can reverse the behavioral phenotypes of both depression-like [by sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swim test (FST)] and anxiety-like [by avoidance latency and escape latency in elevated-T maze (ETM)] behaviors, and the brain area-dependent neurochemical changes of 5-HT profiles of the terminal regions regarding both synaptic efflux and tissue levels in rats of chronic mild stress (CMS). Our results showed that: (i) Even mild stresses when presented in an unpredictable and long-term manner, can induce both depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors. (ii) Depressive profile indexed by SPT was more sensitive to reflect the Es effect than that of FST. (iii) Es did not significantly affect the CMS-induced anxiety-like symptoms indexed by ETM. (iv) Changes in the protein expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were compatible with the treatment outcome. Our results contributed to the understanding of stress-induced mood dysfunction and the involvement of central 5-HT.

AB  - Sertoli cell (SC) proliferation plays an important role in sperm production and quality; however, the regulatory mechanism of SC proliferation is not well understood. This study investigated the role of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the regulation of immature boar SC activity. Cell counting kit -8, Seahorse XFe96, mitochondrial respiratory enzyme -related assay kits, and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect SC proliferative viability, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity, and the ultrastructure of primary cultured SCs in vitro from the testes of 21 -day -old boars. A dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the miRNA-mRNA target interaction. Western blotting was used to analyze cell proliferation -related protein expression of p38, p21, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Cyclin D3, and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Each experiment had a completely randomized design, with three replicates in each experiment. The results showed that the AMPK inhibitor (Compound C, 20 mu M-24 h) increased cell proliferation viability, ATP production, and maximal respiration of SCs by 0.64-, 0.12-, and 0.08 -fold (p < 0.05), respectively; increased the SC protein expression of PCNA, CDK4, Cyclin D3, and p-Rb by 0.13-, 0.09-, 0.88-, and 0.12 -fold (p < 0.05), respectively; and decreased the SC protein expression of p38 and p21 by 0.36- and 0.27 -fold (p < 0.05), respectively. The AMPK agonist AICAR (2 mM-6 h) significantly inhibited SC ultrastructure, OCR, mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity, and cell proliferation -related protein levels. AMPK was validated to be a target gene of miR1285 based on the result in which the miR-1285 mimic inhibited the luciferase activity of wild -type AMPK by 0.54 -fold (p < 0.001). MiR-1285 mimic promoted the OCR of SCs, with 0.45-, 0.15-, 0.21-, and 0.30 -fold (p < 0.01) increases in ATP production, basal and maximal respiration, and spare capacity, respectively. MiR-1285 mimic increased the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity of SCs, with 0.63-, 0.70-, and 0.97 -fold (p < 0.01) increases in NADH-Q oxidoreductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and ATP synthase, respectively. Moreover, the miR-1285 mimic increased the protein expression of PCNA, CDK4, Cyclin D3, and p-Rb by 0.24-, 0.30-, 0.22-, and 0.13 -fold (p < 0.05), respectively, and reduced the protein expression of p38 and p21 by 0.58- and 0.66 -fold (p < 0.001). MiR-1285 inhibitor showed opposite effects on the above indicators and induced numerous autophagosomes and large lipid droplets in SCs. A high dose of estradiol (10 mu M-6 h, showed a promotion of AMPK activation in a previous study) significantly inhibited SC ultrastructure, mitochondrial function, and proliferation -related pathways, while these adverse effects were weakened by Compound C treatment or miR1285 mimic transfection. Our findings suggest that the activation and inhibition of AMPK induced by specific drugs or synthesized targeted miRNA fragments could regulate immature boar SC proliferative activity by influencing the CDK4/Cyclin D3 pathway and mitochondrial function; this helps to provide a basis for the prevention and treatment of male sterility in clinical practice.

AB  - Previous studies have underscored the importance of breastfeeding and parental care on offspring development and behavior. However, their contribution as dynamic variables in animal models of early life stress are often overlooked. In the present study, we investigated how lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) on postnatal day (P)10 affects maternal care, milk, and offspring development. MIA was associated with elevated milk corticosterone concentrations on P10, which recovered by P11. In contrast, both milk triglyceride and percent creamatocrit values demonstrated a prolonged decrease following inflammatory challenge. Adolescent MIA offspring were heavier, which is often suggestive of poor early life nutrition. While MIA did not decrease maternal care quality, there was a significant compensatory increase in maternal licking and grooming the day following inflammatory challenge. However, this did not protect against disrupted neonatal huddling or later-life alterations in sensorimotor gating, conditioned fear, mechanical allodynia, or reductions in hippocampal parvalbumin expression in MIA offspring. MIA-associated changes in brain and behavior were likely driven by differences in milk nutritional values and not by direct exposure to LPS or inflammatory molecules as neither LPS binding protein nor interleukin-6 milk levels differed between groups. These findings reflected comparable microbiome and transcriptomic patterns at the genome-wide level. Animal models of early life stress can impact both parents and their offspring. One mechanism that can mediate the effects of such stressors is changes to maternal lactation quality which our data show can confer multifaceted and compounding effects on offspring physiology and behavior.

AB  - Islands are exceptional field laboratories for studying biogeographical patterns, particularly those lying on the edge of neighbouring bioregions. Among island vertebrates, bats have often been underrepresented in research due to survey challenges and difficulties in assessing their occurrence. Many bat species are a priority for conservation, making it even more essential to understand their distributions and ecological needs. This study was conducted on the small Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, located at the intersection of the African and European bioregions, to assess bat diversity using an integrated approach based on non-invasive survey techniques. By coupling automatic acoustic surveys with potential roost inspections, and molecular tools for species identification from guano, we disclosed the presence of at least eight bat species on the island. Among these, we recorded the unequivocal occurrence of species mainly distributed in North Africa and whose distribution in the European territory is relatively marginal, such as Rhinolophus mehelyi, Plecotus gaisleri and Myotis punicus. Moreover, we highlight the occurrence of the Maghrebian bent-winged bat Miniopterus maghrebensis on Lampedusa, representing the first record of this north-western African species for Europe. Besides, we disclose that, on the limited territory of Lampedusa, temporary ponds and remnants of natural scrubland associated with watersheds are key drivers of species activity and diversity. Our results highlight the exceptional role of islands, and of those in the Strait of Sicily in particular, as biogeographical reservoirs, and consequently, as key areas for bat diversity conservation in Europe.

AB  - Feed and alarm calls induce arousal in chicks, the former for feeding and the latter for danger. However, the response of birds genetically selected for meat or egg production to these calls have not been investigated. Thirtysix chicks each of the ISA Brown pullet and FUNAAB Alpha broiler (2 weeks old) were randomly allocated into three groups per strain and subjected to three playbacks: no call (NCP), feed call (FCP) and alarm call (ACP) continuously for 1 h. The test was carried out for 3 days/week for two weeks. The behaviours monitored were foraging, feeding, pecking (grouped as oral-related behaviour, ORB), freezing and clustering (grouped as fearrelated behaviour, FRB). The eye (ET) and under wing (WT) temperatures were measured before and after each call and the change (AET and AWT) calculated. Tonic immobility (TI) test was performed after each call and the number of attempts to induce TI (NOATI) and the duration of TI (DTI) was recorded. Data on these two behavioural categories were subjected to General Linear Model analyses separately for each call having strain and day as fixed factors. The AET, AWT, NOATI and DTI were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. On both days, AET and AWT was similar after exposure to 1 h of FCP, ACP and NCP. FCP caused more (P 0.001) AWT in pullet than broiler. Fear responses during FCP was not affected (P 0.05) in pullet than broiler. Finally, there was no significant (P 0.05) strain x day or strain effects on ORB and FRB, with ORB greater (P < 0.05) on the 2nd day. In conclusion, pullet and broiler chicks showed greater arousal (higher AWT) to FCP and ACP, respectively. The pullets showed more fear responses during NCP and ACP than the broilers. The ORB and FRB were similar in both strains during each of the three calls.

AB  - The SMAD protein family plays crucial roles in reproduction as a downstream target genes of the TGF8 signaling pathway. Many studies have focused on the expression change exploration of SMADs during testicular development and investigation of SMAD2 in hormone synthesis regulation. However, little attention has been given to determining the regulatory mechanism of SMADs in sheep testes. In the present study, we first detected SMAD mRNA expression levels in three-month-old (3 M), six-month-old (6 M), nine-month-old (9 M) and two-year-old (2Y) sheep testes. Different SMADs showed various expression patterns. In addition, the subcellular localization of SMAD2 was also analyzed, and Sertoli cells (SCs), Leydig cells (LCs) and spermatogonia presented mainly positive staining. Protein and nucleic acid sequence alignment showed that the SMAD2 gene was extremely homologous between various species. SMAD2 interference RNA was transfected into sheep LCs to examine the cell proliferation and hormone levels. The testosterone level was significantly decreased, and cell proliferation efficiency presented the same trend (P < 0.05). Moreover, SMAD2 downregulation promoted cell apoptosis (P < 0.05) and changed the cell cycle. In total, our results revealed that downregulating the expression of SMAD2 can effectively inhibit testosterone levels by affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Various plant extracts have been used as feed additives to benefit ruminant performance. In this study we investigated the effects of dietary cornus plant extract supplementation, with or without the addition of oregano and thyme essential oil, in dairy ewes. Ewes participating in this experiment were reared under thermal stress and their performance, as well as the composition of their final products (milk, feta cheese and yoghurt), were assessed. The outcome of this experiment showed that cornus plant extract, alone or in combination with oregano and thyme, favored the production of ewe's milk, along with the composition of milk and milk products.
   The effect of a diet supplemented with a novel cornus extract, enriched with essential oils of oregano and thyme, on the performance of Chios cross-bred dairy sheep was investigated during the summer period. The plant extracts were prepared using a "green" method based on aqueous extraction. A total of 45 lactating ewes were allocated into three equal groups in a randomized block design. The three groups were fed the same feed allowance, roughage based on Lucerne hay and wheat straw and a concentrate based on cereals and oil cakes (the control diet). The diet of two groups was fortified with cornus extract, with or without oregano and thyme essential oils, at a level 0.515 g of plant extract/essential oils per kg of concentrate. Individual milk yield was recorded weekly and feed refusals were recorded on a pen basis daily, during a six-week period of lactation. Milk samples were analyzed for the chemical composition of protein, fat, lactose and solids-not-fat constituents, somatic cell counts and total viable bacteria counts. Moreover, the milk of each group was used for yoghurt and Feta cheese production. The lipid oxidative stability, protein carbonyl content and fatty acid composition of milk, yoghurt and cheese samples were also evaluated. The results showed that the incorporation of novel plant extracts and essential oils increased the milk production per ewe. Dietary supplementation with cornus extracts and essential oils lowered lipid and protein oxidation in milk, yoghurt and cheese samples, compared to the control. However, diet supplementation with herbal extracts did not affect the fatty acid profile in milk, cheese and yoghurt or the serum biochemical parameters. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with cornus in combination with oregano and thyme has the potential to improve feed utilization and the performance of high-yield dairy Chios cross-bred ewes reared under heat stress.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have proven cardioprotective properties, which makes this class of drugs one of the priorities in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Ischemic stroke and chronic cerebral dyscirculation occur with high frequency in DM2, thus actualizing a study of SGLT2i neurotropic properties. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the neuroprotective effects of the highly selective SGLT2i empagliflozin (EMPA) and low-selective SGLT2i canagliflozin (CANA) on the rat model of acute cerebral ischemia, as well as investigate the probable mechanism of these effects on the brain. At the first stage, EMPA and CANA were administered to Wistar rats without DM2 for 7 days prior to transient focal 30-min cerebral ischemia modeling. After 48 h of reperfusion, neurological deficit was assessed by Garcia scores, and brain sections were then incubated in a triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution to evaluate the brain damage volume. The latter did not differ in EMPA and CANA groups and was significantly smaller compared to the control group of untreated rats. At the same time, neither EMPA nor CANA had a significant effect on neurological deficit. At the second stage, we modeled DM2 (high-fat diet and streptozotocin + nicotinamide), and 4 weeks later, 8-week EMPA and CANA therapy was initiated. After the end of therapy, brain tissue was studied immunohistochemically. DM2 development was accompanied by an increase in the number of microgliocytes in the hippocampal CA1 area; the therapy with EMPA, but not CANA, led to a decrease in the number of activated microgliocytes. Thus, the highly selective SGLT-2i EMPA and low-selective SGLT-2i CANA exert a similar infarct-limiting effect when applied for 7 days prior to ischemia modeling in Wistar rats without DM2. The neuroprotective effect of EMPA in DM2 may in part be due to a decrease in microglial activation.

AB  - During the last decade, sow mortality due to pelvic organ prolapse (POP) has increased. To better understand the biology associated with POP, sows were phenotypically assessed and assigned a perineal score (PS) based on presumed POP risk and categorized as PS1 (low), PS2 (moderate), or PS3 (high). The study objective was to identify changes in sow vaginal microbiota that may be associated with POP. The hypothesis is that vaginal microbiota differs between sows with variable risk for POP, and changes in microbiota during late gestation exist between sows with differing risk. Of the 2864 sows scored during gestation week 15, 1.0, 2.7, and 23.4% of PS1, PS2, and PS3 sows, respectively, subsequently experienced POP. Vaginal swabs subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed differences in community composition (Bray-Curtis; P<0.05) and individual operational taxonomic unit (OTU) comparisons between vaginal microbiota of PS1 and PS3 sows at gestation week 15. Further, differences (P<0.05) in community composition and OTUs (Q<0.05) were observed in PS3 sows that either did or did not subsequently experience POP. Differences in community structure (alpha diversity measurements; P<0.05), composition (P<0.05), and OTUs (Q<0.05) were observed in gestation week 12 sows scored PS1 compared to week 15 sows scored PS1 or PS3, suggesting that sow vaginal microbiota shifts during late gestation differently as POP risk changes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that sows with greater POP risk have unique vaginal microflora, for which a better understanding could aid in the development of mitigation strategies.

AB  - Oil-tea camellia has a long history of cultivation and utilization, with a history of more than 2000 years. In China, it is the main woody oil crop with high economic value and a national resource with unique characteristics. Concurrently, it is also known as one of the four major woody oil crops in the world. However, the genetic background of Camellia drupifera Lour. on Hainan Island in China is still unclear, and there is a great lack of systematic genetic characterization, which seriously hinders the development and utilization of oil-tea camellia germplasm resources and genetic improvement on Hainan Island. To analyze the genetic diversity and kinship between C. drupifera and its related species, this study utilized SSR molecular marker technology to genotype 160 individuals from 23 populations. A total of 137 alleles were amplified from the 14 polymorphic primers, with an average of 9.786. The average number of effective alleles and that of Shannon's information index for each locus were 1.865 and 0.633, respectively, suggesting that the screened SSR markers presented a moderately high level of polymorphism. Additionally, the mean observed heterozygosity (0.915) was greater than the mean expected heterozygosity (0.450), indicating an excess of heterozygotes in the tested population. The results of the principal component analysis (PCA), molecular variation analysis of variance (AMOVA) and population structure analysis were generally consistent; specifically, there was a high degree of individual heterozygosity within the population, and genetic variation occurred primarily among individuals within the population (90%) but rarely among groups (10%). Additionally, the UPGMA clustering divided the 160 germplasm resources into four major clades, and C. drupifera was principally grouped in two distinct branches; meanwhile, Camellia gauchowensis was also mainly clustered in these two clades. Camellia oleifera individuals were chiefly concentrated in other independent branches. It can be speculated that C. drupifera is genetically close to C. gauchowensis, but genetically distant from C. oleifera. This study can provide the scientific basis for the identification, collection, preservation, evaluation, and innovative utilization of oil-tea camellia.

AB  - The concept of human wildlife coexistence has generated a great deal of attention and support in human-wildlife interactions literature; however, the precise nature of coexistence or its operationalisation is not very clear. The paradigm of coexistence has primarily been debated from a conservation perspective and largely by western conservationists. Coexistence with wildlife though can take on a multiplicity of forms in different human cultures and function in the absence of active conservation. We aimed to understand how coexistence operates in the context of species that are not prioritised for conservation and may even be threatened by governance policies. Drawing on work on the human macaque interface in India, we examined the ecology, population dynamics, and coliving trajectories of two common macaque species in India: the bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata) and the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Our findings showed that while there are many apparent similarities in the behaviour and ecology of the two species, they crucially differ in their ecological flexibility, distribution and density patterns, and interactions with human communities. These differences have shaped their different coexistence patterns with humans across their geographic ranges. Coexistence, like conflict, exists in varied forms, and it is unlikely that an ideal state of coexistence will ever exist uniformly across the range of a wildlife species. Instead of aiming for a perfect state of coexistence that connotes mutual benefit for humans and wildlife, it would be more pragmatic for researchers and conservationists to foster different states of human-wildlife coadaptation, that reflect species biology and the culture and value systems of coliving human communities.

KW  - OCEAN SALINITIES
AB  - Sea surface salinity patterns have intensified between the mid-20(th) century and present day, with saline areas becoming saltier and fresher areas fresher. This change has been linked to a human-induced strengthening of the global hydrological cycle as global mean surface temperatures rose. Here we analyse salinity observations from the round-the-world voyages of HMS Challenger and SMS Gazelle in the 1870s, early in the industrial era, to reconstruct surface salinity changes since that decade. We find that the amplification of the salinity change pattern between the 1870s and the 1950s was at a rate that was 5410% lower than the post-1950s rate. The acceleration in salinity pattern amplification over almost 150 years implies that the hydrological cycle would have similarly accelerated over this period. The strengthening of the global hydrological cycle that has been observed since the mid-20(th) century has accelerated during the past 150 years, according to reconstructions of sea surface salinity from two round-the-world voyages in the 1870s.

AB  - Sepsis remains a huge unmet medical need for which no approved drugs, besides antibiotics, are on the market. Despite the clinical impact of sepsis, its molecular mechanism remains inadequately understood. Recent insights have shown that profound hepatic transcriptional reprogramming, leading to fatal metabolic abnormalities, might open a new avenue to treat sepsis. Translation of experimental results from rodents to larger animal models of higher relevance for human physiology, such as pigs, is critical and needs exploration. We performed a comparative analysis of the transcriptome profiles in murine and porcine livers using the following sepsis models: cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice and fecal instillation (FI) in pigs, both of which induce polymicrobial septic peritonitis, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia in pigs, inducing sterile inflammation. Using bulk RNA sequencing, Metascape pathway analysis, and HOMER transcription factor motif analysis, we were able to identify key genes and pathways affected in septic livers. Conserved upregulated pathways in murine CLP and porcine LPS and FI generally comprise typical inflammatory pathways, except for ER stress, which was only found in the murine CLP model. Conserved pathways downregulated in sepsis comprise almost exclusively metabolic pathways such as monocarboxylic acid, steroid, biological oxidation, and small-molecule catabolism. Even though the upregulated inflammatory pathways were equally induced in the two porcine models, the porcine FI model more closely resembles the metabolic dysfunction observed in the CLP liver compared to the porcine LPS model. This comprehensive comparison focusing on the hepatic responses in mouse CLP versus LPS or FI in pigs shows that the two porcine sepsis models generally resemble quite well the mouse CLP model, with a typical inflammatory signature amongst the upregulated genes and metabolic dysfunction amongst the downregulated genes. The hepatic ER stress observed in the murine model could not be replicated in the porcine models. When studying metabolic dysfunction in the liver upon sepsis, the porcine FI model more closely resembles the mouse CLP model compared to the porcine LPS model.

AB  - Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) are transcription factors expressed throughout the body and brain, with especially high expression in the hippocampal area CA2. MRs are essential for maintaining the physiological stress response and regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Further, MRs function through the diurnal modulation of corticosterone activity. The aim of the current study was to determine the role MRs play in the modulation of spontaneous behavior throughout the day/night cycle. Three conditional MR knockout mouse lines were utilized: one with broad embryonic neuronal deletion (Nestin-Cre), one with embryonic forebrain deletion (EMX-Cre), and one with postnatal CA2-targeted deletion (Amigo2-Cre). Behavior in these strains was assessed using an automated home cage monitoring system to track spontaneous behavior over a 60-h period. Broad deletion of MRs disrupted behavior in a sex-dependent manner, with alteration in motor activity and shelter behavior at night. Forebrain deletion of MRs produced similar, but less pronounced, differences in motor activity and shelter behavior, while CA2-targeted deletion produced little alteration in behavior either during the day or at night. These findings provide evidence for the essential role of MRs in the regulation of behavior across the day/night cycle and shed a light on the role of MR development and expression on behavior.

AB  - BackgroundAging affects anxiety levels in rats while the pineal gland, via its hormone melatonin, could modulate their inherited life "clock." The present study aimed to explore the impact of plasma melatonin deficiency on anxiety responses and the possible involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and heat shock proteins (Hsp) 70 and 90 in the frontal cortex (FC) and the hippocampus in young adult, middle-aged and elderly rats with pinealectomy.ResultsMelatonin deficiency induced at different life stages did not affect the lifespan of rats. Pinealectomy abolished the circadian rhythm of motor activity, measured for 48 h in the actimeter, in young adult but not in middle-aged rats. Pinealectomy reduced the motor activity of the young adult rats during the dark phase and impaired the diurnal activity variations of old rats. The same generations (3- and 18 month-old rats with pinealectomy) had lower anxiety levels than the matched sham groups, measured in three tests: elevated-plus maze, light-dark test, and novelty-suppressed feeding test. While the activity of the HPA axis remained intact in young adult and middle-aged rats with melatonin deficiency, a high baseline corticosterone level and blunted stress-induced mechanism of its release were detected in the oldest rats. Age-associated reduced Hsp 70 and 90 levels in the FC but not in the hippocampus were detected. Pinealectomy diminished the expression of Hsp 70 in the FC of middle-aged rats compared to the matched sham rats.ConclusionsOur results suggest that while melatonin hormonal dysfunction impaired the motor activity in the actimeter and emotional behavior in young adult and elderly rats, the underlying pathogenic mechanism in these generations might be different and needs further verification.

AB  - A series of differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified through sequencing in the hair follicle tissues of Hu sheep with small-waved and straight wool patterns. Based on these findings, the circCSPP1-miR-10a-BMP7 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7) regulatory network was constructed. The preliminary study highlighted that miR-10a and the BMP7 gene exhibited not only significant differential expression across hair follicle tissues with different patterns in Hu sheep but also had an impact on the proliferation of hair papilla cells. The proliferation of hair papilla cells is intricately linked to hair follicle development and growth. Consequently, we selected the circCSPP1-miR-10a-BMP7 regulatory network to validate its role in promoting hair papilla cell proliferation in Hu sheep. Firstly, the authenticity of circCSPP1 was successfully confirmed through RNase R digestion and reverse primer amplification. Additionally, nucleoplasmic localization analysis determined that circCSPP1 was predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm. Using the dual-luciferase gene reporter system, we verified the targeting relationship between circCSPP1 and miR-10a, building upon our previous validation of the miR-10a-BMP7 interaction. This clarified the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism within the circCSPP1-miR-10a-BMP7. Furthermore, rescue experiments confirmed that circCSPP1 competitively binds to miR-10a, thereby regulating BMP7 expression and influencing the proliferation of hair papilla cells in Hu sheep. This discovery provides a solid foundation for future investigations into the mechanisms underlying wool curvature and the formation of lambskin patterns, offering insights into the complex regulatory networks that govern these phenotypic traits in Hu sheep.

AB  - BackgroundStudying animal movement in the context of the optimal foraging theory has led to the development of simple movement metrics for inferring feeding activity. Yet, the predictive capacity of these metrics in natural environments has been given little attention, raising serious questions of the validity of these metrics. The aim of this study is to test whether simple continuous movement metrics predict feeding intensity in a marine predator, the southern elephant seal (SES; Mirounga leonine), and investigate potential factors influencing the predictive capacity of these metrics.MethodsWe equipped 21 female SES from the Kerguelen Archipelago with loggers and recorded their movements during post-breeding foraging trips at sea. From accelerometry, we estimated the number of prey encounter events (nPEE) and used it as a reference for feeding intensity. We also extracted several track- and dive-based movement metrics and evaluated how well they explain and predict the variance in nPEE. We conducted our analysis at two temporal scales (dive and day), with two dive profile resolutions (high at 1 Hz and low with five dive segments), and two types of models (linear models and regression trees).ResultsWe found that none of the movement metrics predict nPEE with satisfactory power. The vertical transit rates (primarily the ascent rate) during dives had the best predictive performance among all metrics. Dive metrics performed better than track metrics and all metrics performed on average better at the scale of days than the scale of dives. However, the performance of the models at the scale of days showed higher variability among individuals suggesting distinct foraging tactics. Dive-based metrics performed better when computed from high-resolution dive profiles than low-resolution dive profiles. Finally, regression trees produced more accurate predictions than linear models.ConclusionsOur study reveals that simple movement metrics do not predict feeding activity in free-ranging marine predators. This could emerge from differences between individuals, temporal scales, and the data resolution used, among many other factors. We conclude that these simple metrics should be avoided or carefully tested a priori with the studied species and the ecological context to account for significant influencing factors.

AB  - The official Predator Free New Zealand programme launched in 2016 is based on a hugely inspiring, aspirational ambition to eradicate all invasive rodents (rats Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus but not mice Mus musculus), mustelids (stoat Mustela erminea, ferret M. furo and weasel M. nivalis) and possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) from throughout New Zealand by 2050. Others had already been doing predator control for years, but this campaign has caught the public imagination as no previous operation ever has. It is achieving some impressive results at local scales, to well-deserved acclaim. But its underlying philosophical world view is less often discussed, which, I argue, poses a risk to its prospects of long-term, national-scale public support. World views matter much more than we usually recognise because they determine the questions we ask and the answers we consider reasonable. The history of environmental management in New Zealand offers some thought-provoking examples of programme managers unconsciously committed to unhelpful world views. Some overlook hidden assumptions, e.g. that top-down methods of imposing artificial mortality can exceed the high natural mortality of resilient pest species such as rats, stoats, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), or deer (Cervus elaphus). Some ask the wrong questions, such as how to find better ways to kill pests rather than how to reduce the numbers to be killed, which is usually controlled by food supplies from the bottom up. Some favour the wrong conclusion, such as when an observed change in pest numbers or distribution is attributed to suppression by artificial means even when the natural means are unknown. The philosophy of reasoning suggests that the PF2050 programme could best be considered as a game of two halves. First, short-term prevention of damage to native values by existing top-down suppression that cannot eradicate pest populations but can at least protect the most vulnerable native fauna until we can think of better means to save them. Second, longterm removal of pest populations by supplementing suppression with unknown future methods of minimising pest fertility and immigration.

AB  - A transmission dynamics model with the logistic growth of cystic echinococcus in sheep was formulated and analyzed. The basic reproduction number was derived and the results showed that the global dynamical behaviors were determined by its value. The disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when the value of the basic reproduction number is less than one; otherwise, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium and it is globally asymptotically stable. Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis of the basic reproduction number were also performed to screen the important factors that influence the spread of cystic echinococcosis. Contour plots of the basic reproduction number versus these important factors are presented, too. The results showed that the higher the deworming rate of dogs, the lower the prevalence of echinococcosis in sheep and dogs. Similarly, the higher the slaughter rate of sheep, the lower the prevalence of echinococcosis in sheep and dogs. It also showed that the spread of echinococcosis has a close relationship with the maximum environmental capacity of sheep, and that they have a remarkable negative correlation. This reminds us that the risk of cystic echinococcosis may be underestimated if we ignore the increasing number of sheep in reality.

AB  - Intercropping tea plants with Acacia confusa Merr. offers an environmentally sustainable approach to insect population control in tea plantations. However, the primary compounds in A. confusa responsible for this effect and their biosynthetic mechanisms remain undetermined. This study identified (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenol, and 1-hexanol as the major volatiles in A. confusa. Field experiments demonstrated that all three compounds affected the tea leafhopper, a significant pest. (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate repelled leafhoppers, while the other two compounds attracted them. Leafhopper feeding on tea leaves significantly decreased after fumigation with (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, potentially altering the metabolism of defensive substances in tea leaves. These findings suggest (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate as a crucial component for pest control in tea plantations intercropped with A. confusa. Furthermore, the study identified the nucleus- and cytoplasm-localized AcAAT4 in A. confusa as responsible for (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate biosynthesis. Notably, AcAAT4 expression and the production of the upstream transcription factor AcMYC2b corresponded to the (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate emission pattern. The research also elucidated the positive regulatory effects of nucleus-localized AcMYC2b on AcAAT4 expression. These findings elucidate the molecular basis of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate emission from A. confusa and provide a theoretical foundation for enhancing intercropping practices in tea plantations.

AB  - Simple Summary Getah virus (GETV) is an important zoonotic pathogen with an extensive host range, including horses, pigs, cattle, sheep, birds, and humans, resulting in substantial losses in the livestock and agricultural industries; as such, the prevalence and impact of GETV are significant concerns in China. In this study, the antigen domain of the E2 glycoprotein of GETV was expressed and purified in the Escherichia coli expression system, and an on-site immunochromatographic strip (ICS) was successfully developed to detect GETV antibodies in horses. The ICS has the advantages of being rapid, sensitive, specific, and is an effective method for the detection of GETV in horses that does not rely on special equipment or skilled personnel and can be used for the field diagnosis of GETV in horses.Abstract The prevalence and impact of Getah virus (GETV) are significant concerns in China. GETV can infect a wide range of animals, including horses, pigs, sheep, cattle, birds, and humans, resulting in substantial losses in the livestock and agricultural industries. GETV infection can cause the development of ulcers and inflammation in the mouth and gums of horses, which result in pain and discomfort and lead to symptoms such as reduced appetite, drooling, and difficulty chewing. As a result, there is a pressing need for efficient and rapid disease diagnosis methods. However, the currently available diagnostic methods have limitations in terms of operational time, equipment, and the experience of the individuals using them. In this study, a rapid, specific, and sensitive detection method was developed using a colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for the detection of antibodies against GETV in horses. To prepare the ICS, the antigen domain of the E2 glycoprotein of GETV was expressed using the Escherichia coli expression system after analysis with DNAstar v7.1 software. The nitrocellulose membrane was coated with rE2 protein or SPA to form the test line and control line, respectively. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the strip were verified. The results showed that the test strip had a detection limit of up to 1:320 dilutions for GETV-positive serum, with no cross-reactivity observed with other equine-susceptible pathogens such as equine arteritis virus (EAV), equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-I), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), equine influenza virus (EIV), African horse sickness virus (AHSV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Furthermore, the ICS exhibited a concordance rate of 94.0% when testing 182 clinical serum samples compared to the virus neutralization test. Overall, this ICS diagnosis method will be an effective tool for the rapid detection of GETV in the field.

AB  - Using Camellia oleifera shell (COS) as a raw material and phosphoric acid as the activator, activated Camellia oleifera shell carbon (COSC-0) was prepared and then modified by Fenton's reagent (named as COSC-1). SEM, GC-MS, FTIR, and specific surface area and pore analyzers were used to study the adsorption performance of COS, COSC-0, and COSC-1 on cooking fumes. Results showed that COSC-1 was the best adsorbent compared with COS and COSC-0. The adsorption quantity and penetrating time of COSC-1 were 44.04 mg/g and 4.1 h, respectively. Most aldehydes could be adsorbed by COSC-1, which was due to the large number of carbonyl and carboxyl groups generated on the surface of COSC-1 from the action of Fenton's reagent. The adsorption effect of COSC-1 on different types of pollutants in cooking fumes was analyzed based on the similar compatibility principle. COSC-1 showed a much higher adsorption effect on the strong polarity functional groups than on weak polar groups. The results provide a theoretical basis for the application of Camellia oleifera shell carbon adsorption technology in the treatment of cooking fumes.

AB  - The Chilean fauna of water bugs comprises seven species of semi-aquatic bugs (Heteroptera: Gerromorpha), representing five genera, three tribes, four subfamilies and four families; and 27 species and one subspecies of aquatic bugs (Heteroptera: Nepomorpha), representing four subgenera, eight genera, three tribes, seven subfamilies, and five families. We compare the fauna with neighboring countries and find that several otherwise widespread and abundant taxa are missing in Chile, but that Chepuvelia usingeri China, 1963 (Macroveliidae), Microvelia chilena Drake & Hussey, 1955 (Veliidae), Limnocoris dubiosus Montandon, 1898 (Naucoridae), Nerthra (Nerthra) parvula (Signoret, 1863), N. (N.) undosa Nieser & Chen, 1992, N. (Rhinodermacoris) praecipua Todd, 1957 (Gelastocoridae), and Sigara (Tropocorixa) termasensis (Hungerford, 1928a) (Corixidae) are endemic to the country. To this list, we add +Nerthra (Nerthra) subantarctica Faundez & Ashworth, 2015, even though the species is only known from a subfossil. We can also inform that while water bugs are found in the archipelagoes of southern Chile, no species has been reported from the Juan Fernandez Islands, Easter Island and other off-shore islands. Several of the Chilean species are without any close extant relatives, such as C. usingeri and Aquarius chilensis (Berg, 1881) (Gerridae), or with relatives in Oceania (N. praecipua), suggesting that historical events such as dispersal and extinction have had a major influence on the composition of the Chilean fauna.

AB  - The ciliary muscle constitutes a crucial element in refractive regulation. Investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms within the ciliary muscle during excessive contraction holds significance in treating ciliary muscle dysfunction. A guinea pig model of excessive contraction of the ciliary muscle induced by drops pilocarpine was employed, alongside the primary ciliary muscle cells was employed in in vitro experiments. The results of the ophthalmic examination showed that pilocarpine did not significantly change refraction and axial length during the experiment, but had adverse effects on the regulatory power of the ciliary muscle. The current data reveal notable alterations in the expression profiles of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1 alpha), ATP2A2, P53, alpha-SMA, Caspase-3, and BAX within the ciliary muscle of animals subjected to pilocarpine exposure, alongside corresponding changes observed in cultured cells treated with pilocarpine. Augmented levels of ROS were detected in both tissue specimens and cells, culminating in a significant increase in cell apoptosis in in vivo and in vitro experiments. Further examination revealed that pilocarpine induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and disrupted MMP, as evidenced by mitochondrial swelling and diminished cristae density compared to control conditions, concomitant with a noteworthy decline in antioxidant enzyme activity. However, subsequent blockade of Ca2+ channels in cells resulted in downregulation of HIF-1 alpha, ATP2A2, P53, alpha-SMA, Caspase-3, and BAX expression, alongside ameliorated mitochondrial function and morphology. The inhibition of Ca2+ channels presents a viable approach to mitigate ciliary cells damage and sustain proper ciliary muscle function by curtailing the mitochondrial damage induced by excessive contractions.
   Ciliary muscle overregulation causes apoptosis and senescence of ciliary muscle cells, which is clinically manifested as difficulty in visual accommodation. The molecular mechanism is manifested by intracellular accumulation of calcium ions caused by hypercontraction leading to ciliary muscle mitochondrial damage and increased cellular dysregulation. Nifedipine attenuates these cellular injuries by blocking calcium channels.image

AB  - Simple Summary Arma chinensis Fallou is a predaceous stink bug that can effectively control many kinds of agricultural and forest pests, such as fall armyworm, cotton bollworm and Colorado potato beetle. An insect-free artificial diet comprising chicken egg, tuna fish and raw pig liver was developed for A. chinensis. Several biological characteristics were diminished for A. chinensis reared on the artificial diet compared to the pupae of Chinese oak silk moth. Changes in the formulation of the diet were made in response to the transcriptome results and tested using biological characteristics. Several parameters were improved over 6 generations, although the improved artificial diet remained inferior to the pupae of Chinese oak silk moth regarding egg viability, fecundity, body weight, and nymphal development time. The current study reported the differential proteomic analysis revealing the mechanism of A. chinensis responding to the improved artificial diet. This information will be used to optimize the formulation of the artificial diet and decrease the cost of mass rearing in A. chinensis. The development of artificial diets could considerably simplify and reduce the cost of mass rearing of natural enemies compared to conventional rearing methods. However, improvement of artificial diets can be tedious, convoluted and often uncertain. For accelerating diet development, a better method that can offer informative feedback to target deficiencies in diet improvement is required. Our previous research demonstrated several biological characteristics were diminished in the insect predator, Arma chinensis Fallou, fed on an artificial diet formulated with the aid of transcriptomic methods compared to the Chinese oak silk moth pupae. The present study reports differential proteomic analysis by iTRAQ-PRM, which unravels the molecular mechanism of A. chinensis responding to improvements in the artificial diet. Our study provides multivariate proteomic data and provides comprehensive sequence information in studying A. chinensis. Further, the physiological roles of the differentially expressed proteins and pathways enable us to explain several biological differences between natural prey-fed and improved diet-fed A. chinensis, and subsequent proposed reformulation optimizations to artificial diets.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemical, is widely used in household plastic products. Large amounts of evidence indicate prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure causes neurodevelopmental disorders such as anxiety and autism. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the neurotoxic effects of adulthood BPA exposure remain poorly understood. Here, we provided evidences that adult mice treated with BPA (0.45 mg/kg/day) during 3 weeks exhibited sex-specific anxiety like behaviors. We demonstrated that the BPA-induced anxiety in male mice, but not in female mice, was closely associated with hyperactivity of glutamatergic neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT). Acute chemogenetic activation of PVT glutamatergic neurons caused similar effects on anxiety as observed in male mice exposed to BPA. In contrast, acute chemogenetic inhibition of PVT glutamatergic neurons reduced BPA-induced anxiety in male mice. Concomitantly, the BPA-induced anxiety was related with a down-regulation of alpha-1D adrenergic receptor in the PVT. Taken together, the present study indicated a previously unknown target region in the brain for neurotoxic effects of BPA on anxiety and implicated a possible molecular mechanism of action.

AB  - Background: During the establishment of a model of acute kidney injury (AKI) in pigs, we observed a high prevalence of malignant hyperthermia (MH). These complications led us to refine the anesthetic protocol. This publication describes the impact of the choice of anesthetics on the results obtained. Methods: Pigs were euthanized at the end of the procedure, without recovery from anesthesia. Three anesthetic protocols were used: sevoflurane inhalation (ProtocolA, n = 5), a combination of ketamine, medetomidine and diazepam by intravenous infusion (ProtocolB, n = 5), and a combination of ketamine, diazepam, medetomidine, glucose, and noradrenaline (ProtocolC, n = 5). All pigs received morphine for analgesia. AKI was induced by interrupting renal perfusion for 90 min. MH was diagnosed based on clinical and biological parameters. Results: All MH pigs belonged to ProtocolA. MH pigs showed significantly higher maximum rectal temperature (p = 0.04), maximum expired carbon dioxide (CO2; p = 0.04), maximum heart rate (HR; p = 0.03), plasma concentration of creatinine and potassium (p < 0.0001). Protocol A pigs had a significantly higher maximum HR (p = 0.01) and hyperkalemia compared to the two other groups (ProtocolB, p = 0.005 and ProtocolC, p < 0.0001). Pigs from ProtocolA had a significantly lower minimum mean arterial pressure (MAP) than ProtocolC group (p = 0.03) and MAP remained below 60 mmHg for longer (p = 0.004). In ProtocolB, minimum glycemia was lower than other groups (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Sevoflurane use was associated with the occurrence of MH, hemodynamic alterations and changes in plasma concentration of creatinine and potassium. These modifications can have a major impact on the validation of an experimental AKI model.

AB  - Vermicomposting has recently been shown to be an efficient recycling technology that would improve the quality of the final product by stimulating the microbial community. However, the efficacy of vermicomposting process, as well as the microbial biomass and community structure during this bioconversion process, depend on earthworm species and type of substrate ingested. Therefore, this study investigated the potential of native (Eudrilus eugeniae) and exotic (Eisenia fetida and Eisenia andrei) earthworms in Ethiopia on nutrient trans-formation and microbial dynamics and enzymatic activity during vermicomposting of substrates from mixed agricultural wastes. Earthworm inoculation transformed the wastes into a nutrient-rich humified vermicompost with a significant reduction in pH, TOC and C:N ratios (twofold reduction compared to non-composted sub-strates). An increase in worm growth and cocoon production were shown in substrates of cow manure mixed with soybean and banana residues (CM + SB) after gut transit through Eudrilus eugeniae and Eisenia fetida. Cow manure mixed with maize and soybean residues (CM + MS) were found suitable for Eisenia andrei. The same substrate and earthworm species resulted in the highest nutrient concentrations (N, P, K, and S) and higher C loss (up to 77% of the initial C) with lower N loss (<9%) compared to non-composted substrates. A considerable increase in microbial biomass, & beta;-glucosidase and dehydrogenase activity (two times more than control) was obtained in substrates of CM + SB using Eudrilus eugeniae. The PLFA analysis indicated that earthworms increased Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, actinomycetes, AMF, fungi18:1, and protozoan population, while they reduced fungal community (fungi18:2 and fungi18:3) compared to uninoculated control. In conclu-sion, vermicomposting earthworms could potentially valorize substrates from agricultural wastes into nutrient -rich and microbially improved vermicomposts.

AB  - Global environmental change impacts human security in both Vanuatu and Guam - but in very different ways. This paper studies both regions through a thematic analysis of problem-centered expert interviews with local stakeholders. It provides a comprehensive assessment of pathways from environmental change to human insecurity in both regions. Climate change impacts are omnipresent in Vanuatu and coproduced by fast lifestyle change and developmental challenges. In contrast, Guam is a highly developed US territory. This reduces climate vulnerability but generates other forms of environmental change from heavy military and touristic use. The article argues that human insecurity on Vanuatu and Guam is coproduced by the interplay between economic and (post-)colonial factors and environmental change. This demonstrates that vulnerability and environmental degradation are by no means natural or inevitable, but strongly shaped by socio-economic contexts and histories. This builds an important bridge between human security, political economy, and postcolonial perspectives on environmental security.

AB  - The competition for nutrients when pregnancy coincides with continuing growth in biologically immature adolescent girls increases their risk of preterm delivery and low birthweight and is partly replicated in the overnourished adolescent sheep paradigm. Although overfeeding to promote rapid maternal growth robustly leads to a reduction in average birthweight relative to slow-growing controlfed adolescents of equivalent age, the extent of prenatal compromise is variable. This retrospective analysis of a large cohort of identically managed pregnancies determined whether maternal anthropometry predicts the severity of fetal growth-restriction (FGR) in growing adolescents. Singleton pregnancies were established by embryo transfer in adolescents subsequently control-fed (n = 96) or overnourished. The latter pregnancies were classified as non-FGR (n = 116) or FGR (n = 96) if lamb birthweight was above or below the optimally fed control mean minus 2SD. A similar approach categorised placental growth-restriction (PIGR) and preterm delivery. Gestation length, placental mass and lamb birthweight were FGR < non-FGR < control (post hoc P < 0.01). Relative to the non-FGR group, overnourished dams with FGR were marginally leaner and lighter at conception (P = 0.023/P = 0.014) and had greater gestational weight gain (GWG) during the first-third of pregnancy (P < 0.001). GWG during this early period was also higher in PIGR compared with non-PIGR, and in very preterm vs term deliveries (P < 0.01). Likewise maternal leptin concentrations (fat accrual biomarker) were FGR > non-FGR by day 60, and changes in leptin throughout pregnancy predicted attenuated fetal cotyledon mass and birthweight (P = 0.01 to <0.001). The anthropometric antecedents of FGR in still-growing adolescent sheep originate in early pregnancy coincident with early placental development.

AB  - This study was aimed to explore the effect of astaxanthin (ASTX) and copper (Cu) supplementation on the growth, immunity, antioxidant, and blood biochemical status of growing Murrah buffalo heifers. Twenty-eight Murrah buffalo heifers were selected and randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 7) after blocking by body weight (BW) (129.86 +/- 5.37 kg) and age (9.05 +/- 1.02 months). The heifers were fed basal total mixed ration diet without supplementation (CON) or with ASTX (0.20 mg/kg BW; AX), Cu (10 mg/kg DM; CU), or ASTX + Cu (0.20 mg/kg BW + 10 mg/kg DM; AX + CU) for 90 days of study period. The result showed that BW and dry matter intake (DMI) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in AX + CU than that in other groups. The average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) were statistically higher (P < 0.05) in treatments than the values observed in CON. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was reported significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the AX + CU group followed by AX, CU, and CON groups. The total leukocytes count (TLC), lymphocytes, and total immunoglobulin (TIG) were statistically higher (P < 0.05) in AX + CU groups than that found in other groups. However, neutrophil % decreased (P < 0.05) in the AX + CU group than its level in other groups. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant (TAA) levels were observed higher (P < 0.05) in treatments supplemented with ASTX, Cu, or both than CON group. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentration was lower (P < 0.05) in treatments than its level found in the CON group. Glucose level was higher (P < 0.05); however, non-esterifies fatty acid (NEFA) was lower (P < 0.05) in AX + CU than that in others groups. The level of cholesterol (CH), HDL cholesterol (HDL-CH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were reported lower (P < 0.05) in the AX + CU group followed by CU, AX, and CON groups. The copper (Cu) level was higher (P < 0.05) in CU and AX + CU than AX and CON groups. The result of the present study indicated that the supplementation of ASTX, Cu alone, or their combination improved the growth, immunity, antioxidant status, and liver function of growing heifers.

AB  - The growing popularity of permanent makeup is associated with an increase in the need for treatments that effectively remove pigments from the skin. The risk of the radiation wavelength not being adjusted to the spectral ranges of individual pigments that compose the final color appears because complex dye compositions are used for permanent makeup. Incorrectly selected laser parameters may reduce the effectiveness of the treatment and increase the risk of thermal damage, leading to scarring and discoloration. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of laser permanent makeup removal using hyperspectral imaging. Five different dyes were implemented into the skin of the pig's ear. Then the dyes were removed using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. During the study, skin measurements were performed with a hyperspectral camera before and after laser application. The results were analyzed using GLCM, reflectance, and quadratic tree decomposition. Based on the obtained results, it was found that the most difficult dye to remove is white because it is characterized by high reflectivity of electromagnetic radiation. After the dye removal, there was a decrease in reflectance and contrast of GLCM and an increase in homogeneity for all dyes except for white. After the laser application, the pigments were distributed more equally in the skin.

The present study assessed possible effects of mineral NPK fertilizer (TF: 80 kg ha(-1) compound 25: 5:10) and ACC deaminase-containing, N-2-fixing, and P-solubilizing 6 bacteria strains as single (T-1-T-6:Pseudomonas fluorescens RC483, Pseudomonas fluorescens RC77E, Pseudomonas putida RC19b, Bacillus licheniformis RC5B2, Bacillus subtilis RC5A2, Bacillus pumilus RC7A1), binary (T-7: RC483 + RC5A2, T-8: RC77E + RC7A1), triple (T-9: RC77E + RC5A2+ RC5B2, T-10: RC483+ RC19b + RC7A1) and quadruple (T-11: RC77E + RC5B2 + RC7A1+ RC5A2) inoculations, chemical fertilizer (80 kg ha(-1) compound 25: 5: 10) and control treatments on growth, yield, yield, nutrient uptake and enzyme activity of Pazar-20 tea clones manufactured for commercial purposes. Experimental groups determined in the present study were formed by considering the results of our preliminary study and bacteria that do not have antagonistic effects on each other. Results showed that dual, triple and quadruple inoculations stimulated overal second and third leaf area, leaf yield, macro- and micro-nutrient concenrations, chlorophyll and anthocyanin content, and antioxidant, oxidative, catalytic, hydrolytic and quality-related enzymes activity. Tea plant growth responses were dependent on the inoculant strain and formulations used, as well as on the parameters evaluated. In conclusion, bacterial seed inoculations especially with quadruple bacterial formulation determined to be most effective in tea growth can improve tea yield and productivity on sustainable basis. The ability to increase enzyme activity, which may be important in taste and aroma, leaf antioxidant, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) and tea processing technology by using different combinations prepared with bacterial isolates will be able to a significant contribution to tea technology studies.

AB  - Gait disruptions following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are noted in the clinical population. To date, thorough analysis of gait changes in animal models of TBI to allow for correlation of pathological alterations and utilization of this as a therapeutic outcome have been limited. We therefore assessed gait using the DigiGait analysis system as well as overall locomotion using the Beam Walk test in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats following a commonly used model of TBI, parietal lobe controlled cortical impact (CCI). Rats underwent DigiGait baseline analysis 24 h prior to injury, followed by a moderate CCI in the left parietal lobe. Performance on the DigiGait was then assessed at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-injury, followed by histological analysis of brain tissue. Beam walk analysis showed a transient but significant impairment acutely after injury. Despite observance of gait disturbance in the clinical population, TBI in the parietal lobe of rats resulted in limited alterations in hind or forelimb function. General hindlimb locomotion showed significant but transient impairment. Significant changes in gait were observed to last through the sub-acute period, including right hindpaw angle of rotation and left forelimb and right hindlimb swing phase duration. Slight changes that did not reach statistical significant but may reflect subtle impacts of TBI on gait were reflected in several other measures, such as stride duration, stance duration and stance width. These results demonstrate that moderate-severe injury to the parietal cortex and underlying structures including corpus callosum, hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia result in slight changes to gait that can be detected using the Digigait analysis system.

AB  - Simple Summary: To improve the treatment of patients with kidney disease, new renal replacement therapies are being developed. Prior to their use in humans with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), these therapies need to be tested in animals with kidney disease. Goats seem particularly suitable because they are docile, have bodyweights comparable to humans and easily accessible neck veins to obtain blood access and tolerate frequent blood sampling, allowing for repeated monitoring. To obtain high blood concentrations of waste solutes that accumulate in patients with kidney disease and allow for the evaluation of solute removal by the new renal replacement therapies, we established kidney failure in five goats by partially blocking the blood supply of the kidneys via radiographic embolization. This resulted in stable moderate kidney disease. The administration of high-dose gentamicin caused a temporary further decline in kidney function. Although the response varied with animal, blood concentrations of waste solutes were representative of those found in ESKD patients. These animals can survive for more than ten months in good condition, allowing for the repetitive testing of new therapies in one animal, and therefore limiting the use of laboratory animals.
   A large animal model of (end-stage) kidney disease (ESKD) is needed for the preclinical testing of novel renal replacement therapies. This study aimed to create stable uremia via subtotal renal artery embolization in goats and induce a temporary further decline in kidney function by administration of gentamicin. Renal artery embolization was performed in five Dutch white goats by infusing polyvinyl alcohol particles in branches of the renal artery, aiming for the embolization of similar to 80% of one kidney and complete embolization of the contralateral kidney. Gentamicin was administered to temporarily further increase the plasma concentrations of uremic toxins. After initial acute kidney injury, urea and creatinine plasma concentrations stabilized 1.5 +/- 0.7 months post-embolization and remained elevated (12 +/- 1.4 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.8 mmol/L and 174 +/- 45 vs. 65 +/- 5.6 mu mol/L, resp.) during follow-up (16 +/- 6 months). Gentamicin induced temporary acute-on-chronic kidney injury with a variable increase in plasma concentrations of small solutes (urea 29 +/- 15 mmol/L, creatinine 841 +/- 584 mu mol/L, phosphate 2.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/L and potassium 5.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/L) and protein-bound uremic toxins representative of patients with ESKD. A uremic goat model characterized by stable moderate uremia was established via subtotal renal artery embolization with the induction of temporary severe acute-on-chronic kidney injury by the administration of gentamicin, allowing preclinical in vivo validation of novel renal replacement technologies.

AB  - Many quadrupedal mammals transition from a four-beat walk to a two-beat run (e.g. trot), but some transition to a four-beat run (e.g. amble). Recent analysis shows that a two-beat run minimizes work only for animals with a small pitch moment of inertia (MOI), though empirical MOI were not reported. It was also unclear whether MOI affects gait energetics at slow speeds. Here, I show that a particular normalization of the pitch moment of inertia (the Murphy number) has opposite effects on walking and running energetics. During walking, simultaneous forelimb and hindlimb contacts dampen pitching energy, favouring a four-beat gait that can distribute expensive transfer of support. However, the required pitching of a four-beat walk becomes more expensive as Murphy number increases. Using trajectory optimization of a simple model, I show that both the walking and slow running strategies used by dogs, horses, giraffes and elephants can be explained by work optimization under their specific Murphy numbers. Rotational dynamics have been largely ignored in quadrupedal locomotion, but appear to be a central factor in gait selection.

AB  - Day neutrality, or insensitivity to photoperiod (day length), is an important domestication trait in many crop species. Although the oilseed crop C. sativa has been cultivated since the Neolithic era, day-neutral accessions have yet to be described. We sought to leverage genetic diversity in existing germplasms to identify C. sativa accessions with low photoperiod sensitivity for future engineering of this trait. To do so, we quantified variation in hypocotyl length across 161 C. sativa accessions of 4-day-old seedlings grown in long-day and short-day conditions as a high-throughput approximation of variation in the photoperiod response. Soil-grown adult plants from selected accessions also showed variation in the response to day length in several traits; however, the responses in seedling and adult traits were not correlated, suggesting complex mechanistic underpinnings. Although RNA-seq experiments of the reference accession Licalla identified several differentially regulated Arabidopsis syntelogs involved in photoperiod response and development, including COL2, FT, LHY, and WOX4, expression of these genes in the accessions did not correlate with differences in their photoperiod sensitivity. Taken together, we show that all tested accessions show some degree of photoperiod response and that this trait is likely complex, involving several and separable seedling and adult traits.

AB  - The number of seed setting (NSS) is an important biological trait that affects tea propagation and yield. In this study, the NSS of an F1 tea population (n = 324) generated via a cross between 'Longjing 43' and 'Baihaozao' was investigated at two locations in two consecutive years. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of the NSS was performed, and 10 major QTLs were identified. In total, 318 genes were found in these 10 QTLs intervals, and 11 key candidate genes were preliminarily identified. Among them, the MADS-box transcription factor AGAMOUS LIKE 9 (CsAGL9, CSS0037962) located in the most stable QTL (qNSS2) was identified as a key gene affecting the NSS. CsAGL9 overexpression in Arabidopsis promoted early flowering and significantly decreased the length and number of pods and number of seeds per pod. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the auxin pathway, a key hormone pathway regulating plant reproduction, was highly affected in the transgenic lines. The auxin pathway was likewise the most prominent in the gene co-expression network study of CsAGL9 in tea plants. In summary, we identified CsAGL9 is essential for seed setting using QTL mapping integrated with RNA-seq, which shed a new light on the mechanism NSS of seed setting in tea plants.

AB  - An enormous diversity of specialized metabolites is produced in the plant kingdom, with each individual plant synthesizing thousands of these compounds. Previous research showed that benzoxazinoids, the most abundant class of specialized metabolites in maize, also function as signaling molecules by regulating the production callose as a defense response. We searched for additional benzoxazinoid-regulated specialized metabolites, characterized them, examined whether they too function in herbivore protection, and determined how Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm), a prominent maize pest, copes with these metabolites.<br /> We identified catechol acetylglucose (CAG) as a benzoxazinoid-regulated metabolite that is produced from salicylic acid via catechol and catechol glucoside. Genome-wide association studies of CAG abundance identified a gene encoding a predicted acetyltransferase. Knockout of this gene resulted in maize plants that lack CAG and over-accumulate catechol glucoside. Upon tissue disruption, maize plants accumulate catechol, which inhibits S. frugiperda growth. Analysis of caterpillar frass showed that S. frugiperda detoxifies catechol by glycosylation, and the efficiency of catechol glycosylation was correlated with S. frugiperda growth on a catechol-containing diet.<br /> Thus, the success of S. frugiperda as an agricultural pest may depend partly on its ability to detoxify catechol, which is produced as a defensive metabolite by maize.

AB  - To explore the role of intestinal microbiota on the occurrence of depression-like behavior. Twenty male adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. Depression-like behavior of the rats was validated using sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) after chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 3 weeks. Fecal microbiota was analyzed through 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The levels of 5-HT and inflammatory factors in the colon, brain and sera were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting analyses. The percentage of different types of immune cells in the peripheral blood was determined through flow cytometry. CUMS caused depression-like symptoms, including anhedonia and desperate behavior. Significant differences were found in the structure and abundance of intestinal microbiota. CUMS intervention significantly increased the levels of 5-HT and Tph1 in the colon and decreased the level of Scl6a4. The concentrations of 5-HT and Tph2 in the prefrontal and hippocampal tissues were lower, while IDO1 was higher. Certain cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-alpha, were significantly elevated in peripheral blood, while the percentage of CD3(+) CD4(+) double-positive cells and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio were downregulated in the CUMS group. Pearson correlation analysis showed that intestinal microbiota was significantly associated with not only the metabolism of 5-HT in intestinal and brain tissues, but also with the proportion of immune cells and certain cytokines. Stress can lead to disturbances in the intestinal microbial structure, which may contribute to depression by interfering with 5-HT metabolism and immune inflammatory responses.

AB  - Arbia goat is the most common indigenous breed of Northeastern Algeria, and it has an acceptable production capacity in that region. The gender, litter size, parity, year and month of kidding were used as source of variation of birth weight. A total of 474 kids, reared by nine smallholders under extensive breeding conditions,, were weighed immediately after birth during two seasons of kidding. A Linear mixed effects model (in R software) was used to analyse our results and revealed that average birth weight was 2.63 +/- 0.31 Kg with a significance difference between sex (2.69 +/- 0.32 Kg and 2.60 +/- 0.30 Kg for males and females, respectively) (P <= 0, 0001). Kids born as single were heavier (2.91 +/- 0.34 Kg) than those born as twins and triplets (2.61 +/- 0.26 Kg and 2.33 +/- 0.27 Kg, respectively) (P <= 0,0001). A positive relationship between age of dam and birth weight was found (P <= 0.01). Month of birth has a significant effect on birth weight. Synchronization of kidding during November and December is desired.

AB  - Pasture-based beef systems can provide cattle slurry and grass silage for anaerobic digestion (AD). However, sustainable production of these feedstocks within a livestock farm presents challenges. This study examined the farmland area required to provide slurry and grass silage for a 40 GWh biomethane plant, quantified greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and analyzed digestate management. Results indicated that 130 farms of 50 ha and a livestock unit (LU) of 2.1 LU/ha were required to meet the feedstock requirements of the AD plant. Assigning 15 % of the farmland to produce grass silage for AD decreased GHG emissions by 24 % compared to conventional beef farming. Depending on soil nutrient status, returning digestate to the farmland reduced the application of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers by up to 65 %, 33 % and 56 %, respectively. Future research should analyze the economic implication of biomethane production from these feedstocks at farm and supply chain scales.

AB  - An animal's diet breadth is a central aspect of its life history, yet the factors determining why some species have narrow dietary breadths (specialists) and others have broad dietary breadths (generalists) remain poorly understood. This challenge is pronounced in herbivorous insects due to incomplete host plant data across many taxa and regions. Here, we develop and validate machine learning models to predict pollen diet breadth in bees, using a bee phylogeny and occurrence data for 682 bee species native to the United States, aiming to better understand key drivers. We found that pollen specialist bees made an average of 72.9% of their visits to host plants and could be predicted with high accuracy (mean 94%). Our models predicted generalist bee species, which made up a minority of the species in our dataset, with lower accuracy (mean 70%). The models tested on spatially and phylogenetically blocked data revealed that the most informative predictors of diet breadth are plant phylogenetic diversity, bee species' geographic range, and regional abundance. Our findings also confirm that range size is predictive of diet breadth and that both male and female specialist bees mostly visit their host plants. Overall, our results suggest we can use visitation data to predict specialist bee species in regions and for taxonomic groups where diet breadth is unknown, though predicting generalists may be more challenging. These methods can thus enhance our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions, leading to improved conservation outcomes and a better understanding of the pollination services bees provide.

AB  - A well-known insect phenomenon is colour polymorphism, from which the species hopes to gain some ecological advantage. Herbivores adapt to the colours of their environment to reduce their chances of becoming prey, while predators use camouflage colours to succeed in hiding from prey. The larvae of the cosmopolitan, highly invasive cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hbn., Lep.: Noctuidae) also benefit from this morphological polymorphism. Their fully-developed larvae can take on various colours when feeding on foliage. Our study aimed to determine the host plant-related colour adaptation of H. armigera larvae collected from different plant organs using different spectral analysis methods. Our studies, based on colour analysis of photographic images, showed that the colour of fully-developed larvae of the species is highly correlated with the colour of the damaged nutrient plant. The dominant colours of the larvae show a high similarity with the colours of the consumed host plant parts. The RGB-based analysis confirmed that larval colours are clustered according to the host plant's organs and are mainly located in the yellow and green regions of the visible light spectrum. All these results confirm the extraordinary adaptive capabilities of this invasive species, which, among other things, verify its worldwide distribution.

AB  - Myostatin (MSTN), a member of the TGF beta superfamily, negatively affects skeletal muscle growth and controls muscle development at stages of pre-natal muscle growth. Marker-assisted selection with molecular markers of the MSTN gene can be used in animal husbandry for higher-quality and more economically profitable lambs. The study aims to identify multi-locus genotypes within the MSTN gene regions as molecular markers for fattening, feed efficiency, and carcass traits in Latvian sheep. This analysis was conducted on 76 intensively fattened male lambs representing six breeds in Latvia. Nine genotypes were identified based on four SNPs in the promoter and exon 1 regions, while six and four SNPs in introns 1 and 2 led to the formation of 14 and 10 genotypes, respectively. Six genotypes identified in the 3 ' UTR were significantly linked to traits such as birth weight, slaughter yield, muscle development, fat depth, average daily gain, dry matter intake, and feed efficiency. Genotypes of intron 1 were associated with slaughter yield, while genotypes of intron 2 were linked to fat depth, dry matter intake, and residual weight gain. The study concludes that MSTN gene SNPs can be used in selection to enhance sheep breeds in Latvia and improve economic outcomes for breeders.

AB  - Fluctuations in kynurenic acid (KYNA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the brain reflect its neurological status. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of transiently elevated KYNA concentrations in the cerebroventricular circulation on the expression of BDNF and its high-affinity tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) in specific structures of the sheep brain. Intracerebroventricularly cannulated anestrous sheep were subjected to a series of four 30 min infusions of KYNA: 4 x 5 mu g/60 mu L/30 min (KYNA20, n = 6) and 4 x 25 mu g/60 mu L/30 min (KYNA100, n = 6) or a control infusion (n = 6), at 30 min intervals. Sections of the hippocampal CA3 field, amygdala (AMG), prefrontal cortex (PCx), and the hypothalamic medial-basal (MBH) and preoptic (POA) areas were dissected from the brain immediately after the experiment. The highest concentration of BDNF protein was found in the CA3 field (p < 0.001), which was 8-fold higher than in the AMG and 12-fold higher than that in the PCx (MBH and POA were not analyzed). The most pronounced BDNF mRNA expression was observed in the MBH, followed by the PCx, POA, AMG and CA3, while the highest abundance of TrkB mRNA was recorded in the AMG, followed by the MBH, PCx, CA3, and POA. KYNA increased (p < 0.05-p < 0.01) BDNF protein levels and the expression of its gene in the brain structures were examined, with the effect varying by dose and brain region. KYNA, particularly at the KYNA100 dose, also increased (p < 0.01) TrkB gene expression, except for the AMG, where the lower KYNA20 dose was more effective (p < 0.01). These findings suggest a positive relationship between KYNA levels in the cerebroventricular circulation and BDNF-TrkB expression in specific brain regions in a sheep model. This indicates that a transient increase in the CSF KYNA concentration can potentially restore BDNF production, for which deficiency underlies numerous neurological disorders.

AB  - African wild pigs have a contentious evolutionary and biogeographic history. Until recently, desert warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) and common warthog (P. africanus) were considered a single species. Molecular evidence surprisingly suggested they diverged at least 4.4 million years ago, and possibly outside of Africa. We sequenced the first whole-genomes of four desert warthogs and 35 common warthogs from throughout their range. We show that these two species diverged much later than previously estimated, 400,000-1,700,000 years ago depending on assumptions of gene flow. This brings it into agreement with the paleontological record. We found that the common warthog originated in western Africa and subsequently colonized eastern and southern Africa. During this range expansion, the common warthog interbred with the desert warthog, presumably in eastern Africa, underlining this region's importance in African biogeography. We found that immune system-related genes may have adaptively introgressed into common warthogs, indicating that resistance to novel diseases was one of the most potent drivers of evolution as common warthogs expanded their range. Hence, we solve some of the key controversies surrounding warthog evolution and reveal a complex evolutionary history involving range expansion, introgression, and adaptation to new diseases.

AB  - Litter size records from two lines of Tunisian Barbarine sheep were analysed across parities using an RRM. A total of 2751 and 2562 litter records from the first to the sixth parity from the prolific and the conventional lines, respectively, were included in the analysis. The total number of animals in the pedigree was 1277 for the prolific line and 1102 for the conventional line. The estimation of genetic parameters was based on Bayesian inference under categorical distribution. Fixed effects included the year and month of lambing and a fixed quadratic regression coefficient for the lambing number with Legendre polynomials. The random additive and permanent environmental effects were modelled by second-order Legendre polynomials. Heritability ranged from 0.04 to 0.18 for the prolific line and from 0.17 to 0.39 for the conventional line. Genetic correlations within trait through parities showed a wide range of values, from 0.25 to 0.96 for the prolific line and from zero to 0.93 for the conventional line. Due to the changes in the variances and the genetic correlations different from unity across parities, the use of an RRM is recommended to analyse litter size in the Barbarine sheep.

AB  - Cellular diversity supports the computational capacity and flexibility of cortical circuits. Accordingly, principal neurons at the CA1 output node of the murine hippocampus are increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous population. Their genes, molecular content, intrinsic morpho-physiology, connectivity, and function seem to segregate along the main anatomical axes of the hippocampus. Since these axes reflect the temporal order of principal cell neurogenesis, we directly examined the relationship between birthdate and CA1 pyramidal neuron diversity, focusing on the ventral hippocampus. We used a genetic fate-mapping approach that allowed tagging three groups of age-matched principal neurons: pioneer, early-, and late-born. Using a combination of neuroanatomy, slice physiology, connectivity tracing, and cFos staining in mice, we show that birthdate is a strong predictor of CA1 principal cell diversity. We unravel a subpopulation of pioneer neurons recruited in familiar environments with remarkable positioning, morpho-physiological features, and connectivity. Therefore, despite the expected plasticity of hippocampal circuits, given their role in learning and memory, the diversity of their main components is also partly determined at the earliest steps of development.

AB  - This study provides intriguing mechanistic insights into the innate immunity of the pigeonpea wild relative, Cajanus platycarpus , in comparison to the cultivated Cajanus cajan , based on biochemical and metabolic changes during Helicoverpa armigera infestation. Over a 96 h herbivory challenge, both species exhibited 164 metabolites, with 54 undergoing significant alterations. In C. platycarpus , primary carbohydrates such as sucrose, glucose, galactose, and mannose decreased, while structural carbohydrates like xylose, talose, and tagatose accumulated, indicating cell wall damage in C. cajan . Notably, C. platycarpus down-regulated most amino acids except for phenylalanine, which is crucial for the synthesis of defense compounds. The linoleic/linolenic acid pathway, which produces jasmonic acid, was exclusively identified in C. platycarpus , highlighting active defense. As herbivory continued, levels of galactinol, mannitol, and pinitol significantly increased in C. platycarpus , while sorbitol and xylitol levels rose in C. cajan . Essentially, C. platycarpus reduced nutrient availability to insects, enhanced specific defense hormones and pathways, and maintained reactive oxygen species (ROS) equilibrium. These findings offer significant potential for understanding the biology of the wild relative and developing innovative strategies for herbivore control and food sustainability.

AB  - BackgroundDepressive disorder is a common and serious public health challenge globally. Fructus arctii is a traditional medicinal plant ingredient with diverse pharmacological effects. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of Fructus arctii in alleviating depressive-like behaviors.Materials and MethodsWe established a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression mouse model to assess the antidepressant effects of Fructus arctii. BV2 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to mimic neuronal damage. Behavioral tests, including the sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, and forced swim test, were conducted to evaluate the impact of Fructus arctii on depressive-like behaviors. Let-7e expression was detected by RT-qPCR, and TLR4 signaling pathway activation was evaluated by western blot analysis, which also assessed the inflammatory response by measuring levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, and iNOS. Immunohistological analysis was conducted to detect the expression of microglia markers. Luciferase reporter assays verified the interaction between let-7e and TLR4.ResultsFructus arctii administration effectively alleviated depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS in mice, as evidenced by improved sucrose preference and reduced immobility time in behavioral tests. Mechanistically, Fructus arctii reversed the CUMS-induced downregulation of let-7e and upregulation of TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels in mice hippocampus tissues. In addition, Fructus arctii suppressed microglial activation and reduced the levels of inflammatory factors by upregulating let-7e. Let-7e was verified to bind to TLR4, thereby negatively regulating its expression. TLR4 overexpression reversed the suppressive effect of let-7e upregulation on inflammatory reactions and microglial activation. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of let-7e agomiR alleviated depressive-like behavior and inhibited microglial activation in vivo.ConclusionIn summary, Fructus arctii mitigates depression by regulating the let-7e/TLR4/MyD88 pathway, offering new insights into potential depression therapies.

AB  - Only five species of the once-diverse Rhinocerotidae remain, making the reconstruction of their evolutionary history a challenge to biologists since Darwin. We sequenced genomes from five rhinoceros species (three extinct and two living), which we compared to existing data from the remaining three living species and a range of outgroups. We identify an early divergence between extant African and Eurasian lineages, resolving a key debate regarding the phylogeny of extant rhinoceroses. This early Miocene (similar to 16 million years ago [mya]) split post-dates the land bridge formation between the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian landmasses. Our analyses also show that while rhinoceros genomes in general exhibit low levels of genome-wide diversity, heterozygosity is lowest and inbreeding is highest in the modern species. These results suggest that while low genetic diversity is a long-term feature of the family, it has been particularly exacerbated recently, likely reflecting recent anthropogenic-driven population declines.

AB  - As one of the most important agronomic traits of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis), the timing of bud flush (TBF) affects the sales price of tea beverages. Here, we performed specific-locus amplified fragment (SLAF) sequencing and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis on 200 offspring of natural hybridization from the 'Qianmei 601'. A total of 796,294 SLAF tags and 2,324,211 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained by sequencing. The 200 tea germplasms were clustered into four groups by population structure, principal component analysis (PCA) and phylogenetic tree analysis. GWAS identified twelve SNPs loci that were significantly associated with TBF traits. Seven candidate genes associated with TBF were subsequently identified by scanning in the regions within 1 Mb SNP loci. In addition, we found that two candidate genes (ARP and WRKY) were highly expressed in individuals with early TBF. Interestingly, cloning and sequencing of the ARP gene revealed C-G variants between the early and late TBF individuals. Our results provide a theoretical basis for early TBF breeding and functional gene analysis in tea plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Recombination-activating genes (RAGs) play a crucial role in the V(D)J recombination process. In this study, we generated RAG2 knockout (KO) pigs and evaluated the impact of RAG2 KO on the development of immune organs and immune cells. The thymus and spleen sizes of RAG2 KO pigs were significantly smaller than those of wild-type (WT) pigs, and their structures were highly disorganized and devoid of notable characteristic structures, indicating that RAG2 KO leads to dysplasia of the organs. The proportion of mature T and B lymphocytes in the circulation of RAG2 KO pigs was significantly reduced as compared to WT pigs. These findings successfully verified the immunodeficiency phenotype of RAG2 KO pigs. This study may provide immunodeficient animals for the development of tumor models and humanized animals.Abstract Recombination-activating genes (RAGs) play a crucial role in the V(D)J recombination process and the development of immune cells. The development of the immune system and its mechanisms in pigs exhibit greater similarity to those of humans compared to other animals, thus rendering pigs a valuable tool for biomedical research. In this study, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and somatic cell nuclear transfer technology to generate RAG2 knockout (KO) pigs. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of RAG2 KO on the immune organs and immune cell development through morphological observations, blood analysis and flow cytometry technology. RAG2 KO cell lines were used as donors for cloning. The reconstructed embryos were transplanted into 4 surrogate sows, and after 116 days of gestation, 2 sows gave birth to 12 live piglets, all of which were confirmed to be RAG2 KO. The thymus and spleen sizes of RAG2 KO pigs were significantly smaller than those of wild-type (WT) pigs. Hematoxylin-eosin staining results revealed that the thymus and spleen tissue structures of RAG2 KO pigs were disorganized and lacked the characteristic structures, indicating that RAG2 KO leads to dysplasia of the thymus and spleen. Hematological analysis demonstrated that the total number of white blood cells and lymphocytes in the circulation of RAG2 KO pigs was significantly lower, while the number of eosinophils was higher. Flow cytometry results indicated that the proportions of mature T and B lymphocytes were significantly reduced compared to WT pigs. These findings successfully verified the immunodeficiency phenotype of RAG2 KO pigs. This study may provide experimental animals for the development of tumor models and humanized animals.

AB  - Simple Summary This study addresses the critical need for accurate prediction of key environmental factors-temperature, humidity, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide-in pig houses, essential for pigs' growth and health. Traditional methods face challenges in predictive accuracy and stability. We introduce an innovative OTDBO-TCN-GRU model, a hybrid framework combining the dung beetle algorithm, temporal convolutional network, and gated recurrent unit, enhanced by the Osprey optimization algorithm (OOA). This model synergistically merges DBO's optimization power, TCN's long-term dependency handling, and GRU's proficiency in nonlinear sequence management, offering improved global detection capabilities. The OTDBO-TCN-GRU model showcases superior accuracy in environmental prediction, evident from its mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0474, mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0039, and correlation coefficient of 0.9871. It significantly surpasses the traditional DBO-TCN-GRU and OOA models, reducing MAE and MSE by 37.2% and 66.7%, and 48.7% and 74.2%, respectively. Moreover, it outperforms mainstream models like GRU, LSTM, and XGBoost in terms of accuracy. This model significantly improves the forecasting of environmental conditions within pig houses, which is vital for maintaining optimal living conditions and ensuring the well-being of pigs.Abstract Temperature and humidity, along with concentrations of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, are critical environmental factors that significantly influence the growth and health of pigs within porcine habitats. The ability to accurately predict these environmental variables in pig houses is pivotal, as it provides crucial decision-making support for the precise and targeted regulation of the internal environmental conditions. This approach ensures an optimal living environment, essential for the well-being and healthy development of the pigs. The existing methodologies for forecasting environmental factors in pig houses are currently hampered by issues of low predictive accuracy and significant fluctuations in environmental conditions. To address these challenges in this study, a hybrid model incorporating the improved dung beetle algorithm (DBO), temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), and gated recurrent units (GRUs) is proposed for the prediction and optimization of environmental factors in pig barns. The model enhances the global search capability of DBO by introducing the Osprey Eagle optimization algorithm (OOA). The hybrid model uses the optimization capability of DBO to initially fit the time-series data of environmental factors, and subsequently combines the long-term dependence capture capability of TCNs and the non-linear sequence processing capability of GRUs to accurately predict the residuals of the DBO fit. In the prediction of ammonia concentration, the OTDBO-TCN-GRU model shows excellent performance with mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.0474, 0.0039, and 0.9871, respectively. Compared with the DBO-TCN-GRU model, OTDBO-TCN-GRU achieves significant reductions of 37.2% and 66.7% in MAE and MSE, respectively, while the R2 value is improved by 2.5%. Compared with the OOA model, the OTDBO-TCN-GRU achieved 48.7% and 74.2% reductions in the MAE and MSE metrics, respectively, while the R2 value improved by 3.6%. In addition, the improved OTDBO-TCN-GRU model has a prediction error of less than 0.
   3 mg/m3 for environmental gases compared with other algorithms, and has less influence on sudden environmental changes, which shows the robustness and adaptability of the model for environmental prediction. Therefore, the OTDBO-TCN-GRU model, as proposed in this study, optimizes the predictive performance of environmental factor time series and offers substantial decision support for environmental control in pig houses.

AB  - The main drawback in developing in vitro embryo production (IVP) systems in wild species, such as the Iberian red deer, is that access to these animals is usually restricted, and long distances from the collection site to the laboratory are usually inevitable. Prolonged ovary storage is known to negatively influence the quality and developmental competence of the oocytes used for IVP. To overcome this issue, we evaluated the effect of adding a caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk, to the in vitro maturation media to improve the quality and developmental potential of Iberian red deer oocytes. Oocytes were in vitro matured with and without z-DEVD-fmk, and the following parameters were analyzed: viability, early apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation, and relative abundance of mRNA transcript related to apoptosis. Moreover, oocyte maturation and blastocyst rates were also assessed. The results showed that z-DEVD-fmk decreased early apoptosis (inhibitor= 44.44 +/- 3.6% vs. control= 60 +/- 2.79%), DNA fragmentation (inhibitor= 57.83 +/- 1.91% vs. control= 74.62 +/- 1.91%), caspase-3 activity (inhibitor= 41.88 +/- 3.42% vs. control= 67.10 +/- 3.42%) and the relative abundance of TP53 and ITM2B transcripts, as well as increased the number of live (inhibitor= 41.48 +/- 2.32% vs. control= 20 +/- 1.8%) and in vitro-matured oocytes (inhibitor= 88.18 +/- 1.99% vs. control= 74.01 +/- 1.99%) rates. Nevertheless, the blastocyst production was not different between both experimental groups (inhibitor: 7.35 +/- 2.30 vs. control: 13.77 +/- 2.30). The supplementation of z-DEVD-fmk to the maturation medium improved the quality of Iberian red deer oocytes. Further research and alternative strategies are needed to evaluate if this inhibitor could still enhance the developmental potential of oocytes during prolonged ovarian transport.

AB  - The tea green leafhopper, Empoasca onukii Matsuda (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is currently one of the most threatening pests of tea production in China. Several approaches have been used to identify the resistance of different tea cultivars to this important tea pest. However, relatively limited information has been documented about its oviposition preferences. This study aimed to elucidate the preferential oviposition of E. onukii among 24 tea cultivars. Towards this objective, a multi-selective test for E. onukii oviposition was conducted in the laboratory, and the egg densities of E. onukii on 24 varieties were also surveyed in plantations at different time periods during the tea plant growing season in 2019. There was a significant difference in E. onukii egg densities among the 24 cultivars studied in both laboratory tests and the field investigations. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the laboratory and field data for the number of eggs laid per cultivar. According to the laboratory and field evaluations, 2 cultivars were identified as very-susceptible for E. onukii oviposition, while another 5 cultivars were assigned as susceptible, 9 cultivars were classified as resistant and 2 cultivars were identified as very-resistant, respectively. This information on the oviposition preference for E. onukii on different cultivars could be used as a selection parameter for further breeding of leafhopper-resistant tea cultivars.

AB  - Simple Summary Citrus cultivation is affected in many parts of the world because of a devastating disease, huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening. In Florida, nearly all commercial citrus is compromised due to HLB, and the disease has spread to other citrus-growing regions of the United States, California and Texas. In California, testing Asian citrus psyllids (ACPs) for the HLB pathogen has been an essential part of integrated pest management. ACP and HLB surveys are essential for disease management in areas where HLB is not widespread. We developed improved ACP traps that can be deployed in the field along with the standard yellow sticky traps. The reusable traps were designed with Rhinoceros computer software and a 3D printer. These traps can be deployed for several months and provide a dynamic sampling mechanism for an improved disease survey strategy. In the present study, ACPs from the 3D-printed traps are collected in a preservative and appear suitable for HLB testing. The evaluation of traps in Florida and California under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions indicates that the 3D-printed traps can capture ACPs with about the same efficiency as the sticky traps. They are easy to handle and provide an important field tool for HLB management. Citrus huanglongbing (HLB) is a severe problem for citrus cultivation. The disease management programs benefit from improved field tools suitable for surveying the ACP vector (Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae)) and the associated pathogen. In the present study, we utilize three-dimensional (3D) printers and design tools to develop traps that can capture and preserve ACPs. Three novel, 3D-printed traps were designed and evaluated: stem trap, and cylinder traps 1 and 2. The traps and yellow sticky cards were deployed weekly for 8 months in 2 non-commercial citrus groves in Florida; in California, the traps were evaluated for 12 months in field cages and 4 citrus groves. The stem traps captured lower numbers of ACPs at all experimental sites compared to the cylinder traps. Capture rates in the cylinder traps were comparable to the sticky trap, making the device a viable tool for monitoring field ACPs. The two main advantages of using the reusable 3D traps over standard methods of ACP and HLB surveys include dynamic sampling that can be conducted year-round and the capture of ACPs that can be preserved and tested. Improved trapping may facilitate quick management decisions and mitigate HLB.

AB  - Of the 24 Greenland interstadials in the Last Glacial-interglacial cycle (LGIC) only five are conventionally recognised in Britain. This paper aims to improve understanding of the LGIC in Britain from a site at Arclid, Cheshire. Sediments were characterised and luminescence used to establish a chronology. This found that the Chelford Sand Formation spans 77-47 ka with sand deposited initially by aeolian but later by fluvial transportation. Coleoptera and Diptera from the basal peat lens provided a reconstruction for a heather-rich heathland environment grazed by large herbivores, with summer temperatures between 13 and 18 degrees C, and winter temperatures between -14 and 1 degrees C. Flies included the earliest records of the blood-sucking horsefly Haematopota pluvialis, and the soldierfly Chloromyia formosa. The overlying Stockport Sand Formation was deposited fluvioglacially between 47-41 ka with the upper Stockport Till formed by the advance of the last British icesheet after-33 ka. Stenothermic beetle analysis from Arclid indicate similarities with results from other British mid LGIC sites, some of which are at or beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating and may be of a similar age to Arclid. Basal organic sediments found at Arclid along with other reassigned sites are proposed as a new Arclid Interstadial. A revised British LGIC chronostratigraphy has the Wretton, Chelford and Brimpton Interstadials and the previously suggested but not widely recognised Cassington Interstadial. The Arclid Interstadial occurred after these, but prior to the Upton Warren Interstadial complex. This closes the previous gap in interstadials between the Brimpton Interstadial and the Upton Warren Interstadial complex within the British chronostratigraphy.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - BackgroundClimate change and anthropogenic activities are accelerating environmental changes, challenging wild animals' survival. Behavioral plasticity, such as adjusting habitat selection and foraging activity, is a key mechanism for responding to rapid environmental changes in the Anthropocene era. However, this shift may expose animals to new challenges. Moreover, not all behavioral plasticity is adaptive, as evidenced by ecological traps. This study focuses on Poyang Lake, a Ramsar wetland and a critical wintering ground for waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Historically, the migratory patterns of waterbirds were synchronized with the plant life cycle. However, recent hydrological regime changes have diminished suitable habitats and food resources, thereby posing significant conservation challenges for waterbirds.MethodsUtilizing multiyear satellite tracking data, we examined the variations in wintering home range and behaviors of four herbivorous waterbird species between natural and artificial wetlands in Poyang Lake under different hydrological conditions.ResultsOur results reveal significant differences in home range area and movement speed among species and across hydrological years. All species demonstrated a marked increase in their use of artificial wetlands under unfavorable conditions. Specifically, the Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) shifted its distribution to artificial wetlands during drought years while favoring natural wetlands under normal conditions, indicating a stress-induced adaptation. In contrast, the Bean Goose (A. fabalis) and Swan Goose (A. cygnoid) displayed greater behavioral plasticity. Notably, the Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) increasingly used artificial wetlands, likely due to human protection, raising concerns about potential ecological traps. Additionally, waterbirds foraging in artificial wetlands generally exhibited higher movement speeds during drought conditions. This behavior suggests maladaptation and a more dispersed distribution.ConclusionsOur study underscored the critical role of artificial wetlands in supporting migratory waterbirds during drought, though elevated movement speeds observed in these habitats suggest potential maladaptation. Species-specific responses raise concerns about ecological traps if these habitats fail to meet key ecological needs. To ensure long-term conservation, efforts should focus on preserving natural wetlands and enhancing the quality of artificial habitats. Future research should prioritize long-term monitoring to guide habitat management and address species-specific needs in the face of climate change and habitat degradation.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress impacts animal production, reproduction, health, and welfare, making it profitable to raise animals adapted to the climate. In this context, Caracu (Bos taurus taurus) is the large Creole breed adapted to the Brazilian tropical climate. Thus, this study investigated the influence of environmental temperature on thermoregulation (surface temperature obtained by infrared thermography and rectal temperature), hormonal (cortisol, cortisone, and progesterone), and hematological characteristics of Caracu. The results revealed that heat stress changes several physiological characteristics of Caracu cattle, although most of them remained within the regular values observed for taurine Creole breeds. In addition, males and females exhibited differences in their responses to heat stress. The decrease in animal production caused by heat stress is a growing concern. Therefore, the identification and wide use of naturally resistant animals in terminal crossbreeding schemes to explore heterosis and complementarity, and in pure herds, is important to minimize the impact of heat stress on animal production. This study evaluated the influence of environmental temperature on thermoregulation, hormonal, and hematological characteristics in Caracu cattle. Blood samples, hair length, coat and muzzle colors, rectal (RT), and surface temperatures were collected from 48 males and 43 females before (morning) and after sun exposure for eight hours (afternoon). Infrared thermography (IRT) was used to identify superficial temperature that exhibits a high correlation with RT. Hematological parameters, hormone concentrations, RT, and the superficial temperature obtained by IRT that exhibited the highest correlation with RT were evaluated by variance analysis. Regarding IRT, the lower left side of the body (LS) showed the highest correlation with the RT. Interaction between period and sex was observed for LS, cortisol, and eosinophils. Cortisone, progesterone, and RT were influenced by period and sex. Neutrophils and segmented neutrophils were influenced by the period, which showed the highest concentrations after sun exposure. Platelets, leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes were influenced by sex. Heat stress changes several physiological characteristics where males and females exhibited differences in their responses to heat stress. Furthermore, most characteristics evaluated remained within the regular values observed for taurine Creole breeds, showing that Caracu is adapted to tropical climates.

AB  - Simple Summary: There were not long-term studies in the literature reviewed on how machine milking parameters (pulsation rate, pulsation ratio and system vacuum) affect milk production, milk composition, animal welfare and udder health throughout the lactation of Murciano-Granadina goats. After previous experiments developed in short term by this research group, the aim of the present experiments was to test during one entire lactation duration the best combination of system vacuum and pulsation parameters using two types of milking parlours, one with low-line pipes and the other with mid-line pipes to obtain optimal values of milking duration, milk yield, animal welfare and udder health. The results confirmed that the optimal parameters to milk Murciano-Granadina goats are different in mid-line milking parlours and in low-line milking parlours. The milking parameters must be correctly programmed to achieve optimal milking efficiency and milk quality values, enhancing the animals' sanitary status and farm profitability. The conclusions of this project have established work guidelines for small ruminants' farmers and technicians to improve milk quantity, milk quality and animal welfare.
   Recent short-term studies on Murciano-Granadina goats have established that the optimal parameters to set up the milking machines are different according to the milk pipes height. Two groups of 52 fresh goats each were employed in 2 different experiments to confirm during an entire lactation period the best combinations of system vacuum pulsation rate and pulsator ratio in low-line and mid-line milking parlours. The experiment performed in the low-line milking parlour included one group milked with 40 KPa vacuum system level, 90 puls/min pulsation rate and 60/40 pulsation and a second group milked with 38 KPa vacuum system level, 90 puls/min pulsation rate and 60/40 pulsation ratio. The experiment carried out in mid-line included one group milked with 40 KPa vacuum system level, 90 puls/min pulsation rate and 60/40 pulsation ratio and a second group milked with 40 KPa vacuum system level, 120 puls/min pulsation rate and 60/40 pulsation ratio. Variables studied included milking efficiency, milk composition, cortisol, SCC and intramammary infections, teat-end oedema after milking and vacuum dynamics during milking. Considering the results of an entire lactation period, it was confirmed that when milking in mid-line, the combination of 40 KPa system vacuum, 90 cycles/min pulsation rate and 60/40 pulsator ratio showed optimal results of the above-mentioned variables. On the other hand, the use of 40 KPa in a low-line system increased the milk cortisol values (0.34 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.1 ng/mL) without any other advantage. Thus, the recommendation is to use a combination of 38 KPa system vacuum, 90 cycles/min pulsation rate and 60/40 pulsator ratio to enhance animal welfare.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of adding 360 mg/kg niacinamide (NAM) to diets on nutrient metabolism, providing insights into how dietary NAM supplementation enhances nitrogen utilization and growth performance in pigs. Forty growing-finishing pigs were randomly assigned to one of four experimental diets as follows: basal diet + 30 mg/kg NAM (CON), basal diet + 360 mg/kg NAM (CON + NAM), low-protein diet + 30 mg/kg NAM (LP), and low-protein diet + 360 mg/kg NAM (LP + NAM). Results showed that supplementation of both the CON and LP diets with 360 mg/kg NAM resulted in decreased urea nitrogen concentrations and carbamyl phosphate synthetase-I activity (p < 0.05). The pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in the serum and liver, as well as the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 in the ileum mucosa, was increased by supplementing the LP diet with 360 mg/kg NAM (p < 0.05). The LP diet with 360 mg/kg NAM increased the villi length to crypt depth, mRNA expression of glucose transporters 1 and 2 and alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1, and mRNA expression of mechanistic target of the rapamycin 1 in the ileum (p < 0.05). Additionally, 360 mg/kg NAM supplementation in the LP diet reduced ileal Lactobacillus abundance (LDA > 4) and increased ileal microbial nucleotide and purine metabolism (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that addition of 360 mg/kg NAM to the LP diet reduced urea production in the liver, enhanced glucose and amino acid absorption and transport in the ileum, and improved glucose metabolism.

AB  - As teeth develop, their mineralised composition is a bio-recorder of diet, environment, and growth. High-resolution elemental mapping provides a tool to reveal records of life history within teeth. The relative concentrations of a range of trace elements change between in utero development, birth, and weaning in eutherian mammals. Marsupials, however, have a different mode of development: altricial birth and growth within the pouch facilitated by compositional transitions in milk. How these differences alter patterns of elemental mineralisation and become recorded in marsupial teeth is previously unknown. This study analyses the distribution of calcium (major element), zinc (actively incorporated trace element), and strontium (passively incorporated trace element) in the teeth of five species of diprotodontian marsupial using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy. We find that the diprotodontian lower incisor concatenates elemental variation from across the molariform dentition, preserving a prolonged record of life history in four of the five species. Patterns of elemental incorporation in enamel, dentine, and cementum are presented, with Ca, Zn, and Sr having differing distributions. Zn accretion indicates a role in mineralisation and/or prevention of tooth degradation. Zn also demarcates incremental cementum lines. Sr is shown to be passively incorporated into marsupial teeth, with increasing Sr concentration in milk recorded in dental tissues formed contemporaneously. Older individuals have oscillatory signals in Sr that appear linked to seasonality. These findings highlight some similarities between eutherian and marsupial trace element incorporation, particularly in the distribution of Zn. Sr signals in marsupial teeth record key aspects of life history.

AB  - This study presents an open source method for detecting 3D printing anomalies by comparing images of printed layers from a stationary monocular camera with G-code-based reference images of an ideal process generated with Blender, an open source free physics rendering engine. Recognition of visual deviations was accomplished by analyzing the similarity of histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) of local image areas. The developed technique requires preliminary modeling of the working environment to achieve the best match for orientation, color rendering, lighting, and other parameters of the printed part. The output of the algorithm is a level of mismatch between printed and synthetic reference layers. Twelve similarity and distance measures were implemented and compared for their effectiveness at detecting 3D printing errors on six different representative failure types (local infill defects, presence of a foreign body in the layer, spaghetti problem, separation and shift of the printing part from the working surface, defects in thin walls, and layer shift) and their control error-free print images. The results show that although Kendall's tau, Jaccard, and Sorensen similarities are the most sensitive, Pearson's r, Spearman's rho, cosine, and Dice similarities produce the more distinguishable results. This open source method allows the program to notice critical errors in the early stages of their occurrence and either pause manufacturing processes for further investigation by an operator or in the future intelligent automatic error correction. The implementation of this novel method does not require preliminary data for training, and the greatest efficiency can be achieved with the mass production of parts by either additive or subtractive manufacturing of the same geometric shape. This open-source method has the potential means of enabling smart distributed recycling for additive manufacturing in challenging environments.

AB  - Purpose We analysed the possible synergistic activity among active extracts from Artemisia cina and Tagetes lucida combinations on Haemonchus contortus, a nematode parasitising sheep. Methods The work was carried out in vitro on eggs and infective larvae (L3) of H. contortus. The results were analysed with SAS 9.1, applying the ANOVA and Tukey test, and the lethal concentration (LC) values LC50 and LC90 were determined with regression analysis, employing Proc Probit of SAS 9.1. Additionally, the lethal concentration (LC) was calculated with LC50 and LC90 to determine the synergistic effect. Results The results demonstrated a high efficacy of the two plants studied on both nematode eggs and L3 larvae as well as of their combinations. The highest egg hatching inhibition was obtained with a 50/50 combination, and the best larvae mortality was obtained with 25% A. cina and 75% T. lucida at 10 mg/mL. Additionally, this combination showed a synergistic effect. Conclusion The two plant species studied here can be applied as natural anthelmintic alternatives due to their high bioactive effect and synergistic response.

AB  - In recent years, decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms have become popular algorithms for solving multi-objective problems in real-life scenarios. In these algorithms, the reference vectors of the Penalty-Based boundary intersection (PBI) are distributed parallelly while those based on the normal boundary intersection (NBI) are distributed radially in a conical shape in the objective space. To improve the problem-solving effectiveness of multi-objective optimization algorithms in engineering applications, this paper addresses the improvement of the Collaborative Decomposition (CoD) method, a multi-objective decomposition technique that integrates PBI and NBI, and combines it with the Elephant Clan Optimization Algorithm, introducing the Collaborative Decomposition construction method with adaptive changes following the number of iterations and a novel individual merit ranking based on NBI and angle are proposed., enabling the creation of subpopulations closely linked to weight vectors and the identification of diverse individuals within them. Additionally, new update strategies for the clan leader, male elephants, and juvenile elephants are introduced to boost individual exploitation capabilities and further enhance the algorithm's convergence. Finally, a new CoD-based environmental selection method is proposed, introducing adaptive dynamically adjusted angle coefficients and individual angles on corresponding weight vectors, significantly improving both the convergence and distribution of the algorithm. Experimental comparisons on the ZDT, DTLZ, and WFG function sets with four benchmark multi-objective algorithms-MOEA/D, CAMOEA, VaEA, and MOEA/D-UR-demonstrate that CoDMOIECO achieves superior performance in both convergence and distribution.

AB  - Simple Summary Extensive research has explored hunters' support for chronic wasting disease management, but many studies do not account for differences between types of hunters nor the tradeoffs hunters make in their decision-making about management alternatives. To address this, we used data from a survey of Texas hunters to create categories of hunters and explore their preferences for chronic wasting disease management based on these categories. Across five hunter categories, most hunters support disease management, although their attitudes towards Texas Parks and Wildlife Department varied. Different hunter categories had different preferences for chronic wasting disease management policies. Wildlife agencies can refer to our study findings to create preferred chronic wasting disease management policies and better communicate about them. Wildlife agencies seek to understand how hunters have and will respond to chronic wasting disease (CWD) management policies because of the vital role hunters play in deer management efforts. As such, dozens of studies have examined the human dimensions of CWD management and policy to assess stakeholder support for management alternatives and reveal what drives support. However, most of these studies have not (1) fully explored the heterogeneity that exists among hunters, and (2) accounted for the tradeoffs that agencies and hunters must make with regard to deer management and potential CWD policy alternatives. To address these deficiencies, we used latent profile analysis to create different typologies of hunters based on a survey of Texas hunters, then analyzed discrete choice experiments investigating the CWD management preferences of these typologies. Across five hunter typologies, we found strong overall support for CWD management, although attitudes towards Texas Parks and Wildlife Department were variable. Preferences for CWD management policies greatly differed between each hunter typology. Wildlife agencies can refer to our findings to better develop hunter-preferred CWD management policies and identify areas of compromise between typologies. Our results also provide agencies with insights regarding how to better communicate about CWD management with different types of hunters.

AB  - Excess light induces chloroplast degradation in plants, leading to decreased photosynthetic efficiency and an albino leaf phenotype. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process remains unclear, especially in perennial crops like tea plant. This study investigated the effects of relatively strong light (SL, 240 mu mol m- 2 center dot s- 1) on chloroplast ultrastructure and metabolites in the light-sensitive tea germplasm Nanchuan Dachashu (Camellia nanchuanica). Continuous exposure to SL resulted in abnormal chloroplast structure characterized by extensive vacuolation. SL also significantly decreased the levels of chlorophyll (-60.30 %), carotenoids (-88.29 %), free amino acids (-23.97 %), and caffeine (-41.15 %) compared to relatively weak light (WL, 15 mu mol m- 2 center dot s- 1). Transcriptome analysis and RT-qPCR revealed that the chloroplast vesiculation gene CsCV was significantly upregulated under SL, with promoter analysis showing more light-responsive elements in CsCV compared to another light-responsive gene, CsNBR1. Overexpression of CsCV in Arabidopsis caused stunted growth and accelerated leaf senescence, with the most affected line showing decreases in chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of 24.97 % and 17.39 %, respectively. Conversely, silencing CsCV in tea plants using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (asODNs) for 3 days increased chlorophyll and carotenoid levels by 15.98 % and 18.35 %, respectively. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays and in protein-protein docking simulations demonstrated that CsCV interacts with the photosystem proteins CsLhca1, CsLhcb4, and CsPsaL through its conserved C-terminal region, suggesting CsCV may trigger chloroplast degradation by destabilizing the photosynthetic apparatus under SL. These findings provide mechanistic insights into light-induced chloroplast degradation in tea plants and highlight CsCV as a potential target for improving crop stress tolerance.

AB  - Group-living organisms commonly exhibit collective escape responses, yet how information flows among group members in these events remains an open question. Here, we study the collective responses of a sheep flock (Ovis aries) to a shepherd dog (border collie) in a driving task between two well-defined target points. We collected high-resolution spatiotemporal data from 14 sheep and the dog, using Ultra-Wide-Band tags attached to each individual. We find that the spatial positions of sheep along the front-back axis of the group's velocity strongly correlate with their impact on the collective movement. Our analyses reveal that, even though the dog chases the sheep flock from behind, directional information on shorter time scales propagates from the front of the group towards the rear; further, the dog adjusts its movement in response to the flock's dynamics. We introduce an agent-based model that captures key data features. Specifically, in response to chasing, the sheep change their spatial relative positions less frequently and exhibit a transfer of directional information flow from front to back; this pattern disappears in the absence of chasing. Our study reveals some general insights into how directional information propagates in escaping animal groups.
   Experimental analysis and computational modeling of collective responses of flocking sheep to a herding dog reveal how directional information spreads in escaping animal groups.

AB  - Aims: Oxidative stress and neuronal death are the primary reasons for the progression of amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ecdysterone (ecdy), a common derivative of ecdysteroids, possesses free radical scavenging and cognitive-improving effects. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be a therapeutic strategy for improving cognitive decline and oxidative stress. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of HIIT exercise and ecdy consumption synergistically on the changes in learning and memory functions, activities of hippocampal antioxidant enzymes, and neuronal population after AD induced by A beta in male rats.Materials and methods: Following ten days of A beta injection, HIIT exercise and ecdy treatment (10 mg/kg/day; P.O.) were initiated and continued for eight consecutive weeks in rats. At the end of the treatment period, the rat's learning and memory functions were assessed using Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRx), and changes in neuronal population were evaluated in rats' brains.Results: The results indicated that A beta injection disrupted spatial/passive avoidance learning and memory in both tests, accompanied by a decrease in the SOD and CAT (as endogenous antioxidants) in rats' hippocampus. Additionally, A beta injection resulted in neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Although the consumption of ecdy separately improved spatial/passive avoidance learning and memory impairments, recovered hippocampal activity of SOD, CAT, GRx, and prevented the hippocampal neuronal loss, its combi-nation along with HIIT resulted in a more powerful and effective amelioration in all the above-mentioned A beta-neuropathological changes.Conclusion: Our results confirm that a combination of HIIT and ecdy treatment could be a promising potential therapeutic option against AD-associated cognitive decline, owing to their free radical scavenging and neuro-protective properties.

AB  - The events of September 11, 2001 exposed nearly half a million community residents and workers engaged in rescue and recovery and clean-up to dust, debris and toxic chemicals, as well as psychologic and physical stressors. Early studies showed an excess of aerodigestive diseases including rhinosinusitis and gastroesophageal reflux. Several studies of World Trade Center (WTC) responders report an excess of obstructive sleep apnea among patients who developed new onset or worsening chronic rhinosinusitis. High quality clinical diagnostic and treatment guidelines are available from The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. For enrolled members, the WTC program covers diagnostic evaluation and treatment for sleep apnea in members diagnosed with WTC-related upper and lower respiratory disease and gastroesophageal reflux.

Multiple wasp cohorts were reared from hosts collected in a montane dryland habitat of New Mexico, USA. This is the first case of gregariousness in Iconella. An updated key to American Iconella species is provided. We present a maximum likelihood tree using the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) locus of this species relative to other described Iconella species from the Americas. We also describe the biology and environmental conditions where Iconella melitaraevora sp. nov. was discovered in the context of its prickly pear cactus (Opuntia Mill.) herbivore host. The potential biological control capacity of microgastrine wasps which attack prickly pear specialist herbivores is discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary BMP15 is a critical gene in sheep reproduction. Most of its variations have been reported in European sheep. In this study, the entire open reading frame (ORF) region of BMP15 was sequenced in 154 Luzhong mutton sheep. Among 13 identified variations, six were novel. Four SNPs (ENSOART00000010201.1:c.352+342C>A, c.352+1232T>C, c.352+1165A>G and c.353-2036T>A) were significantly associated with litter size, and could be used as candidate genetic markers for improving litter size. The results also suggested possible interaction between BMP15 and FecB/GDF9. Litter size is an important economic trait in the mutton sheep industry. BMP15 is one of the key candidate genes for litter size in sheep. In this study, the entire ORF region of BMP15 was sequenced in 154 Luzhong mutton ewes, and the novel variations were determined. The association between polymorphism in BMP15 and litter size was analyzed using a general linear model. Six out of a total of thirteen variations were identified to be novel. Association analysis indicated that four (SNPs ENSOART00000010201.1:c.352+342C>A, c.352+1232T>C, c.352+1165A>G and c.353-2036T>A) were significantly associated with litter size. The joint analysis among three major genes (BMP15, BMPR1B and GDF9) exhibited significant interaction effects in three combinations (FecB and c.352+1232T>C of BMP15; FecB and c.352+1165A>G of BMP15; c.352+342C>A of BMP15 and ENSOART00000014382.1:c.994G>A of GDF9). For the SNPs c.352+1232T>C and c.352+342C>A, the global distribution of allele frequencies showed that the highest variation frequency occurs in Western Europe. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that BMP15 is a major gene for litter size in Luzhong mutton sheep and candidate SNPs associated with litter size were identified.

AB  - Population growth, urbanization, and changing consumption patterns are contributing to an increase in household waste production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Composting of biowaste presents a sustainable solution by reducing the volume of waste sent to landfills while enriching the soil. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of solid household biowaste for composting in market garden crops in Dolisie (the Republic of Congo). Specifically, the study aimed to (i) assess the production and management practices of solid household waste in relation to socio-economic factors, (ii) analyze the chemical composition of solid household biowaste and its concentration of trace elements (TEs), and (iii) determine the potential phytotoxicity of solid household biowaste across different production seasons. In this study, wastes were collected from 40 households over a 60-day period, with daily sorting conducted during both the dry and wet seasons. Using a completely randomized design, various compost application rates were incorporated into the soil to conduct a germination test. The quality of the biowaste and compost was evaluated through physicochemical analyses. Results showed that approximately 90% of high-income households received regular waste collection services and practiced waste separation in contrast to middle- and low-income households. The composition of the biowaste was primarily composed of fruit and vegetable scraps, with slight contamination by chromium and cadmium. Temperature, pH, and humidity levels showed similar trends during compost formation in both the rainy and dry seasons. Germination rates were above 80% in all treatments across both seasons, indicating that the compost was mature. Overall, all physicochemical parameters of the compost met established quality standards, and trace element concentrations were below the recommended thresholds. The study concluded that biowaste, once converted into compost, can be safely applied to agricultural soils without posing any risk of phytotoxicity or contamination to crops.

AB  - Simple Summary Many zoos offer close-encounter experiences, and visitors frequently share photographs from these experiences online. This study measured the effects that viewing such images had on public perceptions of both the zoo and the animals that they saw. Results indicated that viewing different animal species and the different human proximities within these images can affect public perceptions about how zoos care for their animals and views about the use of animals as pets. With the rising popularity of social media, conservation organisations and zoos need to understand its impact on public perceptions of the animals they house and their role in conservation. In addition, many zoos offer close-encounter experiences, and visitors frequently share images from these experiences online. This study measured the effects that viewing such encounter images had on public perceptions of both the zoo and the animals they saw. One of sixteen images was randomly presented to participants in two samples: one of Zoo Community followers and members of Zoos Victoria (n = 963), and a representative sample of the Australian public (n = 1619). Each image featured one of four animals (Eclectus parrot, Kangaroo Island kangaroo, Monteith's leaf insect, Centralian carpet python) and one of four human positions (human and animal touching, human and animal ~30 cm apart, human and animal ~1 m apart, animal alone). Results indicated that viewing different animals and the different human positions within these human-animal encounter images can affect public perceptions of zoo animals. In particular, the closer the proximity of a human to an animal in an image, the more likely respondents were to think that the animal was not displaying a natural behaviour and the more likely it was for General Public respondents to think that the animal would make a good pet. These findings can be used by zoos, wildlife tourism, and media organisations to ensure that they are sending clear, positive, and intended messages about zoo facilities and animals, as well as providing insights into animal encounter images in wider settings.

AB  - Naturally fluctuating temperatures provide a constant environmental stress that requires adaptation. Some fungal pathogens respond to heat stress by producing new morphotypes that maximize their overall fitness. The fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici responds to heat stress by switching from its yeast-like blastospore form to hyphae or chlamydospores. The regulatory mechanisms underlying this switch are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a differential heat stress response is ubiquitous in Z. tritici populations around the world. We used QTL mapping to identify a single locus associated with the temperature-dependent morphogenesis and we found two genes, the transcription factor ZtMsr1 and the protein phosphatase ZtYvh1, regulating this mechanism. We find that ZtMsr1 regulates repression of hyphal growth and induces chlamydospore formation whereas ZtYvh1 is required for hyphal growth. We next showed that chlamydospore formation is a response to the intracellular osmotic stress generated by the heat stress. This intracellular stress stimulates the cell wall integrity (CWI) and high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathways resulting in hyphal growth. If cell wall integrity is compromised, however, ZtMsr1 represses the hyphal development program and may induce the chlamydospore-inducing genes as a stress-response survival strategy. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism through which morphological transitions are orchestrated in Z. tritici - a mechanism that may also be present in other pleomorphic fungi.

AB  - The stem borer Sesamia nonagrioides and the fungus Fusarium verticillioides are frequently present in maize. However, their interaction with this crop and their effects on its physiology remain poorly understood. This study explores the combined impact of these two organisms on carbon composition and delta C-1(3) content in the stem pith. Eight genetically distinct maize lines (A239, A509, A630, A637, EP42, EP77, EP125, PB130) were subjected to four treatments: an untreated control (UC), infection by F. verticillioides (FV), attack by S. nonagrioides (SN), and infection by F. verticillioides and infestation by S. nonagrioides (FS). Results show moderate variation in delta C-1(3) values between UC genotypes (-12.6 to -13.1 parts per thousand, with the exception of line EP77 at -13.8 parts per thousand), with minor differences related to their inbred resistance to the insect and fungus. Insect infestation results in a noticeable reduction in delta C-1(3) (0.6 parts per thousand), but this decrease is partially attenuated in plants previously colonized by the fungus, suggesting an influence of the fungus on the maize's defensive response. In addition, the analysis of 13C isotopic composition and carbon signatures provide key elements for a better understanding of maize defence mechanisms. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the impact of Sesamia and Fusarium, and their interaction, on carbon metabolism in different maize genotypes.

AB  - The article discusses the problem of detecting sick or mechanically damaged potatoes using machine learning methods. We proposed an algorithm and developed a system for the rapid detection of damaged tubers. The system can be installed on a conveyor belt in a vegetable store, and it consists of a laptop computer and an action camera, synchronized with a flashlight system. The algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase uses the Viola-Jones algorithm, applied to the filtered action camera image, so it aims to detect separate potato tubers on the conveyor belt. The second phase is the application of a method that we choose based on video capturing conditions. To isolate potatoes infected with certain types of diseases (dry rot, for example), we use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. In case of inconsistent or weak lighting, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)-Bag-of-Visual-Words (BOVW)-neural network (BPNN) method is used. Otherwise, Otsu's threshold binarization-a convolutional neural network (CNN) method is used. The first phase's result depends on the conveyor's speed, the density of tubers on the conveyor, and the accuracy of the video system. With the optimal setting, the result reaches 97%. The second phase's outcome depends on the method and varies from 80% to 97%. When evaluating the performance of the system, it was found that it allows to detect and classify up to 100 tubers in one second, which significantly exceeds the performance of most similar systems.</p>

AB  - Purpose Beneficial soil microbes, such as rhizobia, engage in facultative symbioses in the roots of leguminous host plants to exchange nitrogen for products of photosynthesis, and these symbioses can be altered by biotic and abiotic factors. Here, we investigated how soil nitrate supply and aboveground insect herbivory interact to influence biological nitrogen fixation in Medicago sativa (alfalfa or lucerne). Methods Using field and greenhouse experiments, we quantified above- and belowground allocation of rhizobially fixed nitrogen using isotopic nitrogen ratios in plants with different combinations of herbivory and nitrate supplementation. We caged Empoasca fabae (potato leafhopper) on fixing and non-fixing cultivars of M. sativa and supplemented soils with varied nitrate concentrations. Results We detected strong changes in legume above- and belowground allocation of fixed nitrogen in response to both herbivory and nitrate supply. Moderate nitrate soils, irrespective of herbivory, induced little to no fixed nitrogen allocation across both field and greenhouse experiments. In the field only, non-supplemented soil increased aboveground allocation of fixed nitrogen following herbivore damage but resulted in no changes belowground. In contrast, non-supplemented and high nitrate soils in the greenhouse increased above- and belowground fixed nitrogen allocation relative to moderate nitrate soils. Conclusion Our results demonstrate herbivory drives distinct plant allocation strategies across soil nitrate levels, advancing our understanding of how rhizobia influence legumes both above- and belowground. Herbivory-induced changes in rhizobia-legume symbioses are likely widespread across both agricultural and natural ecosystems.

AB  - Dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons are the targets of most excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex, and dendritic spine morphology directly reflects their function. However, there are scarce data available regarding both the detailed morphology of these structures for the human cerebral cortex and the extent to which they differ in comparison with other species. Thus, in the present study, we used intracellular injections of Lucifer yellow to reconstruct-in three dimensions-the morphology of basal dendritic spines from pyramidal cells in the human and mouse CA1 hippocampal region and compared these spines with those of the human temporal and cingular cortex. We found that human hippocampal dendrites show lower spine density, larger volume, and longer length of dendritic spines than mouse CA1 spines. Furthermore, human hippocampal dendrites show higher spine density, smaller spine volume, and shorter length compared to dendritic spines from the human temporal and cingular cortex. This morphological diversity suggests an equally large variability of synaptic strength and learning rules across these brain regions in humans and between humans and mice. Nevertheless, a balance between size and density was found in all cases, which may be a cortical rule maintained across cortical areas and species.

AB  - The majority of population genetic theory assumes fully haploid or diploid organisms with obligate sexuality, despite complex life cycles with alternating generations being commonly observed. To reveal how natural selection and genetic drift shape the evolution of haploid-diploid populations, we analyze a stochastic genetic model for populations that consist of a mixture of haploid and diploid individuals, allowing for asexual reproduction and niche separation between haploid and diploid stages. Applying a diffusion approximation, we derive the fixation probability and describe its dependence on the reproductive values of haploid and diploid stages, which depend strongly on the extent of asexual reproduction in each phase and on the ecological differences between them.

AB  - Lignosus rhinocerotis (Cooke) Ryvarden has been reported to possess numerous pharmacological effects. However, little is known about its potential role in mitigating the detrimental effects of oxidative stress. The present study investigated the cytoprotective effects of L. rhinocerotis extracts against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. In the pre-treatment model, PC12 cells were pre-treated with aqueous (LRAQ) or ethanolic (LRET) extracts of L. rhinocerotis for 24 h, followed by 30 mu M of H2O2 for 24 h. In the co-treatment model, the cells were incubated with LRAQ or LRET and H2O2 for 2 or 24 h to induce oxidative stress. Cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and apoptotic cells with activated caspase-3/7 were quantified. Additionally, LRET was separated into fractions by chromatographic methods prior to analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). 320 mu g/ml aqueous extract showed a significant cytoprotective effect of 70.0 +/- 22.4% and 133.92 +/- 8.8% in the pre-treatment and co-treatment models, respectively, compared to untreated H2O2-challenged cells. LRAQ also showed a reduction (p < 0.05) in the percentage of depolarized cells of 37.6 +/- 0.6% at 640 ug/ml and 53.4 +/- 4.5% at 320 ug/ml in the pre-treatment and co-treatment models, respectively, compared to untreated H2O2-challenged cells. LRAQ or LRET showed a reduction (p < 0.01) in caspase 3/7 activity compared to untreated H2O2-challenged cells in the co-treatment model. However, LRAQ or LRET did not reduce excessive ROS formation (p > 0.05). The cytoprotective effects could be attributed to the presence of fatty acids, phenols, phytosterols, and dicarboxylic acids. In conclusion, L. rhinocerotis extracts demonstrated cytoprotective effects against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in an in vitro model, contributing to the maintenance of cellular integrity through the regulation of mitochondrial function and apoptosis.

AB  - Fatty acids (FAs) are important for cell membrane composition, eicosanoid synthesis, and metabolic processes. Membrane proteins that facilitate FA transport into cells include FA translocase (also known as CD36) and FA transporter proteins (encoded by SLC27A genes). The present study aimed to examine expression profiles of FA transporters in the endometrium of cyclic and early pregnant gilts on days 3 to 20 after estrus and the possible regulation by conceptus signals and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs). The effect of PUFAs on prostaglandin (PG) synthesis and transcript abundance of genes related to FA action and metabolism, angiogenesis, and immune response was also determined. Day after estrus and reproductive status of animals affected FA transporter expression, with greater levels of CD36, SLC27A1, and SLC27A4 observed in pregnant than in cyclic gilts. Conceptus-conditioned medium and/or estradiol-17 beta stimulated SLC27A1 and CD36 expression. Among PUFAs, linoleic acid decreased SLC27A1 and SLC27A6 mRNA expression, while arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, and eicosapentaenoic acids increased SLC27A4 transcript abundance. Moreover, arachidonic acid stimulated ACOX1, CPT1A, and IL1B expression and increased PGE2 and PGI2 secretion. In turn, alpha-linolenic acid up-regulated VEGFA, FGF2, FABP4, and PPARG mRNA expression. These results indicate the presence of an active transport of FAs in the porcine endometrium and the role of PUFAs as modulators of the uterine activity during conceptus implantation.

AB  - Ovarian puncture has been widely used in assisted reproduction, but there are still gaps about its effects on ovarian morphophysiology, as well as the relationship between inflammation caused by this procedure and the follicular growth and fertility. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ovarian puncture on folliculogenesis and fertility. Mice (n = 24) were divided into two groups: (1) SHAM-both ovaries were exposed and repositioned and (2) Punctured-ovaries were exposed, punctured, and repositioned. After 96 h of surgery, ovaries were collected for morphofunctional analysis. New females were used for the superovulation (n = 10) and fertility assays (n = 10). Increased volumetric density of inflammatory cells-p = 0.0005, p = 0.0013; hemorrhagic foci-p < 0.0001; and inflammatory exudate-p < 0.0001 could be noticed on the punctured group, compared to SHAM. The percentage of primordial follicles was lower on the punctured ovaries (p = 0.00294). Ovarian puncture has also induced an increase in the proliferation of granulosa cells of primary (p = 0.0321) and antral follicles (p = 0.0395), and an increased apoptotic index of antral follicles (p = 0.0100). There was no influence on expression of some genes related to inflammation, collagen deposition and folliculogenesis progression. The reproductive aspects (oocyte retrieval and number of fetuses per female) were not altered (p > 0.05). Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that ovarian puncture results in a local inflammation that affects follicular growth and atresia. However, it does not affect female fertility, which strengthens the safety of this procedure.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of GnRH-loaded chitosan-TPP nano -particles (GnRH-CsNPs) to improve the reproductive performance of anestrus buffaloes during the summer. Egyptian buffaloes (n = 50) were synchronized for estrus either with the ovsynch protocol (OVSs, n = 20) or with the modified ovsynch protocol (OVSm, n = 30) using GnRH-CsNPs. Sera samples were collected on days 0, 7, and 10 (insemination day); and days15 and 30 post insemination for estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) determination. The follicles were monitored on day 0 and day 10. CLs diameter and pregnancy diagnosis were scanned on day 30 post insemination. Using a half dose of GnRH as GnRH-CsNPs in the OVSm improved (P < 0.05) the number of total and large follicles, and the total surface area of subordinate and large follicles compared to the OVSs protocol. The OVSm increased (P < 0.05) the largest follicles diameter on day 10 and CLs diameter on day 30 post insemination compared to the OVSs protocol. E2 con-centration was greater (P < 0.05) on insemination day, and P4 concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) on days 15 and 30 post insemination in the OVSm than in the OVSs. The estrus induction rate was 80 % higher (P < 0.05) in the OVSm and cows exhibited estrus within 17.54 h earlier than the OVSs (50 % within 42 h), respectively. The conception rate increased in OVSm compared to OVSs (75 vs. 40 %, respectively). In conclusion, nanofabrication of GnRH allowed to reduce hormonal dose to 50 % without any adverse effects on fertility, and improved ovarian activity and reproductive performance of anestrus buffaloes during the low breeding season.

AB  - A moderate supply of aluminum (Al) can promote the root growth of plant species, such as tea, that have adapted to acid soils. The formation and development of roots are regulated by phytohormones. However, the role that phytohormones play in facilitating the beneficial effects of Al on root growth is unclear. In the present study, tea plants cultured hydroponically with either 0 or 0.4 mmol/L Al were characterized and compared in terms of root growth, hormone concentrations, and the expression of related genes. The hormone content in tea roots was measured by UPLC-MS, and the expression levels of genes involved in phytohormone biosynthesis, transport, and response were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Our results showed that the indole acetic acid (IAA) concentrations in the root base were significantly higher in plants supplied with Al compared to control plants without Al during the experimental period from 6 h to 7 d. By using inhibitors of IAA synthesis and transport, we found that Al induces short-term IAA synthesis in the root tip and enhances IAA transport in other parts of the root over the longer term, thus promoting root growth in tea plants by limiting IAA accumulation. The expression levels of genes Upsilon UC8 and AMI1, involved in IAA accumulation, were consistently upregulated in the root tip, whereas expression of PIN1/2/8, involved in IAA transport, was induced in the root base under Al supply at 6 h. In addition, the expression of PIN2 and PIN5 was highly induced in root stem by Al after 7 d and probably contributed to alleviating IAA accumulation in the root tip and thereby promoted root growth in tea plants. Meanwhile, the XET and expansin activities were increased under Al supply at 6 h. Thus, we conclude that the mechanism of Al-induced root growth is mediated by auxin accumulation and transport in cooperation with cell wall loosening in tea plants.

AB  - Acrobasis nuxvorella Neuzing (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), or the Pecan Nut Casebearer (PNC), is a monophagous pecan nut [Carya illinoinensis (Wang) K. Koch] herbivore. This insect has caused major crop losses, despite pecan nut trees producing a high concentration of tannins, which are deterrent compounds for insects. The PNC consumes and processes tannin-rich tissues without any negative effects on its nutrition. Certain bacterial species of the herbivore gut microbiota have been proven to produce tannase, therefore, we hypothesize that the PNC has symbiotic bacteria that produce tannase for the digestion of tannin contained in their food.In this work, live PNC larvae were extracted from pecan nutlets. The larval guts were dissected and their contents were cultured to obtain the cultivable bacteria. A total of 224 bacterial isolates were recovered, 19 of which tested positive for tannase activity. Isolates LB66, LB24, TT29, and TP8 displayed comparable activity to the control strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Further enzyme semi-purification steps showed specific tannase ac-tivity values in the range of 39.5-3.7 U/mg of protein. The isolates were identified as Bacillus pumilus strain TT29, Bacillus pumilus strain LB66, Bacillus pumilus strain LB24 and Sthaphylococcus warneri (TP8) by 16S ribo-somal RNA gene sequencing. Our findings indicate that PNC larvae contain gut bacteria able to produce tannase that hydrolyze the galloyl ester bonds in tannins.

AB  - In this study, brewer's spent grains (BSG)-raw matrix was technologically and functionally improved by adding natural active ingredient carriers (crushed wheat, rapeseed, and pumpkin seed press cake) and using planetary roller extrusion and used as feed additive for pigs. Feeding trials were run for 189 days using 60 pigs with an age of 28 days. Pigs were grouped in a control group (fed with organic basic feed) and two experimental groups (fed with BSG 1 or BSG 2 in addition to organic basic feed). The 20 animals per group gained similar weight in the control group (306 g day(-1) and 725 g day(-1)) and in the group fed with BSG 1 (282 g day(-1) and 627 g day(-1)) or BSG 2 (250 g day(-1) 598 g day(-1)) in addition during rearing and fattening phases, respectively. Carcass evaluation revealed that meat quality did not differ between control and experimental groups. The BSG-based feed formulations tested seem to not result in negative effects on weight gain nor on meat quality. Animals were generally of good health and marketable quality, and thus the outcomes of this study are expected to contribute to an improved utilization strategy of brewer's spent grains from breweries.

AB  - Background Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Hepeviridae. The genome of HEV is organized into three open-reading frames (ORFs): ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. The ORF1 non-structural Y-domain region (YDR) has been demonstrated to play an important role in the HEV pathogenesis. The nucleotide composition, synonymous codon usage bias in conjunction with other factors influencing the viral YDR genes of HEV have not been studied. Codon usage represents a significant mechanism in establishing the host-pathogen relationship. The present study for the first time elucidates the detailed codon usage patterns of YDR among HEV and HEV-hosts (Human, Rabbit, Mongoose, Pig, Wild boar, Camel, Monkey). Results The overall nucleotide composition revealed the abundance of C and U nucleotides in YDR genomes. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis indicated biasness towards C and U over A and G ended codons in HEV across all hosts. Codon frequency comparative analyses among HEV-hosts showed both similarities and discrepancies in usage of preferred codons encoding amino acids, which revealed that HEV codon preference neither completely differed nor completely showed similarity with its hosts. Thus, our results clearly indicated that the synonymous codon usage of HEV is a mixture of the two types of codon usage: coincidence and antagonism. Mutation pressure from virus and natural selection from host seems to be accountable for shaping the codon usage patterns in YDR. The study emphasised that the influence of compositional constraints, codon usage biasness, mutational alongside the selective forces were reflected in the occurrence of YDR codon usage patterns. Conclusions Our study is the first in its kind to have reported the analysis of codon usage patterns on a total of seven different natural HEV hosts. Therefore, knowledge of preferred codons obtained from our study will not only augment our understanding towards molecular evolution but is also envisaged to provide insight into the efficient viral expression, viral adaptation, and host effects on the HEV YDR codon usage.

AB  - Mercury pollution in the surface ocean has more than doubled over the past century. Within oceanic food webs, sea turtles have life history characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to mercury (Hg) accumulation. In this study we investigated Hg concentrations in the skin and carapace of nesting flatback turtles (Natator depressus) from two rookeries in Western Australia. A total of 50 skin samples and 52 carapace samples were collected from nesting turtles at Thevenard Island, and 23 skin and 28 carapace samples from nesting turtles at Eighty Mile Beach. We tested the influence of turtle size on Hg concentrations, hypothesising that larger and likely older adult turtles would exhibit higher concentrations due to more prolonged exposure to Hg. We compared the rookeries, hypothesising that the turtles from the southern rookery (Thevenard Island) were more likely to forage and reside in the Pilbara region closer to industrial mining activity and loading ports (potential exposure to higher environmental Hg concentrations) with turtles from the northern rookery (Eighty Mile Beach) more likely to reside and feed in the remote Kimberley. Turtles from the Eighty Mile Beach rookery had significantly higher skin Hg concentrations (x = 19.4 +/- 4.8 ng/g) than turtles from Thevenard Island (x = 15.2 +/- 5.8 ng/g). There was no significant difference in carapace Hg concentrations in turtles between Eighty Mile Beach (x = 48.4 +/- 21.8 ng/g) and Thevenard Island (x = 41.3 +/- 16.5 ng/g). Turtle size did not explain Hg concentrations in skin samples from Eighty Mile Beach and Thevenard Island, but turtle size explained 43.1% of Hg concentrations in the carapace of turtles from Eighty Mile Beach and 44.2% from Thevenard Island. Mercury concentrations in the flatback turtles sampled in this study are relatively low compared to other sea turtles worldwide, likely a result of the generally low concentrations of Hg in the Australian environment. Although we predicted that mining activities would influence flatback turtle Hg bioaccumulations, our data did not support this effect. This may be a result of foraging ground overlap between the two rookeries, or the predominant wind direction carrying atmospheric Hg inland rather than seaward. This is the first Hg study in skin and carapace of flatback turtles and represents a baseline to compare Hg contamination in Australia's surrounding oceans.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF), a viral disease affecting both domestic pigs and wild boars, is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). Currently, an effective vaccine is lacking. The structural protein p49, encoded by the B438L gene, is vital for the virus's capsid structure and architecture. Research indicates its potential as a vaccine target. In this study, mAbs against ASFV p49 were generated using the hybridoma technique. The full-length B438L sequence was divided into 5 segments (B1 similar to B5) via the overlapping polypeptide method, and an expression vector was constructed for expression and purification. Three hybridoma cell lines recognized epitope regions, with 3B12 and 6F1 recognizing the B4 (aa 234-362) fragment, and 3B12, 6F1, and 7C5 reacting with the B5 (aa 312-438) segment. The amino acid sequence (aa 333-438) was further divided into three segments (B6 similar to B8) for verification. Results from Dot-ELISA and peptide ELISA confirmed that 333-YQTHYMENIVTLVPR-347 and 383-NNYIPKYTGGIGDSK-397 were the major B cell antigenic, highly conserved across ASFV strains. Interestingly, the motif 333-YQTHYMENIVTLVPR-347 was highly conserved, except for a single substitution (T -> S) in three residues. This study identifies the B cell epitope of p49 protein, providing insights into ASFV p49 protein structure and function and supporting the development of ASFV-related vaccine products.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of the study was to set up experimental conditions to simulate the simultaneous outbreak of post-weaning diarrhea and enterotoxaemia in weaned piglets, through verocytotoxic O138 Escherichia coli challenge. Zootechnical, clinical, microbiological, histological and immunological parameters were evaluated along the follow-up of control and infected groups. Results showed that experimental infection significantly affected the clinical status. Infected animals showed significant higher total median scores of epiphora, vitality, hair irregularity, oedema and depression; in addition, they displayed evident inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, and follicular hyperplasia, increase of IgG in the intestinal crypts and CD3-positive T cells in intestinal epithelium. The infection model, carried out on receptor-mediated susceptible piglets, allowed to identify a discriminative panel of clinical symptoms related to Escherichia coli O138 infection and could be used to assess the protective effect of antibiotic alternatives. Pig livestock was influenced by several global concerns that imposed a re-thinking of the farming system, which included the reduction in chemical dependency and the development of antimicrobial alternatives. Post-weaning diarrhea and enterotoxaemia caused by Escherichia coli, are serious threats that are responsible for the economic losses related to mortality, morbidity and stunted growth in weaning piglets. The aim of the study was to set up experimental conditions to simulate the simultaneous outbreak of post-weaning diarrhea and enterotoxaemia in weaned piglets, through verocytotoxic O138 Escherichia coli challenge, with a multidisciplinary approach. Eighteen piglets susceptible to F18 VTEC infection were selected by polymerase chain reaction for polymorphism on the fucosyltransferase 1 gene and randomly divided in two experimental groups, non-infected controls (C; n = 6) and infected ones (I; n = 12) and housed into individual pens at the same environmental conditions for 29 days. At day 20, I pigs were orally inoculated with Escherichia coli O138 and fed a high protein ration for 3 days. Zootechnical, clinical, microbiological, histological and immunological parameters were evaluated along the follow up (3 and 9 days). Experimental infection, confirmed by bacteria faecal shedding of the I group, significantly affected the clinical status. The I group showed significantly higher total scores, corresponding to medians of the sum of daily scores from days 1 to 3 (sigma 3) and 1 to 9 (sigma 9) post infection, epiphora, vitality, hair irregularity, oedema and depression. Histological examination showed evident inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, and follicular hyperplasia in I pigs; in the same group, the immunohistochemical and immunological assays revealed an increase in IgG in the intestinal crypts and CD3-positive T cells in intestinal epithelium. The experimental Escherichia coli infection in controlled conditions is crucial for both the evaluation of innovative compounds and the elucidation of the mechanisms associated with the persistence of antibacterial resistant strains. In conclusion, the adopted infection model, carried out on receptor-mediated susceptible piglets, allowed us to identify a discriminative panel of clinical symptoms related to Escherichia coli O138 infection, and could be used to assess the protective effect of antibiotic alternatives.

AB  - Livestock farming significantly contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and malodorous pollutants, exacerbating global environmental degradation. Despite the crucial role of protein feeds in regulating gas emissions and enhancing pork production efficiency, the mechanisms by which different protein feeds regulate odors remain unclear. This study employed an in vitro simulated fermentation and in vivo feeding trials to explore the effects of eight protein feeds in China on odor mitigation through regulation of pig gut microbiota. Results demonstrated that protein content and amino acid composition were key factors influencing odor emissions. Notably, the cottonseed meal group exhibited the highest levels of odor (68.67 +/- 58.13 ppm) and showed enrichment of the genus Megasphaera. Correlation analysis revealed positive associations between Megasphaera and the production of H2S, NH3, H2, and CO2. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the cottonseed meal group displayed a higher abundance of metabolic pathways compared to other experimental groups, with Megasphaera positively correlating with multiple metabolic pathways, including amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. In contrast, corn germ meal-H and rapeseed meal-J groups had lower odor levels (12 +/- 5.33 ppm and 16.17 +/- 6.18 ppm, respectively), negatively associated with Bacillus and unclassified_c__Bacilli. Additionally, feeding trials demonstrated that rapeseed meal-based feed reduced NH3 and H2S emissions in pig houses by 47.75% and 54.2%, respectively, without compromising pig production performance. These findings clarified protein feeds' role in odor regulation and laid a scientific foundation for balancing pig industry sustainability and environmental degradation. However, odor metabolism molecular mechanisms in key bacteria and others still require in-depth study.

AB  - As cannabis legalization expands, preclinical studies continue to investigate the impact of repeated exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in the plant. With the increasing popularity of cannabis infused foods, the rise of THC in medicinal applications have also expanded. The present study addresses a critical gap in existing literature by investigating the behavioral and neurobiological effects of low-dose edible THC in a preclinical rodent model. Adult male rats were administered synthetic-THC (Dronabinol) (0.0625 mg/kg, 0.125 mg/kg, and 0.25 mg/kg) or vehicle (sesame oil) through edible cookies, 90 min prior to eight locomotor sessions. Locomotor activity significantly increased in both 0.0625 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/ kg THC groups, indicating a dose-dependent relationship. Repeated 0.25 mg/kg THC administration dose- dependently reduced cannabinoid receptor 1 expression in the hippocampus. The observed neurobiological change from low dose oral THC advances our understanding of repeated cannabis use. These findings also emphasize the importance of refining rodent models for translational relevance.

AB  - One of the key reasons for the poor performance of natural enemies of honeydew-producing insect pests is mutualism between ants and some aphid species. The findings demonstrated that red wood ant, Formica rufa Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) had a deleterious impact on different biological parameters of the lady beetle, Hippodamia variegata Goeze (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). H. variegata laid far fewer eggs in ant-tended aphid colonies, laying nearly 2.5 times more eggs in ant absence. Ants antennated and bit the lady beetle eggs, resulting in significantly low egg hatching of 66 per cent over 85 per cent in ant absent treatments. The presence of ants significantly reduced the development of all larval instars. The highest reduction was found in the fourth larval instar (31.33% reduction), and the lowest in the first larval instar (20% reduction). Later larval instars were more aggressively attacked by ants than earlier instars. The first and second larval instars stopped their feeding and movement in response to ant aggression. The third and fourth larval instars modified their mobility, resulting in increased ant aggression towards them. Adult lady beetles were shown to be more vulnerable to ant attacks than larvae. However, H. variegata adults demonstrated counterattacks in the form of diverse defensive reaction behaviours in response to F. rufa aggression.

AB  - Reticulitermes grassei Cl & eacute;ment and R. banyulensis Cl & eacute;ment are native termites of the Iberian Peninsula and are considered harmful pests in several places. Subterranean termites cause severe damage to wooden structures around the world. In Spain, wood is used in traditional construction, and many town centers feature such architecture. The presence of these pests is often overlooked until the damage becomes considerable over a large area. Baiting with a chitin-synthesis inhibitor is the only option to eliminate all termite colonies over large areas. Here, data are assessed on the area-wide management of Reticulitermes species in 5 town centers in Spain, after implementing a bait system with 0.5% hexaflumuron for 5 years. Our protocol included an initial survey, treatment with hexaflumuron baits, and a post-bait monitoring program. Our results showed that all detectable termite colonies affecting urban areas of 23,000-170,500 m2 were eliminated using the protocol described. This was achieved with a minimal amount of hexaflumuron (58 and 190 g), in less than 1 year on average (7-16 months) in warm dry southern and damp northern areas. The number of stations used ranged from 509 to 1,417 for each treatment area, of which 7.83% and 39% had termite activity. Following the treatments, termite activity has been absent in treated areas for more than 10 years. Our studies confirmed that it is possible to eliminate subterranean termite populations of the genus Reticulitermes from large areas in Europe using hexaflumuron baits and achieving long-term termite-free zones is feasible.

AB  - Coprophilous basidiomycetous fungi constitute a distinct ecological group, essential for the recycling of cellulose and other polymers digested by herbivores, and exhibiting adaptations such as thick-walled basidiospores. The family Bolbitiaceae, including the genera Pholiotina, Conocybe and Bolbitius, is well-represented on animal dung. Nonetheless, the coprophilous fungal diversity of Uruguay remains largely unexplored. This study aims to expand the knowledge of Uruguayan coprophilous fungi through the analysis of basidiomes collected from horse and cow dung samples, and using morphological, chemical and multilocus phylogenetic analyses (including ITS, LSU and Tef1-alpha regions). We recorded and characterized Pholiotina coprophila and Conocybe rufostipes for the first time in Uruguay and also identified and described a new species: Conocybe pruinosa sp. nov. Based on previous reports for related species, we searched for psychoactive tryptamines, but none of the samples in this study showed detectable concentrations of psilocybin or psilocin. Interestingly, in all cases, the clades consisted of sequences from Asia, Europe, North America and now Uruguay, which may correlate with the introduction of bovine cattle from these regions into the country.

AB  - Exposure to psychosocial stress is a risk factor for human diseases such as depression. Social defeat stress (SDS) is a well-known rodent model of human psychosocial stress, and animals exposed to SDS show social avoidance behavior. Fish oil, which is rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), is expected to decrease the risk of depressive disorders. In this study, we determined whether fish oil affects the social behavior of SDS-exposed mice and measured serotonin levels and expression of genes related to tryptophan (TRP) metabolism in the hippocampus. The experimental animals were fed a diet containing fish oil during SDS exposure. For the fish oil treatment, experimental mice were fed a diet containing fish oil at low (L-FO), middle (M-FO), and high (H-FO) concentrations. The control group was supplemented with an equivalent amount of canola oil (no fish oil: N-FO). After the SDS protocol, we performed a social interaction test and assessed the sociality of experimental mice. In the N-FO group, SDS-exposed mice showed negative social interactions compared with non-stressed mice. The L-FO and H-FO groups showed negative social interactions after SDS exposure; however, the M-FO group did not exhibit negative social behavior. The serotonin levels of SDS-exposed mice were lower than those of non-stressed mice in the N-FO group. In contrast with these results in the N-FO group, there was no difference in serotonin levels between SDS-exposed and non-stressed mice in the FO groups. In addition, the expression of genes related to TRP metabolism in SDS-exposed mice increased in the N-FO group, but not in the FO group. These results suggest that fish oil improves the psychosocial behavioral disorders caused by SDS. This improvement could be explained by the increase in serotonin synthesis in the hippocampus.

AB  - Caves are important fossil repositories which provide records extending back over million-year timescales. While the physical processes of cave formation are well understood, the timing of initial cave development and opening-a more important parameter to studies of palaeontology, palaeoanthropology and archaeology-has proved more difficult to constrain. Here we investigate speleothems from the Naracoorte Cave Complex in southern Australia, with a rich record of Pleistocene vertebrate fossils (including extinct megafauna) and partly World Heritage-listed, using U-Th-Pb dating and analyses of their charcoal and pollen content. We find that, although speleothem formation began at least 1.34 million years ago, pollen and charcoal only began to be trapped within growing speleothems from 600,000 years ago. We interpret these two ages to represent the timing of initial cave development and the subsequent opening of the caves to the atmosphere respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of U-Th-Pb dating combined with charcoal and pollen as proxies to assess the potential upper age limit of vertebrate fossil records found within caves.
   The presence of pollen and charcoal in radiometrically dated speleothems suggest the Naracoorte Cave Complex, South Australia, has been open to the atmosphere for the past 600,000 years, placing an upper limit on the accumulation of fossils inside the caves.

AB  - Parasitism of mice by Toxoplasma gondii reduces the host's aversion to cat odours, likely increasing predation and transmission of the parasite to its definitive host. This behavioural change suggests a parasitic manipulation where host behaviour becomes an extended phenotype of the parasite. Independently, epigenetic changes within an organism are now known to create behavioural change. The results described here provide an experimental connection between these disparate strands of extended phenotypes and the role of epigenetics in behavioural diversity. Using mice captured on Kangaroo Island in Australia, we demonstrate that Toxoplasma gondii infection leads to specific DNA hypomethylation events in the host brain. Previous laboratory studies have shown that these epigenetic changes underlie the central processing of cat odours. We posit that the concept of extended phenotype can be expanded to extended epiphenotype, thus linking parasite genes to host behaviour through epigenesis. This phenomenon has broad implications for inter-species relationships. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of dietary hydroxytyrosol (HT) addition on piglets during the nursery phase across two experiments. In the first, 72 weaned male piglets (similar to 26 days old, 7.3 +/- 0.5 kg) were assigned to one of four diets containing 0, 5, 10, or 50 mg HT/kg feed. Growth performance, serum biochemistry, histological and behavioral parameters, and meat lipid profiles were assessed. In the second study, the apparent digestibility of diets containing 0, 25, or 50 mg HT/kg feed was evaluated using 15 male piglets (21.5 +/- 1.5 kg) through total excreta collection. Results revealed that HT influenced serum glucose and gamma-glutamyl transferase, histological inflammation, and active behaviors. HT modified lipid profiles, reduced capric, lauric, linolenic, arachidonic, cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic fatty acid concentrations, and increased the nervonic acid profile. The digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, energy, and protein increased with HT use up to 50 mg/kg of feed. These findings demonstrate that HT positively impacts piglet efficiency, changing the fatty acid profile with increased nervonic acid, highlighting its potential as a dietary additive for improving nursery pig production.

AB  - Ammonia is a significant pollutant in the livestock houses and the atmospheric environment, and excessive ammonia would harm the health of livestock and breeders. Previous studies have shown that ammonia exposure could damage the tissue structure of the nervous system, but the molecular mechanism of ammonia-induced hypothalamus damage was still unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of excessive ammonia in abnormal autophagy of pig hypothalamus and whether selenomethionine would have a mitigating effect on ammonia toxicity. Twenty-four 18-week pigs were randomly divided into four groups: the control group (C group), the selenium group (Se group), the ammonia + selenium group (A + Se group), and the ammonia group (A group). In our study, the expression levels of NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, iNOS, TNF-alpha, IKK-alpha, p-IKK-alpha, Nrf2, ATG5, ATG 10, ATG 12, LC3 I/II, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 were increased after ammonia exposure; meanwhile, IFN-gamma, IKB-alpha, p-IKB-alpha, Keap1, P62, mTOR, AKT, p-AKT, PI3K, SQSTM, and Beclinl showed decreasing trends. The results indicated that excessive ammonia inhalation inhibited the AKT/mTOR pathway to acclerated autophagy through oxidative stress-mediated inflammation in the porcine hypothalamus. L-selenomethionine could alleviate hypothalamus injury induced by ammonia exposure.

AB  - Pig diseases seriously threaten the health of pigs and the benefits of pig production. Previous research has indicated that Chinese native pigs, such as the Min (M) pig, has a better disease resistance ability than Large White (LW) pigs. However, the molecular mechanism of this resistance is still unclear. In our study, we used serum untargeted metabolomics and proteomics, interrogated to characterize differences in the molecular immunities between six resistant and six susceptible pigs raised in the same environment. A total of 62 metabolites were identified as being significantly exhibited in M and LW pigs. Ensemble feature selection (EFS) machine learning methods were used to predict biomarkers of metabolites and proteins, and the top 30 were selected and retained. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) confirmed that four key metabolites, PC (18:1 (11 Z)/20:0), PC (14:0/P-18: 0), PC (18:3 (6 Z, 9 Z, 12 Z)/16:0), and PC (16:1 (9 Z)/22:2 (13 Z, 16 Z)), were significantly associated with phenotypes, such as cytokines, and different pig breeds. Correlation network analysis showed that 15 proteins were significantly correlated with the expression of both cytokines and unsaturated fatty acid metabolites. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) co-location analysis results showed that 13 of 15 proteins co-localized with immune or polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-related QTL. Moreover, seven of them co-localized with both immune and PUFA QTLs, including proteasome 20S subunit beta 8 (PSMB8), mannose binding lectin 1 (MBL1), and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP). These proteins may play important roles in regulating the production or metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids and immune factors. Most of the proteins could be validated with parallel reaction monitoring, which suggests that these proteins may play an essential role in producing or regulating unsaturated fatty acids and immune factors to cope with the adaptive immunity of different pig breeds. Our study provides a basis for further clarifying the disease resistance mechanism of pigs.

AB  - Periparturient ewes display several activities in addition to maternal behavior per se. They isolate themselves from the flock and, contrary to other mammals, do not show postpartum estrus. We investigated the possibility of a common hormonal control of maternal behavior, prepartum social isolation responses, and absence of postpartum estrus. We quantified responses to flockmate separation and incidence of sexual receptivity at several reproductive stages in intact ewes (Experiment 1). Responses to social isolation were lowest in preparturient ewes and at pregnancy day 149, intermediate at pregnancy day 147 and highest at day 136 and in non-pregnant ewes (P < 0.05 between the 3 levels). In a second experiment, we quantified the same parameters and maternal behavior in 1) ovariectomized ewes receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate only (ovxMPA); 2) ovariectomized ewes receiving MPA + estradiol benzoate (ovxSHORT); 3) intact ewes receiving a longer MPA + estradiol dipropionate treatment, before and after vaginocervical stimulation (VCS). Before VCS no steroid treatments decreased social isolation responses and maternal behavior was scarce or absent. Following VCS and interaction with lamb, maternal responses in the ovxSHORT group increased while social isolation responses decreased. Sexual receptivity occurred in non-pregnant ewes and in ovxSHORT group. Conclusion: some hormonal treatments +VCS can effectively induce maternal behavior and reduce social isolation responses. Long-term progestin treatment can inhibit postpartum estrus.

AB  - Nonadditive genetic effects pose significant challenges to traditional genomic selection methods for quantitative traits. Machine learning approaches, particularly kernel-based methods, offer promising solutions to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a novel machine learning method, KPRR, which integrated a polynomial kernel into ridge regression to effectively capture nonadditive genetic effects. The predictive performance and computational efficiency of KPRR were evaluated using six datasets from various species, encompassing a total of 18 traits. All the traits were known to be influenced by additive, dominance, or epistatic genetic effects. We compared the performance of KPRR against six other genomic prediction methods: SPVR, BayesB, GBLUP, GEBLUP, GDBLUP, and DeepGS. For datasets dominated by additive effects, KPRR achieved superior prediction accuracies in the wheat dataset and comparable performance in the cattle dataset when compared to GBLUP. For datasets influenced by dominance effects, KPRR matched GDBLUP in accuracies in the pig dataset and outperformed GDBLUP in the sheep dataset. For datasets exhibiting epistatic effects, KPRR outperformed other methods in some traits, while BayesB showed superior performance in others. Incorporating nonadditive effects into a GBLUP model led to overall improvements in prediction accuracy. Regarding computational efficiency, KPRR was consistently the fastest, while BayesB was the slowest. Our findings demonstrated that KPRR provided significant advantages over traditional genomic prediction methods in capturing nonadditive effects.

AB  - Floral initiation is a major phase change in the spermatophyte, where developmental programs switch from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. It is a key phase of flowering in tea-oil trees that can affect flowering time and yield, but very little is known about the molecular mechanism of floral initiation in tea-oil trees. A 12-year-old Camellia oleifera (cultivar 'changlin53') was the source of experimental materials in the current study. Scanning electron microscopy was used to identify the key stage of floral initiation, and transcriptome analysis was used to reveal the transcriptional regulatory network in old leaves involved in floral initiation. We mined 5 DEGs related to energy and 55 DEGs related to plant hormone signal transduction, and we found floral initiation induction required a high level of energy metabolism, and the phytohormones signals in the old leaves regulate floral initiation, which occurred at stage I and II. Twenty-seven rhythm-related DEGs and 107 genes associated with flowering were also identified, and the circadian rhythm interacted with photoperiod pathways to induce floral initiation. Unigene0017292 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR), Unigene0046809 (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL), Unigene0009932 (GIGANTEA), Unigene0001842 (CONSTANS), and Unigene0084708 (FLOWER LOCUS T) were the key genes in the circadian rhythm-photoperiod regulatory network. In conjunction with morphological observations and transcriptomic analysis, we concluded that the induction of floral initiation by old leaves in C. oleifera 'changlin53' mainly occurred during stages I and II, floral initiation was completed during stage III, and rhythm-photoperiod interactions may be the source of the main signals in floral initiation induced by old leaves.

AB  - Certain life stressors having enduring physiological and behavioral consequences, in part by eliciting dramatic signaling shifts in monoamine neurotransmitters. High monoamine levels can overwhelm selective transporters like the serotonin transporter. This is when polyspecific transporters like plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT, Slc29a4) are hypothesized to contribute most to monoaminergic signaling regulation. Here, we employed two distinct counterbalanced stressors-fear conditioning and swim stress-in mice to systematically determine how reductions in PMAT function affect heterotypic stressor responsivity. We hypothesized that male heterozygotes would exhibit augmented stressor responses relative to female heterozygotes. Decreased PMAT function enhanced context fear expression, an effect unexpectedly obscured by a sham stress condition. Impaired cued fear extinction retention and enhanced context fear expression in males were conversely unmasked by a sham swim condition. Abrogated corticosterone levels in male heterozygotes that underwent swim stress after context fear conditioning did not map onto any measured behaviors. In sum, male heterozygous mouse fear behaviors proved malleable in response to preceding stressor or sham stress exposure. Combined, these data indicate that reduced male PMAT function elicits a form of stress-responsive plasticity. Future studies should assess how PMAT is differentially affected across sexes and identify downstream consequences of the stress-shifted corticosterone dynamics.

AB  - Aegle marmelos (L.) Correa belongs to the family Rutaceae is generally known as "bael fruit tree" occuring across the south Asian countries. The current investigation screened the main derivatives from crude ethanolic extracts of the Bael tree leaf and evaluated activity effects on the larvae and adults of Aedes aegypti (L.) Dengue vector mosquito and a non-target aquatic predator. The GC-MS results showed that the peak area was found to be profound in N-methyl-1-adamantaneacetamide (N-M 1a) followed by oleic acid (OA) with 63.08 and 11.43% respectively. The larvicidal activity against the fourth instar larvae and the crude Ex-Am showed prominent mortality rate (93.60%) at the maximum dosage of 100 ppm. The mortality rate of N-M 1a and OA was occurred at 10 ppm (97.73%) and 12 ppm (95.4%). The repellent activity was found to be prominent at crude Ex-Am (50 ppm) as compared to the pure compounds (N-m 1a and OA) with maximum protection time up to 210 min. The non-target screening of Ex-Am, N-M 1a, and OA on mosquito predator Tx. splendens showed that they are scarcely toxic even at the maximum dosage of 1000 ppm (34.13%), 100 ppm (27.3%), and 120 ppm (31.3%) respectively. Thus, the present investigation clearly proved that the crude Ex-Am and their major derivatives Nm 1-a and OA showed their acute larval toxicity as well as potential mosquito repellent against the dengue mosquito and eco-safety against the mosquito predator.

AB  - Stress-induced plant volatiles play an important role in mediating ecological interactions between plants and their environment. The timing and location of the inflicted damage is known to influence the quality and quantity of induced volatile emissions. However, how leaf characteristics and herbivore feeding behaviour interact to shape volatile emissions is not well understood. Using a high-throughput volatile profiling system with high temporal resolution, we examined how mechanical damage and herbivore feeding on different leaves shape plant-level volatile emission patterns in maize. We then tested feeding patterns and resulting consequences on volatile emissions with two generalist herbivores (Spodoptera exigua and Spodoptera littoralis), and assessed whether feeding preferences are associated with enhanced herbivore performance. We found maize seedlings emit more volatiles when larger leaves are damaged. Larger leaves emitted more volatiles locally, which was the determining factor for higher plant-level emissions. Surprisingly, both S. exigua and S. littoralis preferentially consumed larger leaves, and thus maximize plant volatile emission without apparent growth benefits. Together, these findings provide an ecophysiological and behavioural mechanism for plant volatile emission patterns, with potentially important implications for volatile-mediated plant-environment interactions.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance tends to carry fitness costs, making it difficult to understand how resistance can be maintained in the absence of continual antibiotic exposure. Here we investigate this problem in the context of mcr-1, a globally disseminated gene that confers resistance to colistin, an agricultural antibiotic that is used as a last resort for the treatment of multi-drug resistant infections. Here we show that regulatory evolution has fine-tuned the expression of mcr-1, allowing E. coli to reduce the fitness cost of mcr-1 while simultaneously increasing colistin resistance. Conjugative plasmids have transferred low-cost/high-resistance mcr-1 alleles across an incredible diversity of E. coli strains, further stabilising mcr-1 at the species level. Regulatory mutations were associated with increased mcr-1 stability in pig farms following a ban on the use of colistin as a growth promoter that decreased colistin consumption by 90%. Our study shows how regulatory evolution and plasmid transfer can combine to stabilise resistance and limit the impact of reducing antibiotic consumption.

AB  - In this study, a small-sized macroalgal bed was restored through the removal of sea urchins at a barren site in Kashiyama, Nagasaki Prefecture. Sea urchin densities decreased from 13.9 to 0.7 individuals/m(2) from June to November 2015, and remained low afterward. By the following spring, small-sized macroalgae such as Gelidiaceae spp. and Chondrophycus undulatus increased while large-sized macroalgae did not. The coverage of the small-sized macroalgae was three times that of the control area, in which the densities of sea urchins exceeded 12.2 individuals/m(2) throughout the experimental period. Tank experiments showed that many of the small-sized macroalgae examined (Dictyopteris undulata, D. prolifera, Gelidium elegans, and Dichotomaria falcata) were less vulnerable to feeding by Siganus fuscescens and Kyphosus bigibbus than large-sized macroalgae (Sargassum alternato-pinnatum). Our results indicate that small-sized macroalgal beds can be more easily restored than large-sized macroalgal beds simply through the removal of sea urchins, even under high browsing pressure from herbivorous fish. In small-sized macroalgal beds, the gonad index of Heliocidaris crassispina was higher than that of animals in the barren areas. Therefore, the restoration of small-sized macroalgal beds would likely be advantageous to sea urchin fisheries.

Ixodes affinis Neumann, 1899 is redescribed based on the original type specimens (females) from Leopardus pardalis, and from recently collected specimens from Costa Rica. Ixodes keiransi n. sp., previously treated as North American populations of Ixodes affinis, is described based on males and females from carnivores and ungulates from the southeastern United States. Concatenated total evidence phylogenetics based on combined DNA sequence analyses from mitochondrial genes (12SrDNA, 16SrDNA and COI) and a nuclear gene (ITS2) corroborate the recognition of these species.

AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife is a great concern because of its free-ranging movements. They carry bacterial zoonoses in their feces, such as Bacillus species. In this study, we developed a 16S Bacillus species-specific 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecular marker for species identification. For discrimination of genetically similar members of Bacillus cereus group, including Bacillus cereus, B. anthrax, and B. thuringiensis, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based marker was developed. We altered an artificial base at the 3 '-end of SNP sites in each SNP-based 16S rRNA primer sequence to improve the ability of SNP-based primers to bind the PCR template sequence, thereby improving the allele-specific detection of target B. cereus strains. SNP analysis in high-quality DNA sequences could facilitate identification and discrimination of closely related bacterial species. Ambiguous, heterogeneous, endospore-forming Bacillus species, notably Bacillus cereus, often produce fatal toxins that threaten human health. We identified Bacillus from wild animal fecal samples (n = 80), including the Korean water deer (n = 25) and striped field mouse (n = 55). Using traditional culture-based methods, 25 animal fecal samples (31.25%; 25/80) were found to be positive for Bacillus species, whereas using molecular techniques, 19 samples (23.75%; 19/80) were found to be positive for the same. In addition, we designed a Bacillus species-specific 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene marker and utilized it to identify 19 samples by means of PCR amplification and sequencing, using at least one colony from the 19 Bacillus positive samples. The recovered sequences were matched to sequences of three Bacillus species (B. cereus, B. amyloliquefaciens, and B. megaterium) from the GenBank database. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree generated in this study established specific clades for the Bacillus group. In addition, to differentiate between B. cereus, B. anthracis, and B. thuringiensis, we designed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based primer by identifying SNPs in the alignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences of B. cereus group strains. The SNPs were used to design primer sets for discrimination between highly similar species from the B. cereus group. The study could be used in surveillance of agricultural fresh-produce-associated Bacillus outbreaks, for accurate identification of each Bacillus species, and in the development of control measures.

AB  - The conventional luminescent materials used in the anticounterfeiting field generally exhibit unicolor output and a single-wavelength excitation mode, resulting in a poor anticounterfeiting effect. Herein, we successfully achieved a new transparent SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+/CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor-in-glass (PiG) with dynamic luminescence color variation from red to yellow in hundreds of seconds during the ultraviolet lamp irradiation and green persistent luminescence (PersL) after ceasing excitation. Additionally, the prepared PiG owns excitation wavelength- or doping weight ratio-dependent color-tunable luminescence. As a proof-of-concept experiment, the specially designed SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+/CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ PiG based flower patterns exhibit dynamic luminescence color variation under a simple ultraviolet lamp, and can be observed for quick discrimination. This work exploits a new perspective for the design of dynamic multicolor anticounterfeiting materials.

AB  - IntroductionPatients with medical and social complexity require care administered through cross-sector collaboration (CSC). Due to organizational complexity, biomedical emphasis, and exacerbated needs of patient populations, interventions requiring CSC prove challenging to implement and study. This report discusses challenges and provides strategies for implementation of CSC through a collaborative, cross-sector, interagency, multidisciplinary team model.MethodsA collaborative, cross-sector, interagency, multidisciplinary team was formed called the Buffalo City Mission Recuperative Care Collaborative (RCU Collaborative), in Buffalo, NY, to provide care transition support for people experiencing homelessness at acute care hospital discharge through a medical respite program. Utilizing the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) framework and feedback from cross-sector collaborative team, implementation strategies were drawn from three validated ERIC implementation strategy clusters: 1) Develop stakeholder relationships; 2) Use evaluative and iterative strategies; 3) Change infrastructure.ResultsStakeholders identified the following factors as the main barriers: organizational culture clash, disparate visions, and workforce challenges related to COVID-19. Identified facilitators were clear group composition, clinical academic partnerships, and strategic linkages to acute care hospitals.DiscussionA CSC interagency multidisciplinary team can facilitate complex care delivery for high-risk populations, such as medical respite care. Implementation planning is critically important when crossing agency boundaries for new multidisciplinary program development. Insights from this project can help to identify and minimize barriers and optimize utilization of facilitators, such as academic partners. Future research will address external organizational influences and emphasize CSC as central to interventions, not simply a domain to consider during implementation.

AB  - The population of ticks within North America has been increasing and expanding geographically due to climate change, reforestation, resurging deer populations, and other factors. A study was conducted to determine which species of ticks occur in Missouri during the summer season (June, July, and August). We initiated an expanded statewide surveillance using environmental samples and ticks collected by veterinary offices across the state in 2021. This work was a continuation of 2019 surveillance that involved 34 conservation areas from 22 counties. The survey was funded by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, in part to determine if the invasive Haemaphysalis longicornis was present in Missouri. Among all the species detected, only four species of medical importance were identified in 2019: Amblyomma americanum, Amblyomma maculatum, Dermacentor variabilis, and Ixodes scapularis . In 2021 following an expanded surveillance, however, sampling did detect the invasive species H. longicornis in Missouri. Our study is intended to inform environmental health professionals of the prevalence of tick species of importance in Missouri, the pathogens these species harbor, and human health risks. This information can increase awareness of tick species-including new novel species-to educate the public about safety and preventive practices, as well as possibly inform the development of diagnostic and treatment protocols.

AB  - Bactrocera dorsalis and its larvae have evolved to cope with the hypoxic environment during their lifetime. In this study, we sequenced the transcriptomes of B. dorsalis under and post anoxia stress. Our data revealed the different biological mechanisms of B. dorsalis in response to anoxia and during recovery from anoxia. The induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs) might be one of the important mechanisms for B. dorsalis to tolerate anoxia. Furthermore, our data showed B. dorsalis acquires energy through gluconeogenesis rather than glycolysis under anoxia and upregulated its lipid metabolism post anoxia. The up-regulation of the genes involved in the Hippo signaling pathway might also play a role in eliminating damaged cells as a result of anoxia. Furthermore, the HIF system of B. dorsalis did not change in response to anoxia stress in this study. We hypothesized that the HIF system in B. dorsalis might be activated by a specific duration of anoxia.

AB  - Intensive selection raises the efficiency of pig farming considerably, but it also promotes the accumulation of homozygosity, which can lead to an increase in inbreeding and the accumulation of deleterious variation. The analysis of segments homozygous-by-descent (HBD) and non-HBD segments in purebred and crossbred pigs is of great interest. Research was carried out on 657 pigs, of which there were Large White (LW, n = 280), Landrace (LR, n = 218) and F1 female (male LR x female LW) (F1, n = 159). Genotyping was performed using the GeneSeek(R) GGP Porcine HD Genomic Profiler v1 (Illumina Inc., USA). To identify HBD segments and estimate autozygosity (inbreeding coefficient), we used the multiple HBD classes model. LW pigs exhibited 50,420 HBD segments, an average of 180 per animal; LR pigs exhibited 33,586 HBD segments, an average of 154 per animal; F1 pigs exhibited 21,068 HBD segments, an average of 132 per animal. The longest HBD segments in LW were presented in SSC1, SSC13 and SSC15; in LR, in SSC1; and in F1, in SSC15. In these segments, 3898 SNPs localized in 1252 genes were identified. These areas overlap with 441 QTLs (SSC1-238 QTLs; SSC13-101 QTLs; and SSC15-102 QTLs), including 174 QTLs for meat and carcass traits (84 QTLs-fatness), 127 QTLs for reproduction traits (100 QTLs-litter traits), 101 for production traits (69 QTLs-growth and 30 QTLs-feed intake), 21 QTLs for exterior traits (9 QTLs-conformation) and 18 QTLs for health traits (13 QTLs-blood parameters). Thirty SNPs were missense variants. Whilst estimating the potential for deleterious variation, six SNPs localized in the NEDD4, SEC11C, DCP1A, CCT8, PKP4 and TENM3 genes were identified, which may show deleterious variation. A high frequency of potential deleterious variation was noted for LR in DCP1A, and for LW in TENM3 and PKP4. In all cases, the genotype frequencies in F1 were intermediate between LR and LW. The findings presented in our work show the promise of genome scanning for HBD as a strategy for studying population history, identifying genomic regions and genes associated with important economic traits, as well as deleterious variation.

AB  - Hu sheep is a valuable sheep breed in China, and semen cryopreservation of Hu sheep is important for sustainable development of the agri-food industry. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of thawing rate and antioxidants (procyanidins [PC] and mitoquinone [MitoQ]) on the quality and antioxidant enzyme activity of post-thaw sperm in Hu sheep. Our results showed that the highest sperm quality was obtained from the group thawed at 70 degrees C for 5 seconds. Furthermore, addition of 150 nM MitoQ in the extender could enhance motility, integrity of the membrane and acrosome, and mitochondrial activity, whereas only sperm motility and membrane integrity were increased with 10 mu g/mL of PC supplementation, compared with the control group. Meanwhile, both PC (10 mu g/mL) and MitoQ (150 nM) supplementation increased the levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde. In conclusion, the optimal thawing protocol of semen cryopreservation in Hu sheep was 70 degrees C for 5 seconds. MitoQ supplementation (150 mM) in the extender could improve sperm quality and reduce the level of oxidative stress in Hu sheep semen after cryopreservation. Further studies are needed to evaluate fertility of the post-thaw semen using MitoQ.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of phytobiotics on the intestinal health and growth performance of pigs. Totals of 40 newly-weaned pigs with 6.4 +/- 0.3 kg BW (Exp. 1) and 120 growing pigs with 27.9 +/- 2.3 kg BW (Exp. 2) were allotted in RCBD in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. The factors were: antibiotics as growth promoter (AGP) and phytobiotics (PHY). Pigs were fed experimental diets during 21 d (Exp. 1) and 42 d (Exp. 2). Growth performance, health parameters, and nutrient digestibility were evaluated. In Exp. 1, AGP diet increased (p < 0.05) ADG and G:F compared with a diet without AGP or PHY and a diet with AGP combined with PHY. PHY decreased (p < 0.05) TNF-alpha and IgG in the jejunum and protein carbonyl in plasma, whereas it increased (p < 0.05) the villus height. In Exp. 2, AGP or PHY diets increased (p < 0.05) ADG, ADFI, and G:F compared with a diet without AGP or PHY and a diet with AGP combined with PHY. PHY decreased (p < 0.05) IgG and PC in plasma. Collectively, AGP and PHY improved growth performance by reducing oxidative stress and enhancing immune status and jejunal morphology. However, the combinational use of phytobiotics with antibiotics suppressed their effect.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a toxic heavy metal that severely impairs plant growth and crop quality. Melatonin, a widely present indoleamine compound, enhances plant stress tolerance, yet its role in tea plant resistance to lead stress remains unclear. This study examined two tea genotypes with distinct anthocyanin levels, Longjing43 (LJ43) and Zijuan (ZJ), comparing their phenotype, antioxidant capacity, secondary metabolite synthesis, and lead transport gene expression under lead stress. Excessive Pb exposure caused severe oxidative stress, reducing PSII efficiency, increasing ROS accumulation, and intensifying lipid peroxidation. ZJ, with higher anthocyanin concentration, exhibited stronger lead stress resistance than LJ43. Under lead stress, melatonin promoted phenylalanine accumulation in ZJ, facilitating its conversion into anthocyanins and catechins via key gene regulation (CsC4H, CsLAR, and CsANS). Moreover, exogenous melatonin significantly reduced Pb concentrations in roots, stems, and leaves, with a more pronounced effect in ZJ (reductions of 20.46%, 53.30%, and 38.17%, respectively), which might be associated with the downregulation of Pb transport genes like CsZIP1 (notably showing a 29-fold decrease). While these results suggest that melatonin might enhance Pb stress tolerance by modulating flavonoid metabolism and restricting Pb uptake, the specific roles of anthocyanins and catechins in this process remains to be fully elucidated. Further studies are necessary to clarify the primary bioactive compounds and mechanisms involved in melatonin-mediated heavy metal stress mitigation.

AB  - Exposure to mercury (Hg) and pesticides (o.p'DDT, p.p'DDT, o.p'DDE, and p.p'DDE) in the Amazon through eating fish is of concern due to the large participation of this food in the diet of traditional fishing communities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the estimated daily intake (EDI) and the incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with Hg and o.p'DDT, p.p'DDT, o.p'DDE, and p.p'DDE in an Amazonian community. The results showed that for Hg, the EDI from carnivorous and detritivorous fish had the highest values, while for pesticides, the EDI from detritivorous fish intake had the highest value. The incremental lifetime cancer risk was below the permitted limit. A recommendation for controlling the high risk of exposure includes the reduction of detritivorous fish ingestion and/or replacement with herbivorous fish, which had lower EDI. We highlight the importance of investigating the human dietary patterns when estimating risk of exposure to Hg and pesticides.

TI  - Biobased films from unconventionally sourced starch (Cucurbita foetidissima Kunth) and oregano essential oil (Lippia berlandieri Schauer): A look at their physicochemical properties
T2  - MRS ADVANCES
LA  - English
AB  - Buffalo gourd root starch (BGRS) and Mexican oregano essential oil (OEO) were used to obtain bioplastic films. The effect of different concentrations of OEO (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% w/w in relation with starch) on the films physicochemical properties was evaluated. The additive inclusion significatively impacted on optical, mechanical, permeability, thermal, wettability, and morphological properties compared to the control, outstanding this effect on samples at low OEO concentrations (0.1 and 0.3% w/w respect to the BGRS), due to its component's plasticizer capacity. FTIR analysis evidenced the different degrees of material's components mixtures integration through the possible formation of hydrogen bonds to which the changes in the physicochemical properties of the obtained films could be attributed. SEM micrography showed an appropriated components integration for 0.1 and 0.5% OEO concentrations. According to their properties, these films may have a greater possibility to have practical applications, including food packaging.

AB  - Simple Summary In this work, we have shown for the first time that deletion of the transcription factor Satb1 in cortical neurons leads to changes in the expression of key protein kinases involved in the induction of epileptiform activity. As a result, neurons derived from mice with a Satb1 deletion are not only characterized by increased hyperexcitation but also by increased sensitivity to hypoxia and impaired hypoxic preconditioning mechanisms.Abstract Genetic disorders affecting the functioning of the brain lead not only to the development of numerous hereditary diseases but also to the development of neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders. The result of this may be the disability of part of the able-bodied population. Almost all pathological states of the brain are characterized by serious defects in the intracellular and intercellular signaling of neurons and glial cells. At the same time, the mechanisms of disruption of these signaling cascades are not well understood due to the large number of molecules, including transcription factors that, when mutated, cause brain malformations. The transcription factor Satb1 is one of the least studied factors in the cerebral cortex, and the effects of its deletion in the postnatal brain are practically not studied. Hyperexcitability of neurons is observed in many genetic diseases of the nervous system (Hirschsprung's disease, Martin-Bell syndrome, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's, etc.), as well as in ischemic brain phenomena and convulsive and epileptic conditions of the brain. In turn, all these disorders of brain physiology are associated with defects in intracellular and intercellular signaling and are often the result of genetic disorders. Using Satb1 mutant mice and calcium neuroimaging, we show that Satb1 deletion in projection neurons of the neocortex causes downregulation of protein kinases PKC, CaMKII, and AKT/PKB, while a partial deletion does not cause a dramatic disruption of kinome and Ca2+ signaling. As a result, Satb1-null neurons are characterized by increased spontaneous Ca2+ activity and hyperexcitability when modeling epileptiform activity. As a result of the deletion of Satb1, preconditioning mechanisms are disrupted in neurons during episodes of hypoxia. This occurs against the background of increased sensitivity of neurons to a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen, which may indicate the vulnerability of neuronal networks and be accompanied by impaired expression of the Satb1 transcription factor. Here, we show that Satb1 deletion impaired the expression of a number of key kinases and neuronal hyperexcitation in models of epileptiform activity and hypoxia.

AB  - Many plant species worldwide are dispersed by scatter-hoarding granivores: animals that hide seeds in numerous, small caches for future consumption. Yet, the evolution of scatter-hoarding is difficult to explain because undefended caches are at high risk of pilferage. Previous models have attempted to solve this problem by giving cache owners large advantages in cache recovery, by kin selection, or by introducing reciprocal pilferage of 'shared' seed resources. However, the role of environmental variability has been so far overlooked in this context. One important form of such variability is masting, which is displayed by many plant species dispersed by scatterhoarders. We use a mathematical model to investigate the influence of masting on the evolution of scatter-hoarding. The model accounts for periodically varying annual seed fall, caching and pilfering behaviour, and the demography of scatterhoarders. The parameter values are based mostly on research on European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis). Starvation of scatterhoarders between mast years decreases the population density that enters masting events, which leads to reduced seed pilferage. Satiation of scatterhoarders during mast events lowers the reproductive cost of caching (i.e. the cost of caching for the future rather than using seeds for current reproduction). These reductions promote the evolution of scatter-hoarding behaviour especially when interannual variation in seed fall and the period between masting events are large. This article is part of the theme issue 'The ecology and evolution of synchronized seed production in plants'.

AB  - Skatole of gut origin has garnered significant attention as a malodorous pollutant due to its escalating emissions, recalcitrance to biodegradation and harm to animal and human health. Magnolol is a health -promoting polyphenol with potential to considerably mitigate the skatole production in the intestines. To investigate the impact of magnolol and its underlying mechanism on the skatole formation, in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted in pigs. Our results revealed that skatole concentrations in the cecum, colon, and faeces decreased by 58.24% (P = 0.088), 44.98% (P < 0.05) and 43.52% (P < 0.05), respectively, following magnolol supplementation. Magnolol supplementation significantly decreased the abundance of Lachnospira, Faecalibacterium, Paramuribaculum, Faecalimonas, Desulfovibrio, Bariatricus, and Mogibacterium within the colon (P < 0.05). Moreover, a strong positive correlation (P < 0.05) between skatole concentration and Desulfovibrio abundance was observed. Subsequent in silico studies showed that magnolol could dock well with indolepyruvate decarboxylase (IPDC) within Desulfovibrio. Further in vitro investigation unveiled that magnolol addition led to less indole-3pyruvate diverted towards the oxidative skatole pathway by the potential docking of magnolol towards IPDC, thereby diminishing the conversion of substrate into skatole. Our findings offer novel targets and strategies for skatole emission from the source.

AB  - The large-scale commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) cotton has brought significant economic and environmental benefits. However, GM crops must undergo strict environmental monitoring and long-term observation. An important natural enemy insect in cotton fields, Geocoris pallidipennis, can ingest the Bt pro-tein expressed in GM cotton by feeding on herbivorous insects that feed on the cotton. However, the potential risk of GM cotton to G. pallidipennis is still unclear. We here evaluated the effects of Bt cotton expressing the Cry1Ac/1Ab protein on nymphs and adults G. pallidipennis. Cry1Ac protein was detected in the midgut of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, after it ingested Bt cotton, and in the midgut of G. pallidipennis nymphs and adults preying on Bt-fed H. armigera. However, the survival rate, growth, development, and fecundity of G. pallidipennis were not adversely affected. Furthermore, G. pallidipennis cadherins, and those genes related to detoxification, antioxidant activity, nutrient utilization, and immune function were not differentially expressed in response to Cry1Ac exposure. Finally, we showed that Cry1Ac could not bind to brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) proteins in G. pallidipennis nymphs or adults. In summary, these results indicate that the po-tential negative effect of transgenic Cry1Ac/1Ab cotton on the insect redator G. pallidipennis is negligible.

AB  - Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disorder belonging to the group of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases, which are caused by an infectious isoform of the innocuous cellular prion protein (PrPC) known as PrPSc. DNA methylation, one of the most studied epigenetic mechanisms, is essential for the proper functioning of the central nervous system. Recent findings point to possible involvement of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, but there is still a lack of knowledge about the behavior of this epigenetic mechanism in such neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we evaluated by immunohistochemistry the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels in sheep and mouse brain tissues infected with scrapie. Expression analysis of different gene coding for epigenetic regulatory enzymes (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HDAC1, HDAC2, TET1, and TET2) was also carried out. A decrease in 5mC levels was observed in scrapie-affected sheep and mice compared to healthy animals, whereas 5hmC displayed opposite patterns between the two models, demonstrating a decrease in 5hmC in scrapie-infected sheep and an increase in preclinical mice. 5mC correlated with prion-related lesions in mice and sheep, but 5hmC was associated with prion lesions only in sheep. Differences in the expression changes of epigenetic regulatory genes were found between both disease models, being differentially expressed Dnmt3b, Hdac1, and Tet1 in mice and HDAC2 in sheep. Our results support the evidence that DNA methylation in both forms, 5mC and 5hmC, and its associated epigenetic enzymes, take part in the neurodegenerative course of prion diseases.

AB  - The association of air pollution and greenspace with respiratory pathogen acquisition and respiratory health was investigated in a community-based birth-cohort of 158 Australian children. Weekly nasal swabs and daily symptom-diaries were collected for 2-years, with annual reviews from ages 3-7-years. Annual exposure to fine-particulate-matter (PM2.5), nitrogen-dioxide (NO2), and normalised-difference-vegetation-index (NDVI) was estimated for pregnancy and the first 2-years-of-life. We examined rhinovirus, any respiratory virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae detections in the first 3-months-of-life, age at initial pathogen detection, wheezing in the first 2-years, and asthma at ages 5-7-years. Our findings suggest that higher NDVI was associated with fewer viral and M. catarrhalis detections in the first 3-months, while increased PM2.5 and NO2 were linked to earlier symptomatic rhinovirus and H. influenzae detections, respectively. However, no associations were observed with wheezing or asthma. Early-life exposure to air pollution and greenspace may influence early-life respiratory pathogen acquisition and illness.

AB  - The clinical diagnosis of dermatophytosis and identification of dermatophytes face challenges due to reliance on culture-based methods. Rapid, cost-effective detection techniques for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been developed for other microorganisms, but their application to dermatophytes is limited. This study explores using VOCs as diagnostic markers for dermatophytes. We compared VOC profiles across different dermatophyte taxa using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and advanced analytical methods: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS). We analyzed 47 dermatophyte strains from 15 taxa grown on sheep wool, including clinically significant species. Additionally, we examined phylogenetic relationships among the strains to correlate genetic relatedness with metabolite production. Our results showed that GCxGC-TOFMS offered superior resolution but similar differentiation of VOC profiles compared to GC-MS. VOC spectra allowed reliable distinction of taxonomic units at the species level and below, however, these distinctions showed only a slight correlation with phylogenetic data. We identified pan-dermatophyte and species- or strain-specific VOC profiles, indicating their potential for rapid, non-invasive detection of dermatophyte infections, including epidemic strains. These patterns could enable future taxa-specific identification. Our study highlights the potential of VOCs as tools for dermatophyte taxonomy and diagnosis.

AB  - Simple Summary Non-specific uterine infections in bovine (uterine line inflammation) are a significant issue for the dairy industry. These infections are responsible for significant financial losses all over the world. Paraclostridium bifermentans is an obligate anaerobe, gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria belonging to the Clostridia class and the Peptostreptococcaceae family produces endospores. This bacterium has the ability to infiltrate bovine uterine endometrial epithelial cells and cause infection in the endometrium epithelial cells. Our study found that an examination of a buffalo uterus with yellowish purulent discharge reported the presence of pathogenic bacteria Paraclostridium bifermentans, where its genomic characterization, substrate utilization, and antibiotic susceptibility potentiality was studied. This discovery indicates the presence of virulence genes as well as pathogenic features. This is the first report of P. bifermentans from the bovine uterus environment. Chronic non-specific contamination of the reproductive tract in animals is a major issue during early postpartum, natural coitus, or artificial insemination. Uterine infection is one of the major concerns reducing fertility, production loss, and early culling of the animals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify any novel bacterium if present in the uterine environment of Bubalus bubalis causing infections. A strictly anaerobic bacterial strain designated as Paraclostridium bifermentans GBRC was isolated and characterized. Bacterium was found to be Gram positive moderate rod with motility. The optimum growth was observed at 40 +/- 2 degrees C. The pathogenic characteristics of the GBRC strain, such as hemolysis, gelatin hydrolysis, and the production of volatile sulfur compounds, were similar to those seen in the epithelial layer invading pathogenic strains. Assembled genome size was 3.6 MB, with 78 contigs, and a G + C content of 28.10%. Furthermore, the whole genome sequence analysis confirmed the presence of genes encoding virulence factors and provided genomic insights on adaptation of the strain in the uterine environment. Based on the phenotypic and genetic differences with phylogenetic relatives, strain GBRC is proposed to represent a first reported species of the genus Paraclostridium with potential pathogenic character, from the buffalo uterine environment. This study analysis of the GBRC strain serves as a key reference point for the investigation of potential pathogenic strains that may cause endometritis and metritis in bovine.

AB  - Organelle-derived nuclear DNAs, nuclear plastid DNAs (NUPTs), and nuclear mitochondrial DNAs (NUMTs) have been identified in plants. Most, if not all, genes residing in NUPTs/NUMTs (NUPGs/NUMGs) are known to be inactivated and pseudogenized. However, the role of epigenetic control in silencing NUPGs/NUMGs and the dynamic evolution of NUPTs/NUMTs with respect to organismal phylogeny remain barely explored. Based on the available nuclear and organellar genomic resources of wheat (genus Triticum) and goat grass (genus Aegilops) within Triticum/Aegilops complex species, we investigated the evolutionary fates of NUPTs/NUMTs in terms of their epigenetic silencing and their dynamic occurrence rates in the nuclear diploid genomes and allopolyploid subgenomes. NUPTs and NUMTs possessed similar genomic atlas, including (i) predominantly located in intergenic regions and preferential integration to gene regulation regions and (ii) generating sequence variations in the nuclear genome. Unlike nuclear indigenous genes, the alien NUPGs/NUMGs were associated with repressive epigenetic signals, namely high levels of DNA methylation and low levels of active histone modifications. Phylogenomic analyses suggested that the species-specific and gradual accumulation of NUPTs/NUMTs accompanied the speciation processes. Moreover, based on further pan-genomic analyses, we found significant subgenomic asymmetry in the NUPT/NUMT occurrence, which accumulated during allopolyploid wheat evolution. Our findings provide insight into the dynamic evolutionary fates of organelle-derived nuclear DNA in plants.
   Dynamic genetic and epigenetic changes in organelle-derived nuclear DNAs drive intricate genome evolution in the diverse Triticum/Aegilops complex species, shaping their genetic landscape over time.

AB  - center dot Sexing monomorphic birds is essential for reproduction in conservation programs. In ramphastids (toucans) species, males have longer beaks than females, making beak morphometry potentially useful for sexing. In this study, we measured the following traits: curved beak length, total culmen length, straight beak length, curved and straight length of the ventral line of the gnathotheca, beak width, lateral area of the rhinotheca, and cloacal opening in 44 Keel-billed Toucans, as well as previously reported morphometric data from 17 additional individuals. Measurements were obtained using two methods (manual and image processing software), and the reliability between the two methods was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Individuals of unknown sex were sexed via PCR tests. The ICC showed poor reliability between the two measurement methods, so we only used manual measurements for comparisons between the sexes. We used GLMMs to determine whether the morphometric traits we measured could be used to determine sex in keel-billed toucans. In addition, we evaluated GLMMs to determine which morphometric trait was the strongest predictor of sex in this species. Beak length was longer in adult males than in females. The GLMMs indicated that beak traits associated with sex in this species are beak curved length, beak straight length, straight length of the ventral line of the gnathotheca, and total culmen length. The straight length of the ventral line of the gnathotheca was the strongest predictor of sex in the Keel-billed Toucan. Unlike previous research, the development of GLMMs allows us to determine the probability of a toucan's sex based on continuous variables, facilitating sexing and allowing us to evaluate the reliability of the estimation of the sexing of each toucan. This method is an alternative for situations where other sexing methodologies cannot be performed.

AB  - MiRNAs regulate follicle development and atresia, steroid production, granulosa cell (GC) proliferation, and apoptosis. However, the target genes and the functioning of novel miRNAs remain unexplored. We reveal the targeting relationship between novel-m0297-5p and WNT5A and the specific regulatory mechanism of GC proliferation in small-tailed Han sheep using whole transcriptomic sequencing. We performed whole transcriptomic sequencing on small-tailed Han sheep ovarian GCs supplemented with 10 ng/mL of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) during the early stages. This led to identifying the differential expression of novel-m0297-5p and Wnt family member 5A (WNT5A) and predicting their targeting relationship. Based on this, we hypothesized that TGF-beta 1 could mediate novel-m0297-5p targeting WNT5A to participate in the proliferation process of GCs in small-tailed sheep. We confirmed the relationship between TGF-beta 1 and both novel-m0297-5p and WNT5A. The mimicry of novel-m0297-5p inhibited GC activity and proliferation. However, the inhibition of novel-m0297-5p yielded the opposite effect. We validated the binding site for novel m0297-5p within the 3 ' UTR of WNT5A using dual-luciferase reporter gene. TGF-beta 1 alleviated the impact induced by the mimicry of novel-m0297-5p on cell viability. Inhibitor co-transfection for both novel-m0297-5p and si-WNT5A suppressed the granulocyte proliferation induced by novel-m0297-5p inhibition. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1 can mediate the inhibitory effect of novel-m0297-5p targeting WNT5A on GC proliferation and activity in small-tailed Han sheep. This study provides an experimental basis for research on the biological function of GCs and their impact on follicle development.

AB  - A cyto-, myelo-, and chemoarchitectonic analysis of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin is provided. As certain portions of the pallial telencephalon have been described previously (olfactory pallium, hippocampal formation, and amygdaloid complex), we focus on the claustrum and endopiriform nuclear complex, the white matter and white matter interstitial cells, and the areal organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis indicates that the organization of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin is similar to that observed in many other mammals, and specifically quite similar to the closely related carnivores. The claustrum of the tree pangolin exhibits a combination of insular and laminar architecture, while the endopiriform nuclear complex contains three nuclei, both reminiscent of observations made in other mammals. The population of white matter interstitial cells resembles that observed in other mammals, while a distinct laminated organization of the intracortical white matter was revealed with parvalbumin immunostaining. The cerebral cortex of the tree pangolin presented with indistinct laminar boundaries as well as pyramidalization of the neurons in both layers 2 and 4. All cortical regions typically found in mammals were present, with the cortical areas within these regions often corresponding to what has been reported in carnivores. Given the similarity of the organization of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin to that observed in other mammals, especially carnivores, it would be reasonable to assume that the neural processing afforded the tree pangolin by these structures does not differ dramatically to that of other mammals.

AB  - This study investigates the microstructural evolution during the coprecipitation of metastable gamma '' (D022-Ni3Nb) particles within a supersaturated gamma matrix in commercial IN625 Ni-based superalloy. The research aims to comprehensively understand the morphological evolution and fraction distribution of precipitate phases to enhance material strength and guide the design of additive manufacturing processes. A sophisticated coupled computational phase-field model is developed. The novel phase-field model within the open-source multiphysics object oriented simulation environment finite element framework enables the efficient construction of coupled phase-field mechanics models for multiphase systems. The quantitative precipitation model incorporates essential inputs, such as ab initio calculations, experimental data, precipitate-matrix orientation relationships, interfacial energy, interdiffusivities, and a tailored thermodynamic database. Simulation results reveal the intricate interplay of alloy composition, lattice misfit, external stress, temperature, and time, influencing the dynamic microstructure evolution during additive manufacturing. The findings highlight the significant influence of thermal cycles and process parameters on gamma '' precipitate formation, directly impacting material properties and volumetric fraction. Leveraging experimental-driven formulations for coherent strength optimization aims to maximize gamma '' precipitates while minimizing postprocessing costs.

AB  - Tea plant germplasm resources are abundant in China. Effectively identifying tea varieties and evaluating the tea bud sprouting period (BSP) are critical for tea plant breeding and tea plantation management. This study focused on key tea varieties cultivated in the tea-growing regions of Shandong Province, China. UAV-based multispectral and RGB images of seven tea varieties were collected before and during the budding period in spring. Five machine learning classification algorithms, LSTM, BP, PSO-BP, GA-BP and SVM were employed to classify tea varieties and BSP. Results indicated significant spectral differences among tea varieties across six spectral bands. Spectral differences among varieties collected during budding became more pronounced than that pre-budding period. Machine learning techniques effectively distinguished different tea varieties and BSP. Models of LSTM, BP and PSO-BP established by data collected during budding enhanced the classification accuracy of tea varieties by 0.45 similar to 2.11% than that before budding. The integration of indices and texture features from both sampling periods further improved classification accuracy of tea varieties. BP model achieved the highest variety and BSP classification accuracy with a test set accuracy of 93.65% and 92.86%, respectively, followed by LSTM with the accuracy of 93.65% and 90.48%, respectively. Considering computational speed and accuracy, the BP classification model was well-suited for real-time classification needs in various application scenarios. This study provides technical support for large-scale tea variety classification and budding phenology monitoring. It also serves as a valuable reference for the rapid screening, identifying, and improving tea plant superior germplasm, thereby enhancing breeding efficiency.

AB  - Plants have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms against insect herbivores, including cell wall fortification through lignin biosynthesis. Insect attack primes systemic acquired resistance in plants, preparing them to respond more swiftly and vigorously to subsequent insect assaults. Here, we found that Beauveria bassiana-exposed maize plants can emit phytol upon infestation by Spodoptera frugiperda, inducing plant-to-plant (PTP) communication of alert signals for neighboring plants, and revealed the expansin protein EXP-A20 as a pivotal node mediating maize defense responses in neighboring plants against the destructive pest Ostrinia furnacalis via stimulation of ethylene (ET) synthesis and lignin production. Through virus-induced gene silencing, we showed that EXP-A20 is essential for maize resistance, while downregulating ET and lignin pathways. Critically, protein-protein interactions determined via luciferase complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that EXP-A20 binds to and likely activates the ET-forming enzyme gene ACO31 to initiate defense signaling cascades, representing a novel signaling modality for expansins. Treatment with the plant volatile phytol has known insecticidal/priming activity, but we found that its effectiveness requires EXP-A20. This finding highlights the importance of EXP-A20 upstream of hormone-cell wall crosstalk in defense activation by volatiles. Overall, our multifaceted dissection of EXP-A20 revealed key molecular intersections underlying inducible maize immunity against herbivores. Furthermore, we provide functional evidence that extensive cell growth processes directly stimulate defense programs in plants. Our work opens new avenues for enhancing durable, broad-spectrum pest resistance in maize through the use of volatile organic compounds and PTP interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary This study addresses the significance of animal sounds as valuable indicators of both behavior and health in animals, emphasizing the challenges involved in collecting datasets for deep learning models. Particularly, in the context of classifying pig vocalization and non-vocalization, it is identified as laborious and time-consuming when relying on human efforts. In response to these challenges, the research proposes a new approach utilizing a deep learning model to automatically classify pig vocalization and non-vocalization with high accuracy. The success of this method not only provides an efficient means of collecting pig sound datasets but also presents a promising avenue for improving the classification of pig vocalization and non-vocalization in deep learning models, thereby contributing to advancements in animal behavior research and health monitoring.Abstract Since pig vocalization is an important indicator of monitoring pig conditions, pig vocalization detection and recognition using deep learning play a crucial role in the management and welfare of modern pig livestock farming. However, collecting pig sound data for deep learning model training takes time and effort. Acknowledging the challenges of collecting pig sound data for model training, this study introduces a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture for pig vocalization and non-vocalization classification with a real pig farm dataset. Various audio feature extraction methods were evaluated individually to compare the performance differences, including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Mel-spectrogram, Chroma, and Tonnetz. This study proposes a novel feature extraction method called Mixed-MMCT to improve the classification accuracy by integrating MFCC, Mel-spectrogram, Chroma, and Tonnetz features. These feature extraction methods were applied to extract relevant features from the pig sound dataset for input into a deep learning network. For the experiment, three datasets were collected from three actual pig farms: Nias, Gimje, and Jeongeup. Each dataset consists of 4000 WAV files (2000 pig vocalization and 2000 pig non-vocalization) with a duration of three seconds. Various audio data augmentation techniques are utilized in the training set to improve the model performance and generalization, including pitch-shifting, time-shifting, time-stretching, and background-noising. In this study, the performance of the predictive deep learning model was assessed using the k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) technique on each dataset. By conducting rigorous experiments, Mixed-MMCT showed superior accuracy on Nias, Gimje, and Jeongeup, with rates of 99.50%, 99.56%, and 99.67%, respectively. Robustness experiments were performed to prove the effectiveness of the model by using two farm datasets as a training set and a farm as a testing set. The average performance of the Mixed-MMCT in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score reached rates of 95.67%, 96.25%, 95.68%, and 95.96%, respectively. All results demonstrate that the proposed Mixed-MMCT feature extraction method outperforms other methods regarding pig vocalization and non-vocalization classification in real pig livestock farming.

AB  - Global mean sea level (GMSL) during intermediate interglacial Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) (60-26 ka) has proven difficult to constrain. Paleo-sea level estimates based on ice margin, modeling, and paleo-shoreline reconstructions indicate that MIS 3 GMSL was substantially higher than reconstructed from deep-ocean benthic foraminifera oxygen isotope (delta O-18) and coral records, implying much smaller ice sheets during MIS 3. Here, we use the delta O-18 and Mg/Ca chemistry of surface and thermocline dwelling foraminifera in the Sulu Sea in the western Pacific margin to estimate relative changes of the influx of South China Sea surface flow through the Sulu Sea over the last 140 ka. We show that this South China Sea throughflow is controlled in part by changes in GMSL modulating the depth of the 36 m deep Karimata Strait at the southern end of the South China Sea. We constrain maximum allowable GMSL at the beginning and end of MIS 3 to -22 +/- 6 and -29 +/- 5 m, respectively, and minimum allowable GMSL during interglacial stages MIS 5c and 5a (117-72 ka) to range from -3 +/- 8 to -8 +/- 8 m and -11 +/- 7 to -12 +/- 7 m, respectively. Our results constrain MIS 3 GMSL, but do not rule out higher MIS 3 ice margin, modeling, and paleo-shoreline-based MIS 3 GMSL estimates or lower coral and seawater delta O-18-based estimates. Our results favor the highest MIS 5a and 5c GMSL estimates and confirm that the Sunda Shelf served as a land-bridge for human and megafauna migration during MIS 3 when humans first arrived in Borneo.

AB  - Simple Summary After four decades of studies on methods to assess pain in sheep, a pain scale composed of behavioral items that are fast, robust, and simple to apply was recently developed-the Unesp-Botucatu sheep acute pain scale (USAPS). Scientific evidence suggests that considering the importance of each behavior separately may improve the quality of pain diagnosis; however, this has not yet been studied for animal pain assessment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether the implementation of statistical weights using machine learning algorithms improves the discriminatory capacity of the USAPS. A behavioral database, previously collected for USAPS validation, of 48 sheep before and after an abdominal surgical procedure was used. A multilevel binomial logistic regression algorithm and a random forest algorithm were used to establish the statistical weights and classify the sheep as to whether they needed analgesia or not. The quality of the USAPS pain diagnosis weighted by the two algorithms was better than the original version of the instrument. We conclude that considering the importance of each USAPS behavior by the two machine learning algorithms improved the instrument's ability to differentiate sheep in pain from those free of pain. Recently, the Unesp-Botucatu sheep acute pain scale (USAPS) was created, refined, and psychometrically validated as a tool that offers fast, robust, and simple application. Evidence points to an improvement in pain diagnosis when the importance of the behavioral items of an instrument is statistically weighted; however, this has not yet been investigated in animals. The objective was to investigate whether the implementation of statistical weightings using machine learning algorithms improves the USAPS discriminatory capacity. A behavioral database, previously collected for USAPS validation, of 48 sheep in the perioperative period of laparoscopy was used. A multilevel binomial logistic regression algorithm and a random forest algorithm were used to determine the statistical weights and classify the sheep as to whether they needed analgesia or not. The quality of the classification, estimated by the area under the curve (AUC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), was compared between the USAPS versions. The USAPS AUCs weighted by multilevel binomial logistic regression (96.59 CI: [95.02-98.15]; p = 0.0004) and random forest algorithms (96.28 CI: [94.17-97.85]; p = 0.0067) were higher than the original USAPS AUC (94.87 CI: [92.94-96.80]). We conclude that the implementation of statistical weights by the two machine learning algorithms improved the USAPS discriminatory ability.

AB  - Genetically engineered crop plants for enhanced emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) offer great potential in reducing the herbivore load on crops by repelling insect herbivores directly or attracting their natural enemies. Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are also essential for pollination, insect reproduction, allelopathy, and serve as antimicrobial agents. Existing research in this field revolves around the routine chemical ecological experiments like identifying VOCs, HIPVs, and synthetic blends. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the role of enhanced volatile emissions and volatile biosynthetic pathways involved in chemical communication can lead to the development of behavior-based novel pest management strategies and lay the foundation for future research in these approaches. Recent discoveries in identifying and isolating the enzymes and genes associated with the biosynthetic pathways of volatiles have opened new avenues for the genetic engineering of crops. Genetically engineered plants could be developed to release volatiles only with an herbivore attack to conserve plant resources by mimicking a natural defensive strategy for direct repellence and/or recruitment of natural enemies. Crops engineered for sustainable volatile production can also serve as companion plants in the push and pull strategies and modify insect behavior to reduce the pest damage. A crop bioengineered for enhanced repellence of oviposition and increased release of insect pheromone-resembling compounds could benefit pest management programs. Further advanced research under field conditions is required to assess the physiological and ecological consequences, especially to the crop and the environment.

AB  - From dissuading predators to gaining an edge on intraspecific rivals, animals have evolved weapons to meet various needs. Those with the most extreme weapons often use them to battle conspecifics, but some weapons defend against predation and others signal prowess to prospective mates and rivals. Many fishes have evolved armaments, but humans rarely observe these structures in action due to the inaccessibility of many weapon-bearing fish species. For example, how sculpins use the diverse horn-like spines that project from their head remains a mystery. We deduced the function of the weaponized preopercle in the 16 species of sculpins in the subfamily Oligocottinae by determining whether they exhibit three well-documented hallmarks of offensive weapons in terrestrial animals: ontogenetic change, sexual dimorphism, and fluctuating asymmetry. Geometric morphometrics of micro-computed tomography (mu CT) scans show no sexual dimorphism in preopercular spine shape but reveal phylogenetically widespread ontogenetic shape change. Fluctuating asymmetry is low to moderate across species. Taken together, these results suggest that despite their varied reproductive habits, frequent territoriality, and possession of weapons that resemble bovid horns, oligocottine sculpins evolved their spines primarily to defend against predators.

AB  - This study examines the multifaceted role of the two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus) in the livelihoods of Mongolian pastoralists, focusing on its adaptability to extreme climates, economic contributions, and cultural significance. Camels are essential for the production of meat, milk, and wool, which account for 54% of total cash income in certain regions. They also provide essential draft power for transportation, tourism, and sports. The study reveals variations in camel distribution across Mongolia's natural zones and highlights their resilience in supporting herders under diverse ecological conditions. The reproductive and lactation cycles of camels, adapted to Mongolia's distinct climate, further highlight their suitability for pastoral systems. This research emphasizes the importance of promoting sustainable camel farming practices through supportive policies and investments to improve pastoral livelihoods and to ensure the preservation of Mongolia's camel-rearing heritage.

AB  - Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are pluripotent stem cells located in the bulges of hair follicles. Apoptosis regulates tissue homeostasis by eliminating unnecessary or damaged cells during development and aging. VDAC2, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOM), is a key apoptosis regulator, but its role in cashmere goat hair follicles remains unclear. In previous studies, through proteomic sequencing, we found that VDAC2 was significantly differentially expressed in the anagen, catagen, and telogen phases of the hair follicles of Albas cashmere goats. This study aimed to explore the role of VDAC2 in secondary hair follicle stem cells (SHFSCs) and preliminarily investigate its regulatory mechanism through RNA-seq. Overexpression of VDAC2 promoted apoptosis in SHFSCs, while knockdown had the opposite effect. RNA-seq analysis, together with expression validation of downstream genes, indicates that the P53 signaling pathway may be involved in VDAC2-mediated SHFSC regulation. RT-qPCR and Western blotting confirmed that VDAC2 activated the P53 signaling pathway in SHFSCs. Furthermore, the use of a P53 inhibitor after VDAC2 overexpression partially rescued the apoptosis of cells caused by VDAC2. These results demonstrate that VDAC2 plays an important role in SHFSC apoptosis. Our findings greatly enhance our understanding of the role of VDAC2 in SHFSC apoptosis and hair follicle growth.

AB  - Simple Summary The effects of long-term protein restriction on meat quality of Shaziling pigs and the underlying mechanism remain relatively unexplored. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in meat quality and muscle metabolites of Shaziling pigs under the condition of low-protein diets and to provide a practical nutritional manipulation for swine production. After a 24-week trial, we found that reducing dietary crude protein by 20% led to improved meat quality (the reduced L* value and the increased a* value) and altered metabolite profiles of longissimus thoracis, without impairing growth performance and carcass traits. Moreover, results showed that the improvement on meat quality might be credited to diminished concentrations of Danazol, N,N-dimethyl-Safingol, and cer(d18:0/14:0). Our findings suggested long-term protein restriction (20% reduction) is suitable to improve meat quality and sustain growth performance. Background: It has been demonstrated that low-protein diets can improve the meat quality of pork. This study aimed to investigate the effects of long-term protein restriction from piglets to finishing pigs for 24 weeks on meat quality and muscle metabolites of Shaziling pigs. Results: Compared to the control group, reducing dietary protein levels by 20% reduced the L* value (p < 0.05), increased the a* value (p < 0.01), and tended to decrease pressing loss (p = 0.06) of longissimus thoracis muscle (LTM). Furthermore, compared to the control group, the -20% group had significantly lower levels of muscular danazol, N,N-dimethyl-Safingol, and cer(d18:0/14:0) (p < 0.05), all of which were positively associated with the L* value and negatively associated with the a* value (p < 0.05). Therefore, danazol, N,N-dimethyl-Safingol, and cer(d18:0/14:0) might be potential biomarkers for meat color. Conclusions: These results indicated that reducing dietary crude protein by 20% for 24 weeks could improve meat quality and alter muscular metabolites of Shaziling pigs, and the improvement in meat quality might be ascribable to decreased danazol, N,N-dimethyl-Safingol and cer(d18:0/14:0).

AB  - About 280 million people suffer from depression as the most common neurological disorder and the most common cause of death worldwide. Exercise with serotonin released in the brain by the 5-HT3-IGF-1 mechanism can lead to antidepressant effects. Swimming exercise has antidepressant effects by increasing the sensitivity of serotonin 5-HT2 receptors and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, increasing 5-HT and 5HIAA levels, increasing TPH and serotonin, and decreasing inflammatory levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Anaerobic and aerobic exercises increase beta-endorphin, enkephalin, and dynorphin and have antidepressant effects. Exercise by increasing dopamine, D1R, and D2R leads to the expression of BDNF and activation of TrkB and has antidepressant behavior. Exercise leads to a significant increase in GABAAR (gamma 2 and alpha 2 subunits) and reduces neurodegenerative disorders caused by GABA imbalance through anti-inflammatory pathways. By increasing glutamate and PGC1 alpha and reducing glutamatergic neurotoxicity, exercise enhances neurogenesis and synaptogenesis and prevents neurodegeneration and the onset of depression. Irisin release during exercise shows an important role in depression by increasing dopamine, BDNF, NGF, and IGF-1 and decreasing inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-1 beta. In addition, exercise-induced orexin and NPY can increase hippocampal neurogenesis and relieve depression. After exercise, the tryptophan to large neutral amino acids (TRP/LNAA) ratio and the tryptophan to branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) ratio increase, which may have antidepressant effects. The expression of M5 receptor and nAChR alpha 7 increases after exercise and significantly increases dopamine and acetylcholine and ameliorates depression. It appears that during exercise, muscarinic receptors can reduce depression through dopamine in the absence of acetylcholine. Therefore, exercise can be used to reduce depression by affecting neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, cytokines, and/or neurotrophins.

AB  - Self-incompatibility (SI) poses a significant reproductive barrier, severely impacting the yield, quality, and economic value of Camellia oleifera. In this study, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was employed as an exogenous stimulus to alleviate SI in C. oleifera. The research findings revealed that an exogenous dose of 1000 mu mol<middle dot>L-1 MeJA enhanced the germination and tube growth of C. oleifera self-pollen and greatly improved ovule penetration (18.75%) and fertilization (15.81%), ultimately increasing fruit setting (18.67%). It was discovered by transcriptome analysis that the key genes (CAD, C4H) involved in the lignin production process exhibited elevated expression levels in self-pistils treated with MeJA. Further analysis showed that the lignin concentration in the MeJA-treated pistils was 31.70% higher compared with the control group. As verified by pollen germination assays in vitro, lignin in the appropriate concentration range could promote pollen tube growth. Gene expression network analysis indicated that transcription factor bHLH may be pivotal in regulating lignin biosynthesis in response to MeJA, which in turn affects pollen tubes. Further transient knockdown of bHLH (Co_33962) confirmed its important role in C. oleifera pollen tube growth. In summary, the application of MeJA resulted in the stimulation of self-pollen tube elongation and enhanced fruit setting in C. oleifera, which could be associated with the differential change in genes related to lignin synthesis and the increased lignin content.

AB  - Background: The intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in maintaining host health, especially during childhood, a critical period for its establishment. Early life stress can lead to shifts in gut microbiota composition, thus increasing the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adulthood. The supplementation with probiotics restores intestinal permeability and the health of gut microbial communities, therefore being potential study targets for the treatment of MDD. In this sense, the yeast Komagataella pastoris was reported as a promising probiotic with antidepressant effect.
   Methods: Hence, the present study aims to investigate this effect in mice submitted to maternal separation (MS) 3 h per day from PND2 to PND14. Adult mice and mothers were treated with K. pastoris KM71H (8 log UFC.g(-1)/per animal, i.g.) or PBS (500 mu l, i.g.) for 14 days. After behavioral tests, the animals were euthanized, followed by hippocampi and intestines removal for biochemical analysis.
   Results: On behavioral tests, K. pastoris KM71H treatment reduced the immobility time in TST of adult mice and increased the grooming activity in splash test of adult mice and mothers induced by MS. The probiotic treatment restored plasma corticosterone levels and glucocorticoid receptor expression in hippocampi, alongside nitrate/ nitrite levels and superoxide dismutase activity in intestine, in addition to reducing reactive species levels in both structures. Moreover, it also normalized the fecal pH and water content of feces.
   Conclusion: Thus, we conclude that K. pastoris KM71H is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MDD.

AB  - The increasing demand for automation in livestock farming scenarios highlights the need for effective noncontact measurement methods. The current methods typically require either fixed postures and specific positions of the target animals or high computational demands, making them difficult to implement in practical situations. In this study, a novel dual-network framework is presented that extracts accurate contour information instead of segmented images from unconstrained pigs and then directly employs this information to obtain precise liveweight estimates. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed framework achieves high accuracy, providing liveweight estimates with an R2 value of 0.993. When contour information is used directly to estimate the liveweight, the real-time performance of the framework can reach 1131.6 FPS. This achievement sets a new benchmark for accuracy and efficiency in non-contact liveweight estimation. Moreover, the framework holds significant practical value, equipping farmers with a robust and scalable tool for precision livestock management in dynamic, real-world farming environments. Additionally, the Liveweight and Instance Segmentation Annotation of Pigs dataset is introduced as a comprehensive resource designed to support further advancements and validation in this field.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of subclinical pregnancy toxaemia (SPT) on fetal skeletal muscle development and assessed the potential protective role of L-carnitine supplementation during gestation. A total of 18 crossbred Hamdani ewes underwent oestrous synchronisation, natural mating and pregnancy confirmation via ultrasonography on day 45 post-mating. The ewes were managed according to NRC (2007) dietary guidelines until day 100 of gestation, after which they were assigned to three experimental groups: subclinical PT group (group 1; G1, n = 6), treatment group (subclinical PT + L-carnitine, group 2; G2, n = 6) and control group (group 3; G3, n = 6). Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta HBA) concentrations were measured on day 100 and 138 of the gestation. Then, all ewes were slaughtered for fetal muscle sampling from the Musculus Longissimus Dorsi (MLD) and Vastus Lateralis (VL). Results indicated a significant reduction in muscle fibre number and fibre diameter in both MLD and VL in the SPT group (G1) compared to the control (G3) (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between G1 and G2 or between G2 and G3 for these parameters (p > 0.05). On the other hand, large effect sizes for group and pairwise comparisons imply that SPT may negatively affect prenatal muscle development and L-carnitine supports muscle development during the prepartum period. These findings highlight the negative effects of SPT and protective effects of L-carnitine supplementation on fetal skeletal muscle development in ewes with SPT. The observed deficits may negatively impact postnatal growth, survival rates and meat quality. Further investigations are warranted to optimise maternal nutrition strategies and evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of SPT on fetal muscle development in ruminants. Furthermore, L-carnitine supplementation may be a useful in compensating for the negative effects of SPT.

AB  - The ovary is a crucial reproductive organ in mammals, and its development directly influences an individual's sexual maturity and reproductive capacity. To comprehensively describe ovarian sexual maturation in goats, we integrated phenotypic, hormonal, metabolomic, and transcriptomic data from four specific time points: after birth (D1), at 2 months old (M2), at 4 months old (M4), and at 6 month old (M6). The study showed that during the early stage (D1-M2), ovarian growth was the most rapid, with weight and morphology increasing by 284% and 65%, respectively, and hormone levels rose significantly, with estradiol increasing by 57%. Metabolomic analysis identified 1231 metabolites, primarily lipids, lipid molecules, and organic acids, which can support hormone balance and follicle development by providing energy and participating in signaling transduction. Transcriptomic analysis identified 543 stage-specific differentially expressed genes, mainly enriched in steroid biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, and the PI3K/AKT pathway, which are key factors influencing ovarian cell proliferation, apoptosis, hormone secretion, and metabolism. The integrated analysis revealed the key processes in the ovarian steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway and gene/metabolite networks associated with ovarian phenotypes and hormone levels, ultimately highlighting scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SCARB1), Cytochrome P450 Family 1 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP11A1), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3BHSD), progesterone, estradiol, and L-phenylalanine as key regulators of ovarian morphological and functional changes at different developmental stages. This study is the first to reveal the metabolic changes and molecular regulatory mechanisms during ovarian sexual maturation in goats, providing valuable insights for understanding reproductive system development and optimizing reproductive performance and breeding efficiency.

AB  - Relating genetic variants to behavior remains a fundamental challenge. To assess the utility of DNA methyl-ation marks in discovering causative variants, we examined their relationship to genetic variation by gener-ating single-nucleus methylomes from the hippocampus of eight inbred mouse strains. At CpG sequence densities under 40 CpG/Kb, cells compensate for loss of methylated sites by methylating additional sites to maintain methylation levels. At higher CpG sequence densities, the exact location of a methylated site becomes more important, suggesting that variants affecting methylation will have a greater effect when occurring in higher CpG densities than in lower. We found this to be true for a variant's effect on transcript abundance, indicating that candidate variants can be prioritized based on CpG sequence density. Our find-ings imply that DNA methylation influences the likelihood that mutations occur at specific sites in the genome, supporting the view that the distribution of mutations is not random.

AB  - Although porcine liver contributes to their growth and development by nutrition production and energy supply, oxidative stress-induced hepatocyte damage is inevitable during metabolism. N-glycosylation is a common modification in oxidation; nevertheless, the effects of N-glycosylation on pig liver oxidative reactions remain undefined. In this study, liver proteins with N-glycosylation were detected in Wuzhishan (WZS) pigs between 4 and 8 months old and Large White (LW) pigs at 4 months old based on LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the number of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was larger between different pig cultivars than that between WZS pigs at various growth periods. The enriched pathways of DEPs were mainly related to oxidative reactions, and 10 proteins were finally selected that primarily consisted of CYPs, GSTs and HSPs with expressions significantly correlating to liver size and weight. The oxidative genes shared N-glycosylation-modified models of N-x-S and N-G. Five out of 10 proteins were upregulated in WZS pigs compared to LW pigs at 4 months old, while five proteins increased in WZS pigs from 4 to 8 months old. In conclusion, this research provides valuable information on the N-glycosylation motifs in liver oxidation genes of WZS pigs.

AB  - Objective: It is indisputable that the functional connectivity of the brain network in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) patients is abnormal. As a mathematical extension of the traditional network model, the multilayer network can fully capture the fluctuations of brain imaging data with time, and capture subtle abnormal dynamic changes. This study assumed that the dynamic structure of JME patients is abnormal and used the multilayer network framework to analyze the change brain community structure in JME patients from the perspective of dynamic analysis.Methods: First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were obtained from 35 JME patients and 34 healthy control subjects. In addition, the communities of the two groups were explored with the help of a multilayer network model and a multilayer community detection algorithm. Finally, differences were described by metrics that are specific to the multilayer network.Results: Compared with healthy controls, JME patients had a significantly lower modularity degree of the brain network. Furthermore, from the level of the functional network, the integration of the default mode network (DMN) and visual network (VN) in JME patients showed a significantly higher trend, and the flexibility of the attention network (AN) also increased significantly. At the node level, the integration of seven nodes of the DMN was significantly increased, the integration of five nodes of the VN was significantly increased, and the flexibility of three nodes of the AN was significantly increased. Moreover, through division of the core-peripheral system, we found that the left insula and left cuneus were core regions specific to the JME group, while most of the peripheral systems specific to the JME group were distributed in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Finally, we found that the flexibility of the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus was significantly correlated with the severity of JME symptoms.Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the dynamic community structure of JME patients is indeed abnormal. These results provide a new perspective for the study of dynamic changes in communities in JME patients.

AB  - Two of this century's most significant public health challenges are climate change and healthy aging. The future of humanity will be both warmer and older than it is today. Is it socially responsible, in a warming planet of a population exceeding 8 billion people, for science to aspire to develop gerotherapeutic drugs that aim to reduce the burden of aging-related diseases that may also increase lifespan? This question is the "elephant in the room" for geroscience advocacy. Science communication concerning what constitutes empirically valid and morally defensible ways of navigating the dual public health predicaments of climate change and healthy aging must be sensitive to both the interdependence of the environment (including planetary health) and the mechanisms of aging, as well as the common (mis)perceptions about the potential conflict between the goals of climate science and geroscience. Geroscience advocacy can transcend narratives of intergenerational conflict by highlighting the shared aspirations of climate science and geroscience, such as the goals of promoting health across the lifespan, redressing health disparities, and improving the economic prospects of current and future generations.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LED) offer energy-efficient and customizable light sources that can be tailored to optimize plant chemistry and growth characteristics. Indoor cannabis production is the most energy-intensive crop in the United States and suffers from insect pest infestations including the cannabis aphid, Phorodon cannabis Passerini, which can negatively impact yield. Here we investigated the potential of light quality (color) to manage Cannabis sativa plant chemistry and cannabis aphids to increase crop quality. Cannabis was grown indoors under LED lighting systems where we manipulated the color spectrum. Within each light treatment, a subset of plants was exposed to aphid herbivory. Physical and chemical plant responses and aphid biology were measured. The interaction between light quality and herbivory drove the time to the first flower (cola) in our experimental plants. Light quality did not impact THC/CBD, but plants under increased blue light had higher bud yield than those grown under white light. The red-blue light treatment resulted in the tallest plants with the lowest leaf-stem dry mass and bud yield. Herbivory decreased bud yield and lowered the concentration of CBD/THC in buds. Lastly, light quality impacted the reproduction and mortality of the cannabis aphid. This study demonstrates the capacity of light quality to impact plant growth traits but offers no evidence for light quality impacting CBD/THC production in Cannabis. More importantly, herbivory resulting from aphid feeding was shown to decrease CBD and THC. Light quality impacted pest biology, supporting the potential use of light quality as a pest management tool.

AB  - Simple Summary: Thailand is in the tropics, with high temperatures, humidity, and long daylight hours. Seasons affecting estrous cycles have been discovered in the semi-captive Asian elephant in Thailand. In addition, seasonality in reproduction has been reported in sows and cows in the tropic environment. Despite the fact that measurements of the body condition score (BCS) have served as a disease diagnostic tool in terms of screening undernourishment and obesity in veterinarian practice and have been developed and applied in captive elephants, obesity is a growing concern today. The consequences of being overweight are typically not recognized until welfare-related reproductive dysfunctions, such as higher neonate weight, stillbirth, and acyclicity, are present. In captive-managed elephants, ovarian dysfunction and estrous cycling abnormalities are common, which are linked to a variety of issues such as obesity, reproductive tract pathologies, and metabolic derangements. These problems are most likely to contribute to poor reproductive health and then lead to undesirable reproduction. Thus, it is critical and urgent to identify the factors affecting reproductive health and ovarian patterns and thus facilitate fertility. The data for this study were collected from eight captive female elephants. During the rainy, hot, and cool seasons, their BCS was measured. Characteristics of the estrous cycle were studied, including the length of the estrous cycle and the lengths and starts of the luteal phase and follicular phase. The findings revealed that a higher BCS and the start of the follicular phase were highly frequent during the rainy season, which resulted in a longer luteal phase and estrous cycle and higher peak progesterone levels in the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).
   The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of season on the body condition score (BCS), the characteristics of the estrous cycle (luteal phase [LPL], follicular phase [FPL], estrous cycle [ECL] lengths, and the start of the luteal phase [SLP] and follicular phase [SFP]), and progesterone levels (baseline and peak) of eight captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand. From 2014 to 2019, blood samples were collected weekly for serum progesterone enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Estrous cycles (n = 70), including the luteal and follicular phases, and BCS (n = 70) were recorded. Based on the BCS, the LPL, FPL, and ECL were assigned to the following two groups: normal (BCS = 3.0-4.0, n = 38) and overweight (BCS = 4.5-5.0, n = 32). The findings demonstrated that there was no difference in LPL between the groups. However, in the normal group, the ECL was one week longer (14.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 13.9 +/- 1.7 weeks; p < 0.05), and the FPL also tended to be one week longer (7.2 +/- 1.7 vs. 6.4 +/- 1.5 weeks; p = 0.06) than in the overweight group. The mean progesterone level during the rainy, hot, and cool seasons was not statistically different. Based on the yearly averaged BCS from three seasons, the baseline and peak levels of progesterone were classified into the normal (n = 16) and overweight (n = 12) groups. Females with a normal BCS tended to exhibit higher progesterone peak levels (p = 0.08). The majority of peaks appeared during the rainy season (53.57%). The BCS was highest during the hot (4.47) and rainy (4.38) seasons, but not during the cool (4.12) season. The LPL, FPL, and ECL were not affected by the season in which the luteal phase occurred. On the other hand, the rainy season had a significant effect on the SFP, resulting in a longer LPL (p < 0.05) and ECL (p = 0.01); both were the longest during the rainy season. In conclusion, the effects of season on BCS may be related to characteristics of the estrous cycle and peak progesterone levels. Ultimately, these findings provide ground knowledge to assist elephant managers and owners in planning breeding activities using seasonal effects and BCS measurements in tropical climates.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) has been significantly raised owing to the development of broadband access network, machine learning (ML), big data analytics (BDA), cloud computing (CC), and so on. The development of IoT technologies has resulted in a massive quantity of data due to the existence of several people linking through distinct physical components, indicating the status of the CC environment. In the IoT, load scheduling is realistic technique in distinct data center to guarantee the network suitability by falling the computer hardware and software catastrophe and with right utilize of resource. The ideal load balancer improves many factors of Quality of Service (QoS) like resource performance, scalability, response time, error tolerance, and efficiency. The scholar is assumed as load scheduling a vital problem in IoT environment. There are many techniques accessible to load scheduling in IoT environments. With this motivation, this paper presents an improved deer hunting optimization algorithm with Type II fuzzy logic (IDHOA-T2F) model for load scheduling in IoT environment. The goal of the IDHOA-T2F is to diminish the energy utilization of integrated circuit of IoT node and enhance the load scheduling in IoT environments. The IDHOA technique is derived by integrating the concepts of Nelder Mead (NM) with the DHOA. The proposed model also synthesized the T2L based on fuzzy logic (FL) systems to counterbalance the load distribution. The proposed model finds useful to improve the efficiency of IoT system. For validating the enhanced load scheduling performance of the IDHOA-T2F technique, a series of simulations take place to highlight the improved performance. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the capable outcome of the IDHOA-T2F technique over the recent techniques.

AB  - Pigmentation and colouration are important to animal fitness. Colourations convey important information and impact predation risk, thermoregulation and mate selection. There are many cases of hypopigmentation across the animal kingdom, and leucism is a common form. We observed a Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) pup with cream-coloured fur, light skin and white nails multiple times in 2022 in Erebus Bay, Antarctica. The pup was observed 1 year later as a generally healthy yearling. This is the first documentation of a leucistic seal within this well-studied population and the second documentation of such colouration in this species. This seal offers a potential opportunity to observe the effects of hypopigmentation in Antarctic true seals.

AB  - Discoloration is a critical limitation in the storage of fish meat. In this study, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of phytochemicals extracted from mango leaf, guava leaf, and green tea residue and a mixture of these phytochemicals (1:1:1, w/w/w) were initially evaluated in vitro. Compared with the individual byproducts, the mixture exhibited higher antioxidant and antimicrobial activities and was selected for use as a feed or processing additive. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the phytochemicals mixture for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity was calculated as 10.46 mu g/mL. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of the mixture against Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, Escherichia coli, Lactococcus garvieae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus iniae ranged from 0.20 to 12.50 mg/mL. Nile tilapia were fed with diets containing different concentrations of the phytochemicals mixture, namely 0.0% (control), 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%, for a duration of 8 weeks before filleting. The results indicated that the growth performance of the fish was not affected by the phytochemicals mixture. In the immersion treatment, half of the fillets from the control group were immersed in a solution containing a 1 mg/mL phytochemicals mixture and air-dried. During the storage period, chromatic analysis revealed a stable increase in the CIE b* value, with both dietary and immersion treatments significantly inhibiting discoloration (p < 0.05). Overall, both the peroxide value and total plate count results indicated that the anti-discoloration effect of the phytochemicals mixture was primarily ascribed to its antioxidant properties.

AB  - Simple Summary With the ban on using antibiotics as animal growth promoters in many countries, developing alternative growth promoters is of urgent need. In this study, we investigated the growth-promoting efficacy of a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula Zhenqi granules (ZQ) in pigs. We show that ZQ has a significant growth-promoting effect in pigs, especially during the finishing stage. To further explore the possible mechanisms of growth promotion, transcriptomics analysis with liver and skeletal muscle tissues are performed that reveals that genes involved in collagen biosynthesis and lipid biosynthetic processes are differentially expressed in the pigs administrated with ZQ. We report for the first time that a TCM formula ZQ has significant growth promotion efficacy in pigs and reveals that it may promote animal growth by regulating skeletal myogenesis and fat deposition. Developing nonantibiotic livestock growth promoters attracts intensive interest in the post-antibiotic era. In this study, we investigated the growth-promoting efficacy of Zhenqi granules (ZQ) in pigs and further explored the possible mechanisms by transcriptomics analysis. Weaned piglets (52 days old with an average body weight of 17.92 kg) were fed with diets supplemented with different doses of ZQ (0 g/kg, 1 g/kg, and 2 g/kg) for 30 days and continued observations for an additional 32 days after removing ZQ from the diets. Compared with the control group, the average daily gain, carcass weight, average back fat thickness, and fat meat percentage of the group supplemented with 1 g/kg of ZQ showed a significant increase, and the feed/gain ratio was lower. The group supplemented with 2 g/kg of ZQ also showed a significant increase in average daily gain and average backfat thickness. A transcriptomics analysis revealed that the supplementation of ZQ at 1 g/kg upregulated the expression of genes related to collagen biosynthesis and lipid biosynthesis in skeletal muscle and liver. This effect was primarily through upregulating the mRNA levels of structural proteins and lipid-related enzymes. This study demonstrates the growth-promoting efficacy of ZQ and provides some insights of the mechanism of growth promotion.

   A total of 84% of the autochthonous livestock breeds in Spain are in danger of extinction. This decline is mainly produced because they are not very productive and the farmers have been oriented to the most productive breeds, neglecting the rest. There are many factors that push us to conserve autochthonous breeds with little census. These animals are very adapted to their environment, so they are the ones that best exploit the geographical characteristics of their area; besides, their products have a high quality and these breeds have very beneficial genetic components: they are a source of very useful and not sufficiently known gene variants that make them a genetic heritage of undoubted value. If they become extinct, we would be losing an irreplaceable genetic quality. Rubia de El Molar sheep, an autochthonous breed of Madrid, Spain, is currently in serious danger of disappearing. In this work, the meat quality of lambs from Rubia de El Molar breed was studied to test both weight and sex effects on meat quality, assessed by means of instrumental methods. This is the first work that studies the instrumental quality of Rubia de El Molar suckling lamb meat.
   The effects of sex and weight on instrumental meat quality characteristics of Rubia de El Molar autochthonous ovine breed were studied. Four weight groups (10, 15, 20 and 25 kg, each of the groups with seven males and seven females) were assessed. A decrease of longissimus thoracis muscle (LT) lightness from 43.39 for 10 kg lambs to 38.84 for 25 kg group was observed. LT redness and yellowness indices and chromaticity values increased as weight increased. The percentage of juice expelled increased from 11.52 (10 kg) to 17.15 (15 kg). The percentage of intramuscular fat in biceps femoris (BF) and supraespinatus (SE) muscles increased as weight increased. Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) in raw meat and hardness in cooked meat increased as liveweight increased. However, a decrease in the amount of soluble collagen in quadriceps femoris (QF), biceps femoris (BF) and infraespinatus (IE) muscles was observed as weight increased. Sex effect was only observed for intramuscular fat content in QF and BF muscles (2.4% in males and 2.9 in females) and WBSF in raw meat (26.12 N for males and 21.25 N for females). Weight had a greater effect than sex on Rubia de El Molar meat quality characteristics.

AB  - The predation process plays a significant role in advancing life evolution and the maintenance of ecological balance and biodiversity. Hunting cooperation in predators is one of the most remarkable features of the predation process, which benefits the predators by developing fear upon their prey. This study investigates the dynamical behavior of a modified LV-type predator-prey system with Michaelis-Menten-type harvesting of predators where predators adopt cooperation strategy during hunting. The ecologically feasible steady states of the system and their asymptotic stabilities are explored. The local codimension one bifurcations, viz. transcritical, saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, that emerge in the system are investigated. Sotomayors approach is utilized to show the appearance of transcritical bifurcation and saddle-node bifurcation. A backward Hopf-bifurcation is detected when the harvesting effort is increased, which destabilizes the system by generating periodic solutions. The stability nature of the Hopf-bifurcating periodic orbits is determined by computing the first Lyapunov coefficient. Our analyses revealed that above a threshold value of the harvesting effort promotes the coexistence of both populations. Similar periodic solutions of the system are also observed when the conversion efficiency rate or the hunting cooperation rate is increased. We have also explored codimension two bifurcations viz. the generalized Hopf and the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation exhibit by the system. To visualize the dynamical behavior of the system, numerical simulations are conducted using an ecologically plausible parameter set. The existence of the bionomic equilibrium of the model is analyzed. Moreover, an optimal harvesting policy for the proposed model is derived by considering harvesting effort as a control parameter with the help of Pontryagins maximum principle.

AB  - Simple Summary The identification of new and beneficial alternatives to antibiotics is of great value in ruminant farming. The combined addition of inulin and Chinese gallotannin to the diet could reduce the content of saturated fatty acids in mutton while increasing the content of unsaturated fatty acids. Besides, these supplements could also enhance the energy and lipid metabolism of Hu sheep, ultimately improving mutton quality and production performance. Thus, sheep producers are encouraged to consider using these dietary supplements to support better mutton production. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of inulin and Chinese gallotannin on the meat fatty acids and urinary metabolites in sheep. Twenty-four healthy (25.80 +/- 3.85 kg) weaned Hu lambs of approximately 4.5 months old were equally divided into four groups: control group (basal diet), treatment group I (basal diet + 0.1% inulin), treatment group II (basal diet + 0.1% inulin + 2% Chinese gallotannin), and treatment group III (basal diet + 0.1% inulin + 2% Chinese gallotannin + 4% PEG). The contents of myristic acid (C14:0) and palmitic acid (C16:0) were found to be lower in treatment group II than in the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the palmitoleic acid (C16:1) content in treatment group II was notably higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05), while the elaidic acid (C18:1n9t) content in treatment group II was higher than that in other groups (p < 0.05). Besides, the linoleic acid (C18:2n6c) content was higher in the treatment II and control groups than in the treatment I and III groups. Furthermore, compared with the control group, both 4-pyridoxic acid and creatinine in treatment groups I and II were upregulated (p < 0.05), while other metabolites, such as nicotinuric acid, l-threonine, palmitic acid, and oleic acid, were drastically downregulated (p < 0.05). These differential metabolites were found to be mainly involved in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism (ko00760), vitamin B6 metabolism (ko00750), and the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (ko00061). It is concluded that the combination of inulin and Chinese gallotannin in the diet could improve the energy and lipid metabolism of sheep, which may improve both mutton quality and production performance.

AB  - Simple Summary Interferon-alpha-16 (IFNA16) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 19 (TNFRSF19) are cytokines that may play a role in adipogenesis, lipid accumulation and fatty acid metabolism in the muscle tissue of mammals. However, no association study of the porcine IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 genes with the fatty acid composition of intramuscular fat has been reported in pigs. Therefore, the current study was performed to verify single nucleotide polymorphisms of the porcine IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 genes and to analyze how they affect intramuscular fat content and fatty acid composition in commercial crossbred pigs. The porcine IFNA16 c.413G > A polymorphism was associated with stearic acid, total saturated fatty acids and the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids. Moreover, the TNFRSF19 c.860G > C polymorphism was associated with intramuscular fat content and arachidic acid levels. The results revealed that the porcine IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 polymorphisms are related to lipid deposition and/or fatty acid composition in the muscle tissue of pigs. These findings suggest that the porcine IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 gene variants may contribute to lipid accumulation and fatty acid deposition in the muscle tissue of pigs. Interferon-alpha-16 (IFNA16) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 19 (TNFRSF19) are cytokines that may play a role in adipogenesis and fatness. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the porcine IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 genes were verified and their association with intramuscular fat (IMF) content and fatty acid (FA) composition were evaluated in commercial crossbred pigs. Two non-synonymous SNPs of the porcine IFNA16 c.413G > A and TNFRSF19 c.860G > C loci were detected in commercial crossbred pigs. The porcine IFNA16 c.413G >A polymorphism was significantly associated with stearic acid, total saturated FAs (SFAs), and the ratio of monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) to SFAs (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the porcine TNFRSF19 c.860G > C polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with IMF content and arachidic acid levels (p < 0.05). The results revealed that porcine IFNA16 and TNFRSF19 polymorphisms are related to IMF content and/or FA composition and affirmed the importance of these cytokine genes as potential candidate genes for lipid deposition and FA composition in the muscle tissue of pigs.

AB  - Background The oil-tea tree (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is a woody tree species that produces edible oil in the seed. C. oleifera oil has high nutritional value and is also an important raw material for medicine and cosmetics. In China, due to the uncertainty on maturity period and oil synthesis mechanism of many C. oleifera cultivars, growers may harvest fruits prematurely, which could not maximize fruit and oil yields. In this study, our objective was to explore the mechanism and differences of oil synthesis between two Camellia oleifera cultivars for a precise definition of the fruit ripening period and the selection of appropriate cultivars. Results The results showed that 'Huashuo' had smaller fruits and seeds, lower dry seed weight and lower expression levels of fatty acid biosynthesis genes in July. We could not detect the presence of oil and oil bodies in 'Huashuo' seeds until August, and oil and oil bodies were detected in 'Huajin' seeds in July. Moreover, 'Huashuo' seeds were not completely blackened in October with up to 60.38% of water and approximately 37.98% of oil in seed kernels whose oil content was much lower than normal mature seed kernels. The oil bodies in seed endosperm cells of 'Huajin' were always higher than those of 'Huashuo' from July to October. Conclusion Our results confirmed that C. oleifera 'Huashuo' fruits matured at a lower rate compared to 'Huajin' fruits and that 'Huajin' seeds entered the oil synthesis period earlier than 'Huashuo' seeds. Moreover, 'Huashuo' fruits did not mature during the Frost's Descent period (October 23-24 each year).

AB  - Good aerobic fitness associates positively with cognitive performance and brain health and conversely, low aerobic fitness predisposes to neurodegenerative diseases. To study how genotype together with exercise, started at older age, affects brain and behavior, we utilized rats that differ in inherited aerobic fitness. Rats bred for Low Capacity for Running (LCR) are shown to display less synaptic plasticity and more inflammation in the hippocampus and perform worse than rats bred for a High Capacity for Running (HCR) in tasks requiring flexible cognition. Here we used middle-aged (similar to 16 months) HCR and LCR rats to study how genotype and sex associate with anxiety and neural information filtering, termed sensory gating. Further, we assessed how inherited aerobic capacity associates with hippocampus-dependent learning, measured with contextual fear conditioning task. In females, we also investigated the effects of voluntary wheel running (5 weeks) on these characteristics. Our results indicate that independent of sex or voluntary running, HCR rats were more anxious in open-field tasks, exhibited lower sensory gating and learned more efficiently in contextual fear conditioning task than LCR rats. Voluntary running did not markedly affect innate behavior but slightly decreased the differences between female LCR and HCR rats in fear learning. In conclusion, inherited fitness seems to determine cognitive and behavioral traits independent of sex. Although the traits proved to be rather resistant to change at adult age, learning was slightly improved following exercise in LCR females, prone to obesity and poor fitness.

AB  - Facility agriculture in China is facing the challenge of the excessive use of chemical fertilizers (nitrogen fertilizers), which hinder the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture. Optimizing nitrogen fertilizer allocation is essential to balance agricultural production and environmental concerns. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal organic fertilizer strategy for tomato cultivation under different irrigation methods. An experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, and two irrigation methods, surface irrigation (SI) and drip irrigation (SDI), were used during tomato growth. The fertilization treatments included urea alone (CK); 30%, 40%, and 50% chicken manure mixed with urea (FC1, FC2, FC3); and 50% cow manure and sheep manure mixed with urea (FB3, FS3). The results showed that the irrigation techniques and fertilization had significant effects on ammonia volatilization accumulation, soil mineral nitrogen content, and tomato yield and quality. Compared with the surface irrigation technique with the same amount of fertilizer application, the drip irrigation technique reduced the ammonia volatilization accumulation by a maximum of 76.40%. The SDIFC3 and SDIFB3 ammonia volatilization accumulation was as low as 5.24 (kg center dot hm-2) and 7.61 (kg center dot hm-2); the soil nitrate nitrogen content was reduced, and the tomato yield increased significantly by 17.11%. The SDIFC3 treatment achieved a maximum yield of 13,414 (kg center dot hm-2), increased the tomato vitamin C and soluble sugar contents by 19.13% and 8.97%, and lowered the titratable acid content by as much as 30.51%. Under drip irrigation fertilization conditions, the SDIFC3 treatment showed lower ammonia volatilization accumulation and the highest tomato yield and quality compared to CK and the same proportion of organic fertilizer substitutes with cow and sheep manure. The increase in the proportion of organic fertilizers replacing chemical fertilizers resulted in a gradual decrease in ammonia volatilization accumulation and a gradual increase in the tomato yield and various qualities. The soil mineral N content, on the other hand, was significantly affected by irrigation, fertilizer application, and water-fertilizer interaction effects, with a tendency for the content to increase and then decrease after each fertilizer application. The mineral N content was lower with drip irrigation compared to surface irrigation, especially in the 10-20 cm soil layer than in the 0-10 cm layer. Increasing drip irrigation and organic fertilizer substitution significantly increased the vitamin C and soluble sugar contents in the tomatoes, while decreasing the titratable acid content.

AB  - Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a small bioactive phospholipid which plays an important role during embryonic development and promotes developmental potential of in-vitro-produced (IVP) embryos in several species, including sheep and pigs. In bovines, LPA accelerates IVP blastocyst formation through the Hippo/YAP pathway. However, other LPA effects and its potential receptors during bovine embryo development are less clear. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess the presence of LPA in bovine oviductal fluid and determine cell apoptosis in embryos after LPA stimulation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We further evaluated potential receptors of LPA through molecular docking, RNA-seq data analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. LPA was found to be present in oviductal fluid. An increase in total cell number and a decrease in apoptosis levels were detected in day 7 blastocysts after LPA treatment. Among eight LPA receptors (LPARs), GPR87 and LPAR2 showed the highest affinity with LPA and their transcripts were expressed in embryos after the 16-cell stage in RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis. However, only the expression of LPAR2 was significantly increased in day 6 blastocysts after LPA stimulation, indicating its potential role in LPA-mediated signaling pathways. Our data highlight the positive effects of LPA on embryos and enrich information of related signaling mediators of LPA during embryonic development.

AB  - Ethanol and other drugs of abuse disrupt learning and memory processes, creating problems associated with drug use and addiction. Understanding individual factors that determine susceptibility to drug-induced cognitive deficits, such as genetic background, age, and sex, is important for prevention and treatment. Comparison of adolescent and adult mice of both sexes across inbred mouse strains can reveal age, sex, and genetic contributions to phenotypes. We treated adolescent and adult, male and female, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred mice with ethanol (1 g/kg or 1.5 g/kg) or MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg), an NMDA receptor antagonist, prior to fear conditioning training. Contextual and cued fear retention were tested one day and eight or nine days after training. After ethanol exposure, adult C57BL/6J mice experienced greater deficits in contextual learning than adult DBA/2J mice. C57BL/6 J adolescents were less susceptible to ethanol-induced contextual learning disruptions than C57BL/6J adults, and adolescent males of both strains exhibited greater ethanol-induced contextual learning deficits than adolescent females. After MK-801 exposure, adolescent C57BL/6J mice experienced more severe contextual learning deficits than adolescent DBA/2J mice. Both ethanol and MK-801 had greater effects on contextual learning than cued learning. Collectively, we demonstrate that genetic background contributes to contextual and cued learning outcomes after ethanol or MK-801 exposure. Further, we report agedependent drug sensitivities that are strain-, sex-, and drug-specific, suggesting that age, sex, and genetic background interact to determine contextual and cued learning impairments after ethanol or MK-801 exposure.

AB  - To reduce the maintenance requirements during the service life of highway bridges and enhance the cracking resistance of concrete slabs in the hogging moment zone of continuous composite girders, this paper proposes an innovative girder-to-pier joint for composite bridges with integral piers. Compared to the existing ones, this new joint has structural differences. The middle part of the embedded web is hollowed out to facilitate the construction, and the upper and bottom flanges of the steel girder within this joint are widened. Moreover, cast-in-place ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is applied instead of normal concrete (NC) only on the top surface of the pier. A full-scale test was carried out for this new joint to evaluate the load-displacement relationship, load-strain relationship, crack initiation, and crack propagation. Compared with the numerical simulation results of the reference engineering, the test results demonstrated that the proposed joint exhibited excellent flexural performance and cracking resistance. This paper also proposes a calculation method for the elastic flexural capacity of the girder-to-pier joint incorporating the tensile strength of UHPC, and the calculated result was in good agreement with the experimental result.

AB  - Simple Summary Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) are raised in the wild by shepherds on the Tibetan Plateau and domesticated for a long period. Studying variations in the behavioral and physiological traits of sheep during the growing season is important for welfare and productivity. In this study, the behavior and physiology of a Tibetan sheep cohort were repeatedly evaluated in 2-, 5-, and 11-month-old sheep. The mean level of the risk-taking variable increased, while that of the vocalizations variable decreased. The exploration variable was stable over ontogeny. The novelty decreased, and the heart rate increased from 2 to 5 months, but both stabilized at 11 months. The fecal cortisol concentration (CORT) variable was stable at 2 and 5 months but decreased at 11 months of age. Stable correlations were reported for 2- and 5-month-olds and for behavioral variables and heart rate. However, some correlations emerged only at 11 months, whereas others disappeared over ontogeny. Moreover, CORT was independent of temperament and heart rate during the entire period. Temperament is a consistent behavioral difference among individuals over time or in different contexts. A comprehensive understanding of temperament and complex behavioral interactions enhances knowledge on animal evolution, welfare, and productivity. However, reports on the development of behavioral consistency over ontogeny are vague. Here, we tested the ontogeny of the temperament and physiological traits of Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) in three crucial age stages. The mean level of the risk-taking variable increased, while that of the vocalizations variable decreased. The exploration variable was stable over ontogeny. The novelty decreased and the heart rate increased from the juvenile to the adolescent stage but stabilized at the adult stage. The fecal cortisol concentration (CORT) variable was stable at the juvenile and adolescent stages but decreased at the adult stage. Stable correlations were reported for the juvenile and adolescent stages and for the behavioral variables and heart rate. However, some correlations emerged only after maturation, whereas others disappeared over ontogeny. Moreover, CORT was independent of temperament and heart rate at different ages. These results demonstrate that age affects temperament and physiology and their correlations. Hence, developmental aspects should be incorporated into future temperament studies.

AB  - The problem of rice farming in Indonesia is the increasing extent of nutrient-poor land due to the lack of addition of organic matter and continuously inundated irrigated rice fields, causing the production of greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane gas (CH4), to increase. The study aims to determine the impact of organic fertilizers and rice varieties on rice yield, methane emissions, and the feasibility of farming in nutrient-poor rice fields. The study used a randomized block design in factorial with four replicates. The first factor is the type of organic fertilizers (compost of rice straw and goat manure), and the second factor is the variety of rice (Ciherang, Inpari 20, and Inpari 30). The results showed that the productivity of Inpari 20 (8.02 t center dot ha(-1)) was significantly higher than that of Inpari 30 (6.10 t center dot ha(-1)) and Ciherang (6.91 t center dot ha(-1)). The highest yields of Harvest Dry Grain (HDG) to Milled Dry Grain (MDG) were the Inpari 20 (88.23%), Inpari 30 (86.94%), and Ciherang (85.04%). Methane (CH4) emissions were highest in the Ciherang variety (56.4 kg h(-1) season(-1)), followed by Inpari 30 (40.8 kg h(-1) season(-1)), and lowest in Inpari 20 (22.3 kg h(-1) season(-1)). Compared to Inpari 30 and Ciherang varieties, the Inpari 20 variety with rice straw compost has broad development viability in nutrient-poor paddy fields (highest R/C ratio and break-even point). More research on organic rice is needed to determine the productivity and emissions (methane, nitrite, carbon dioxide).

AB  - Provisioning can significantly affect the ranging patterns, foraging strategies, and time budget of wild primates. In this study, we document for the first time, the effects of provisioning on the activity budget and foraging effort in an Asian colobine. Over 3-years, we used an instantaneous scanning method at 10-min intervals to collect data on the activity budget of a semiprovisioned breeding band (SPB) of black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) (42-70 individuals) at Xiangguqing (Tacheng), Yunnan, China. We then compared the effects of provisioning in our study band with published data on a sympatric wild nonprovisioned breeding band (NPB) of R. bieti (ca. 360 monkeys) at the same field site. The SPB spent 25.6% of their daytime feeding, 17.1% traveling, 46.9% resting, and 10.3% socializing. In comparison, the NPB devoted more time to feeding (34.9%) and socializing (14.1%), less time to resting (31.3%), and was characterized by a greater foraging effort (1.74 versus 0.96, foraging effort = (feeding + traveling)/resting; see Methods). There was no difference between bands in the proportion of their activity budget devoted to traveling (15.7% vs. 17.1%). In addition, the SPB exhibited a more consistent activity budget and foraging effort across all seasons of the year compared to the NPB. These findings suggest that the distribution, availability, and productivity of naturally occurring feeding sites is a major determinant of the behavioral strategies and activity budget of R. bieti. Finally, a comparison of our results with data on six nonprovisioned R. bieti bands indicates that caution must be raised in meta-analyses or intraspecific comparisons of primate behavioral ecology that contain data generated from both provisioned and nonprovisioned groups.

AB  - Simple Summary Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is an important determinant of pork quality and a complex process facilitated by non-coding ceRNAs. Emerging evidence suggests that IMF deposition is a complex process facilitated and associated with non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). In our study, whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed using longissimus dorsi samples of six low and high IMF Berkshire x Anqing Sixwhite crossbred pigs. Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, were screened and constructed 34 competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Following weighted gene co-expression network analysis, only one ceRNA, lncRNA4789/miR-381-3p/FABP3, that showed similar DE trend in longissimus dorsi tissue was retained. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assays further indicated that FABP3 was a direct, functional target of miR-381-3p while overexpressed lncRNA4789 attenuated the effect of miR-381-3p on FABP3 by sponging miR-381-3p. Cell function verification experiment demonstrated that miR-381-3p suppressed IMF deposition by inhibiting preadipocyte cell differentiation and lipid droplet deposition via the suppression of FABP3 expression in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signalling pathway, whereas lncRNA4789 rescued FABP3 expression by sponging miR-381-3p. Our study may aid in identifying novel molecular markers for its optimization in IMF which is of importance in breeding for improving pork quality. Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is an important determinant of pork quality and a complex process facilitated by non-coding ceRNAs. In this study, 52 Berkshire x Anqing Sixwhite crossbred pigs were slaughtered to measure eight carcass and pork quality traits. Whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed using longissimus dorsi samples of six low- and high-IMF samples; 34 ceRNA networks, based on 881, 394, 158 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, were constructed. Following weighted gene co-expression network analysis between the low and high IMF, only one ceRNA, lncRNA4789/miR-381-3p/FABP3, that showed similar DE trend in longissimus dorsi tissue was retained. Dual-luciferase reporter assays further indicated that FABP3 was a direct, functional target of miR-381-3p, where miR-381-3p overexpression inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of FABP3. In addition, overexpressed lncRNA4789 attenuated the effect of miR-381-3p on FABP3 by sponging miR-381-3p. Cell function verification experiment demonstrated that miR-381-3p suppressed IMF deposition by inhibiting preadipocyte cell differentiation and lipid droplet deposition via the suppression of FABP3 expression in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signalling pathway, whereas lncRNA4789 rescued FABP3 expression by sponging miR-381-3p.

AB  - Background Birds are key indicator species in extant ecosystems, and thus we would expect extinct birds to provide insights into the nature of ancient ecosystems. However, many aspects of extinct bird ecology, particularly their diet, remain obscure. One group of particular interest is the bizarre toothed and long-snouted longipterygid birds. Longipterygidae is the most well-understood family of enantiornithine birds, the dominant birds of the Cretaceous period. However, as with most Mesozoic birds, their diet remains entirely speculative. Results To improve our understanding of longipterygids, we investigated four proxies in extant birds to determine diagnostic traits for birds with a given diet: body mass, claw morphometrics, jaw mechanical advantage, and jaw strength via finite element analysis. Body mass of birds tended to correspond to the size of their main food source, with both carnivores and herbivores splitting into two subsets by mass: invertivores or vertivores for carnivores, and granivores + nectarivores or folivores + frugivores for herbivores. Using claw morphometrics, we successfully distinguished ground birds, non-raptorial perching birds, and raptorial birds from one another. We were unable to replicate past results isolating subtypes of raptorial behaviour. Mechanical advantage was able to distinguish herbivorous diets with particularly high values of functional indices, and so is useful for identifying these specific diets in fossil taxa, but overall did a poor job of reflecting diet. Finite element analysis effectively separated birds with hard and/or tough diets from those eating foods which are neither, though could not distinguish hard and tough diets from one another. We reconstructed each of these proxies in longipterygids as well, and after synthesising the four lines of evidence, we find all members of the family but Shengjingornis (whose diet remains inconclusive) most likely to be invertivores or generalist feeders, with raptorial behaviour likely in Longipteryx and Rapaxavis. Conclusions This study provides a 20% increase in quantitatively supported fossil bird diets, triples the number of diets reconstructed in enantiornithine species, and serves as an important first step in quantitatively investigating the origins of the trophic diversity of living birds. These findings are consistent with past hypotheses that Mesozoic birds occupied low trophic levels.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment is a key process for the authorization of pesticides, and is subjected to continuous challenges and updates. Current approaches are based on standard scenarios and independent substance-crop assessments. This arrangement does not address the complexity of agricultural ecosystems with mammals feeding on different crops. This work presents a simplified model for regulatory use addressing landscape variability, co-exposure to several pesticides, and predicting the effect on population abundance. The focus is on terrestrial vertebrates and the aim is the identification of the key risk drivers impacting on mid-term population dynamics. The model is parameterized for EU assessments according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Guidance Document, but can be adapted to other regulatory schemes. The conceptual approach includes two modules: (a) the species population dynamics, and (b) the population impact of pesticide exposure. Population dynamics is modelled through daily survival and seasonal reproductions rates; which are modified in case of pesticide exposure. All variables, parameters, and functions can be modified. The model has been calibrated with ecological data for wild rabbits and brown hares and tested for two herbicides, glyphosate and bromoxynil, using validated toxicity data extracted from EFSA assessments. Results demonstrate that the information available for a regulatory assessment, according to current EU information requirements, is sufficient for predicting the impact and possible consequences at population dynamic levels. The model confirms that agroecological parameters play a key role when assessing the effect of pesticide exposure on population abundance. The integration of laboratory toxicity studies with this simplified landscape model allows for the identification of conditions leading to population vulnerability or resilience. An Annex includes a detailed assessment of the model characteristics according to the EFSA scheme on Good Modelling Practice.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the initial development of the male reproductive system, including the prostate, should provide insight into malfunctions in the adult male. Although changes in circulating androgens during development are characterized in multiple species, potential changes in the androgen receptor, in the enzyme that converts testosterone to the presumably more potent dihydrotestosterone, and in colony stimulating factor 1, a critical mediator of macrophage influence on organ development, were previously unknown and anticipated to be influenced by androgens and estrogens. Gene expression in the testis, prostate, and seminal vesicles of these three mediators of development, including responses to reduced testosterone or estrogens, were evaluated. Each of these three genes had a unique temporal pattern of expression during postnatal reproductive tract development. However, surprisingly minimal effects of altered steroid signaling were reported on the expression of these presumed pivotal genes. The male reproductive system develops from a minimally functioning gonad and nonfunctioning accessory sex glands in the neonate; sex steroids, presumed to be primary influencers of these changes, have been characterized in multiple species. This study focused on the expression of the androgen receptor as the principal mediator of androgen-induced signaling; the 5 alpha reductase enzyme that converts testosterone to the more active dihydrotestosterone; and colony stimulating factor 1, a mediator of macrophage influence on organ development in the pig. The time points chosen to evaluate normal developmental changes during the juvenile and prepubertal intervals included the inflection time points of 6.5 weeks of age at the nadir of circulating estradiol and testosterone concentrations in juveniles, and 11 weeks of age, when these concentrations begin to increase. The role of sex steroid signaling in the regulation of gene expression was evaluated by the blockade of androgen and estrogen receptors and reduction in endogenous estrogens. Expression of colony stimulating factor 1 in the testes gradually decreased during development; developmental profiles in the prostate and seminal vesicles were clearly different. Interference with sex steroid signaling had no effect on the expression of these three genes in testicular tissue and minimal and transient effects in prostate and seminal vesicles.

AB  - Allelochemicals produced by plants may be ingested by herbivorous insects and transferred to higher trophic levels with potentially deleterious effects. We develop a system of differential equations to investigate the effect of the transfer of allelochemicals, such as nicotine, on the population dynamics of a system of hosts, parasitoids, and two competing hyperparasitoids that attack different life stages of the parasitoids. We find both somewhat deleterious effects of nicotine on the larvae-attacking hyperparasitoids and increased attack rates for the pupae-attacking hyperparasitoids can promote coexistence. We also use an evolutionary game-theoretic approach to determine the optimal distribution of hyperparasitoid attacks among nicotine-producing and nicotine-free plants. With strong deleterious effects of nicotine and increased attack rates for the pupae-attacking hyperparasitoid, we find both species attack parasitoids on the nicotine-free plant but only pupae-attacking hyperparasitoids attack parasitoids on the nicotine-producing plant. Recommendations for Resource Managers: In the absence of nicotine and with equal attack rates, the larvae-attacking hyperparasitoids will exclude pupae-attacking hyperparasitoids due to the advantage of attacking an earlier life-stage of the parasitoid. Coexistence of larvae- and pupae-attacking hyperparasitoid species can occur when the pupae-attacking species has the advantage of a higher oviposition rate and/or when the larvae-attacking species suffers increased mortality due to nicotine. If mortality rates of larvae-attacking hyperparasitoids due to nicotine become too large, they are unable to persist. The population dynamics of systems incorporating multiple trophic levels are complex and intertwined. The presence of allelochemicals such as nicotine in the first trophic level may impact the observed diversity of hyperparasitoid species in the fourth trophic level.

AB  - Background Dynamic changes in the mammary gland during lactation and the dry period involve proliferation, secretion, apoptosis, and remodeling of mammary epithelial cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized as critical regulators of mammary gland development and lactation. However, their expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms at different lactation stages-particularly during mammary involution and remodeling-remain poorly understood in dairy goats.Methods In this study, high-throughput sequencing was employed to analyze miRNA expression profiles in goat mammary tissues at five key stages: late gestation (LG), early lactation (EL), peak lactation (PL), late lactation (LL), and the dry period (DP). Differential expression analysis, miRNA clustering, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were performed to predict the functions of target genes. A miRNA-mRNA regulatory network associated with mammary gland development was constructed, and functional validation experiments were conducted to confirm key regulatory relationships.Results A total of 1,120 miRNAs were identified, including 408 known and 712 newly predicted miRNAs. Among them, 383 were significantly differentially expressed, with the largest number observed between the dry period and late gestation. Six expression-specific miRNA clusters were identified. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these miRNAs may regulate epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling by targeting pathways such as energy metabolism, cell adhesion, and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. IGF1R was identified as a key regulatory gene in the miRNA-mRNA network related to mammary gland development. Experimental validation showed that chi-miR-423-3p inhibited mammary epithelial cell proliferation, induced G1/S cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis by targeting IGF1R and suppressing the PI3K/Akt pathway.Conclusion This study highlights the dynamic regulatory roles of miRNAs in the goat mammary gland across lactation stages. Notably, the miR-423-3p/IGF1R axis is a key regulator of mammary remodeling during the dry period, offering new insights into the molecular basis of mammary gland functional transitions.

AB  - Our objectives were to explore the effect of naringenin addition in the semen extender on the post-thaw 1) sperm quality, 2) fertility-associated gene expression, and 3) fertilization potential of buffalo bull sperm. In experiment 1, semen samples (n = 32) from four Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls were pooled (n = 8) and diluted with the tris-citric acid (TCF-EY) extender containing different concentrations of naringenin, i.e., placebo (DMSO), 0 (control), 50, 100, 150 and 200 mu M naringenin. After dilution, semen samples were packed in 0.5 mL French straws, cryopreserved and analyzed for post-thawed sperm quality and gene expression. Computer-assisted Semen Analysis, Hypo-osmotic Swelling test, Normal Apical Ridge assay, Rhodamine 123, Acridine orange, Propidium iodide staining and Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances assay were performed to assess sperm motility parameters, plasma membrane functionality, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA integrity, viability and lipid peroxidation, respectively. Expression levels of sperm acrosome-associated SPACA3, DNA condensation-related PRM1, anti-apoptotic BCL2, pro-apoptotic BAX, and oxidative stress-associated ROMO1 genes were evaluated through qPCR. Results revealed that total and progressive motility, plasma membrane functionality, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA integrity and viability were higher (P < 0.05) with 50, 100 and 150 mu M naringenin compared to 200 mu M naringenin, placebo and control groups. Moreover, all naringenin-treated groups improved catalase activity, and reduced lipid peroxidation compared to placebo and control groups (P < 0.05). Relative expression levels of SPACA3 and PRM1 genes were higher (P < 0.05) with 150 mu M naringenin compared to all groups except 100 mu M (P > 0.05). No difference (P > 0.05) in the expression level of BCL2 gene was observed among all groups. Furthermore, BAX gene was expressed higher (P < 0.05) in the 200 mu M naringenin group, whereas no difference (P > 0.05) in expression was noticed among the remaining groups. In addition, ROMO1 gene was expressed lower (P < 0.05) in all naringenin-treated groups compared to the control. In experiment 2, the in vivo fertility of semen doses (n = 400; 200/group) containing optimum concentration of naringenin (150 mu M; depicted better in vitro sperm quality in experiment 1) was compared with control during the breeding season. Buffaloes were inseminated 24 h after the onset of natural estrus and palpated transrectal for pregnancy at least 60 days post-insemination. The fertility rate of 150 mu M naringenin group was higher (P = 0.0366) compared to the control [57.00 +/- 0.03 % (114/200) vs. 46.50 +/- 0.04 % (93/200), respectively]. Taken together, it is concluded that naringenin supplementation in semen extender improves post-thaw quality, fertility-associated gene expression and fertilization potential of buffalo bull sperm, more apparently at 150 mu M concentration.

AB  - Donkey milk is a valuable product due to its uses that range from feeding newborns and heart and hypercholesterolemic patients to making dairy products, cosmetics, active biomolecules, and soaps. Although the use of donkey milk for cosmetic applications has a long history, there is little knowledge about its perceived quality in cosmetics. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the perception of untrained consumers regarding the sensory aspects of a donkey milk-based face cream. The consumer test was carried out by 110 randomly recruited women who evaluated two formulations of the cosmetic with or without donkey milk. On the 7th and 15th day of use, the following sensory aspects were evaluated: appearance, fragrance, effectiveness, and overall satisfaction. ANOVA test demonstrated the effect of cosmetics and skin type on judgement. In both periods, the donkey milk-added cream reached a good rating in most of the parameters. Consumers with dry skin appreciated this product more than consumers with normal and oily skin and gave significantly higher ratings for moisturization and smoothness of the skin in both periods.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a significant challenge for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Effective mitigation of HWC requires a multidisciplinary, holistic, and comprehensive approach. In the past two decades, scientific research has focused on HWC. It can be expected that in the next few years, the number of HWC literature will continue to increase. In this study, the VOSviewer version 1.6.16, and Bibliometrix packages in R were used to conduct a quantitative review of the HWC literature and investigate its social network and development trends. The results show that 2197 publications about HWC have been published in 320 journals from 128 countries in 2003-2021. The United States is the largest producer with 893. Among all journals, Biological Conservation ranked first in terms of total link strength, number of links, documents, and citations. The analysis of keywords, development trends, and development themes shows that the research on HWC mainly includes three aspects: the conflict between humans and carnivores, conflict between humans and herbivores, and protection of the human dimension. The main focus of the research has shifted from the conflict itself to the coexistence of humans and wild animals through the integration of natural and economic factors. It is expected that HWC research will play a key role in generating the interdisciplinary scientific knowledge needed to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.

AB  - Chemical communication between sexes in the elephants has been well studied at the chemical and behavioural levels, but little is known about the proteins mediating the exchange of chemical signals. Two sex pheromones have been identified in Asian elephants: (Z)-7-dodecenyl acetate and frontalin, and their effects on the elephants' behaviour have been described in detail. The genomes of both the Asian (Elephas maximus) and the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) have been poorly annotated. In particular, the complete sequences of two odorant-binding proteins and a VEG protein are available for the African elephant, together with isoforms and other members of the same families, which however are incomplete or unreliable. In a previous study, we have expressed the OBP1 of both elephant species, and investigated their binding properties. We showed that OBP1 is tuned to the pheromone (Z)-7-dodecenyl acetate and few structurally related linear esters, but also binds (E)-beta-farnesene and farnesol with good affinity. In this work we have explored the characteristics of the second OBP of the African elephant (LafrOBP2). This protein, which was not found in the trunk wash, does not bind any of the above listed semiochemicals. Instead, it shows selected affinity to unsaturated linear aldehydes of 16 carbon atoms, specifically (Z)-9-hexadecenal, (Z)-11-hexadecenal and (10E,12Z)-hexadecadienal (bombykal). Fourteen and 18 carbon orthologues show only much reduced binding affinity. Some linear alcohols, fatty acids and esters also weakly bind this protein with dissociation constants about one order of magnitude higher.

AB  - Global climate change and the greenhouse effect have accelerated the decline in semen quality of male animals. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a newly discovered class of non-coding RNAs, play a crucial role in spermatogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of piRNAs in testicular heat stress remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the impact of environmental temperature on semen quality in mammals, using 23,385 data points from pigs as a representative species. We constructed a mouse testicular heat stress model and performed in vitro functional validation of selected piRNAs in spermatogonia. Our results revealed a significant negative correlation between environmental temperature and semen quality, with rapid declines occurring when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C. Heat stress caused testicular atrophy and spermatogenic arrest, while decreasing piRNA-related gene expression in spermatogenic cells. PANDORA-seq identified piRNAs as the most responsive small RNAs to heat stress. We further identified piR_021767 as a key regulator of spermatogenic disorders, with its expression negatively correlated with testicular weight and semen density. Inhibition of piR_021767 expression in C18-4 cells suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Dual luciferase assays showed that piR_021767 inhibits BAX expression, regulating spermatogonial apoptosis. This study provides new insights into the role of piRNAs in heat stress-induced spermatogenic disorders.

AB  - For sustainable sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) berry production, the task at hand is to find an application for the large amount of biomass waste arising at harvesting. Sea buckthorn (SBT) vegetation is currently poorly studied. The purpose of this research was to assess the composition and potential of SBT twigs as a source of valuable biologically active substances. Water and 50% EtOH extracts of twigs of three Latvian SBT cultivars with a high berry yield and quality, popular for cultivation in many countries (H. rhamnoides 'Maria Bruvele', 'Tatiana', 'Botanicheskaya Lubitelskaya'), were investigated for the first time. The phytochemical composition (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis) and biological activity of the obtained hydrophilic extracts were determined. The highest yield of polyphenolic compounds and serotonin was observed for 'Maria Bruvele'. Hydrophilic extracts were investigated for radical scavenging activity (DPPLI . test), antibacterial/antifungal activity against five pathogenic bacteria/yeast, cytotoxicity, and the enzymatic activity of alpha-amylase (via in vitro testing), which is extremely important for the treatment of people with underweight, wasting, and malabsorption. The results showed a high potential of sea buckthorn biomass as a source of valuable biologically active compounds for the creation of preparations for the food industry, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics.

AB  - Exogenous melatonin (MT) has been used to promote the growth of secondary hair follicles and improve cashmere fiber quality, but the specific cellular-level mechanisms involved are unclear. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of MT on the development of secondary hair follicles and on cashmere fiber quality in cashmere goats. The results showed that MT improved secondary follicle numbers and function as well as enhanced cashmere fiber quality and yield. The MT-treated goat groups had high secondary-to-primary ratios (S:P) for hair follicles, greater in the elderly group (p < 0.05). Antioxidant capacities of secondary hair follicles improved fiber quality and yield in comparison with control groups (p < 0.05/0.01). Levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were lowered (p < 0.05/0.01) by MT. There was significant upregulation of antioxidant genes (for SOD-3; GPX-1; NFE2L2) and the protein of nuclear factor (Nrf2), and downregulation of the Keap1 protein. There were significant differences in the expression of genes for secretory senescence-associated phenotype (SASP) cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, MMP-9, MMP-27, CCL-21, CXCL-12, CXCL-14, TIMP-1,2,3) plus their protein of key transcription factors, nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), in comparison with the controls. We concluded that MT could enhance antioxidant capacity and reduce ROS and RNS levels of secondary hair follicles through the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in adult cashmere goats. Furthermore, MT reduced the expression of the SASP cytokines genes by inhibiting the protein of NF kappa B and AP-1 in the secondary hair follicles in older cashmere goats, thus delaying skin aging, improving follicle survival, and increasing the number of secondary hair follicles. Collectively, these effects of exogenous MT enhanced the quality and yield of cashmere fibers, especially at 5-7 years old.

AB  - Objective: To explore different mRNA transcriptome patterns and RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) alteration in yunaconitine (YA)-treated HT22 mouse hippocampal neuron, and uncover the role of abnormal mRNA expression and RNA m6A modification in YA-induced neurotoxicity.Methods: HT22 cells were treated with 0, 5, 10, and 50 mu M of YA for 72 h to evaluate their viability and GSH content. Subsequently, mRNA-seq and MeRIP-seq analyses were performed on HT22 cells treated with 0 and 10 mu M YA for 72 h, and molecular docking was used to simulate interactions between YA and differentially expressed m6A regulators. The mitochondrial membrane potential was examined using the JC-10 probe, and RT-qPCR was conducted to verify the expression levels of differentially expressed m6A regulatory factors, as well as to assess alterations in the mRNA expression levels of antioxidant genes.Results: YA treatment significantly reduced the viability of HT22 cells and decreased GSH content. The mRNA-seq analysis obtained 1018 differentially expressed genes, KEGG and GO enrichment results of differentially expressed genes mainly comprise the nervous system development, cholinergic synapse, response to oxidative stress, and mitochondrial inner membrane. A total of 7 differentially expressed m6A regulators were identified by MeRIP-seq. Notably, molecular docking results suggested a stable interaction between YA and most of the differentially expressed m6A regulators.Conclusion: This study showed that YA-induced HT22 cell damage was associated with the increased methylation modification level of target gene m6A and abnormal expression of m6A regulators.

AB  - Abnormal expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been correlated with depressive disorders, but limited data are available on the lncRNA-microRNA (miRNA/miR)-messenger RNA (mRNA) competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism in depression. Herein, we address this issue based on transcriptome sequencing and in vitro experiments. Mouse hippocampus tissues were obtained from chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mice to screen out differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs based on the tran-scriptome sequencing. Next, the depression-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained, fol-lowed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. A total of 1018 differentially expressed mRNAs, 239 differentially expressed lncRNAs, and 58 DEGs related to depression were acquired. The miRNAs targeting Harvey rat sarcoma virus oncogene (Hras) and miRNAs sponged by Hras-related lncRNA were intersected to identify the ceRNA regulatory network. In addition, the synapse-related genes related to depression were acquired by bioinformatics analysis. Hras was identified as the core gene related to depression, mainly related to neuronal excitation. We also found that 2210408F21Rik competitively bound to miR-1968-5p that targeted Hras. The effects of 2210408F21Rik/miR-1968-5p/Hras axis on neuronal excitation were verified in primary hippocampal neurons. The experimental data indicated that the downregulation of 2210408F21Rik increased the level of miR-1968-5p to diminish Hras expression, thereby affecting neuronal excitation in CUMS mice. In conclusion, the 2210408F21Rik/miR-1968-5p/Hras ceRNA network can potentially affect the expression of synapsia-related proteins and is a promising target for preventing and treating depression.

AB  - Anthracnose, a severe disease caused by Colletotrichum, affects diverse crops and leads to significant economic losses through pronounced fruit/leaf lesions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in modulating gene expression in response to disease resistance, defence responses and plant immunity. However, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in responses to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides remain unknown in tea plants. Our study revealed that csn-miR393a targets auxin receptor gene CsAFB2 during resistance to C. gloeosporioides in tea plants by comparing the resistant cultivar Zhongcha108 to the susceptible cultivar Longjing43. Through Nicotiana benthamiana leaf co-transformation assays, we demonstrated that csn-miR393a suppresses the expression of CsAFB2, and csn-miR393a target mimic blocks the function of csn-miR393a, leading to increase in the expression of CsAFB2. Repression of transcripts in tea leaves by antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated that csn-miR393a negatively affects the tea plant defence by regulating reactive oxygen species homoeostasis, PR gene expression and catechin accumulation. To further validate the regulatory mechanisms of csn-miR393a, we developed transgenic tea plants overexpressing CsAFB2, resulting in enhanced resistance responses against C. gloeosporioides. Additionally, transgenic N. benthamiana lines overexpressing a csn-miR393a target mimic provided further evidence that csn-miR393a negatively regulates the tea plant defence response against C. gloeosporioides by suppressing CsAFB2. Therefore, manipulating csn-miR393a or its target gene, CsAFB2, has the potential to strengthen the tea plant's resistance against tea anthracnose.

AB  - The appropriate balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines is important for the maternal immune tolerance during pregnancy in mammals. Among the various cytokines, interleukin (IL)-10 (IL10) plays an essential role in anti-inflammatory responses, while IL12 is involved in pro-inflammatory responses during pregnancy. However, the roles of IL10 and IL12 in the endometrium during pregnancy have not been studied in pigs. Thus, we investigated the expression of IL10, IL12 (IL12A and IL12B), and their receptors (IL10RA, IL10RB, IL12RB1, and IL12RB2) at the maternal-conceptus interface. IL10, IL12, and their receptors were expressed in the endometrium during the estrous cycle and pregnancy in a pregnancy stage-specific manner. During pregnancy, IL10 expression increased on Day 15, whereas the expression of IL12A and IL12B decreased after the implantation period. IL10 protein was localized to luminal epithelial (LE), stromal cells, and macrophages; IL10RA protein to LE, endothelial, stromal, and T cells; and IL10RB mRNA to LE cells in the endometrium. IL10 and IL10RA proteins and IL10RB mRNA were also localized to chorionic epithelial (CE) cells. In endometrial explants, the expression of IL10RA and IL10RB was induced by estradiol-17 beta, IL-1 beta, and/or interferon-gamma. Heme oxygenase 1, an IL10-inducible factor, was expressed in the endometrium with the highest levels on Day 30 of pregnancy and was localized to LE and CE cells. These results in pigs suggest that conceptus-derived signals change the endometrial immune environment by regulating the expression of IL10 and IL10 receptors at the maternal-conceptus interface and that IL10 may provide anti-inflammatory conditions for the maternal immune tolerance.
   IL10 expression increases at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the main concerns of veterinarians and researchers involved in animal research work is the improvement of experimental procedures to minimize discomfort to the animal. In the handling of experimental pigs, one of the challenges is immobilization, since due to their size, it is difficult and can cause stress to the animals. Immobilization using a restraint sling is a safe method for the animal and relatively simple for the operators. For this reason, the objective of this study was to evaluate the stress of pigs immobilized with a sling by quantifying salivary cortisol levels. We found that salivary cortisol levels did not increase when pigs were lifted and briefly restrained in the sling, even though some pigs (especially hybrids) showed apparent signs of stress. The lack of correlation between such apparent stress and salivary cortisol levels could be because the vocalizations and movements were not really signs of stress, but simply a way of releasing discomfort, learned in the process of socialization and habituation. In light of this unexpected conclusion, further studies collecting other physiological and behavioral data are needed to clarify what actually happens when pigs are restrained in a sling.Abstract The goal of the present study was to evaluate the potential stress developed in farm hybrid pigs and miniature laboratory pigs briefly restrained in a sling, by measuring salivary cortisol levels. The study was performed in 20 healthy pigs grouped into three groups: group HYB-F: hybrid female pigs (n = 12), housed at the CREBA facility (Lleida, Spain); group MIN-F: Specipig (R) miniature female pigs (n = 4), housed at the CREBA facility; group MIN-M: Specipig (R) miniature male pigs (n = 4), housed at the Almirall facility (Barcelona, Spain). Upon arrival, the animals were enrolled in a social habituation and training program, which included habituation to a restraint sling. The sling was a stainless steel structure with a canvas hammock which had four openings for placing the animal's feet. The assessment of stress levels in the sling was carried out by measuring cortisol levels in saliva samples. Five saliva samples were collected from each animal over 4 days: Sample 1 (basal sample): taken after animals perceived the presence of the technicians in the pen; Sample 2: taken after animals saw the sling in the pen; Sample 3: taken when animals were in the sling; Sample 4: taken 1 min after the previous one; Sample 5: taken after animals were released back on the floor. In group HYB-F, five animals (5/12) showed strong resistance and could not be restrained in the sling on at least one day. All animals in the groups of miniature pigs could be restrained on all the days. Within each group, the manipulation phase did not affect salivary cortisol levels. Likewise, salivary cortisol levels did not change significantly across days in either group. In conclusion, salivary cortisol levels did not increase when pigs were lifted and briefly restrained in the sling, even though some of them (in particular, the hybrid pigs) showed apparent signs of stress. The lack of correlation between such apparent stress and salivary cortisol levels might be because the vocalizations and movements were not really signs of stress, but simply a way of releasing discomfort, learned in the process of socialization and habituation. In light of this unexpected conclusion, further studies are needed to collect other physiological and behavioral data to clarify what actually happens when pigs are restrained in a sling.

AB  - Simple Summary The negative effects of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) exposure on the testicular function of bull camels are examined in this study. We uncover the bioaccumulation of these toxic metals, which causes subcellular alterations, reduced testes, and altered hormone synthesis, through comprehensive sampling and analysis. The results highlight the significance of understanding and addressing the effects of Pb and Cd exposure on camel reproductive health. The free grazing habits of camels from various sources may cause heavy metals to bioaccumulate in their tissues and organs, possibly resulting in higher amounts of these toxic substances in their bodies over time. The aim of this study was to assess the exposure impact of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) on bull camels of the Lassi breed, aged 7 to 8 years, at a site near the industrial area and another two non-industrial sites, to analyze the presence of heavy metals. Samples from three sites were collected from thirty camels (n = 10/each), soil and water (n = 30), and five different plants (n = 15/each) for analysis. Testes were collected for atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Serum samples were obtained to measure testosterone levels by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Samples were obtained from plants, soil, water, blood, serum and urine for AAS. According to the results, the testes' weight, length, width, and volume significantly decreased at the industrial site compared with the other two sites as a result of exposure to Cd and Pb. Additionally, blood testosterone concentrations were considerably lower at the industrial site, indicating a detrimental impact on testicular steroidogenesis. The histological investigation of the industrial site indicated structural disturbances, including seminiferous tubule degeneration and shedding, cellular debris in seminiferous tubules, lining epithelium depletion, and vacuolation. Elevated amounts of Cd and Pb were found at the industrial site when analyzed using water, soil, plants, testes, serum, and urine. These findings demonstrate the adverse effects of Pb and Cd exposure on camel testicular function, including decreased weight and altered steroidogenesis. These findings are essential for understanding the impact of exposure to Pb and Cd on camel reproductive function and for developing successful prevention and management plans for these exposures in this species.

AB  - Drought is the major devastating stress affecting plant growth and development. The plant develops some physiological and biochemical changes to withstand drought. The raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) are sugars that have a significant role in abiotic stress tolerance. Galactinol synthase (EC 2.4.1.123; GolS) initiates the primary step of the RFOs synthesis. Their accumulation implies a role for RFOs in abiotic stress adaptation. The galactinol synthase gene from proso millet was isolated and characterized. Full length proso millet galactinol synthase gene of size similar to 1,200 bp having 3 exons with 2 introns was isolated and predicted using bioinformatics tools. A high sequence similarity was observed at 97.2, 95.6, 91.8 and 85.4% with Panicum hallii, Panicum virgatum, Setaria italica and Zea mays mRNA, respectively. PmGolS gene expression pattern with respect to drought stress was evaluated in proso millet. PmGolS gene was highly expressed, 40.3 and 23.7-fold in vegetative and reproductive stages of drought-stressed plants respectively compared to control. It suggested that PmGolS gene has an active role in drought stress tolerance.

AB  - Simple Summary Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are considered as the key component to control the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV). The majority of pig farms apply the 'mass' vaccination strategy in breeding female animals. However, this PRRS MLV vaccination protocol involves the risk of inoculation of sows in the last stage of gestation, resulting in possible infection of the fetus as the virus can efficiently cross the placenta during the last period of pregnancy. Thus, we evaluated the ability of the vaccine virus to act as a pathogenic strain, to be transmitted to fetuses and to affect the health status of neonatal piglets. The results indicated that the study gilts transmitted the vaccine virus to their offspring, as well as that the PRRSV-infected piglets showed a poor clinical performance. Consequently, the pig farms that apply PRRS MLV vaccination in a routine blanket vaccination strategy must avoid inoculating pregnant gilts the last week before their parturition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential risks of the four commercial PRRS-1 MLV vaccines in pregnant vaccinated gilts at the last stage of gestation under field conditions. The study was conducted at four pig farms, including 25 gilts from each farm (25 x 4 = 100 gilts), which were equally allocated to five different study groups. A PRRS-1 MLV vaccination was applied on the 100th day of their pregnancy with the different commercial vaccines that are available in the Greek market. The results indicated virus congenital infection and viremia in piglets (20/200 = 10% PRRSV infected piglets), and detection of PRRSV-specific antibodies (181/200 = 90.5% piglets found with PRRSV antibodies). The subsequent phylogenetic analyses revealed high percentages of similarity between the PRRSV-1 strain detected in infected litters and the PRRSV-1 vaccine strain to which the study gilts had been previously exposed to. Health status analyses of trial piglets resulted in differences between litters from vaccinated sows and litters from non-vaccinated sows at 110th day of gestation as regards the number of weak-born piglets, mummies, and piglets with splay-leg and/or respiratory symptoms. The current study's results indicate several potential dangers of the PRRS MLV vaccination in late gestation.

AB  - Early life stress negatively impacts brain development and affects structure and function of parvalbumin immunopositive (PV+) inhibitory neurons. Main regulators of PV+ interneurons activity and plasticity are perineuronal nets (PNNs), an extracellular matrix formation that enwraps PV+ interneurons mainly in the neocortex and hippocampus. To experimentally address the impact of early life stress on the PNNs and PV+ interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus in rats, we employed a 24 h maternal deprivation protocol. We show that maternal deprivation in the medial prefrontal cortex of adult rats caused a decrease in density of overall PNNs and PNNs that enwrap PV+ interneurons in the rostral cingulate cortex. Furthermore, a staining intensity decrease of overall PNNs and PNN+/PV+ cells was found in the prelimbic cortex. Finally, a decrease in both intensity and density of overall PNNs and PNNs surrounding PV+ cells was observed in the infralimbic cortex, together with increase in the intensity of VGAT inhibitory puncta. Surprisingly, maternal deprivation did not cause any changes in the density of PV+ interneurons in the mPFC, neither had it affected PNNs and PV+ interneurons in the hippocampus. Taken together, our findings indicate that PNNs, specifically the ones enwrapping PV+ interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, are affected by early life stress.

AB  - The tea plants have been one of the most widely consumed and oldest nonalcoholic beverage crops in the world. Lingyun Baihao tea plants are unique species and widely distribute in Guangxi. It is well known that aroma usually determine the quality of tea. In recent years, molecular identification has been employed in the tea plant at the genetic level. However, the association of aroma loss issues to genetic diversities between wild and cultivated tea plants is not clear. Here, we identified 112,938,224 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 10,736,211 insertions/deletions (InDels) for the tea plants through the whole genome sequencing technology. Both SNPs and InDels have certain characteristics in the tea genome, which transition in SNPs type distributes wildly comparing with transversion and single base variation has absolute advantage in InDels. These markers demonstrated that DNA polymorphisms and high diversity. Collectively, we confirmed that the loss of aroma might due to genetic differences at the molecular level between wild and cultivated tea plants, which will be valuable resources for further genetic researches of Lingyun Baihao tea plant.

Arabidopsis defense compounds include tryptophan-derived metabolites, which limit Arabidopsis infestation by the generalist herbivore two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. However, the phytochemicals responsible for Arabidopsis protection against T. urticae are unknown. Here, we used Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in the synthesis of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites to identify phytochemicals involved in the defense against T. urticae. We show that of the three tryptophan-dependent pathways found in Arabidopsis, the indole glucosinolate (IG) pathway is necessary and sufficient to assure tryptophan-mediated defense against T. urticae. We demonstrate that all three IGs can limit T. urticae herbivory, but that they must be processed by myrosinases to hinder T. urticae oviposition. Putative IG breakdown products were detected in mite-infested leaves, suggesting in planta processing by myrosinases. Finally, we demonstrate that besides IGs, there are additional JA-regulated defenses that control T. urticae herbivory. Together, our results reveal the complexity of Arabidopsis defenses against T. urticae that rely on multiple IGs, specific myrosinases, and additional JA-dependent defenses.

AB  - Rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep serves a critical role in processing cognitive and behavioral functions. Evidence shows that REM sleep deprivation (REM SD) strongly affects the mood state and cognitive abilities. However, there are many inconsistent reports. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying REM SD effects have not well been discovered, however, molecular factors including those affected synaptic plasticity and mood state may be involved. There are two important molecular factors that have not been well studied: synaptophysin and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta). The present study aimed to investigate the role of synaptophysin and GSK-3beta in the modulation of memory and behavioral changes induced by REM SD and lithium (as a potent GSK-3beta inhibitor and mood stabilizer). Multiple platform apparatus was used to induce REM SD for 48 h. Lithium was injected at the dose of 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.). Locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, pain threshold, novel object recognition memory, and synaptophysin and GSK-3beta level in the prefrontal cortex were evaluated. Results showed REM SD increased locomotor activity, decreased pain threshold, impaired novel object recognition memory, decreased synaptophysin and increased GSK-3beta levels. Lithium reversed these effects. Anxiety-like behavior was unaffected. For the first time, the present study showed that GSK-3beta and synaptophysin may be involved in the modulation of behavior and cognition induced by REM SD and lithium. In conclusion, we suggested that GSK-3beta upregulation and synaptophysin downregulation may underlie the deleterious effects of REM SD, while lithium may counteract REM SD effects via restoring the level of both.

AB  - To verify the accuracy of AIWS, we weighed 106 pen growing-finishing pigs' weights using both the manual and AIWS methods, respectively. Accuracy was evaluated based on the values of MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. In the growth experiment, manual weighing was conducted every two weeks and AIWS predicted weight data was recorded daily, followed by fitting the growth curves. The results showed that MAE, MAPE, and RMSE values for 60 to 120 kg pigs were 3.48 kg, 3.71%, and 4.43 kg, respectively. The correlation coefficient r between the AIWS and manual method was 0.9410, and R-2 was 0.8854. The two were extremely significant correlations (p < 0.001). In growth curve fitting, the AIWS method has lower AIC and BIC values than the manual method. The Logistic model by AIWS was the best-fit model. The age and body weight at the inflection point of the best-fit model were 164.46 d and 93.45 kg, respectively. The maximum growth rate was 831.66 g/d. In summary, AIWS can accurately predict pigs' body weights in actual production and has a better fitting effect on the growth curves of growing-finishing pigs. This study suggested that it was feasible for AIWS to replace manual weighing to measure the weight of 50 to 120 kg live pigs in large-scale farming.

AB  - Numerous facilities around the world offer tourists interactive experiences with captive tigers. Yet, the animal welfare implications of this practice have not been widely studied. This study aimed to investigate whether qualitative behavioral assessment (QBA) could: (i) provide a valid indicator of tiger's emotional state and (ii) be applied to assess whether unfamiliar human presence with hand-raised captive tigers had an impact on the emotional state of those tigers. To investigate this, QBA was applied to video clips of hand-raised captive tigers from three sites (two offering unfamiliar human interaction, Sites A and C, and one retirement site with no direct interactions, Site B) in Thailand. QBA allows inferences to be made about animal emotion on the basis of descriptions of behavioral expression. Analysis, using a free choice profiling methodology, was provided by observers (N = 38) split between three groups; tiger keepers and vets from the Thai venues (n = 12), UK-based animal behavior MSc and vet students (n = 16), and international tiger keepers (n = 10). Tigers (N = 35) were split between Sites A (n = 7), B (n = 18), and C (n = 10) and filmed at three time points; morning (0800-0930 h); midday, (1130-1230 h); and evening, (1630-1830h) totaling 105 clips. Using generalized procrustes analysis, a consensus profile was calculated for each observer group. Two meaningful dimensions of behavioral expression, explaining 75.0% of the variation, were observed across these groups: Dimension 1 (D1: "active"/"interested"/"agitated" to "relaxed"/"calm"/"chilled-out") and Dimension 2 (D2: "bored"/"stressed"/"frustrated" to "relaxed"/"curious"/"interested"). There was clear agreement between the three observer groups in terms of tiger emotional expression along D1. However, agreement was more variable on D2. The behavioral expression on D1 was not significantly affected by site but was significantly affected by an interaction between age and time of day. Time of day also affected scores on D2, with the Thai observer group also showing an effect of site. During the midday period, when unfamiliar humans were present, all tiger age groups showed more positive behavioral expressions on D1 (lower scores: "relaxed"/"calm"/"chilled-out") and more negative behavioral expressions on D2 (higher scores: "bored"/"stressed"/"frustrated"), which could indicate that the presence of unfamiliar humans was a stressor. However, tigers in the retirement Site C also displayed similar behavioral expressions, which could indicate a deeper welfare issue. With further development, QBA could be used as part of a valid tool for long-term measurement of behavioral expression in captive tigers.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;The role of olfaction in avian life histories has traditionally been neglected, but a growing body of evidence suggests that birds use olfaction in different biological contexts, including foraging. Insectivorous birds are known to detect the defence volatiles emitted by trees when attacked by herbivore arthropods. Recently, it has been shown that insectivorous birds not only use these indirect cues to locate their prey but that they can also eavesdrop on the pheromones emitted by the prey. However, the questions of whether avian attraction is limited to prey pheromones only or whether they can detect any insect pheromone remain unexplored. Therefore, we performed a field experimental study using artificial larvae close to pheromone dispensers placed on trees to analyze whether birds are attracted to prey pheromones but not to non-prey pheromones or control unscented dispensers. We recorded the number of trees that contained artificial larvae with signals of avian predation and found that insectivorous birds were only attracted to prey pheromones, confirming that insectivorous birds are able to eavesdrop on prey pheromones and suggesting that birds are not attracted to non-prey pheromones.</p>
   <br></p>
   Natural selection has favored the evolution of different capabilities that allow animals to obtain food-e.g., the development of senses for improving prey/food detection. Among these senses, chemical sense is possibly the most ancient mechanism used by organisms for environmental assessment. Comparative studies suggest the prime role of foraging ecology in the evolution of the olfactory apparatus of vertebrates, including birds. Here, we review empirical studies that have shown birds' abilities to detect prey/food via olfaction and report the results of a study aiming to analyze the specificity of eavesdropping on prey pheromones in insectivorous birds. In a field study, we placed artificial larvae and a dispenser with one of three treatments-prey (Operopthera brumata) pheromones, non-prey (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) pheromones, or a control unscented dispenser-on the branches of Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica). We then measured the predation rate of birds on artificial larvae. Our results show that more trees had larvae with signs of avian predation when they contained a prey pheromone dispenser than when they contained a non-prey pheromone dispenser or an unscented dispenser. Our results indicate that insectivorous birds can discriminate between the pheromones emitted by their prey and those emitted by non-prey insects and that they only exhibit attraction to prey pheromones. These results highlight the potential use of insectivorous birds in the biological control of insect pests.</p>

AB  - The upheavals of late eighteenth century Europe encouraged people to demand greater liberties, including the freedom to explore the natural world, individually or as part of investigative associations. The Moravian Agricultural and Natural Science Society, organized by Christian Carl Andre, was one such group of keen practitioners of theoretical and applied scientific disciplines. Headquartered in the "Moravian Manchester" Brunn (nowadays Brno), the centre of the textile industry, society members debated the improvement of sheep wool to fulfil the needs of the Habsburg armies fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. Wool, as the raw material of soldiers' clothing, could influence the war's outcome. During the early nineteenth century, wool united politics, economics, and science in Brno, where breeders and natural scientists investigated the possibilities of increasing wool production. They regularly discussed how "climate" or "seed" characteristics influenced wool quality and quantity. Breeders and academics put their knowledge into immediate practice to create sheep with better wool traits through consanguineous matching of animals and artificial selection. This apparent disregard for the incest taboo, however, was viewed as violating natural laws and cultural norms. The debate intensified between 1817 and 1820, when a Hungarian veteran soldier, sheep breeder, and self-taught natural scientist, Imre (Emmerich) Festetics, displayed his inbred Mimush sheep, which yielded wool extremely well suited for the fabrication of light but strong garments. Members of the Society questioned whether such "bastard sheep" would be prone to climatic degeneration, should be regarded as freaks of nature, or could be explained by natural laws. The exploration of inbreeding in sheep began to be distilled into hereditary principles that culminated in 1819 with Festetics's "laws of organic functions" and "genetic laws of nature," four decades before Gregor Johann Mendel's seminal work on heredity in peas.

AB  - Simple Summary A concerning highly pathogenic avian influenza caused widespread outbreaks among birds and wildlife at a global level. First identified in South America in October 2022 and linked to migratory birds, there's growing concern about virus spillover during bird migrations between the poles. The Arctic tern's migration from the Arctic to Antarctica raises concerns about its role in transmission. Even in Antarctica's seemingly untouched environment, diverse wildlife is at risk from the new strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Surveillance efforts started in the South Shetland Islands in January 2023, focusing on areas where penguins, birds, and marine mammals normally gather. Following Antarctic Treaty guidelines, observations and sample collection were conducted, revealing no signs of the virus in the region during that time lapse. These findings not only contribute to confirming the absence of the virus in Antarctica during the specified period but also emphasize the necessity for sustained surveillance and monitoring to safeguard the Antarctic ecosystem.Abstract In January 2023, an active surveillance initiative was undertaken in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, with the specific objective of ascertaining evidence for the presence of avian influenza, and specifically the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1). The investigation encompassed diverse locations, including Hanna Point (Livingston Island), Lions Rump (King George Island), and Base Escudero (King George Island), with targeted observations on marine mammals (southern elephant seals), flying birds (the kelp gull, snowy sheathbill and brown skua), and penguins (the chinstrap penguin and gentoo penguin). The study encompassed the examination of these sites for signs of mass mortality events possibly attributable to HPAIV H5N1, as well as sampling for influenza detection by means of real-time RT-PCR. Two hundred and seven (207) samples were collected, including 73 fecal samples obtained from the environment from marine mammals (predominantly feces of southern elephant seals), and 77 cloacal samples from penguins of the genus Pygoscelis (predominantly from the gentoo penguin). No evidence of mass mortality attributable to HPAIV H5N1 was observed, and all the collected samples tested negative for the presence of the virus, strongly suggesting the absence of the virus in the Antarctic territory during the specified period. This empirical evidence holds significant implications for both the ecological integrity of the region and the potential zoonotic threats, underscoring the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring in the Antarctic ecosystem.

AB  - Evidence of cannibalism is usually associated with higher population density, or lower food plant quality, and has been reported in half of all terrestrial, herbivorous insects. However, we found that cannibalism can still occur in Spodoptera frugiperda when only two larvae had been provided with an abundance of corn leaves, a high-quality food. We analyzed the causes of cannibalism, its benefits and the nutritional physiology of the winner of cannibalistic contests. We found that there were different frequencies of cannibalism on five different plant foods, with the lowest incidence on corn leaves and the highest on rice leaves. Cannibalism is only beneficial to survival if fourth- to sixth-instar larvae cannibalize more than three conspecifics of the same age. Because of the higher incidence of partial pupation and a lower emergence rate in cannibal larvae, the probability of a newly molted sixth-instar larva subject to sudden food deprivation developing into a moth was about 5.42%. Transcriptome and real-time PCR suggest that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and putative solute carrier family 38 member 9 (SLC38A9) of cannibal larvae could be key hubs for gluconeogenesis and the utilization of amino acids from cannibalized conspecifics. In conclusion, cannibalism in S. frugiperda is essential for larvae to survive starvation, or to successfully colonize new, nutrient-poor, food plants. Further research on cannibalism in may allow the development of novel pest control strategies to control this major, invasive, global pest.

AB  - We determined the combined effects of salinity (10, 15, 20, 25, 27, 30 and 33 psu) and cold storage (4 +/- 1 degrees C) for 5, 14, 90 and 180 days for extending the lifespan of subitaneous eggs of the calanoid copepod Acartia sinjiensis. The hatching success rate of the eggs decreased with an increase in the cold storage period. The average proportion of viable A. sinjiensis eggs after 90 days was >40% except at a salinity of 10 psu. Eggs hatched at different times depending on storage and salinity. Specifically, >55% of the eggs stored for 14 days under the salinities of 25 and 30 psu and >45% of those stored for 90 days with salinities of 30 and 33 psu hatched. However, some eggs stored for 180 days hatched which only occurred at salinity 30 psu. These results can help optimize cold storage conditions to improve the viability of stored copepod eggs.

AB  - Animal manures are suspected to be a major source of nitrate leaching due to their low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by crops. However, actual measurements of nitrate leaching from animal manure under field conditions are scarce. In an on-farm field trial in Switzerland over 2.5 years, we used 15N labelling to trace the fate of N from cattle slurry in the soil-plant system and to test whether more nitrate was leached from slurry than from mineral fertiliser. The experiment was conducted on two neighbouring fields with loamy soil in an agricultural area of the Swiss midlands, where nitrate levels in the groundwater are persistently high. Both fields followed the same crop rotation (silage maize - winter wheat - grass-clover), but shifted by one year. We compared three fertiliser treatments: Control (Con), 15N mineral fertiliser (Min), and 15N cattle slurry (Slu). In order to provide a comprehensive fertiliser N balance over several years, we traced the labelled fertilisers into crop biomass, soil, and leached nitrate. In the year of application, 15N recovery in crops was 45-47% for Min, but only 19-23% for Slu. Complementary to this finding, recoveries in soil were greater for Slu than for Min, despite greater NH3 emissions from Slu. Fertiliser recovery in the succeeding crops was small (< 4.6% of the originally applied fertiliser N in the first residual year and < 2.4% in the second) and similar for both fertilisers. Depth translocation of fertiliser N was marginal, with the majority of 15N in soil still in the top 0.3 m after 2.5 years. Along with higher recoveries in soil for Slu, we found significantly more slurry N than mineral fertiliser N lost through leaching. However, less than 5% of cumulated amounts of nitrate leaching over the three crops, which reached up to 205 kg nitrate-N ha-1, originated from direct leaching of the labelled fertilisers. Our findings suggest that most nitrate leaching originated from the mineralisation of soil N.

AB  - Phase -field modeling is an effective simulation technique for modeling microstructure evolution of elastically anisotropic systems. To introduce the elastic energy contribution in a phase field model, an interpolation scheme is used to define the mechanical properties within the phases and across the continuous interface. Several existing interpolation schemes introduce a potential excess elastic energy at the interface, which undesirable effect on microstructure evolution needs to be evaluated. In this study, we focused on three interpolation schemes including Khachaturyan' scheme (KHS), Voigt-Taylor's scheme (VTS), and Steinbach- Apel's scheme (SAS). Comparisons of these schemes' performances were performed in three configuration types using the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) framework: bi-crystal, isotropic particle-matrix and anisotropic particle-matrix. The contribution of excess elastic energy on the interface energy as a function of interface width and the computational time to steady-state were evaluated in these three configurations. SAS introduces the lowest excess elastic energy contribution and the VTS has the biggest contribution amongst the considered schemes. Moreover, when modeling precipitation in an anisotropic elastic material, the SAS approach seems to predict more physical convex shapes during growth, making it preferable to KHS and VTS. As currently implemented, SAS requires the largest computational time and KHS requires the smallest time to reach steady-state amongst the considered schemes.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical and neurologic emergency that may lead to permanent brain damage, morbidity, or death. Animal models of SE are particularly important to study the pathophysiology of SE and mechanisms of SE resistance to antiseizure medications with the aim to develop new, more effective treatments. In addition to rodents (rats or mice), larger mammalian species such as dogs, pigs, and nonhuman primates are used. This short review describes and discusses the value and limitations of the most frequently used mammalian models of SE. Issues that are discussed include (1) differences between chemical and electrical SE models; (2) the role of genetic background and environment on SE in rodents; (3) the use of rodent models (a) to study the pathophysiology of SE and mechanisms of SE resistance; (b) to study developmental aspects of SE; (c) to study the efficacy of new treatments, including drug combinations, for refractory SE; (d) to study the long-term consequences of SE and identify biomarkers; (e) to develop treatments that prevent or modify epilepsy; (e) to study the pharmacology of spontaneous seizures; (4) the limitations of animal models of induced SE; and (5) the advantages (and limitations) of naturally (spontaneously) occurring SE in epileptic dogs and nonhuman primates. Overall, mammalian models of SE have significantly increased our understanding of the pathophysiology and drug resistance of SE and identified potential targets for new, more effective treatments. This paper was presented at the 9th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures held in April 2024.

AB  - Simple Summary Mitigating environmental footprint is one of the most important pillars for building sustainable livestock production. Evidently, using natural feed additives exploited from agro-food byproducts to optimize feed efficiency and animal performance can bring multiple advantages to the environment. Our study using a life-cycle assessment of a commercial citrus extract feed additive showed that the impacts generated by this additive manufacturing are minor, in comparation to the reduction in environmental issues from pig and broiler chicken productions, thanks to the additive's effects on improving animal growth performances. More precisely, the manufacturing and distribution of a 25 kg bag of citrus extract feed additive potentially emits 13.1 kg of CO2 equivalent; uses 5.3 m2 of land year round; and consumes 66 L of water. Meanwhile, using one bag of 25 kg citrus extract feed additive in feed at a low inclusion rate (250 g per ton of completed feed) can reduce CO2 equivalent emission by 5 and 6 tons and water consumption by 82 m3 and 201 m3 in swine and broiler productions, respectively. In parallel, land surface used is saved by 7000 m2 year round in both mentioned livestock systems. Such results demonstrate the great interest in using citrus extract feed additive as an additional tool for mitigating environmental impacts from livestock farming activities.Abstract The rapid expansion of the livestock production sector to meet the world population's demand is posing a big challenge to environmental sustainability. Plant-based feed additives extracted from agro-food byproducts could potentially result in multiple outcomes: reducing food-processing wastes and improving animal growth performances, hence mitigating environmental impacts of meat production chains. This presented study was carried out to assess the environmental impacts of the use of a commercial citrus extract feed additive (CEFA) in swine and broiler chicken farming. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to assess the impact of manufacturing and distributing one 25 kg bag of CEFA and its use in feed in broiler chicken and swine productions. With regards to CEFA manufacturing and distribution, results showed that most of the impact came from the production of CEFA ingredients, accounting for 70% of the impact generated. The remaining 30% effect was divided between transportation to the customer (25%), CEFA packaging (3%), and CEFA manufacturing and production loss (2%). When enlarging the scope, the use of the CEFA in pigs and broilers' diets was shown to improve the measured environmental indicators, compared to such standard systems. Indeed, CEFA-added feeds have demonstrated enhanced growth performances, hence reducing the required amount of consumed feed to achieve the same level of growth. Consequently, this helped reduce environmental issues from animal feed ingredients' agriculture. To be more specific, the use of one 25 kg bag of CEFA in feed at 250 g per ton of feed led to a reduction of 6 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2 eq) emitted along the life cycle of poultry production and 5 tons in the case of fattening pigs. The inclusion of this CEFA in the diet also led to a reduction in the land use footprint by 0.7 hectares and reductions in water consumption by 201 m3 and 82 m3 for broiler chicken and swine production, respectively. The environmental performance assessment thus showed the interest in using this CEFA in swine and broiler chicken diets to mitigate the environmental impacts.

AB  - The nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOP receptor) has wide expression in the nervous system and is involved in neurotransmitter release. However, the role of the NOPR in depression is not widely recognized. This study aims to evaluate behavioral and biochemical effects of the NOPR agonist Ro 65-6570 in mice submitted to social defeat protocol. The open-field test, social interaction test, and tail suspension test were applied to evaluate depressive behavior in male Swiss mice. Blood and brain tissue samples were obtained to evaluate the oxidative stress. The NOP agonist, Ro 65-6570 (1 mg/kg), or the social defeat stress reduced exploration rate in the open-field test. The social defeat stress and/or the NOP agonist also increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and the grooming time, as well as reduced the social interaction on the last day of social defeat protocol. Seven days after the end of the protocol, only the drug alone was able to affect the animals' interaction. Additionally, the NOP agonist increased the concentration of carbonyl groups (CGs) in hippocampus and malondialdehyde in serum. The stress of social defeat and the NOP agonist, together, increased malondialdehyde in animals' serum and prefrontal cortex, as well as increased the CGs concentration in the prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate a chronic depressive effect induced by the NOPR activation, sometimes regardless of the social defeat stress. We suggest that the NOPR signaling can activate pathways involved in cellular oxidative stress, contributing to the depression pathology.

AB  - Previous investigations have implicated the basolateral amygdala (BLA) epigenetic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of depression. SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylase, widely expresses in BLA. However, epigenetic mechanisms in the BLA under the regulation of SIRT1 in the depression are largely uncharacterized. Under the chronic unpredictable chronic mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, we used adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) that encoded SIRT1-shRNA or SIRT1 to specifically knockdown or overexpress SIRT1 in BLA neurons, respectively. CUMS procedure induced significant depression symptoms including the decreased sucrose preference, the less bodyweight gained, the decreased immobile latency and the increased immobile time both in forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Knockdown of SIRT1 in BLA glutamatergic neurons reversed these depression-like behaviors and restored the synaptic abnormalities. Overexpression of SIRT1 in BLA glutamatergic neurons induced depression-like behaviors in non-stressed control mice. The result of protein expressions and ultrastructural changes were consistent with the behavioral results. Our study suggested that downregulation of SIRT1 in BLA has certain beneficial effect on CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors such as anorexia, anhedonia, hopelessness and despair. In addition, the increased expression of SIRT1 may be the immediate cause of depressive-like symptoms. The abnormal expression of SIRT1 may affect the transcriptional regulation mechanism and signaling protein acetylation, affecting neuroplasticity and ultimately contribute to MDD. In the stress-susceptible mice, these two mechanisms may co-exist, but the specific mechanism needs further research.

AB  - Sperm cryopreservation is the most common procedure used to establish germplasm banks for en-dangered species -but sometimes sperm cells cannot be obtained. In such cases, freezing testicular tissue may be the only option. The testes contains germ cells at different stages of differentiation, including spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa, among which differences in cryoresistance might be expected. The present work compares the viability and DNA integrity of 'rounded' cells, and of elongated spermatids and spermatozoa, from the dog and wild boar, following the cryopreservation of testicular tissue by slow freezing or vitrification. Cell viability was analyzed by PI/SYBR14 staining, and DNA integrity via the TUNEL technique. For wild boar, no significant differences were seen between the two methods with respect to the percentage of viable cells, nor in the percentage of cells with DNA damage. In the dog, the percentage of viable rounded germ cells (65.0 +/- 2.4%) was higher (P < 0.05) after vitrification than after slow freezing (45.1 +/- 6.7%). No difference was found between the two methods in terms of the viability of elongated cells. For rounded cells, the percentage of intact DNA was greater (P < 0.05) after vitrification (90.5 +/- 2.1%) than after slow freezing (42.6 +/- 11.0%), while for elongated spermatids and spermatozoa it was higher (P < 0.05) after slow freezing (66.9 +/- 6.1%) than after vitrification (50.7 +/- 4.5%). Thus, the response to cryopreservation is cell type-, cryopreservation type-, and species-dependent. Vitrification would appear to be the most appropriate method for preserving dog testicular tissue given the associated high cell viability and low degree of DNA fragmentation, while in wild boar, either method might be used.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hybrid pairing of the corresponding silkworm species is a pivotal link in sericulture, ensuring egg quality and directly influencing silk quantity and quality. Considering the potential of image recognition and the impact of varying pupal postures, this study used machine learning and deep learning for global modeling to identify pupae species and sex separately or simultaneously. The performance of traditional feature-based approaches, deep learning feature-based approaches, and their fusion approaches were compared. First, 3600 images of the back, abdomen, and side postures of 5 species of male and female pupae were captured. Next, six traditional descriptors, including the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and six deep learning descriptors, including ConvNeXt-S, were utilized to extract significant species and sex features. Finally, classification models were constructed using the multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine, and random forest. The results indicate that the {HOG + ConvNeXt-S + MLP} model excelled, achieving 99.09% accuracy for separate species and sex recognition and 98.40% for simultaneous recognition, with precision-recall and receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0.984 to 1.0 and 0.996 to 1.0, respectively. In conclusion, it can capture subtle distinctions between pupal species and sexes and shows promise for extensive application in sericulture.

AB  - The reproductive performance of sows largely determines the efficiency of the entire pig farming industry. The purpose of our work is the evaluation of polymorphism of the ryanodine receptor gene and its impact on the reproductive traits of sows of the Welsh breed of pigs. For this study, 148 pigs of the Welsh breed were used. The reproductive traits of sows were evaluated in two adjacent generations. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the reproductive ability of sows using the SIRQS (selection index of reproductive qualities of sows), determined phenotypic consolidation coefficients and assessed the genetic potential of the animals' productivity. The polymorphism of the RYR1 gene was determined using polymerase chain reaction -restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP). Data processing was performed using single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Polymorphism of the ryanodine receptor gene in sows of the Welsh pig breed was evaluated. 8.0% of the animals were identified as carriers of the mutant allele of the RYR1 gene. However, no homozygous RYR1-nn animals were found. Pigs of the maternal generation carrying the homozygous NN genotype had better reproductive performance in all indica-tors. Sows that were carriers of the mutant allele were characterized by lower values of the genetic productivity potential com-pared with the entire estimated population for all productive traits. Sows which were free of the mutant allele of the RYR1 gene were characterized by large values of the SIRQS index. The values of the coefficients of phenotypic consolidation of the number of live born piglets in sows without the mutant allele were lower than in sows with the mutant allele n. Better performance of sows free of the mutant allele of the RYR1 gene was established over sows carrying it in all evaluated traits of reproductive capacity (for different traits P ranged from 0.021 to 1.0*10-4), except for number of piglets born alive per sow in the daughter generation. Sows with the NN genotype had better selection index values by 15.7% in the maternal generation and by 10.2% in the daughter generation. In order to increase the reproductive ability of sows in the studied population of Welsh pigs and achieve similar results in other herds of this breed, animals free from the mutant allele of the RYR1 gene should be selected for further reproduction in the process of breeding, while on the contrary, carriers of this gene should be gradually eliminated from the herd. To carry out breeding work, further research is needed on the entire population of Welsh pigs for the RYR1 gene.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effects of various low-frequency ultrasound-assisted extraction processes, including ultrasound-assisted acid-soaked water bath extraction (UAW), ultrasound-assisted water bath extraction after acid soaking (AUW), acid-soaked water bath extraction followed by ultrasonics (AWU), and acid-soaked water bath extraction without ultrasound (CON), on the structural properties, thermal stability, gel properties, and microstructure of sheep's hoof gelatin. The results revealed that the primary components of sheep's hoof gelatin consisted of alpha 1-chain, alpha 2-chain (100-135 kDa), and beta-chain. In addition, it was observed that among the three sonication groups, sheep's hoof gelatin extracted in the AUW group exhibited the highest yield (27.16 +/- 0.41 %), the best gel strength (378.55 +/- 7.34 g), and higher viscosity at the same shear rate. The gelling temperature (25.38 +/- 0.45 degrees C) and melting temperature (32.28 +/- 0.52 degrees C) of sheep's hoof gelatin in the AUW group were significantly higher than those in the other groups (p > 0.05). Moreover, our experiments revealed that the sequence of low-frequency ultrasonic pretreatment processes was a crucial factor influencing the gel properties and structural characteristics of sheep's hoof gelatin. Specifically, the acid treatment followed by the ultrasound-assisted approach in the AUW group yielded high-quality and high-yield sheep's hoof gelatin.

AB  - Simple Summary For the Iberian pork industry, the authentication of the raw material is of great importance. For this reason, the main object of this study was the classification of Iberian pig carcasses in accordance with the time the animals have spent in the montanera period and the breed. To do this, the potential of Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry techniques was studied. Different sampling methods and mathematical treatments of the data were assayed. The results obtained show high percentages of correct classification both for days in the montanera and according to the breed for both techniques. The advantages for the industry are that none of the selected techniques require any chemical treatment of the sample before analysis and the proposed sampling is easy to use by the operator. It is also not necessary to identify individual compounds. This leads to the conclusion that both technologies are fast and useful for the authentication of raw material. The potential of two complementary analytical techniques (near infrared spectroscopy, NIRS and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry, GC-IMS) was used to establish the time that Iberian pigs have been fed on acorns and pasture and to verify their genetic purity. For both techniques it was neither necessary to carry out any chemical treatment in advance nor to identify individual compounds. The results showed that both the NIR spectrum and the spectral fingerprint obtained by GC-IMS were affected by the time that the Iberian pig feeds on natural resources. High percentages of correct classification were achieved in the calibration for both techniques: >98% for the days of montanera and >96% for the breed by NIRS and >99% for the days of montanera and >98% for the breed by GC-IMS. The results obtained showed that NIR spectra taken from intact samples is a quick classification method according to the time of montanera and breed.

AB  - Fetal growth restriction (FGR) caused by placental insufficiency is a major contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is currently no in utero treatment for placental insufficiency or FGR. The placenta serves as the vital communication, supply, exchange, and defense organ for the developing fetus and offers an excellent opportunity for therapeutic interventions. Here we show efficacy of repeated treatments of trophoblast-specific human insulin-like 1 growth factor (IGF1) gene therapy delivered in a non-viral, polymer nanoparticle to the placenta for the treatment of FGR. Using a guinea pig maternal nutrient restriction model (70% food intake) of FGR, nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment was delivered to the placenta via ultrasound guidance across the second half of pregnancy, after establishment of FGR. This treatment resulted in correction of fetal weight in MNR + IGF1 animals compared to sham treated controls on an ad libitum diet, increased fetal blood glucose and decreased fetal blood cortisol levels compared to sham treated MNR, and showed no negative maternal side-effects. Overall, we show a therapy capable of positively impacting the entire pregnancy environment: maternal, placental, and fetal. This combined with our previous studies using this therapy at mid pregnancy in the guinea pig and in two different mouse model and three different human in vitro/ex vivo models, demonstrate the plausibility of this therapy for future human translation. Our overall goal is to improve health outcomes of neonates and decrease numerous morbidities associated with the developmental origins of disease.

AB  - Population monitoring provides information on species conservation status. We reassess the status of the southern elephant seal population at Macquarie Island. The number of cows on the isthmus, similar to 20% of the total population, correlated with counts for the whole island (i.e. they reliably indicate island-wide trends). Cow numbers within the isthmus decreased from similar to 9400 in 1949 to similar to 2550 in 2023 at -1.1% year(-1), similar to the -0.8% year(-1) from 1984 to 2023 when counts were made annually (before 1984, counts were less systematic). This contrasts with all other southern elephant seal populations, which are either stable or increasing. There was also considerable year to year variability (+/- 350 cows year(-1)) in the numbers of cows ashore, indicating individuals skipping breeding. Counting errors may contribute to this variability but are unlikely given that the isthmus study area harems are small, typically < 200 cows. We found no link between cow numbers and summer ocean conditions using the Southern Annular Mode as a proxy (i.e. prior to blastocyst implantation), and it remains unclear what is causing this variation. Nonetheless, several other studies have suggested changing prey conditions during the winter are the most likely cause of this overall and ongoing decrease.

AB  - The hippocampus, an extension of the temporal part of the cerebral cortex, plays a crucial role in learning and memory. Structural and functional complexity within the hippocampus is greatly affected by a variety of external environmental stimuli including alteration in the light-dark (LD) cycle. The effect of altered LD cycle in learning and memory associated cognitive impairment has been reported in rodents. However, a comparative study of underlying neuronal changes between nocturnal and diurnal species is not well explored. The objective of the present study was to explore the morphological changes in hippocampal CA1 and DG neurons in response to prolonged constant condition viz. constant light (LL) and constant darkness (DD) in diurnal squirrels and nocturnal mice. Animals (n = 5/group) were placed in chronocubicle under 12:12 h LD, LL and DD. After four weeks, brain tissues were collected and processed for Golgi-Cox staining to analyze morphological changes in CA1 and DG neurons. The total and basal dendritic length, basal dendrite number, branch end, the diameter of apical dendrite and spine density were analyzed. The results showed a significant reduction in structural complexity of CA1 and DG neurons of squirrels exposed to prolonged constant darkness, whereas mice showed a significant increase as compared to LD. However, a significantly reduced neuronal complexity was observed in both squirrels and mice exposed to prolonged constant light. The results obtained were further confirmed by Sholl analysis of CA1 and DG neurons. The present study suggests that prolonged constant light may cause adverse effects on the neuronal complexity of both diurnal and nocturnal animals, but constant darkness may cause adverse effects mainly to the diurnal animals.

AB  - TRISO fuel particles are candidates for use in next generation reactors including gas reactors, fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactors, and micro-reactors. The UCO fuel kernel consists of a uranium dioxide (UO2) and uranium carbide mixture. The addition of UC2 helps suppress the formation of carbon monoxide gas, which led to failures during initial TRISO development. The addition of uranium carbide alters the chemistry of the UO2 kernel, which is known to influence performance parameters such as fission gas diffusivity, although the impact has not been quantified and no models exist that take the change in chemistry into account. Therefore, better understanding and more accurate models of the impact of chemistry on fuel performance are of high priority. In this paper, a first-principles density functional the-ory (DFT) and empirical potential based multi-scale study has been carried out to model the diffusivity of fission gas xenon (Xe) in UCO TRISO fuel kernels. The focus is on the UO2 component in the UCO fuel kernels, as that represents the largest volume fraction of the fuel kernels. The study relies on DFT and empirical potential calculations to determine Xe and point defect properties, which are then used in ther-modynamic and kinetic models to predict diffusion for intrinsic conditions. In addition, the information is utilized in cluster dynamics simulations using the Centipede code to estimate the impact of irradiation on defect transport. The presence of UC2 or UC2-x in the UCO fuel kernels is shown to have a substantial impact on the UO2 non-stoichiometry by inducing oxygen vacancies and driving UO2 sub-stoichiometric, which causes much slower Xe diffusion in UCO compared to light water reactor UO2 fuel. The application of this model in fuel performance simulations using the Bison code is also demonstrated. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animal biologists have recently focused on individual variation in behavioral traits and have found that individuals of many species have personalities. These are defined as consistent intraspecific differences in behaviors that are repeatable across different situations and stable over time. When animals sense danger, some individuals will alert neighbors with alarm calls and both calling and responding vary consistently among individuals. Plants, including sagebrush, emit volatile cues when they are attacked by herbivores and neighbors perceive these cues and reduce their own damage. We experimentally transferred volatiles between pairs of sagebrush plants to evaluate whether individuals showed consistent variation in their effectiveness as emitters and as receivers of cues, measured in terms of reduced herbivore damage. We found that 64% of the variance in chewing damage to branches over the growing season was attributable to the identity of the individual receiving the cues. This variation could have been caused by inherent differences in the plants as well as by differences in the environments where they grew and their histories. We found that 5% of the variance in chewing damage was attributable to the identity of the emitter that provided the cue. This fraction of variation was statistically significant and could not be attributed to the environmental conditions of the receiver. Effective receivers were also relatively effective emitters, indicating consistency across different situations. Pairs of receivers and emitters that were effective communicators in 2018 were again relatively effective in 2019, indicating consistency over time. These results suggest that plants have repeatable individual personalities with respect to alarm calls.

AB  - Laticifers are hypothesized to mediate both plant-herbivore and plant-microbe interactions. However, there is little evidence for this dual function. We investigated whether the major constituent of natural rubber, cis-1,4-polyisoprene, a phylogenetically widespread and economically important latex polymer, alters plant resistance and the root microbiome of the Russian dandelion (Taraxacum koksaghyz) under attack of a root herbivore, the larva of the May cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha). Rubber-depleted transgenic plants lost more shoot and root biomass upon herbivory than normal rubber content near-isogenic lines. Melolontha melolontha preferred to feed on artificial diet supplemented with rubber-depleted rather than normal rubber content latex. Likewise, adding purified cis-1,4-polyisoprene in ecologically relevant concentrations to diet deterred larval feeding and reduced larval weight gain. Metagenomics and metabarcoding revealed that abolishing biosynthesis of natural rubber alters the structure but not the diversity of the rhizosphere and root microbiota (ecto- and endophytes) and that these changes depended on M. melolontha damage. However, the assumption that rubber reduces microbial colonization or pathogen load is contradicted by four lines of evidence. Taken together, our data demonstrate that natural rubber biosynthesis reduces herbivory and alters the plant microbiota, which highlights the role of plant-specialized metabolites and secretory structures in shaping multitrophic interactions.

AB  - Excessive use of pesticides has raised great concern on food safety as well as crop quality in the form of pesticide residues. Plants have natural defense mechanisms against pesticides for its alleviation. This study investigated distribution of tolfenpyrad as well as physiological, metabolomic, transcriptomic and hormonal responses of tea plants to tolfenpyrad application. Results show that tolfenpyrad tends to accumulate in tea leaves, with limited translocation to stems and roots after foliar application. While no significant change in plant biomass or growth status was apparent following tolfenpyrad application, it triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant system impacts. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal disrupted purine metabolism and nitrogen metabolism, mainly in amino acid pathways, with a glutathione (GSH) detoxification response. Hormonal and targeted metabolic profiling confirms a significant elevation in melatonin biosynthesis, then exogenous application of melatonin is proved to efficiently reduce pesticide residue in tea plants. This study improved our understanding of the tea plants' defense mechanism to pesticide, and suggested an emerging plant-derived regulator for improving quality and safety of tea products.

AB  - Puerto Rico is an active mango (Mangifera indica L.; Anacardiaceae) producer, with an annual market value of $25 million and a production volume of 19 million kilograms. Phidotricha erigens Ragonot (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae: Epipaschiinae) larvae adversely affect the reproductive organs of various fruit trees, but little is known about their specific impact on mango inflorescences. This study was conducted during summer 2024, on a commercial mango farm in Juana D & iacute;az, Puerto Rico, to assess the extent of damage caused by P. erigens on mango inflorescences through a no-choice semi-field experiment. Exposure to adult moths statistically increased infestation levels, contributed to lower flower weights, and fewer pea-stage mangoes per panicle compared to unexposed flowers. A higher number of pedicels significantly predicted greater progeny, with significantly more pupae and fifth instars than first instars found in flowers bearing more pedicels. These findings highlight the potential of this pest to adversely affect mango yields by compromising floral development. Given the year-round vulnerability of mango inflorescences, this study underscores the need for early pest management strategies to mitigate yield losses in mango agriculture, particularly through timely intervention during the flowering stage.

Este estudio se llev & oacute; a cabo en el verano de 2024 en una finca comercial de mangos en Juana D & iacute;az, Puerto Rico, para evaluar el grado de da & ntilde;o causado por P. erigens en las inflorescencias del mango a trav & eacute;s de un experimento semi-campo de no-elecci & oacute;n. La exposici & oacute;n a polillas adultas aument & oacute; significativamente los niveles de infestaci & oacute;n, contribuy & oacute; a un menor peso de las flores y a una menor cantidad de mangos en estado de ch & iacute;charo por panoja en comparaci & oacute;n con flores no expuestas. Un mayor n & uacute;mero de pedicelos predijo significativamente una mayor producci & oacute;n de progenie, con una cantidad significativamente mayor de pupas y larvas de quinto estadio que de primer estadio en flores con m & aacute;s pedicelos. Estos hallazgos destacan el potencial de esta plaga para afectar negativamente los rendimientos del mango al comprometer el desarrollo floral. Dada la vulnerabilidad continua de las inflorescencias del mango a lo largo del a & ntilde;o, este estudio subraya la necesidad de estrategias de manejo temprano de plagas para mitigar las p & eacute;rdidas de rendimiento en la agricultura de mango, especialmente mediante la intervenci & oacute;n oportuna durante la etapa de floraci & oacute;n.

AB  - In animal production, a large part of financial resources is destined to animal feed, so the use of low-cost diets with maximum production efficiency is crucial. The present study evaluated the effects of a high-grain diet and the use of residual frying oil on the productive performance and carcass characteristics of lambs. Fifteen lambs were distributed into three groups in a completely randomized design in which they were fed a control diet, a high-grain diet, or a diet with the inclusion of residual frying oil, for 40 days. There was no difference (P > 0.05) between the control and frying-oil diets regarding the daily intakes of dry matter, crude protein, mineral matter, neutral detergent fiber, or total carbohydrates. The high-grain diet reduced the intake of dry matter and nutrients, negatively affecting weight gain. The highest means for final weight, total weight, and daily weight gain were obtained with the control diet and the diet containing residual oil, which did not differ from each other (P> 0.05). Slaughter weight and hot and cold carcass weights decreased with the high-grain diet. There was an effect (P < 0.05) of frying oil inclusion on the carcass characteristics of the lambs. The diets did not affect (P > 0.05) carcass yields. The animals on the high-grain diet showed unsatisfactory production performance, with impaired carcass characteristics. The inclusion of frying oil led to greater weight gain as well as more attractive carcass characteristics, making it the most viable alternative in this research.

AB  - Simple Summary Lambs are routinely castrated and/or tail docked. Local anesthesia could improve lamb welfare, but data on the duration of effect of local anesthetics are not available. This study evaluated the efficacy of lidocaine, procaine, or bupivacaine in terms of the behavioral response to castration and/or tail docking. The benefits of local anesthetics were modest. The effects of procaine appear to last longer than lidocaine, while bupivacaine is slower to take effect but may provide longer-lasting pain relief. The duration of action of local anesthetics is limited in sheep, and detailed behavioral evaluations are required in the first hour post-procedure to observe efficacy. The use of local anesthesia at the time of ring castration and tail docking can improve lamb welfare. However, few local anesthetics are registered for sheep, and data on their duration of effect is limited. Three studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of procaine (P), lidocaine (L), and bupivacaine (B) in terms of observed alleviation of behavioral responses to castration and/or tail docking in 10-min blocks in the first 60 min post-treatment. In each study, comparisons were made between two groups of lambs castrated and/or tail docked with rubber rings and either receiving the agent using the NUMNUTS(R) instrument (N) or receiving no anesthetic agent (RR). Acute pain behavior was lower in NL (n = 28) than RRL (n = 15) males in the first 10 min post-procedure (p < 0.05); lower in NB (n = 16) than RRB (n = 16) males in periods 10-20 min (0.05 < p < 0.01), 20-30 min (p < 0.05) and 40-50 min (0.05 < p < 0.01); lower in NB (n = 16) than RRB (n = 16) females between 20 and 40 min post-procedure (0.05 < p < 0.01); lower in NP (n = 8) than RRP (n = 7) males in period 10-20 min (0.05 < p < 0.01), and lower in NP (n = 9) than RRP (n = 9) females in periods 0-10 min (0.05 < p < 0.01), and 10-40 min (p < 0.05). Benefits were modest, and the effects of procaine appear to last longer than lidocaine, while bupivacaine is slower to take effect than either procaine or lidocaine but may provide longer-lasting pain relief. The duration of action of local anesthetics is short in sheep, and detailed behavioral evaluations are required in the first hour post-procedure to establish efficacy.

AB  - Mastitis is one of the most frequent clinical diseases in dairy animals. Epithelial cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promote the process of mastitis. Oestrogen deficiency is disadvantaged of many tissue inflammation and regeneration, while exogenous oestrogen treatment can reverse these effects. G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) is a membrane estrogen receptor. However, the potential effects of oestrogen via GPER1 on EMT in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) are still unclear. Here, this study discovered that the activation of GPER1 by oestrogen could inhibit the EMT in GMECs via NF-kappa B signalling pathway. The activation of GPER1 by oestrogen inhibited the EMT accompanied by upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of N-cadherin and vimentin. Meanwhile, mRNA expression of transcription factors including Snail1 and ZEB1 was decreased. Further, like to oestrogen, GPER1 agonist G1 repressed the EMT progression. Conversely, GPER1 antagonist G15 reversed all these features induced by oestrogen. What's more, GPER1 silencing with shRNA promoted GMECs undergoing EMT. Additionally, oestrogen increased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, which then decreased the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, inhibiting the NF-kappa B signalling pathway activity. Taken, GPER1 may act as a suppressor through the regulation of EMT to prevent the development of mastitis.

AB  - Deltamethrin (DM) is a highly effective and widely used pyrethroid pesticide. It is an environmental factor affecting public and occupational health and exerts direct toxic effects on the central nervous system. As the major target organs for neurotoxicity of DM, the hippocampus and the cerebellum are critical to the learning and motor function. Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups and gavaged at doses of 0, 1, 4or 10 mg/kg/d DM from gestational day (GD) 0 to postnatal day (PN) 21. The PC12 cells were selected to further verify the regulatory mechanisms of DM on the neurodevelopmental injury. We found that maternal exposure to DM caused learning, memory and motor dysfunction in male offspring. Maternal exposure to DM induced the decrease in the density of hippocampal dendritic spines in male offspring through the reduced expression of M1 mAchRs, which in turn reduced the mediated AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, contributing to the inhibition of dynamic changes of GluA1. Meanwhile, DM exposure inhibited the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway, thereby reducing phosphorylation of stathmin and impairing cerebellar purkinje cell dendrite growth and development. Taken together, maternal exposure to DM during pregnancy and lactation could impair neurodevelopment of male offspring.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus accessory gene regulatory Quorum Sensing (QS) system facilitates biofilm formation and biofilms are major contributors for antimicrobial resistance. Quorum quenchers could be used as an adjunct to antibiotics to reduce the development of drug resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sub-inhibitory concentration of ethanolic extracts of Mango Seed Kernel Extract (MSKE), Guava Leaf Extract (GLE) and epsilon-Polylysine (epsilon-PL) against quorum sensing mediated virulence factors of S. aureus.
   We evaluated the antibacterial and Quorum Quenching (QQ) activity of these compounds on 10 MRSA and 10 MSSA isolates. The antibacterial activity was tested by disc diffusion assay. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) for MRSA isolates were: 20 mu g/mL for epsilon-Polylysine, 20 mu g/mL for MSKE extract and GLE and for MSSA isolates were: 12.5 mu g/mL for epsilon-Polylysine, 20 mu g/mL for MSKE extract and GLE. Quorum Sensing Inhibition (QSI) activity was determined at sub-MIC of 10 mu g/mL of all the compounds by studying inhibition of the delta hemolysin on sheep blood agar plate and motility on soft agar media. All these compounds affected the motility and expression of delta-hemolysin activity which confirms that these compounds interfere with the QS activity. The QQ effect was confirmed by quantitation of hld (delta hemolysin) transcript and rnaIII transcript by qPCR. The results of this study will be presented as proof of QQ activity by epsilon-PL, MSKE, and GLE on S. aureus in general and MRSA in particular, as an attractive proposition for adjunct therapy and anti-virulence therapy of MRSA infections.

AB  - Simple Summary Environmental enrichment using music therapy can be used to improve animal welfare. Music, as an enrichment of the environment, is presented as an easy and viable way to remove the sterility of the breeding environment and make it more interesting and attractive. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of auditory environmental enrichment in the pre- and postpartum period of sows on the behavior, performance, and neuro-plasticity of their piglets. Exposure to music in the last 1/3 of pregnancy and farrowing/lactation improved the weight of piglets at birth and weaning. Musical enrichment during pregnancy and lactation was able to cause changes in the piglets' neuroplasticity and improve their productive performances. The rearing environment of pigs can cause a high level of stress due to the lack of stimuli and the impossibility of carrying out natural behaviors. Music therapy is a way to enrich the environment and promote stress relief. Few studies in swine using environmental enrichers focus on functional benefits, such as stress resilience, improved biological functions, or mental status. The effect of environmental enrichment on neurobiological processes is particularly poorly understood in farm animals. Thus, our study sought to elucidate the influence of music in piglets exposed to music therapy in the intrauterine and extrauterine phase on neuroplasticity, evaluating the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Behavioural responses were also evaluated using fear tests related to stress resilience. The productive performance of these piglets was analysed to relate the possible reduction in stress levels to greater productivity gains. Forty-eight sows were used at 90 days of gestation until the weaning of their piglets. In the gestation phase, the sows were divided into two treatments: control (without music therapy) and music (with music therapy). In the farrowing/lactation phase, the sows were separated into four treatments: control-control (no music in any phase); control-music (music only in farrowing/lactation); music-control (music only during pregnancy); and music-music (music in both reproductive phases). Music therapy did not cause a difference in the BDNF levels of piglets at birth. However, piglets born from sows of the music-music treatment did not show a reduction in BDNF between birth and weaning, unlike the other treatments. Exposure to music in the last 1/3 of pregnancy and farrowing/lactation improved the weight of piglets at birth and at weaning. Musical enrichment during pregnancy and lactation was able to cause changes in the piglets' neuroplasticity and improve their productive performances.

AB  - Although sows do not directly enter the market, they play an important role in piglet breeding on farms. They consume large amounts of feed, resulting in a significant environmental burden. Pig farms can increase their income and reduce environmental pollution by increasing the litter size (LS) of swine. PCR-RFLP/SSCP and GWAS are common methods to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes. We conducted a systematic meta-analysis of the effect of SNPs on pig LS. We collected and analysed data published over the past 30 years using traditional and network meta-analyses. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to analyse population data. Gene set enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis were used to analyse the GWAS dataset. The results showed that the candidate genes were positively correlated with LS, and defects in PCR-RFLP/SSCP affected the reliability of candidate gene results. However, the genotypes with high and low LSs did not have a significant advantage. Current breeding and management practices for sows should consider increasing the LS while reducing lactation length and minimizing the sows' non-pregnancy period as much as possible.

AB  - This study focused on the physicochemical characteristics of the fermented products (FP) produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CU33 (CU33) from soybean meal with 70% moisture. Additionally, it investigated the effects of adding FP to starter on the growth performance, general health performance, blood clinical biochemistry, and immunity of Alpine goat kids during the weaning period. Forty 14-day-old male Alpine goat kids were randomly assigned into starter supplementations of 0, 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5% CU33 FP for 8 weeks, and each goat kid was individually raised in stainless steel cage (width 70 cm x height 70 cm x depth 80 cm). The moisture after fermentation was linearly decreased as fermentation time increased (p < 0.05), and the pH value and Bacillus-like counts reached the highest at 24 h of fermentation. The activity of neutral protease and alkaline protease, the content of surfactin and gamma-PGA, the viscosity, and the odor of CU33 FP were linearly increased as fermentation time increased (p < 0.05). The neutral protease activity, surfactin, gamma-PGA, and viscosity increased after drying, whereas the moisture, pH value, Bacillus-like counts, and odor decreased (p < 0.05). During the pre-weaning period (0-4 weeks), the body weight gain (BWG) of the 0.1% CU33 FP group was higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05), and all CU33 FP groups showed a better feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the control group (p < 0.05). During the post-weaning period (4-8 weeks) and throughout the entire experimental period (0-8 weeks), the BWG and FCR of all CU33 FP groups were better than those of the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, both BWG and FCR improved linearly as the dietary level of CU33 FP increased (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, the fecal consistency index at 0-4 and 4-8 weeks and the coliform counts in the rectum at 4 weeks linearly decreased (p < 0.05), and the Bacillus-like counts in the rectum linearly increased at 4 and 8 weeks (p < 0.05). Phosphorous (P), total protein (TP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in serum at 8 weeks, and the oxidative burst capacity at 4 weeks linearly increased as the dietary level of CU33 FP increased, but the skin sensitization test showed a quadratic curve, and the 0.1% CU33 FP group had the lowest performance (p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 0.1% of CU33 FP can improve the growth performance, diarrhea status, and oxidative burst capacity of Alpine goat kids, showing the potential to be a feed additive.

AB  - In the EU28, the meat and dairy supply chains emitted 360 Mt CO2-eq or 80% of all agricultural CH4 and N2O emissions in 2016, which must be reduced to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Our research explores how far these emissions can be reduced by combining field tested mitigation measures for beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, sheep, and synthetic fertilizers. Many mitigation measures targeting enteric fermentation, manure management, and fertilizer application have been experimentally tested; however, the impact of combining measures is relatively unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, we use graph theory to create combinations of measures for which we calculate the overall mitigation potential. From previous review studies, we identified 44 measures and formulated rules on impossible and mandatory combinations of measures. Based on the resulting sets of feasible cliques in the graphs and a simplified technological baseline, we estimate that the combinations with the highest reductions reduce CH4 and N2O emissions from beef cattle by 57%, dairy cattle by 47%, swine by 70%, sheep by 48%, and synthetic fertilizers by 44%. Together, they can reduce CH4 and N2O emissions in the EU28 from meat and dairy production by 54%, and for agriculture overall by 42%. This indicates that implementing more measures in the meat and dairy sectors can create room for further reduction than in the existing modelled pathways for the EU28. However, technical measures are incapable of fully eliminating agricultural CH4 and N2O, so there remains a need for CO2 removal technologies. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dietary bitter compounds such as caffeine have the potential to reduce backfat in pigs. However, the use of caffeine as a feed additive has restrictions in many countries. It was hypothesised that grape seed and gentian plant extracts (GG) could replace caffeine in feed due to their bitterness and antiadipogenic effects. The effect of caffeine (0.5 g/kg), GG (2 g/kg) alone or in combination with caffeine (BM) at increasing concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 g/kg) on feed efficiency, carcass, and meat quality was assessed in finishing pigs (Large White x Landrace). Growth performance and carcass traits were evaluated at a pen level (n = 14). Loins (longissimus thoracis) were removed from eight pig/treatment at the abattoir to assess drip loss, lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*), chroma (C*), hue angle (h degrees), pH, cook loss, and shear force. A linear increase (p < 0.05) in loin a*, b*, and C* values and a linear decrease (p < 0.05) in ADFI, ADG, backfat, dressing percentage, and HSCW were observed with increasing BM levels. At 1.5 g/kg, BM increased the loins a* (p < 0.05), b* (p < 0.05) and C* values (p < 0.05) compared to the control. Twenty-two proteins related to energy metabolism and myofibril assembly were identified to be upregulated (FDR < 0.05) in BM vs. control loins. In conclusion, GG could be used in combination with low doses of caffeine to modulate appetite and carcass leanness and improve pork colour.

AB  - Curvilinear building forms are increasingly common in modern architecture, yet their impact on wind dynamics remains understudied. This research examines the wind flow behavior around high-rise residential building rows configured with convex and concave curvilinear shapes, focusing on the influence of varying central angles. Using parametric models generated in Rhino's Grasshopper, followed by experimentally validated CFD simulations, we analyze the aerodynamic effects of these configurations. The findings indicate contrasting impacts: convex curvilinear rows amplify wind flow as their central angles increase, while concave rows hinder airflow under similar conditions. These variations are linked to changes in the windward projective areas. This study enhances the understanding of wind behavior in urban settings and provides key insights for optimizing natural ventilation and designing sustainable curvilinear building clusters.

AB  - Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors are ubiquitous in plants. They have been proposed to be a part of a defense mechanism against herbivores. Trypsin inhibitors also have potential applications in the biotechnology industry, such as in mammalian cell culture. We discovered that durian (Durio zibethinus) seed contains Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors as identified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. Eleven new trypsin inhibitors were cloned. The D. zibethinus trypsin inhibitors (DzTIs) that are likely expressed in the seed were produced as recombinant proteins and tested for trypsin inhibitory activity. Their inhibitory activity and crystal structures are similar to the soybean trypsin inhibitor. Surprisingly, a crystal structure of the complex between DzTI-4, the DzTI with the lowest inhibitory constant, and bovine trypsin revealed that DzTI-4 utilized a novel tryptophan-containing beta 1-beta 2 loop to bind trypsin. Site-direct mutagenesis confirmed the inhibitory role of this loop. DzTI-4 was not toxic to the HEK293 cells and could be used in place of the soybean trypsin inhibitor for culturing the cells under serum-free conditions. DzTI-4 was not toxic to mealworms. However, a mixture of DzTIs extracted from durian seed prevented weight gain in mealworms, suggesting that multiple trypsin inhibitors are required to achieve the antinutritional effect. This study highlights the biochemical diversity of the inhibitory mechanism of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors and provides clues for further application of these inhibitors.

AB  - Contemporary conservation visions stress the need to expand land for biodiversity protection globally, despite many critiques saying that this often leads to human dispossession from land and resources. Recent global goals focus on '30 x 30': extending conservation spaces to 30% of the globe by 2030, rendering the question of how to deal with the many people that inevitably live on these lands acute. While not solely reliant on protected areas, this approach incorporates various land types to meet this target, potentially including restrictions on its use. In India, acquiring land for elephant corridors is one example of extending conservation spaces into surrounding agrarian landscapes. This research investigates such a case in South India where farmers whose lands are identified for acquisition already struggle with challenges in the agrarian landscape, including neglect of agriculture by the state, rising financial debt, uncertain and changing weather patterns. Land use restrictions around protected areas, along with lack of compensation for wildlife-induced crop losses, have increased livelihood pressures, forcing farmers to diversify their income sources. Building on the conservation and agrarian literature, this article posits the concept of the 'Conservation-Agrarian Squeeze' (CAS) to make sense of the dual forces acting on farmers. This concept describes cases where land enclosure for conservation beyond PAs is facilitated by distress in agrarian landscapes. It also engages with and builds on existing terms such as the grab, induced volition, rendering surplus, and expulsion.

AB  - Human exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) has been associated with a range of toxicological effects involving the central nervous system (CNS) such as alterations in learning and memory. Nevertheless, the effects of aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), the main metabolite of glyphosate, remain essentially obscure. Previous preclinical reports suggest that acute intoxication with AMPA and glyphosate exerts decrease on hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity and produces more metabolomic alterations in the female brain over the male one. Therefore, this work explored the effects of acute AMPA and glyphosate on spatial learning, memory and navigation in female rats. Sprague Dawley rats received a single injection (i.p.) of: (i) vehicle; (ii) 10 or 100 mg/kg of AMPA; or (iii) 10 or 100 mg/kg of glyphosate; subsequently, the Barnes maze paradigm was performance. Animals from the control group decreased latency and the attempts to solve the Barnes maze; and increased the degree of orientation when compared first training sessions (S1) vs. the last one (S4; p < 0.05). In contrast, both 10 and 100 mg/kg of glyphosate and 100 mg/kg of AMPA prevented the decrease in latency and attempts; and the increase of orientation (p > 0.05; S1 vs. S4). Both treatments decreased the use of the spatial navigation strategy (p < 0.05). Besides, glyphosate at the higher dose but not AMPA impaired the spatial memory during the test. Our findings suggest that acute exposure to glyphosate and AMPA similarly affected spatial orientation, navigations, learning and/or memory.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) as a momentous signal molecule participates in plant reproductive development and responds to various abiotic stresses. Here, the inhibitory effects of the NO-dominated signal network on the pollen tube growth of Camellia sinensis under low temperature (LT) were studied by microRNA (miRNA) omics analysis. The results showed that 77 and 71 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were induced by LT and NO treatment, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that DEM target genes related to microtubules and actin were enriched uniquely under LT treatment, while DEM target genes related to redox process were enriched uniquely under NO treatment. In addition, the target genes of miRNA co-regulated by LT and NO are only located on the cell membrane and cell wall, and most of them are enriched in metal ion binding and/or transport and cell wall organization. Furthermore, DEM and its target genes related to metal ion binding/transport, redox process, actin, cell wall organization and carbohydrate metabolism were identified and quantified by functional analysis and qRT-PCR. In conclusion, miRNA omics analysis provides a complex signal network regulated by NO-mediated miRNA, which changes cell structure and component distribution by adjusting Ca2+ gradient, thus affecting the polar growth of the C. sinensis pollen tube tip under LT.

AB  - The corpus luteum is primarily responsible for the production and secretion of progesterone. Melatonin has been established to regulate autophagy and induce progesterone secretion in luteal cell. However, whether melatonin affects progesterone secretion by interfering with autophagy is yet to be reported. In the present study, the expression levels of melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2), autophagy-related protein Beclin1 (Bec1), microtubuleassociated protein light chain 3 B (LC3B), progesterone and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1) were analyzed in the corpus luteum of sheep at different stages (early, middle, and late); specifically, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunohistochemical staining, and western blotting were utilized for this expression analysis. In addition, to determine whether melatonin regulated progesterone secretion via the regulation of autophagy, luteal cells were cultured before being exposed to different concentrations of melatonin (0.01-100 nM) and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (50 mu M). Next, luteal cells were treated with the melatonin receptor inhibitors 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin (1 mu M) and luzindole (1 mu M) before detecting Bec1, LC3B2, AMPK/mTOR, and progesterone secretion levels to ascertain whether the effect of melatonin on autophagy and progesterone secretion is mediated by its corresponding receptors in luteal cells. Finally, to determine the significance of the AMPK/mTOR pathway in this process, an AMPK inhibitor, Compound C (10 mu M), was added to luteal cells. Overall, the highest expression of melatonin receptors, autophagy and progesterone secretion was observed in the middle-phase corpus luteum; additionally, melatonin promoted autophagy, at least partially, through its receptor-mediated AMPK/mTOR pathway, which thereby promoting progesterone secretion in luteal cells in vitro. Ultimately, this study is the first to clarify the important role of autophagy in the melatonin-mediated regulation of progesterone secretion in the corpus luteum of sheep; it also lays a foundation for further exploration into the role of melatonin in regulating sheep's ovarian function.

AB  - Neurotrophins constitute a group of growth factor that exerts important functions in the nervous system of vertebrates. They act through two classes of transmembrane receptors: tyrosine-kinase receptors and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)). The activation of p75(NTR) can favor cell survival or apoptosis depending on diverse factors. Several studies evidenced a link between p75(NTR) and the pathogenesis of prion diseases. In this study, we investigated the distribution of several neurotrophins and their receptors, including p75(NTR), in the brain of naturally scrapie-affected sheep and experimentally infected ovinized transgenic mice and its correlation with other markers of prion disease. No evident changes in infected mice or sheep were observed regarding neurotrophins and their receptors except for the immunohistochemistry against p75(NTR). Infected mice showed higher abundance of p75(NTR) immunostained cells than their non-infected counterparts. The astrocytic labeling correlated with other neuropathological alterations of prion disease. Confocal microscopy demonstrated the co-localization of p75(NTR) and the astrocytic marker GFAP, suggesting an involvement of astrocytes in p75(NTR)-mediated neurodegeneration. In contrast, p75(NTR) staining in sheep lacked astrocytic labeling. However, digital image analyses revealed increased labeling intensities in preclinical sheep compared with non-infected and terminal sheep in several brain nuclei. This suggests that this receptor is overexpressed in early stages of prion-related neurodegeneration in sheep.

TI  - Calreticulin Identified as One of the Androgen Response Genes That Trigger Full Regeneration of the Only Capable Mammalian Organ, the Deer Antler

AB  - Deer antlers are male secondary sexual characters that develop to become bone; they are unique appendages that, once lost, can fully regenerate from the permanent bony protuberances or pedicles. Pedicle periosteum (PP) is the tissue that gives rise to the regenerating antlers with three differentiation stages, namely, dormant (DoPP), potentiated (PoPP), and activated (AcPP). Thus far, the transition from the PoPP to the AcPP has not been studied. Our results showed that the AcPP cells maintained their original stem cell features by expressing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers CD73, CD90, and CD105, although they had entered the proliferation mode. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the AcPP compared with those of the PoPP were mainly involved in protein processing, cell cycle, and calcium signaling pathways. Calreticulin (CALR), an androgen response gene, was significantly differentially upregulated in the AcPP cells, and its expression level was negatively regulated by androgens, in contrast to the currently known model systems where all regulation is positive. The downregulation of CALR expression in the AcPP cells in vitro inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell cycle progression at G1-S transition. Therefore, CALR is likely a downstream mediator of androgen hormones for triggering initiation of antler regeneration. We believe that the identification of CALR has not only discovered "one critical piece" of the "jigsaw puzzle" in the initiation of antler regeneration but also helps in revealing the mechanism underlying this unique mammalian epimorphic regeneration and has also opened a new avenue for the study of the nature of CALR regulation by androgen (putative binding partners), thus facilitating the identification of potential molecule(s) for investigation as targets for clinical evaluation.

AB  - Hemoglobin (Hb) is an important oxygen carrying protein inherent in erythrocytes facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide from body tissues. Bioengineered synthetic erythrocytes with enhanced Hb proteins have been developed as efficient blood transfusion substitutes to supply oxygen to patients in extreme situations. This has driven research towards the molecular characterization and structural elucidation of Hb in organisms thriving in extreme conditions. Camel is recognized as a typical organism to investigate molecular level adaptations to surpass extreme ecological conditions in the arid zone. The molecular architecture of Hb is linked to the oxygen requirements of an organism to sustain at extreme living conditions. Molecular structure of camel Hb can be determined by X-ray crystallography. In this study, camel Hb is purified and crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21 with cell dimensions of a = 52.75 & Aring;, b = 116.78 & Aring;, c = 52.80 & Aring; and beta = 120.07 & Aring;. The crystal packing parameters reveal that a whole biological molecule is present in the asymmetric unit with the final R-factor and Rfree value 23.1 and 29.5%, respectively. The Quaternary structural analysis of the camel Hb [PDB ID: 3GDJ] suggests its state to be identical to human R-state Hb.

AB  - The abyssal Pacific Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) hosts vast, commercially valuable seafloor deposits of polymetallic nodules. Foraminifera (testate protists) dominate benthic communities in this region. Here, we present a taxonomic survey, combining morphological and genetic data and focussing on mainly meiofauna-sized Foraminifera from the eastern CCZ. Sequences obtained from >100 specimens, the majority photographically documented, were analysed phylogenetically. Most were single-chambered Monothalamea ('monothalamids'), a high percentage of them squatters inhabiting empty tests of mainly multi-chambered Foraminifera. The first sequences for the monothalamid genus Storthosphaera were obtained, while specimens assigned to Gloiogullmia, Hippocrepinella and Vanhoeffenella yielded new sequences. Among multichambered taxa, high-throughput Illumina sequencing (HTS) revealed a second haplotype of the calcareous rotaliid Oridorsalis umbonatus, possibly representing a distinct species. Additional HTS sequences were obtained from the rotaliids Nuttallides umbonifer and Globocassidulina subglobosa, confirming their wide distributions. We also obtained the first sequences for Cribrostomoides subglobosa, showing that it branches separately from other members of this genus. The fact that many sequences did not correspond to known morphospecies reflects the scarcity of reference barcodes for deep-sea Foraminifera, particularly the poorly known but highly diverse monothalamids. We recommend using HTS of single specimens to reveal further unknown species. Despite extensive research, much remains to be learnt about the true scale of foraminiferal biodiversity in the CCZ.

AB  - Studies of animal movement and migration over large geospatial scales have long relied on natural continental-scale hydrogen isotope (delta H-2) gradients in precipitation, yet the physiological processes that govern incorporation of delta H-2 from precipitation into plant and then herbivore tissues remain poorly understood, especially at the molecular level. Establishing a biochemical framework for the propagation of delta H-2 through food webs would enable us to resolve more complicated regional-scale animal movements and potentially unlock new applications for delta H-2 data in animal ecology and eco-physiology. Amino acid delta H-2 analysis offers a promising new avenue by which to establish this framework. We report bulk tissue delta H-2, delta C-13, and delta N-15 data as well as amino acid delta H-2 and delta C-13 data from three Pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor) tissues-caterpillars, butterfly bodies, and wings-as well as their obligate plant source: pipevine leaves (Aristolochia macrophylla). Insects are often dominant herbivores in terrestrial food webs and a major food source for many higher-level consumers, so it is particularly important to understand the mechanisms that influence insect tissue delta H-2 values. Our data reveal extensive delta H-2 variation within and among individuals of a relatively simple plant-herbivore system that cannot be explained by temporal or geospatial gradients of precipitation delta H-2 or dietary differences. Variations in essential amino acid delta H-2 and delta C-13 indicate that B. philenor acquire these compounds from an additional source that is isotopically distinct from pipevine leaves, potentially gut microbes. We also found multiple isotopic carryover effects associated with metamorphosis. This study emphasizes the strong influence of physiology on consumer-diet delta H-2 discrimination in a local population of pipevines and swallowtails and provides a template that can be broadly applied to Lepidoptera-the second most diverse insect order-and other holometabolous insects. Understanding these physiological mechanisms is critical to interpreting the large degree of delta H-2 variation in consumer tissues often observed at a single collection site, which has implications for using delta H-2 isoscapes to study animal movement. Further investigation into amino acid delta H-2 holds promise to elucidate how subsets of amino acids may be best utilized to address specific ecological and physiological questions for which bulk tissue delta H-2 is insufficient.</p>

AB  - Simple Summary A reduction in lamb mortality would benefit farmers both economically and ethically. The major causes of lamb mortality are similar worldwide. Targeting the specific causes can result in reduced lamb mortality. This involves identifying underlying factors associated with lamb mortality and subsequently recommending changes to management practices. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk factors associated with lamb mortality on Irish sheep farms to provide a greater understanding of the necessary management practices required to reduce lamb mortality. This was achieved by identifying relationships between on-farm practices and risk factors of lamb mortality associated with these practices. Predators, lamb birth weight, and diseases were perceived by farmers to be the main causes of lamb mortality. Individual lambing pens were used on most sheep farms but were not cleaned and/or disinfected on 26% of them. Lamb mortality tended to be lower on farms that used best-known practices. Full-time farmers that used hospital and individual pens had a higher gross margin (euro18/ewe). Management systems affect both lamb mortality and flock gross margin. Every 1% decrease in average lamb mortality across Irish flocks is worth ~euro3 million annually to the Irish sheep sector. Lamb mortality is a key factor influencing ewe productivity and profitability. The current study investigated risk factors associated with and management practices implemented on sheep farms to reduce lamb mortality. A survey consisting of 13 multiple-part questions (57 separate questions) was administered to all sheep farmers participating in the Teagasc National Farm Survey, representative of the Irish national population of sheep farms. A total of 60% of respondents identify mating or lambing date, and this practice tended to be associated with reduced lamb mortality (1.2%, p = 0.08). Individual lambing pens were used by 88% of farmers, but 26% did not clean or disinfect them. A total of 79% and 9.5% of farmers applied iodine to all lambs' navels and administered antibiotics to all lambs to treat and/or prevent diseases, respectively. Most farmers vaccinated their ewes (86%) and lambs (79%) against clostridial diseases and/or pasteurellosis; 13% vaccinated against abortion agents. Lamb mortality tended to be lower (Kruskal-Wallis (KW) = 2.749; p = 0.09) on farms that used stomach tubing, heat box, iodine, hospital, and individual pens compared with farms that do not implement all those practices. Predators, lamb birth weight, and diseases were perceived by respondents to be the three main causes of live-born lamb mortality. The gross margin is significantly higher on lowland farms by euro37 per ewe compared with hill farms (Kruskal-Wallis (KW) = 4.056; p < 0.001). The combination of full-time farming and the use of hospital and individual pens improved gross margin (euro18/ewe, p = 0.028). It is concluded that on-farm management practices affect both lamb mortality and flock gross margin.

AB  - In the mammalian female reproductive tract, physiological oxygen tension is lower than that of the atmosphere. Therefore, to mimic in vivo conditions during in vitro culture (IVC) of mammalian early embryos, 5% oxygen has been extensively used instead of 20%. However, the potential effect of hypoxia on the yield of early embryos with high developmental competence remains unknown or controversial, especially in pigs. In the present study, we examined the effects of low oxygen tension under different oxygen tension levels on early developmental competence of parthenogenetically activated (PA) and in vitro-fertilized (IVF) porcine embryos. Unlike the 5% and 20% oxygen groups, exposure of PA embryos to 1% oxygen tension, especially in early-phase IVC (0-2 days), greatly decreased several developmental competence parameters including blastocyst formation rate, blastocyst size, total cell number, inner cell mass (ICM) to trophectoderm (TE) ratio, and cellular survival rate. In contrast, 1% oxygen tension did not affect developmental parameters during the middle (2-4 days) and late phases (4-6 days) of IVC. Interestingly, induction of autophagy by rapamycin treatment markedly restored the developmental parameters of PA and IVF embryos cultured with 1% oxygen tension during earlyphase IVC, to meet the levels of the other groups. Together, these results suggest that the early development of porcine embryos depends on crosstalk between oxygen tension and autophagy. Future studies of this relationship should explore the developmental events governing early embryonic development to produce embryos with high developmental competence in vitro.

AB  - Exogenous factors influence embryo development. Enniatin B1 (EB1), one emerging mycotoxin of Fusarium fungi, can cause damage to cells and mouse blastocysts. However, the toxicity of EB1 on porcine embryo development and whether melatonin can eliminate the detrimental effects of EB1 on embryos remain unclear. Here, this work demonstrated that EB1 significantly decreased the cleavage and blastocyst rates and blastocyst cell number of embryos in a dose and time dependent manner. Further study displayed that EB1 obviously destroyed nuclear remodeling dynamics. Importantly, EB1 triggered embryo apoptosis through downregulating the expression of Sod1, Gpx4, Cat and Bcl2l1 while upregulating the transcription of Bax and Caspase3. Moreover, EB1 significantly disrupted the transcription of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Tet1 and Tet3, further leading to incomplete DNA demethylation of CenRep, Oct4, Nanog and Sox2, thus, the expression of Eif1a, Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 remarkably decreased. Whereas EB1-exposed embryos were treated with melatonin, these disorders were obviously ameliorated, and the development ability of embryos was also rescued. In conclusion, EB1 exerted detrimental effects on porcine early embryos, while melatonin effectively rescued EB1-mediated defects in embryos. This work provides a novel insight into the improvement of embryo quality and the promotion of human and animal reproduction.

AB  - The rapid development of livestock and poultry farming in China has resulted in an increasing threat of water pollution. In particular, mitigating livestock-related pollutant discharges is a key issue for environmental sustainability, especially for inland surface water bodies. In order to ensure the effective control of pollution and the efficient utilization management of livestock manure, spatially explicit surveys of pollutant generation and discharge from the livestock sector must be performed. In the present study, we estimated the grid cell-level distributions in the generation and discharge of four typical pollutants (chemical oxygen demand, ammonium nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) from the livestock sector across the country with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds. The distributions were estimated using the most recent pollution source census data and multi-sourced ancillary materials by a dasymetric mapping approach. We further investigated the feasibility of the resource utilization of livestock manure by comparing manure-source nutrients with the carrying capacity of adjacent croplands. Our results show that low-intensive farming generated and discharged the majority of livestock farming pollution, with other cattle and pigs breeding identified as the two major sources of pollution from the livestock sector. Southwest, Central and East China suffered the highly densified pollutants generation and discharges. Furthermore, cropland exceeding its carrying capacity was concentrated in these regions. Our findings provide additional insights into livestock and poultry farming in the context of relocation, strengthening regulation, transforming breeding operations, and rationalizing the resource use of manure, all of which are important measures for the sustainable development of both agriculture and the environment. from the livestock sector.

AB  - Simple Summary In commercial-intensive pig farms, the identification and quantification of piglet feeding behavior is an important indicator for daily inspections. However, the model often judges pigs resting in the feeding area as the feeding behavior. Considering the functional characteristics of the pig house feeding area, we present a novel method based on the improved YOLOV5 and feeding functional area suggestions to identify the feeding and non-feeding behaviors of nursery piglets. In addition, four advanced models and ablation experiments are adopted for a comparative evaluation of the robustness of the model. This article proposes a model that can help the management team adjust piglet feeding patterns and save more manpower and feed.Abstract A novel method is proposed based on the improved YOLOV5 and feeding functional area proposals to identify the feeding behaviors of nursery piglets in a complex light and different posture environment. The method consists of three steps: first, the corner coordinates of the feeding functional area were set up by using the shape characteristics of the trough proposals and the ratio of the corner point to the image width and height to separate the irregular feeding area; second, a transformer module model was introduced based on YOLOV5 for highly accurate head detection; and third, the feeding behavior was recognized and counted by calculating the proportion of the head in the located feeding area. The pig head dataset was constructed, including 5040 training sets with 54,670 piglet head boxes, and 1200 test sets, and 25,330 piglet head boxes. The improved model achieves a 5.8% increase in the mAP and a 4.7% increase in the F1 score compared with the YOLOV5s model. The model is also applied to analyze the feeding pattern of group-housed nursery pigs in 24 h continuous monitoring and finds that nursing pigs have different feeding rhythms for the day and night, with peak feeding periods at 7:00-9:00 and 15:00-17:00 and decreased feeding periods at 12:00-14:00 and 0:00-6:00. The model provides a solution for identifying and quantifying pig feeding behaviors and offers a data basis for adjusting the farm feeding scheme.

AB  - Folivorous primates are typically considered time minimizers because the constraints of their unique digestive systems require them to spend a large portion of their activity budgets resting. However, inter- and intraspecific behavioral variation in their activity budgets may be influenced by local geographic and climatic conditions and evolutionary history. We compiled 48 studies representing ten genera, 31 species, and 50 populations to assess geographic (elevation, latitude), climatic (precipitation, temperature), and phylogenetic correlates of colobine activity budgets. Time spent resting negatively correlated with time spent feeding, moving, and socializing. Except for time spent socializing, activity budgets were independent of phylogeny, with more time spent feeding and less time resting in higher-elevation habitats and at lower temperatures. Among the four most common genera in our sample, only in Rhinopithecus did time spent feeding increase with higher elevations (range, 950-3950 m above mean sea level) and lower temperatures (range, 0.9-25 celcius). Only in Trachypithecus did time spent resting decrease with lower temperatures (range, 19-25 celcius). Our findings suggest that there are no apparent effects of geographic or climatic gradients on colobine activity budgets except for Rhinopithecus and Trachypithecus, whose activities are biased in favor of energy maximization rather than time minimization. Compared with other colobines, the ability of Rhinopithecus to adapt their activity budget at high elevations may make them less vulnerable to climate change, while the greater sensitivity of Trachypithecus to heat may make them more vulnerable to climate change.

AB  - Laser lighting technology has become a new star in the field of modern lighting. However, the thermal quenching of optical conversion materials occurs at high incident power density, so it is an urgent problem to improve their heat resistance. In this paper, a kind of Lu3Al5O12:Ce&CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (LuAG&CASN) com-posite phosphor-in-glass (PiG) suitable for high power laser diode is prepared, which shows high brightness and high display. In addition, the graphene monolayer grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is coated on the surface of LuAG&CASN-PiG to further improve the luminescence performance of PiG. The saturation power threshold of the graphene-PiG (G-PiG) sample can reach 4.5 W and the maximum output lumen flux can reach 317.95 lm when the system is excited with 450 nm blue light using the reflective structure. Compared with the samples without graphene coating, the luminescence efficiency of G-PiG was improved by 23.2%. This single-layer graphene surface coating method provides a new idea for the preparation of high-performance fluorescence conversion materials for laser lighting applications, which may play an important role in the future laser lighting.

AB  - Plants use various secondary chemicals in their chemical defense against herbivores. While botanical insecticides are crucial for reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides, the development of plant-derived insecticides remains limited. In this study, we fed Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata with three different host plants (Solanum nigrum, Solanum tuberosum, and Physalis floridana) and observed that feeding on P. floridana led to changes in the body size and a significantly high mortality rate. Through transcriptome analysis, it was found that the trehalose metabolism pathway of H. vigintioctopunctata changed significantly under different host feeding conditions, especially since the expression level of the trehalase gene was extremely different. We subsequently identified eight transcripts of HvTREs and analyzed their evolution and structure. Among them, significant differences are observed in the relative expression levels of HvTRE1-5 in H. vigintioctopunctata after the fourth instar and were affected by different plant diets. Compared with the natural host S. nigrum, the larvae that fed on P. floridana significantly reduced the contents of trehalose, glucose and glycogen and significantly affected the trehalase activity. Knockdown of HvTRE1-5 by RNAi increased mortality at the H. vigintioctopunctata prepupation stage, suggesting that HvTRE1-5 is important for H. vigintioctopunctata pupation. This study provides new insights into developing of green control methods for H. vigintioctopunctata and offers a valuable example for understanding the interaction between host plants and herbivorous insects.

AB  - Both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter receptors can influence maturation and survival of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus; nevertheless, how these two neurotransmitter systems affect integration of new neurons into the existing circuitry is still not fully characterized. Here, we demonstrate that glutamate receptors of the kainate receptor (KAR) subfamily are expressed in adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) and that, through their interaction with GABAergic signaling mechanisms, they alter the functional properties of adult-born cells during a critical period of their development. Both the intrinsic properties and synaptic connectivity of young abDGCs were affected. Timed KAR loss in a cohort of young adult-born neurons in mice disrupted their performance in a spatial discrimination task but not in a hippocampal-dependent fear conditioning task. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of KARs in the proper functional development of young abDGCs.

AB  - This is a review of my laboratory's interest in status epilepticus (SE), which spanned five decades. It started with a study of the role of brain mRNAs in memory, and with the use of electroconvulsive seizures to disrupt recently acquired memories. This led to biochemical studies of brain metabolism during sei-zures, and to the serendipitous development of the first model of self-sustaining SE.The profound inhibition of brain protein synthesis by seizures had implications for brain development, and we showed that severe seizures and SE in the absence of hypoxemia and other metabolic complica-tions can disrupt brain and behavioral development, a concept that was not widely accepted at that time. We also showed that many experimental models of SE can cause neuronal death in the immature brain, even at very young ages.Our studies of self-sustaining SE showed that the transition from single seizures to SE is accompanied by internalization and transient inactivation of synaptic GABAA receptors, while extrasynaptic GABAA receptors are untouched. At the same time, NMDA and AMPA receptors move to the synaptic membrane, creating a "perfect storm" combining failure of inhibition and runaway excitation. Major maladaptive changes in protein kinases and neuropeptides, particularly galanin and tachykinins, also contribute to the maintenance of SE.The therapeutic implications of these results are that our current practice to start the treatment of SE with benzodiazepine monotherapy leaves the changes in glutamate receptors untreated and that sequen-tial use of drugs gives seizures more time to aggravate changes in receptor trafficking. In experimental SE, we showed that drug combinations based on the receptor trafficking hypothesis are far superior to monotherapy in stopping SE late in its course. Combinations that include an NMDA receptor blocker such as ketamine are much better than combinations that follow current evidence-based guidelines, and simultaneous delivery of the drugs is far more effective than sequential delivery of the same drugs at the same dose.This paper was presented as a Keynote Lecture at the 8th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures held in September 2022.Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The objective of the study was two-fold (i) to investigate grazing behaviour of Boutsko sheep reared semi-extensively in alpine region of Epirus Mountain range, using global positioning system (GPS) technology and (ii) to estimate genetic parameters for grazing behaviour traits. A total of 300 ewes were randomly selected from three flocks (n = 200, n = 50, and n = 50, respectively) in Epirus, Greece. Rotational monitoring of animal grazing behaviour was performed from June to September 2021, using GPS devices attached on designated collars. Traits measured included duration of daily grazing, distance, speed, altitude difference, and elevation gain. Energy expenditure from walking was calculated for each individual. Blood samples of ewes were obtained, DNA was extracted, and genome-wide genotyping was performed. Mean ( +/- standard deviation) daily grazing duration, distance, speed, altitude difference, elevation gain and energy expenditure were 7.7 +/- 1.52 h, 10.7 +/- 2.01 km, 1.5 +/- 0.42 km/h, 375.5 +/- 174.84 m, 2740.7 +/- 968.95 m, and 1.3 +/- 0.23 MJ, respectively. Significant (P < 0.05) heritability estimates were derived for duration of grazing and speed (0.75 and 0.78, respectively). These two traits, in addition to elevation gain and energy expenditure were significantly repeatable (0.85, 0.86, 0.14, and 0.14, respectively). Significant (P < 0.05) negative genetic and phenotypic correlations were found between grazing duration and speed (-0.99 and -0.96, respectively) and positive ones between duration and distance (0.28 and 0.24, respectively). These correlations indicate that practices for higher grazing duration are expected to reduce speed and increase distance. Overall, results suggest that genomic selection practices could be implemented to improve grazing behaviour in the context of a multi-trait breeding programme. Moreover, there is significant between-animal variation for most grazing behaviour traits studied to support culling decisions aiming to improve adaptation to extensive rearing conditions.

AB  - Background: Our previous works demonstrated that beta 2-microglobulin (beta 32m), a systemic pro-aging factor, induce depressive-like behaviors. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is identified as a potential target for treatment of depression. The aim of the present work is to explore whether H2S antagonizes beta 2m-induced depressive-like behaviors and the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: The depressive-like behaviors were detected using the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST) and open field test (OFT). The expressions of Warburg-related proteins, including hexokinase II (HK II), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), and synaptic plasticity-related proteins, including postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin1 (SYN1), were determined by western blotting.
   Result: we found that NaHS (the donor of H2S) attenuated the depressive-like behaviors in the beta 2m-exposed rats, as judged by NSFT, TST, FST, and OFT. We also demonstrated that NaHS enhanced the synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by the upregulations of PSD95 and SYN1 expressions in the hippocampus of beta 2m-exposed rats. Furthermore, NaHS improved the Warburg effect in the hippocampus of beta 2m-exposed rats, as evidenced by the upregulations of HK II, PKM2, LDHA and PDK1 expressions, and the downregulation of PDH expression.
   Conclusion: H2S prevents beta 2m-induced depressive-like behaviors, which is involved in improvement of hippocampal synaptic plasticity as a result of enhancement of hippocampal Warburg effect.

AB  - Animal models are important for understanding the pathogenesis of human diseases and for developing and testing new drugs. Pigs have been widely used in the research on the cardiovascular, skin barrier, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems as well as organ transplantation. Recently, pigs also become an attractive large animal model for the study of neurodegenerative diseases because their brains are very similar to human brains in terms of mass, gully pattern, vascularization, and the proportions of the gray and white matters. Although adeno-associated virus type 9 (AAV9) has been widely used to deliver transgenes in the brain, its utilization in large animal models remains to be fully characterized. Here, we report that intravenous injection of AAV9-GFP can lead to widespread expression of transgene in various organs in the pig. Importantly, GFP was highly expressed in various brain regions, especially the striatum, cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, without detectable inflammatory responses. These results suggest that intravenous AAV9 administration can be used to establish large animal models of neurodegenerative diseases caused by gene mutations and to treat these animal models as well.

AB  - There is a consensus that indigenous pigs in China are more resistant than modern commercial pigs in terms of disease resistance. Generally, the immune response is an important part of anti-disease capability; however, the related mechanism in pigs is largely puzzling. Here, the public transcriptome data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Dapulian (Chinese local breed) and Landrace (Commercial breed) pigs after stimulation with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C, a conventional reagent used for simulation of the viral infection) were reanalyzed, and the immune response mechanism in different pig breeds was investigated from a transcriptomic perspective. Of note, through comparative analyses of Dapulian and Landrace pigs, the candidate genes involved in swine broad-spectrum resistance were identified, such as TIMD4, RNF128 and VCAM1. In addition, after differential gene expression, target gene identification and functional enrichment analyses, a potential regulatory network of miRNA genes associated with immune response was obtained in Dapulian pigs, including five miRNAs and 12 genes (such as ssc-miR-181a, ssc-miR-486, IL1R1 and NFKB2). This work provides new insights into the immune response regulation of antiviral responses in indigenous and modern commercial pigs.

AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica is a human pathogen transmitted via the faecal-oral route among animals and humans and is a major foodborne public health hazard. This study explores the role of Y. enterocolitica transmission at the livestock-wildlife interface and investigates the potential role wild and peridomestic rodents play as a source of this zoonotic pathogen. The total of 342 faecal samples collected from the seven rodent species and one insectivore was examined using an optimized protocol to culture and identify Y. enterocolitica. Positive samples were also bioserotyped for grouping and determination of sample pathogenicity. Wildlife species sampled in this study were separated into two sample groups: randomly sampled (brown rats, house mice, wood mice, bank voles, field voles and the common shrew), as well as targeted sampling (red and grey squirrels). The overall prevalence of Y. enterocolitica in the randomly sampled population was 3.73%. Brown rats were chosen as sentinel species and tested to determine if location (pig farm vs non-pig farm) was a significant factor affecting Y. enterocolitica prevalence. In this study, location was not significant. All positive samples were found to be of biotype 1A, deemed non-pathogenic. Three of the samples were serotype 09, six were serotype 27 and five had an unidentifiable serotype. This study represents the first time Y. enterocolitica has been identified in these species of wildlife within mainland Britain. In addition, this study's findings are entirely novel and overall with regard to field voles and common shrews. However, the role of wild and peridomestic rodents in the transmission of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica remains unknown, as this study was unable to detect the presence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains in these species.

AB  - Owing to its high lignocellulose content, the recalcitrance of green waste is a technical challenge obstructing the composting process. This study aimed to identify a temperature that could facilitate efficient lignin and cellulose degradation during green waste composting, and maintain this temperature by controlling the heap size to enhance the degradation. The optimum temperature was determined by conducting a laboratory-scale cultivation experiment under controlled temperatures, and a pilot-scale experiment was conducted to explore heap size control and its influence on green waste composting. The results showed that efficient lignin and cellulose degradation was achieved when the temperature was between 45 and 60 celcius, and maintaining this temperature for at least 150 days maximized the lignin and cellulose degradation rates. This was achieved by constraining the heap size at 0.8 m(3) at the beginning of composting; 1.56, 2.60, and 4.00 m(3) on days 15, 39, and 96; and then enlarging the heap as much as possible on day 156. Following this approach, the duration of the target temperature was extended by over six times, the lignin and cellulose degradation rates were increased by 18.82-21.38 % and 9.54-11.55 %, and nitrification and humification were enhanced. Correlation analysis showed that lignocellulose degradation, nitrification, and humification were positively and significantly correlated with the duration of the target temperature. Generally, heap size control is an ecological and economic method of enhancing the efficiency and quality of green waste composting and compost, respectively.

AB  - Author summaryDespite decades of research, the functional roles of neural heterogeneities towards understanding how sensory inputs are encoded by neural populations remains poorly understood. Here we use multi-unit recordings from sensory neural populations using high-density arrays (i.e., Neuropixels probes) and mathematical modeling to understand how a heterogeneous neural population with antagonistic center-surround receptive field organization encodes object location. We recorded the activities of pyramidal cells within the electrosensory lateral line lobe of weakly electric fish in response to a prey-like stimulus. Overall, we found that the receptive fields were highly heterogeneous even when they overlap considerably. We also found that correlated trial-to-trial variabilities of neural responses (i.e., spike-count correlations) varied along the receptive field. Specifically, correlation magnitude was highest towards the receptive field edges and dropped sharply near the midpoint. Using Fisher information analysis, we determined that the spike-count correlations introduced redundancy, but that the deleterious effect was in part mitigated by their spatial dependence. To better understand how heterogeneities within the receptive field, as well as spatially dependent correlations, influence information transmission, we built a mathematical model. Overall, our model reproduced experimental data and predicted that the level of heterogeneity in receptive field position seen experimentally is optimal for information transmission. Given that there are important parallels between the electrosensory system and other senses (e.g., vision), it is likely that our results will be applicable elsewhere.
   Understanding how neural populations encode sensory stimuli remains a central problem in neuroscience. Here we performed multi-unit recordings from sensory neural populations in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus in response to stimuli located at different positions along the rostro-caudal axis. Our results reveal that the spatial dependence of correlated activity along receptive fields can help mitigate the deleterious effects that these correlations would otherwise have if they were spatially independent. Moreover, using mathematical modeling, we show that experimentally observed heterogeneities in the receptive fields of neurons help optimize information transmission as to object location. Taken together, our results have important implications for understanding how sensory neurons whose receptive fields display antagonistic center-surround organization encode location. Important similarities between the electrosensory system and other sensory systems suggest that our results will be applicable elsewhere.

AB  - Simple Summary The mixture of maize (Zea mays L.) with Moringa oleifera (MOL) during silage can improve the nutritional quality of the silage, but the impact of the proportion of both forages on fermentation and rumen production of greenhouse gases has not been assessed and evaluated. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate the impact of maize co-ensiling with increasing percentages of MOL forage on the kinetics of biogas, methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production, as well as the characteristics of ruminal fermentation and CH4 conversion efficiency, using steers and sheep as inoculum sources. The results indicated that the co-silage of maize with MOL improved the degradability with both sources of inoculum, and that regardless of the percentage of MOL, the steer inoculum presented the highest values in the biogas production, CH4, H2S, degradability of dry matter, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and metabolizable energy (ME), as well as the lowest pH and highest CH4 conversion efficiency, in terms of CH4 produced per unit of SCFA, ME, and organic matter. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the impact of maize co-ensiling with increasing percentages of MOL forage on the kinetics of biogas, methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production, as well as the characteristics of ruminal fermentation and CH4 conversion efficiency, using steers (STI) and sheep (SHI) as inoculum sources. With the STI, the inclusion of MOL reduced (linear: p <= 0.0199; quadratic: p <= 0.0267) biogas production (mL g(-1) DM incubated and degraded), CH4 (mL g(-1) DM degraded), CO (mL g(-1) DM degraded), and H2S (mL g(-1) DM incubated and degraded), without affecting (p > 0.05) the parameters (b = asymptotic gas, c = rate of gas production and Lag = initial delay time before gas production) of CH4 and H2S, and the proportion and production of CH4 per kg of dry matter (DM). In addition, with this inoculum, pH, and dry matter degradation (DMD) increased (linear: p <= 0.0060), and although short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and metabolizable energy (ME) decreased (linear: p < 0.0001; quadratic: p <= 0.0015), this did not affect (p > 0.05) the CH4 conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, with the SHI, the inclusion of MOL only decreased (linear: p <= 0.0206; quadratic: p <= 0.0003) biogas per dry matter (DM) degraded and increased (linear: p <= 0.0293; quadratic: p <= 0.0325) biogas per DM incubated, as well as the production (mL g(-1) DM incubated and degraded and g(-1) kg DM) and proportion of CH4, and CO per DM incubated and degraded. In addition, it did not impact (p > 0.05) on the CH4 and H2S parameters, and in the H2S by DM incubated and degraded, and although it increased (linear: p <= 0.0292; quadratic: p <= 0.0325) the DMD, SCFA, and ME, it was inefficient (quadratic: p <= 0.0041) in CH4 conversion.
   It is concluded that regardless of the percentage of MOL, the STI presented the highest values in the production of biogas, CH4, H2S, DMD, SCFA, and ME, and the lowest pH, so it turned out to be the most efficient in CH4 conversion, while with the SHI only the highest production of CO and pH was obtained, and the lowest DMD, SCFA, and ME, so it was less efficient compared to STI.

AB  - Maintaining blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes critically to preserving normal brain functions. According to the available evidence, intense or chronic exposure to stress would potentially affect different brain structures, such as the hippocampus, negatively. The purpose of this study was to define the relationship between the BBB permeability of the hippocampus and the performance of spatial learning and memory under chronically electric foot shock stress. Sixteen rats were divided into the control and stress groups equally. Animals in the stress group were exposed to foot shock (1 mA, 1 Hz) for 10-s duration every 60 s (1 h/day) for 10 consecutive days. The anxiety-related behavior, spatial learning, and memory were assessed by an Open Field (OF) and the Morris Water Maze (MWM) respectively. The hippocampal BBB permeability was determined by Evans blue penetration assay. Our results demonstrated that the stress model not only increased locomotor activities in the OF test but reduced spatial learning and memory in MWM. Moreover, these effects coincided with a significant increase in hippocampal BBB permeability. In sum, the stress model can be used in future studies focusing on the relationship between stress and BBB permeability of the hippocampus.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum, Poaceae) is cultivated on a large scale in (sub)tropical regions such as Brazil and has considerable economic value for sugar and biofuel production. The plant is a rich substrate for endo- and epiphytic fungi. Black yeasts in the family Herpotrichiellaceae (Chaetothyriales) are colonizers of human-dominated habitats, particularly those rich in toxins and hydrocarbon pollutants, and may cause severe infections in susceptible human hosts. The present study assessed the diversity of Herpotrichiellaceae associated with sugarcane, using in silico identification and selective isolation. Using metagenomics, we identified 5833 fungal sequences, while 639 black yeast-like isolates were recovered in vitro. In both strategies, the latter fungi were identified as members of the genera Cladophialophora, Exophiala, and Rhinocladiella (Herpotrichiellaceae), Cyphellophora (Cyphellophoraceae), and Knufia (Trichomeriaceae). In addition, we discovered new species of Cladophialophora and Exophiala from sugarcane and its rhizosphere. The first environmental isolation of Cladophialophora bantiana is particularly noteworthy, because this species up to now is exclusively known from the human host where it mostly causes fatal brain disease in otherwise healthy patients.

AB  - BackgroundThe volumes of the hippocampal subfields are related to poststroke cognitive dysfunctions. However, it remains unclear whether contralesional hippocampal subfield volume contributes to cognitive impairment. This study aimed to investigate the volumetric differences in the contralesional hippocampal subfields between patients with left and right hemisphere strokes (LHS/RHS). Additionally, correlations between contralesional hippocampal subfield volumes and clinical outcomes were explored.MethodsFourteen LHS (13 males, 52.57 +/- 7.10 years), 13 RHS (11 males, 51.23 +/- 15.23 years), and 18 healthy controls (11 males, 46.94 +/- 12.74 years) were enrolled. Contralesional global and regional hippocampal volumes were obtained with T1-weighted images. Correlations between contralesional hippocampal subfield volumes and clinical outcomes, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), were analyzed. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons.ResultsSignificant reductions were found in contralesional hippocampal as a whole (adjusted p = .011) and its subfield volumes, including the hippocampal tail (adjusted p = .005), cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) (adjusted p = .002), molecular layer (ML) (adjusted p = .004), granule cell and ML of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG) (adjusted p = .015), CA3 (adjusted p = .009), and CA4 (adjusted p = .014) in the RHS group compared to the LHS group. MoCA and MMSE had positive correlations with volumes of contralesional hippocampal tail (p = .015, r = .771; p = .017, r = .763) and fimbria (p = .020, r = .750; p = .019, r = .753) in the LHS group, and CA3 (p = .007, r = .857; p = .009, r = .838) in the RHS group, respectively.ConclusionUnilateral stroke caused volumetric differences in different hippocampal subfields contralesionally, which correlated to cognitive impairment. RHS leads to greater volumetric reduction in the whole contralesional hippocampus and specific subfields (hippocampal tail, CA1, ML, GC-ML-DG, CA3, and CA4) compared to LHS. These changes are correlated with cognitive impairments, potentially due to disrupted neural pathways and interhemispheric communication.

AB  - Timing and quantity of sleep depend on a circadian (-24-h) rhythm and a specific sleep requirement.1 Sleep curtailment results in a homeostatic rebound of more and deeper sleep, the latter reflected in increased electroencephalographic (EEG) slow -wave activity (SWA) during non -rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.2 Circadian rhythms are synchronized by the light -dark cycle but persist under constant conditions.3-5 Strikingly, arctic reindeer behavior is arrhythmic during the solstices.6 Moreover, the Arctic's extreme seasonal environmental changes cause large variations in overall activity and food intake.7 We hypothesized that the maintenance of optimal functioning under these extremely fluctuating conditions would require adaptations not only in daily activity patterns but also in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. We studied sleep using non-invasive EEG in four Eurasian tundra reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Tromso, Norway (69 degrees N) during the fall equinox and both solstices. As expected, sleep -wake rhythms paralleled daily activity distribution, and sleep deprivation resulted in a homeostatic rebound in all seasons. Yet, these sleep rebounds were smaller in summer and fall than in winter. Surprisingly, SWA decreased not only during NREM sleep but also during rumination. Quantitative modeling revealed that sleep pressure decayed at similar rates during the two behavioral states. Finally, reindeer spent less time in NREM sleep the more they ruminated. These results suggest that they can sleep during rumination. The ability to reduce sleep need during rumination-undisturbed phases for both sleep recovery and digestion-might allow for near -constant feeding in the arctic summer.

AB  - Data from post-mortem inspections conducted using official controls on the meat production of slaughtered pigs are generally considered valuable for identifying herd health issues and ensuring meat safety. However, several studies highlighted that a multi-stage assessment of lung changes would provide more useful information on animal health than the implemented binary (yes/no) recording. For this purpose, a new scheme was developed and subsequently used by trained official veterinarians at four slaughterhouses in Austria. Implementation of the multi-stage assessment was carried out in parallel with the conventional assessment, and data collected from both schemes were analyzed and compared to evaluate effectiveness. The analysis of the data (n = 20,345) showed that the most common alteration was low-grade (28.4%), followed by moderate-grade (11.3%,) and then high-grade pneumonia (5.2%). In the case of pleurisy, 88.9% of the carcasses showed no alterations of the pleura, and 11.1% had pathological changes (low-grade pleurisy = 4.7%, moderate-grade pleurisy = 2.7%, high-grade pleurisy = 3.7%). Analysis of the results showed a strong heterogeneity of the frequency of alterations between the batches reflecting various underlying animal health issues. Among the influencing factors, the origin of the pigs had the greatest influence. The project demonstrated that the new evaluation can be carried out easily with no extra time effort once staff are trained and the technological platform for reporting is adapted. The more detailed information ensures more useful feedback is provided to the farmers and supervising veterinarians, thereby ensuing animal welfare and contributing to sustainable, improved animal husbandry.

AB  - Background The sheep blowfly, Lucila cuprina, is a myiasis-causing parasite responsible for significant production losses and welfare issues for the Australian sheep industry. Control relies largely on the use of insecticides. The pyrimidine compound, dicyclanil, is the predominant control chemical, although other insecticides also are used, including imidacloprid, ivermectin, cyromazine and spinosad. We investigated in vitro resistance patterns and mechanisms in field-collected blowfly strains. Results The Walgett 2019 strain showed significant levels of resistance to both dicyclanil and imidacloprid, with resistance factors at the IC50 of 26- and 17-fold, respectively, in in vitro bioassays. Co-treatment with the cytochrome P450 inhibitor, aminobenzotriazole, resulted in significant levels of synergism for dicyclanil and imidacloprid (synergism ratios of 7.2- and 6.1-fold, respectively), implicating cytochrome P450 in resistance to both insecticides. Cyp12d1 transcription levels were increased up to 40-fold throughout the larval life stages in the resistant strain compared to a reference susceptible strain, whereas transcription levels of some other cyp genes (6g1, 4d1, 28d1) did not differ between the strains. Similar resistance levels also were observed in flies collected from the same property in two subsequent years. Conclusion This study indicates that in vitro resistance to both dicyclanil and imidacloprid in this field-collected blowfly strain is likely mediated by cytochrome P450, with Cyp12d1 implicated as the enzyme responsible; however, it remains possible that another P450 also may be involved. A common resistance mechanism for the two drugs has important implications for drug rotation strategies designed to prolong the useful life of flystrike control chemicals. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Lemna minuta is native to North America but an invasive alien plant in Europe, where it poses significant threats to freshwater ecosystems. Explorations for biological control agents were conducted in two regions of the United States (Louisiana and California), revealing three candidate species. Subsequent laboratory investigations focused on the weevil Tanysphyrus lemnae and the fly Lemnaphila scotlandae as the most promising agents and confirmed that both the herbivorous insects attack L. minuta plants. To evaluate the host specificity of these two potential agents, insects were exposed to five species of duckweed commonly occurring in North America and Europe. Preliminary host-range testing indicated that T. lemnae develops on all evaluated duckweed species, including those from different genera (Lemna, Spirodela, Landoltia). Conversely, data revealed that feeding and development of the dipteran L. scotlandae are limited to species in the genus Lemna, but this includes L. minor, a native European species threatened in Europe due to the spread of L. minuta. No-choice and choice tests confirmed that neither larvae nor adults of L. scotlandae discriminate between the two Lemna species, except for pupation, which occurs more frequently in L. minor under choice conditions. We conclude that the broad host-range of T. lemnae and L. scotlandae render them unsuitable as biological control agents of L. minuta in Europe.

AB  - An instance of hormone assay method flaw is reported. In this journal Chronobiology International, two papers appeared in which an ELISA method for human serum or plasma was utilized for blood serum of horse and sheep, respectively. From our testing, it is resulted that such method does not work at all for equine, sheep and other animal species. The use of commercial hormone assay kits for heterologous species always needs a careful validation procedure. First, the same hormone molecule by different species could not share enough homology to be regognized by and react with antibodies utilized in the method. Furthermore, even with a full overlap of the molecules, possible interferences by other components of the sample (matrix effect) have to be considered.

AB  - The stick tea thrip (Dendrothrips minowai Priesner) is the main pest thrip in tea (Camellia sinensis) plantations in China, and seriously affects the quality and yield of tea. Plant-derived semiochemicals provide an alternative to pheromones as lures and these compounds possess powerful attractiveness. In this study, we selected 20 non-pheromone semiochemicals, including compounds that have been reported to attract other thrips and some volatiles emitted from tea plants as the potential attractant components for D. minowai. In electroantennogram (EAG) assays, 10 synthetic compounds (p-anisaldehyde, 3-methyl butanal, (E)-beta-ocimene, farnesene, nonanal, eugenol, (+)-alpha-pinene, limonene, (-)-alpha-pinene, and gamma-terpinene) elicited significant antennal responses in female D. minowai. In addition, a two-choice H-tube olfactometer bioassay showed that D. minowai displayed significant positive responses to eight compound dilutions (p-anisaldehyde, eugenol, farnesene, methyl benzoate, 3-methyl butanal, (E)-beta-ocimene, (-)-alpha-pinene, and (+)-alpha-pinene) when compared with the solvent control at both 1 and 2 h. Moreover, gamma-terpinene exhibited a significantly deterrent effect on D. minowai. Finally, trap catches of four compounds (p-anisaldehyde, eugenol, farnesene, and 3-methyl butanal, respectively) significantly increase in tea plantations. Among these, the maximum number of D. minowai collected by blue sticky traps baited with p-anisaldehyde was 7.7 times higher than the control. In conclusion, p-anisaldehyde, eugenol, farnesene, and 3-methyl butanal could significantly attract D. minowai in the laboratory and under field conditions, suggesting considerable potential as commercial attractants to control D. minowai populations.

AB  - Peperomia pellucida (L.) HBK (Piperaceae) ("jabuti herb") is an herbaceous plant that is widespread in the tropics and has several ethnomedicinal uses. The phytochemical study of leaf extracts resulted in the isolation of 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid, 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone, 2,4,5-trimethoxystyrene, 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, dillapiol, and sesamin in addition to pellucidin A. The co-occurrence of styrene and cyclobutane dimers suggested the formation of pellucidin A by a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of two molecules of 2,4,5-trimethoxystyrene. To investigate this biogenesis, analysis of plant leaves throughout ontogeny and treatments such as drought, herbivory and, exposure to jasmonic acid and UV365 light were carried out. Significant increases in the content of dillapiol (up to 86.0%) were found when P. pellucida plants were treated with jasmonic acid, whereas treatment under UV365 light increase the pellucidin A content (193.2%). The biosynthetic hypothesis was examined by feeding various C-13-labeled precursors, followed by analysis with GC-MS, which showed incorporation of L-(2-C-13)-phenylalanine (0.72%), (8-C-13)-cinnamic acid (1.32%), (8-C-13)-ferulic acid (0.51%), (8-C-13)-2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid (7.5%), and (8-C-13)-2,4,5-trimethoxystyrene (12.8%) into pellucidin A. The enzymatic conversion assays indicated decarboxylation of 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid into 2,4,5-trimethoxystyrene, which was subsequently dimerized into pellucidin A under UV light. Taken together, the biosynthesis of pellucidin A in P. pellucida involves a sequence of reactions starting with L-phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid, which then decarboxylates to form 2,4,5-trimethoxystyrene and then is photochemically dimerized to produce pellucidin A.

AB  - The Optimal Defense Theory (ODT) predicts that the distribution of defenses within a plant should mirror the value and vulnerability of each tissue. Although the ODT has received much experimental support, very few studies have examined defense allocation among reproductive tissues and none assessed simultaneously how these defenses evolve with age. We quantified glucosinolates in perianths, anthers and pistils at different bud maturity stages (i.e., intermediate flower buds, old flower buds and flowers) of undamaged and mechanically damaged plants of an annual brassicaceous species. The youngest leaf was used as a reference for vegetative organs, since it is predicted to be one of the most defended. In line with ODT predictions, reproductive tissues were more defended than vegetative tissues constitutively, and within the former, pistils and anthers more defended than perianths. No change in the overall defense level was found between bud maturity stages, but a significant temporal shift was observed between pistils and anthers. Contrary to ODT predictions, mechanical damage did not induce systemic defenses in leaves but only in pistils. Our results show that defense allocation in plant reproductive tissues occurs at fine spatial and temporal scales, extending the application framework of the ODT. They also demonstrate interactions between space and time in fine-scale defense allocation.

AB  - The energy potential of pig manure (PM) has garnered attention. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is proposed to convert PM to H-2-enriched syngas without the drying process for wet materials. This paper studied the effect of diverse parameters on H-2-enriched syngas production. The results revealed that higher temperatures and alkaline catalysts elevated total gas yield and H-2 yield, with the addition of K2CO3 at 620 C-degrees, 30 min, and 6 wt% feed concentration generating the highest total gas yield (36.55 mol/kg), H(2 )yield (18.89 mol/kg), and mole fraction (51.55%), accompanied by a high gasification efficiency (87.59%). Based on product characterization and thermodynamic analysis, reaction mechanisms were proposed to provide insight into enhancing syngas production, indicating that the suppression of polymerization reactions between cyclic compounds and the promotion of CH4, C2H6, and long-chain alkanes conversion were essential. Further, the environmental impact evaluation showed that heavy metals (Cu, Cr, As, and Zn) were concentrated in solid products by adsorption and passivation. The solid products exhibited negligible environmental hazards. This work showed that PM SCWG realized syngas production as well as heavy metals enrichment and stabilization, which could provide an alternative solution to the clean conversion of other types of organic wastes, especially with high heavy metals content, such as oily sludge and sewage sludge.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) has substantially spread worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses in the swine industry. Despite extensive research, no ASF vaccine has surpassed the effectiveness of live attenuated vaccines. For instance, the live attenuated vaccine ASFV-G-Delta I177L/Delta LVR has demonstrated good efficacy and safety, along with prolonged persistence of ASF antibodies after vaccination. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate its potential for protection against highly virulent homologous ASF viruses based on changes in the farm environment. To this end, we challenged domestic pigs with a virulent field strain of ASFV following intramuscular immunization with ASFV-G-Delta I177L/Delta LVR. We further assessed its genomic stability and long-term antibody persistence in immunized domestic pigs. All vaccinated pigs exhibited high antibody positivity, with higher levels of antibodies observed at the time of challenge. These high ASF vaccine antibodies were maintained for approximately 2 months after vaccination. In addition, no organ or tissue damage was observed in the vaccinated animals. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of this vaccine candidate in the prevention of ASFV infection in the swine industry.

AB  - The neurotoxicological consequences of chronic exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) at environmentally relevant concentrations remain poorly understood, particularly their impact on hippocampal neurons dysfunction. In this study, a mouse model co-exposed to PSNPs and/or luteolin (LUT) was replicated by intraperitoneal injection to investigate the mechanism and effective treatment of PSNPs induced striatal neurodegeneration. Here, we elucidated that PSNPs exposure induced striatal injury characterized by neuronal disorganization and mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. Notably, PSNPs triggered oxidative dysregulation and iron accumulation by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity and suppressing lipid peroxidation, leading to ferroptosis and neuroinflammation. Additionally, PSNPs exposure induced a decrease in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle imbalance by disrupting G6PD/glutathione-dependent pathway, leading to an imbalance in cellular energy metabolism. Our findings highlighted the role of the Piezo1/CaN/NFAT1 axis in PSNPs-induced ER Ca2 + homeostasis imbalance, which was effectively inhibited by LUT. Notably, LUT alleviated the susceptibility to striatal ferroptosis induced by PSNPs via the G6PD/glutathione axis. Collectively, our study provides critical insights into the neurotoxic mechanisms of PSNPs and establishes LUT as a agent against PSNPs induced neurodegeneration. These findings underscore the urgent need for environmental regulation of nano-plastics and offer potential strategies for combating their health effects.

AB  - Fumonisins, a class of mycotoxins, pose significant health risks due to widespread contamination. The presence of masked mycotoxins complicates risk assessments because of insufficient regulation and potential toxicity as well as in vivo transformation. This study aims to compare the toxic effects of continuous exposure to fumonisin B1 (FB1) and hydrolyzed FB1 (HFB1) on the gut-liver axis in mice. After 21 d of exposure to FB1 and HFB1, the distributions of FB1 and its metabolites in mice were analyzed, and their effects on intestinal morphology, gut microbial diversity, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), inflammatory factors, and hippocampal metabolites were assessed. The results revealed that the highest concentrations of FB1 (61.87%) and HFB1 (53.56%) were detected in the cecum, followed by the colon. Exposure to FB1 and HFB1 resulted in compromised intestinal integrity, villi atrophy, elevated levels of inflammatory factors, and decreased total SCFAs. Both FB1 and HFB1 led to a significant reduction in the Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio. Blood biochemical analysis and liver metabolomics indicated that FB1 and HFB1 also induced disturbances in the liver homeostasis. The complex correlations observed between the metabolomic and microbiota results underscore the involvement of the gut-liver axis in the disruption induced by these two mycotoxins. These findings highlight the systemic effects of FB1 and HFB1 on liver and gut health, providing valuable insights for further research into their mechanisms and health implications.

AB  - Simple Summary In the early 1980s, the late Colin Groves (1942-2017), a noted taxonomist and suid specialist, proposed that the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis), an endemic suid from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, had been independently domesticated by a pre-Neolithic human population (that is, a non-sedentary foraging society) and translocated by watercraft to other islands in the region. This conflicts with two central premises in our understanding of the origins of animal domestication: (1) that the wolf was the only animal domesticated by hunter-gatherers prior to the Neolithic farming transition around 12,000-10,000 years ago; and (2) that the beginnings of pig domestication were inextricably tied to the advent of crop-raising and settled agrarian communities. This paper considers whether it is plausible to suggest that a non-sedentary population of hunter-gatherers could have domesticated a wild suid. It is proposed that pre-agricultural foragers could have established a close association with wild-living members of S. celebensis that was similar to the relationship of interspecies companionship that is purported to have existed between Late Pleistocene foragers and juvenile wolves, according to some, leading to the first domesticated dogs. The Sulawesi warty pig (S. celebensis) is a wild and still-extant suid that is endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It has long been theorised that S. celebensis was domesticated and/or deliberately introduced to other islands in Indonesia prior to the advent of the Neolithic farming transition in the region. Thus far, however, there has been no empirical support for this idea, nor have scientists critiqued the argument that S. celebensis was a pre-Neolithic domesticate in detail. Here, it is proposed that early foragers could have formed a relationship with S. celebensis that was similar in essence to the close association between Late Pleistocene foragers in Eurasia and the wild wolf ancestors of domestic dogs. That is, a longstanding practice of hunter-gatherers intensively socialising wild-caught S. celebensis piglets for adoption into human society as companion animals ('pets') may have altered the predator-prey dynamic, brought aspects of wild pig behaviour and reproduction under indirect human selection and control, and caused changes that differentiated human-associated pigs from their solely wild-living counterparts.

AB  - The effect of ambient temperature on various physiological parameters were obtained to determine the upper critical temperature (UCT) in Iberian pigs. After an adaptation period at 28 degrees C, eight barrows (99 kg) were individually moved to two respirometry chambers and fed ad libitum (standard diet). The heat production (HP) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured over 24 h and some physiological parameters were measured every two days at 24, 26, 28, 30 and 32 degrees C. No differences (p > 0.05) were found in the heart rate (HR; 97.7 beats/min) and rectal temperature (RT; 39.7 degrees C) between ambient temperatures. Breathing rate (BR) and skin temperature (ST) increased (272 and 2.4%, respectively; p < 0.05) along with the temperature; whereas voluntary feed intake (VFI), retained energy (RE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) decreased (40.3, 65.8 and 10.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Overall, HP slightly decreased (19.2%; p < 0.01) when the temperature increased. The reduction in RE when the temperature increased was related more to the decrease in VFI rather than to the concomitant reduction in HP. The UCT can be established at 28 for BR, 30 for VFI and RE, and 32 degrees C for ST, HP and RQ. Overall, the UCT was stablished at 28-30 degrees C, indicating the good adaptation of Iberian pigs to heat.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the expression patterns of secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) in the ovaries of Hu sheep and to explore the key downstream factors of SFRP5 in sheep granulosa cells (GCs) using RNA-seq. In the present study, SFRP5 was widely expressed in the ovary and localized to GCs and oocytes during various stages of follicular development. In addition, the expression of SFRP5 increased with follicular diameter. In contrast to the negative control, SFRP5 knockdown promoted the EdU-positive cell rate with an increase in PCNA mRNA and protein levels, whereas SFRP5 overexpression had the opposite effect. In addition, the cell cycle was propelled from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase with the upregulation of CCNB1, CCND1, CDK1, and CDK4 after SFRP5 knockdown. Moreover, SFRP5 overexpression enhanced the apoptosis of GCs with increased Caspase3 protein levels. Following SFRP5 knockdown, differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the PI3K/AKT, MAPK, Wnt, and Hippo signaling pathways, and several related candidate genes such as MMP1, MMP3, SFRP4, INHA, TGFA, and CASP3 were screened. In general, this study enhances our understanding of the expression of SFRP5 in the GCs of Hu sheep, along with its functions in follicular development.

AB  - Thiabendazole (TBZ) is a broad - spectrum anthelmintic and fungicide used in humans, animals, and agricultural commodities. TBZ residues are present in crops and animal products, including milk, posing a risk to food safety and public health. ABCG2 is a membrane transporter which affects bioavailability and milk secretion of xenobiotics. Therefore, the aim of this work was to characterize the role of ABCG2 in the in vitro transport and secretion into milk of 5 - hydroxythiabendazole (5OH - TBZ), the main TBZ metabolite. Using MDCK - II polarized cells transduced with several species variants of ABCG2, we first demonstrated that 5OH - TBZ is efficiently in vitro transported by ABCG2. Subsequently, using Abcg2 knockout mice, we demonstrated that 5OH - TBZ secretion into milk was affected by Abcg2, with a more than 2 - fold higher milk concentration and milk to plasma ratio in wild - type mice compared to their Abcg2 - / - counterpart.

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the impact of different levels of nano-potassium molybdate (nano-K2MoO4) fertilization on the copper (Cu) metabolism in grazing the Pishan red sheep in the natural pasture. The fertilization and grazing experiments were conducted on the Pishan farm in Southern Xinjiang, China. The natural pastures of 16 hm(2) were randomly divided into four groups (4 hm(2)/group), consisting of group C (no fertilized), group I, group II, and group III. The fertilizing amount of Mo from nano-K2MoO4 was 0, 7, 8, and 9 kg/hm(2) for group C, group I, group II, and group III, respectively. The 40 Pishan red sheep were randomly distributed to the tested pastures for 90 days, and the 10 sheep/group. The results showed that the contents of Mo and N in forage from the fertilized pastures were extremely increased (P < 0.01). The yield and dry matter digestibility of forage in fertilized pastures were significantly higher than those in no fertilized pasture (P < 0.01). The values of crude protein (CP) and crude fat (EE) in forage from fertilized pastures were significantly increased (P < 0.01). The Mo contents in the blood and liver in the Pishan red sheep from fertilized pastures were greatly increased (P < 0.01). The Cu contents in the blood and liver in the Pishan red sheep from the fertilized pastures were greatly decreased (P < 0.01). The activities of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in group I, group II, and group III were extremely lower than those in group C (P < 0.01), and the contents of serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in group I, group II, and group III were greatly higher than those from group C (P < 0.01). In summary, the application of nano-K2MoO4 improved the nutritive values and the yield of forage, but overuse will remarkably reduce the Cu contents of blood and greatly interfere with the Cu metabolism, leading to the Cu deficiency and low antioxidant capacity in grazing the ruminants.

AB  - Identified as the pathogenic genes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mainly lead to early-onset AD, whose course is more aggressive, and atypical symptoms are more common than sporadic AD. Here, a novel missense mutation, APP E674Q (also named "Shanghai APP"), was detected in a Chinese index patient with typical late-onset AD (LOAD) who developed memory decline in his mid-70s. The results from neuroimaging were consistent with AD, where widespread amyloid b deposition was demonstrated in 18F-florbe-tapir Positron Emission Tomography (PET). APP E674Q is close to the b-secretase cleavage site and the well-studied Swedish APP mutation (KM670/671NL), which was predicted to be pathogenic in silico. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the E674Q mutation resulted in a rearrangement of the interaction mode between APP and BACE1 and that the E674Q mutation was more prone to cleavage by BACE1. The in vitro results suggested that the E674Q mutation was pathogenic by facilitating the BACE1-mediated processing of APP and the production of AO. Furthermore, we applied an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated transfer of the human E674Q mutant APP gene to the hippocampi of two-month-old C57Bl/6 J mice. AAV-E674Q-injected mice exhibited impaired learning behavior and increased pathological burden in the brain, implying that the E674Q mutation had a pathogenicity that bore a comparison with the classical Swedish mutation. Collectively, we report a strong amyloidogenic effect of the E674Q substitution in AD. To our knowledge, E674Q is the only pathogenic mutation within the amyloid processing sequence causing LOAD. 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Paper mulberry ( Broussonetia papyrifera ) is a fast-growing tree known for its tolerance to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. To explore genes combating Verticillium wilt, a devasting and formidable disease damage to cotton and many economically significant crops, we purified an antifungal protein, named BpAFP, from the latex of paper mulberry. Based on peptide fingerprint, we cloned the full cDNA sequence of BpAFP and revealed that BpAFP belongs to Class I chitinases, sharing 74 % identity with B. papyrifera leaf chitinase, PMAPII. We further introduced BpAFP into Arabidopsis , tobacco, and cotton. Transgenic plants exhibited significant resistance to Verticillium wilt. Importantly, BpAFP also demonstrated insecticidal activity against herbivorous pests, Plutella xylostella , and Prodenia litura , when feeding the larvae with transgenic leaves . Our finding unveils a dual role of BpAFP in conferring resistance to both plant diseases and lepidopterous pests.

AB  - The ectoparasitoid wasp Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), as a widely distributed ectoparasitoid wasp, can parasitize several Coleopteran insect pests such as the lesser grain borer Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera, Bostrichidae). In the current study, the plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions with A. calandrae and R. dominica on six cultivars of wheat Triticum aestivum L. (Poals: Poaceae), including Aftab, Araz, Ghabos, Kalateh, Meraj, and Tirgan, were assessed. The largest egg and larval-pupal periods of R. dominica were observed on cultivars Tirgan and Aftab. Rhyzopertha dominica reared on cultivar Araz had the largest total developmental period. The highest oviposition period and fecundity of R. dominica were observed on cultivar Meraj. The pest had the brief life and the low fecundity duration on cultivar Tirgan. The longest developmental time of A. calandrae was observed on the cultivar Tirgan. The parasitic wasp lived longer on cultivar Ghabos. The developmental time of A. calandrae was positively affected by phenolic content of wheat cultivars. The fecundity and intrinsic rate of increase (r) of the parasitic wasp were significantly decreased by increasing the phenolic content of the cultivars. In general, the cultivar Meraj was sensitive, the cultivars Aftab and Kalateh were semi-resistant, and the cultivars Araz, Ghabos, and Tirgan were resistant to R. dominica. The cultivar Tirgan was found as an unsuitable host compared to others for performance of A. calandrae, while Aftab, Kalateh, Araz, and Meraj were suitable ones. Consequently, the use of cultivar Araz as a resistant host to R. dominica and the suitable cultivar to A. calandrae can be considered as an effective integrated management choice against the pest.

AB  - The IntelliCage allows automated testing of cognitive abilities of mice in a social home cage environment without handling by human experimenters. Restricted water access in combination with protocols in which only correct responses give access to water is a reliable learning motivator for hippocampus-dependent tasks assessing spatial memory and executive function. However, water restriction may negatively impact on animal welfare, especially in poor learners. To better comply with the 3R principles, we previously tested protocols in which water was freely available but additional access to sweetened water could be obtained by learning a task rule. While this purely appetitive motivation worked for simple tasks, too many mice lost interest in the sweet reward during more difficult hippocampus-dependent tasks. In the present study, we tested a battery of increasingly difficult spatial tasks in which water was still available without learning the task rule, but rendered less attractive either by adding bitter tasting quinine or by increasing the amount of work to obtain it. As in previous protocols, learning of the task rule provided access to water sweetened with saccharin. The two approaches of dual motivation were tested in two cohorts of female C57BL/6 N mice. Compared to purely appetitive motivation, both novel protocols strongly improved task engagement and increased task performance. Importantly, neither of the added disincentives had an adverse impact on liquid consumption, health status or body weight of the animals. Our results show that it is possible to refine test protocols in the IntelliCage so that they challenge cognitive functions without restricting access to water.

AB  - Modifying established behavior in novel situations is essential, and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders often lack this flexibility. Understanding how novelty affects behavioral flexibility therefore has therapeutic potential. Here, novelty differentially impacts connectivity within the ventral tegmental-hippocampal-medial prefrontal (VTA-HPC-mPFC) circuit, thereby enhancing the ability of mice to overcome established behavioral bias and adapt to new rules. Circuit connectivity was measured by local field potential (LFP) coherence. As mice exposed to novelty learned to overcome previously established spatial bias, the ventral HPC (vHPC) strengthens its coherence with the VTA and mPFC in theta frequency (4-8 Hz). Novelty or learning did not affect circuits involving the dorsal HPC (dHPC). Without novelty, however, mice continued following established spatial bias and connectivity strength remained stable in the VTA-HPC-mPFC circuit. Pharmacologically blocking dopamine D1-receptors (D1Rs) in the vHPC abolished the behavioral and physiological impacts of novelty. Thus, novelty promotes behavioral adaptation by permitting learning-associated plasticity in the vHPC-mPFC and VTA-vHPC circuit, a process mediated by D1Rs in the vHPC.

AB  - As stormwater management embarks on a new journey of resource allocation and disparity, addressing the contamination resulting from deicing salts is a growing concern for designers and land planners. Turf and native grass variety are currently one of the most readily available and adaptive resources to address some of these ever increasing hydrologic concerns. However, little is known about the water quality efficiency and optimal design layout of turf and native grasses in urban or rural landscapes with regards to salt remediation. In this study, a five plot series of grass swales was utilized in this study to measure water quality efficiency and salt tolerance of turf and native grasses. The grass varieties that were tested in this study include; Common hard fescue (Festuca trachyphylla), Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra commutata), and sheep fescue (Festuca ovina). Results showed that the grass swales that made up of a blend of grass variety were the most successful at reducing saline and TDS levels as compared to their monoculture counterparts. The findings reveal that a relatively simple grass swale could provide excellent salt and TDS reduction when utilizing a blend of grass varieties; specifically a hard fescue and sheep fescue blend.

AB  - Simple Summary The horns of dairy cows are typically removed at a young age. However, surprisingly little is known about the biological function and the role of horns in the regulation of body temperature, or about the potential effects of horn removal for the cow. Farmers reported that horns get warmer during rumination, and studies on goats indicate that horns help with the regulation of body temperature. To study the possible function of horns in the regulation of body temperature in dairy cows, we used infrared thermography to measure the superficial temperature of the horns, eyes, and ears of 18 cows on three different farms in the Netherlands. Social and non-social behaviours of these cows were registered as well. Based on environmental temperature, humidity, and wind speed, the heat load index (HLI) was calculated as a measure of the heat load experienced by a cow. The temperature of the horns rose by 0.18 degrees C per unit HLI, indicating that the horns serve to lose heat. Dehorned cows had higher eye temperatures than horned cows, though this result may not be reliable due to the low sample size and experimental setup. We did not, however, find changes in horn temperature during rumination, nor with any other behaviours. Our study supports a role of horns in the regulation of body temperature, but not related to rumination. These results should be considered when measuring the potential effects of horn removal, a painful procedure. Dairy cattle are typically disbudded or dehorned. Little is known, however, about the biological function and role of horns during thermoregulatory processes in cattle, and thus about the potential physiological consequences of horn removal. Anecdotal evidence suggests that dairy cow horns increase in temperature during rumination, and few studies on other bovid species indicate that horns aid thermoregulation. The objective of this study was, therefore, to elucidate a possible thermoregulatory function of the horns in dairy cattle. Using non-invasive infrared thermography, we measured the superficial temperature of the horns, eyes, and ears of 18 focal cows on three different farms in a temperate climate zone under various environmental circumstances. Observations of social and non-social behaviours were conducted as well. Based on environmental temperature, humidity, and wind speed, the heat load index (HLI) was calculated as a measure of the heat load experienced by a cow. The temperature of the horns increased by 0.18 degrees C per unit HLI, indicating that horns serve the dissipation of heat. Dehorned cows had higher eye temperatures than horned cows, though this result should be interpreted with caution as the low sample size and experimental setup prevent casual conclusions. We did not, however, find changes in horn temperature during rumination, nor with any other behaviours. Our study thus supports a role of horns in thermoregulation, but not related to rumination. These results should be considered when assessing the potential consequences of horn removal, a painful procedure.

AB  - The study assesses the impact of the live sheep export trade on the South African economy. The study used a recent South African Social Accounting Matrix and a partial equilibrium model. The results are mixed. On a positive note, the higher the demand for live sheep exports, the higher the prices and the more significant the economic impact. On the other hand, South Africa loses value -adding opportunities such as output from abattoirs, including hides and skin, offal, head, and consumable internal organs, and employment when live lambs are exported and slaughtered in destination markets. These findings help policymakers to develop appropriate mitigation strategies to balance the advantages and disadvantages of live sheep export. A nationwide analysis may miss some of the local costs and benefits of live sheep exports. Future research can also be done in selected major areas that produce sheep in South Africa.

AB  - There are no standard protocols for assessing antibiosis in soybean, Glycine max (L.) (Fabaceae), cultivars to lepidopterans, including tobacco budworm, Chloridea virescens (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), an important species that causes damage to soybean crops in several production regions. This study was conducted to assess methodologies to determine the optimal combination of larval density, confinement container size, and plant structure in soybean antibiosis assays to C. virescens. In addition, primary and secondary metabolites in plant structures were analyzed to elucidate potential chemical resistance mechanisms against this lepidopteran. Antibiosis assays to C. virescens in resistant (IAC-100) and susceptible (BR-16) soybean cultivars were performed using three larval densities (one, two, and three larvae), two confinement container sizes (150 and 300 ml), and combinations of soybean plant structures (leaves, uncut pods, leaves + uncut pods, cut pods, and leaves + cut pods). Phenol, tannin, fiber, and lignin contents were quantified in the leaves, uncut pods, and grains of the soybean cultivars and related to biological development of C. virescens. Resistance levels in soybean cultivars in antibiosis assays were best differentiated using one larva per 150-ml confinement container, fed only on soybean leaves. Higher contents of condensed tannins in the leaves of IAC-100 cultivar may be one of the main chemical mechanisms of resistance to C. virescens. Our study is the first to determine the optimal combination of larval density, confinement container size, and plant structure for antibiosis assays in soybean cultivars to C. virescens. The developed protocol will benefit high-throughput phenotyping in genetic breeding programs to obtain cultivars resistant to lepidopterans for use in integrated pest management.

AB  - The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta, RIFA) is a globally invasive species with strong sensitivity to environmental conditions. This study investigated the seasonal dynamics and colony structure of RIFA over the course of one year across two typical habitats in South China: Camellia oleifera plantations and fishponds. The results revealed clear seasonal patterns in caste composition. Worker abundance peaked during winter (December-January), while reproductive individuals (queens, males, and alates) emerged primarily in spring and early summer (March-May). Colony biomass, worker number, and individual dry weight were significantly higher in C. oleifera plantations, whereas fishpond habitats exhibited greater numbers of larvae and male alates, suggesting different reproductive allocation strategies across habitats. An analysis of caste composition indicated that adult workers were dominant in both habitats, but the proportion of pupae was notably higher in fishpond colonies, especially in spring. Significant correlations were found between colony metrics and nest characteristics, including a negative relationship between worker body length and colony biomass. Environmental factor analysis showed that air pressure positively influenced worker numbers, while temperature was negatively associated with them. Precipitation and humidity played key roles in regulating larval and pupal populations. Overall, RIFA exhibited strong seasonal patterns and ecological plasticity in response to habitat differences and environmental variables. These findings provide insights into the species' invasion biology and inform habitat-specific monitoring and management strategies.

AB  - Chemerin (CHEM) is a hormone mainly expressed in adipocytes involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and inflammatory response. CHEM expression has been demonstrated in the structures of the porcine hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as well as in the uterus, trophoblasts and conceptuses of pigs. In this study, we performed high-throughput proteomic analyses (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, LC-MS/MS) to examine the influence of CHEM (400 ng/mL) on differentially regulated proteins (DRPs) in the porcine endometrial tissue explants during implantation (15 to 16 days of gestation). Among all 352 DRPs, 164 were up-regulated and 188 were down-regulated in CHEM-treated group. DRPs were assigned to 47 gene ontology (GO) terms (p-adjusted < 0.05). Validation of four DRPs (IFIT5, TGF beta 1, ACO1 and PGRMC1) by Western blot analysis confirmed the veracity and accuracy of the LC-MS/MS method used in the present study. We suggest that CHEM, by modulating various protein expressions, takes part in the endometrial cell proliferation, migration and invasion at the time of implantation. It also regulates the endometrial immune response, sensitivity to P4 and the formation of new blood vessels. Additionally, CHEM appears to be an important factor involved in endothelial cell dysfunction during the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The identification of a large number of DRPs under the influence of CHEM provides a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms of this hormone action during implantation, which is a prerequisite for better control of pig reproduction.

AB  - This study investigated whether dietary supplementation with magnolol affects growth performance, anti-inflammatory abilities, serum and muscle amino acid profiles, and metabolisms in growing pigs. A total of 42 seventy-days-old growing barrows (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) were randomly allocated into two dietary groups: Con, control group (basal diet); and Mag, magnolol group (basal diet supplemented with 400 mg/kg of magnolol). The results revealed that dietary supplementation with magnolol had no effect (p > 0.05) on growth performance. However, magnolol supplementation remarkably increased (p < 0.05) the serum content of albumin, total protein, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and interleukin-22. In addition, dietary magnolol supplementation altered the amino acid (AA) profiles in serum and dorsal muscle and particularly increased (p < 0.05) the serum content of arginine and muscle glutamate. Simultaneously, the mRNA expression of genes associated with AA transport in jejunum (SLC38A2, SLC1A5, and SLC7A1) and ileum (SLC1A5 and SLC7A1) was higher (p < 0.05) in the Mag group than in the Con group. Additionally, the serum metabolomics analysis showed that the addition of magnolol significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) arginine biosynthesis, as well as D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism. Overall, these results suggested that dietary supplementation with magnolol has the potential to improve the accumulation of AAs, protein synthesis, immunity, and body health in growing pigs by increasing intestinal absorption and the transport of AAs.

AB  - Background. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating and degenerative joint disease, which is characterized by progressive destruction of articular cartilage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been implicated in the treatment of OA. However, the function of adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) in OA and its underlying mechanism remain obscure. Aim. We aimed to explore the function of AD-MSCs in OA and investigate its potential regulatory mechanism. Methods. A guinea pig model of OA was constructed. AD-MSCs injected into the articular cavity of OA guinea pigs were viewed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. The effect of AD-MSCs on the gonarthritis of OA guinea pigs was evaluated through both macroscopic and microscopic detections. The detailed molecular mechanism was predicted by GEO databases and bioinformatics tools and then verified via mechanism experiments, including ChIP assay, DNA pulldown assay, and luciferase reporter assay. Results. AD-MSCs had a significant positive therapeutic effect on the gonarthritis of the OA model, and the overall effects of it was better than that of sodium hyaluronate (SH). B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) was significantly downregulated in the articular cartilage of the OA guinea pigs. Furthermore, BTG2 was positively regulated by Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in AD-MSCs at the transcriptional level. AD-MSCs performed an effect on KLF4 expression at the transcriptional levels. Conclusion. AD-MSCs suppresses OA progression through KLF4-induced transcriptional activation of BTG2. Our findings revealed an AD-MSCs-dominated therapeutic method for OA.

AB  - Flaxseed meal (FSM) is a byproduct of flaxseed oil extraction which has rich nutritional value and can be used as a high-quality new protein ingredient. However, the anti-nutrient factor (ANF) in FSM restricts its potential application in feed. The strategy of microbial fermentation is a highly effective approach to reducing ANF in FSM and enhancing its feeding value. However, evaluation of the nutritional value of fermented flaxseed meal (FFSM) in growing pigs has not yet been conducted. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the nutritional value of FFSM in growing pigs and comparison of the effect of fermentation treatment on improving the nutritional value of FSM. Two experiments were conducted to determine the available energy value, apparent digestibility of nutrients, and standard ileal digestibility of amino acids of FSM and FFSM in growing pigs. The results showed as follows: (1) Fermentation treatment increased the levels of crude protein (CP), Ca and P in FSM by 2.86%, 9.54% and 4.56%, while decreasing the concentration of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) by 34.09% and 12.71%, respectively (p < 0.05); The degradation rate of CGs in FSM was 54.09% (p < 0.05); (2) The digestible energy (DE) and metabolic energy (ME) of FSM and FFSM were 14.54 MJ/kg, 16.68 MJ/kg and 12.85 MJ/kg, 15.24 MJ/kg, respectively; (3) Compared with FSM, dietary FFSM supplementation significantly increased the apparent digestibility of CP, NDF, ADF, Ca, and P of growing pigs (p < 0.05) and significantly increased the standard ileal digestibility of methionine (p < 0.05). These results indicate that fermentation treatment could effectively enhance the nutritional value of FSM and provide basic theoretical data for the application of FFSM in pig production.

AB  - The bacteriophage infection cycle is terminated at a predefined time to release the progeny virions via a robust lytic system composed of holin, endolysin, and spanin proteins. Holin is the timekeeper of this process. Pinholin S-21 is a prototype holin of phage Phi 21, which determines the timing of host cell lysis through the coordinated efforts of pinholin and antipinholin. However, mutations in pinholin and antipinholin play a significant role in modulating the timing of lysis depending on adverse or favorable growth conditions. Earlier studies have shown that single point mutations of pinholin S-21 alter the cell lysis timing, a proxy for pinholin function as lysis is also dependent on other lytic proteins. In this study, continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) power saturation and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopic techniques were used to directly probe the effects of mutations on the structure and conformational changes of pinholin S-21 that correlate with pinholin function. DEER and CW-EPR power saturation data clearly demonstrate that increased hydrophilicity induced by residue mutations accelerate the externalization of antipinholin transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1), while increased hydrophobicity prevents the externalization of TMD1. This altered hydrophobicity is potentially accelerating or delaying the activation of pinholin S-21. It was also found that mutations can influence intra- or intermolecular interactions in this system, which contribute to the activation of pinholin and modulate the cell lysis timing. This could be a novel approach to analyze the mutational effects on other holin systems, as well as any other membrane protein in which mutation directly leads to structural and conformational changes.

AB  - Conservation translocations have the potential to strengthen populations of threatened and endangered species, but facilitating integration of translocated individuals with resident populations remains a substantial challenge. Developing functional social relationships like cooperative partnerships or establishing clear dominance hierarchies may be critical to integration of released individuals. Developing such relationships has not received much attention in translocation research, especially for long-lived, socially complex animals for which establishment and navigation of social environments is often a lengthy process that requires sustained monitoring to understand. Here, we present a case study of the social associations of African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) calves that have been rehabilitated and released into a fenced wildlife sanctuary in northern Kenya with a resident population of elephants. We use focal follows of interactions pre-release and GPS tracking post-release to quantify social associations of calves with each other and with resident elephants at the release site. We demonstrate how this approach supports translocation monitoring by capturing temporal trends in social patterns within and between release cohorts and among released elephants and wild elephants already resident at the site during a transitional soft release period. Our results show that initial post-release social behavior of rehabilitated calves is related to histories of interaction with familiar individuals and cohort membership and that released calves increased their associations with residents over time. This information provides new behavioral insights for guiding elephant release projects, like the strength of relationships within and among release cohorts, the time to integration with the resident population, and the occurrence and increased incidence of societal fission-fusion. Further, this study provides an example of the utility of animal behavior research to achieve and assess progress towards conservation objectives, and to develop monitoring tools for conservation managers.

AB  - Plateau adaptation in animals involves genetic mechanisms as well as coevolutionary mechanisms of the microbiota and metabolome of the animal. Therefore, the characteristics of the rumen microbiome and metabolome, transcriptome, and serum metabolome of Tibetan sheep at different altitudes (4500 m, 3500 m, and 2500 m) were analyzed. The results showed that the rumen differential metabolites at 3500 m and 4500 m were mainly enriched in amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism, and there was a significant correlation with microbiota. The differentially expressed genes and metabolites at middle and high altitudes were coenriched in asthma, arachidonic acid metabolism, and butanoate and propanoate metabolism. In addition, the serum differential metabolites at 3500 m and 4500 m were mainly enriched in amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, and they were also related to microbiota. Further analysis revealed that rumen metabolites accounted for 7.65% of serum metabolites. These common metabolites were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways and were significantly correlated with host genes (p < 0.05). This study found that microbiota, metabolites, and epithelial genes were coenriched in pathways related to lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and immune metabolism, which may be involved in the regulation of Tibetan sheep adaptation to plateau environmental changes.

AB  - Mechanical forces are increasingly recognized as important determinants of cell and tissue phenotype and also appear to play a critical role in organ development. During the fetal stages of lung morphogenesis, the pressure of the fluid within the lumen of the airways is higher than that within the chest cavity, resulting in a positive transpulmonary pressure. Several congenital defects decrease or reverse transpulmonary pressure across the developing airways and are associated with a reduced number of branches and a correspondingly underdeveloped lung that is insufficient for gas exchange after birth. The small size of the early pseudoglandular stage lung and its relative inaccessibility in utero have precluded experimental investigation of the effects of transpulmonary pressure on early branching morphogenesis. Here, we present a simple culture model to explore the effects of negative transpulmonary pressure on development of the embryonic airways. We found that negative transpulmonary pressure decreases branching, and that it does so in part by altering the expression of fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10). The morphogenesis of lungs maintained under negative transpulmonary pressure can be rescued by supplementing the culture medium with exogenous FGF10. These data suggest that Fgf10 expression is regulated by mechanical stress in the developing airways. Understanding the mechanical signaling pathways that connect transpulmonary pressure to FGF10 can lead to the establishment of novel non-surgical approaches for ameliorating congenital lung defects.

AB  - Simple Summary The need to identify sustainable and profitable resources for the elaboration of useful feeds in animal nutrition has been the focus of many studies. Insect-based feeds have been tested by introduction into the diets of pigs, poultry, and fish, with interesting results. Worldwide, solid waste management has increased because of economic and population growth, and most investigations have concentrated on identifying efficient solutions to reduce this waste. Aquaculture has experienced exceptional growth and is perceived as having the greatest potential to meet the growing demand for food in the world, by using aquatic species that serve as a protein source in the diet and therefore contribute to the food security of the population. There are studies with the use of black soldier flies (BSF) as a potential feed agent for animals with high protein content. The relevance of evaluating different food resources in the BSF-immature stages is important because the quantity and quality of the food provided to the fly larvae generate different responses on the growth and development of this insect used as animal feed. The black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens (BSF, Diptera: Stratiomyidae) is an insect with high protein value and a potential feed agent for animals aimed for human consumption. The growth parameters of BSF larvae reared on four substrates-restaurant-waste, fruit-waste, fish-waste, and commercial tilapia food-for 41 days before processing for inclusion into Oreochromis niloticus (Perciformes: Cichlidae, Nile tilapia) commercial fry diets at 30% (70:30) were determined. On fly larvae, the food substrate based on restaurant waste yielded the greatest larval weight and length. BSF larvae fed a fish-waste diet showed the shortest developmental time. The fruit-waste diet induced the lowest weight and length in the fly larvae/pre-pupae (immature stage). The pre-pupal protein values were similar to commercial food. On fry-fish, the diets with pre-pupae grown on fish waste showed the greatest yields regarding weight (biomass), length, and nutritional content. These results suggest the BSF has the potential to be used in fish feed and provides an alternative for commercial cultivation.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric illness and a significant contributor to the global burden of disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying depression are complex and have yet to be fully elucidated. Previous studies demonstrated that collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) involved in the onset of depression, but its role is unclear yet. To explore the mechanism of CRMP2 in depression and whether it ameliorates depressive-like behaviours by modulating synaptic functions, we manipulate the expression of CRMP2 by adeno-associated virus (AAV) injected into the hippocampal CA1 region and then induced depressive-like behaviour by subjecting the mice to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPM), forced swimming test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST) are utilized to detect behavioral changes. Golgi-Cox staining and electron microscopy were applied to examine alterations in the structure and morphology of neural synapses. Synaptophysin (SYP), synaptophysin 1 (SYN1), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), glutamate receptor 2 (GLUR2) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) is tested for synaptic function. The proteins interacting with CRMP2 were comprehensively investigated utilizing Immunoprecipitation-Mass Spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis and the direct binding between CRMP2 and PSD95 was validated. In our study, we observed CRMP2 in the hippocampal CA1 region was downregulated following CUMS. Knockdown of CRMP2 resulted in impaired synaptic structure and decreased expression of synapse-associated proteins, accompanied by increased depressive-like behaviour, like anhedonia and hopelessness. Conversely, overexpression of CRMP2 significantly ameliorated behavioural deficits associated with depression and restore the compromised synaptic structure and function. Our findings suggest that CRMP2 exerts a crucial function in modulating depressive-like behaviours by influencing the synaptic structure and function, and it can directly interact with PSD95.

AB  - Coherent patterns of inter-related behaviors that occur across time and contexts, also known as personality or consistent individual differences (CIDs), are important to identify among livestock as they carry valuable information for selective breeding purposes. Repeated testing is necessary to reveal behavioral patterns, yet temporal stability of behavioral traits is often assumed. In this study, three human-animal interaction (HAI) tests were employed within a flock of sheep maintained in the Sierra-Nevada foothills to assess intra-individual consistency and inter- relatedness of behavioral responses. Groups of five (four or six when needed) ewes were placed in three HAI tests (restrained Human Contact, unrestrained Human Presence and unrestrained Human Approach) at the time of post-breeding, gestation and weaning (3 x per year; over 2 years). PCs were created using principal component analysis (PCA) of behaviors from the unrestrained Human Presence test and were compared to the behaviors from the two other HAI tests to evaluate cross-contextual relationships. Frequency of 'environmental vigilance' (EV), 'investigating fence' (IF) and duration of 'head down' (HD) were the only variables to achieve a moderate repeatability estimate [EV: 0.32 +/- 0.09, [CI (0.21, 0.48])]; IF: 0.29 +/- 0.13, [CI (0.14, 0.48)]; HD: 0.44 +/- 0.15, [CI (0.22, 0.68)]. PCA revealed a single component in all Human Presence tests that was characterized by loadings (>0.45) for duration of 'grazing' and 'environmental vigilance'. Spearman's rank order analysis revealed no significant correlations between PC1 of each replicate. There was also no significant inter-relatedness identified between behaviors of each HAI test. Taken together, it is suggested that the rangeland ewes of this study exhibited consistency of some individual behaviors within the Human Contact and Human Presence test, however, did not demonstrate a temporally stable trait that can be generalized across multiple contexts. Future work should evaluate the influence of extensive versus intensive management styles on the development and maintenance of human-oriented behavioral traits.

AB  - Over the past decade, multiple studies have suggested that the secondary metabolites produced by plants against herbivorous insects could be used as biopesticides. However, as the molecular mechanism of action of these compounds remains unknown, it is difficult to predict how they would affect non-target insects; thus, their innocuity needs to be clarified. Here, we investigate, from the molecular level to the organism, the responses of a useful parasitic insect Nasonia vitripennis (Walker, 1836) being exposed at the pupae stage for 48 h (up to 6 days) to sublethal doses (5 mu g/L and 500 mu g/L) of 2-Dodecanone. 2-Dodecanone altered the gene expression of genes related to ecdysone-related pathways, biotransformation, and cell homeostasis. A significant induction of ecdysone response-genes (EcR, usp, E78, Hr4, Hr38) was detected, despite no significant differences in ecdysteroid levels. Regarding the cell homeostasis processes, the gene l(2)efl was differentially altered in both experimental conditions, and a dose-dependent induction of hex81 was observed. 2-Dodecanone also triggered an induction of Cyp6aQ5 activity. Finally, 2-Dodecanone exposure had a significant effect on neither development time, energy reserves, nor egg-laying capacity; no potential genotoxicity was detected. For the first time, this study shows evidence that 2-Dodecanone can modulate gene expression and interfere with the ecdysone signalling pathway in N. vitripennis. This could lead to potential endocrine alterations and highlight the suitability of this organism to improve our general understanding of the molecular effects of plant defences in insects. Our findings provide new insights into the toxicity of 2-Dodecanone that could potentially be explored in other species and under field conditions for plant protection and pest management as a means to reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides.

AB  - Spermatogenesis is a complex biological process crucial for male reproduction and is characterized by intricate interactions between testicular somatic cells and germ cells. Due to the cellular heterogeneity of the testes, investigating different cell types across developmental stages has been challenging. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a valuable approach for addressing this limitation. Here, we conducted an unbiased transcriptomic study of spermatogenesis in sexually mature 4-month-old Hezuo pigs using 10x Genomics-based scRNA-seq. A total of 16,082 cells were collected from Hezuo pig testes, including germ cells (spermatogonia (SPG), spermatocytes (SPCs), spermatids (SPTs), and sperm (SP)) and somatic cells (Sertoli cells (SCs), Leydig cells (LCs), myoid cells (MCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and natural killer (NK) cells/macrophages). Pseudo-time analysis revealed that LCs and MCs originated from common progenitors in the Hezuo pig. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the different types of testicular germ cells were enriched in the PI3K-AKT, Wnt, HIF-1, and adherens junction signaling pathways, while the DEGs in testicular somatic cells were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction and antigen processing and presentation. Moreover, genes related to spermatogenesis, male gamete generation, sperm part, sperm flagellum, and peptide biosynthesis were expressed throughout spermatogenesis. Using immunohistochemistry, we verified several stage-specific marker genes (such as UCHL1, WT1, SOX9, and ACTA2) for SPG, SCs, and MCs. By exploring the changes in the transcription patterns of various cell types during spermatogenesis, our study provided novel insights into spermatogenesis and testicular cells in the Hezuo pig, thereby laying the foundation for the breeding and preservation of this breed.

AB  - The nasal cavity harbors diverse microbiota that contributes to human health and respiratory diseases. However, whether and to what extent the host genome shapes the nasal microbiome remains largely unknown. Here, by dissecting the human genome and nasal metagenome data from 1401 healthy individuals, we demonstrated that the top three host genetic principal components strongly correlated with the nasal microbiota diversity and composition. The genetic association analyses identified 63 genome-wide significant loci affecting the nasal microbial taxa and functions, of which 2 loci reached study-wide significance (p < 1.7 x 10(-10)): rs73268759 within CAMK2A associated with genus Actinomyces and family Actinomycetaceae; and rs35211877 near POM121L12 with Gemella asaccharolytica. In addition to respiratory-related diseases, the associated loci are mainly implicated in cardiometabolic or neuropsychiatric diseases. Functional analysis showed the associated genes were most significantly expressed in the nasal airway epithelium tissue and enriched in the calcium signaling and hippo signaling pathway. Further observational correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses consistently suggested the causal effects of Serratia grimesii and Yokenella regensburgei on cardiometabolic biomarkers (cystine, glutamic acid, and creatine). This study suggested that the host genome plays an important role in shaping the nasal microbiome.

AB  - Simple Summary Feed-intake optimization is important for the efficient growth of livestock and poultry, and the identification of factors regulating feed intake is crucial for efficient animal husbandry. Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) has been reported as an endogenous antagonist of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) and plays an important role in feed intake and energy homeostasis in mammals. In chickens, LEAP2 function is thought to be mainly antimicrobial, and its role in appetite regulation remains unexplored. This study aimed to outline the expression profiles of genes related to the ghrelin system in 20 different tissues of broiler chicks in different energy states. The expression levels of LEAP2 in the liver and small intestine varied significantly with changes in diet, and CDX4 may be a potential regulator of LEAP2 expression in the small intestine. Overall, the results of this study highlight the importance of LEAP2 for avian feed intake. Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), ghrelin, and GHSR have been reported to play important roles that influence feed intake in mammals. LEAP2, an endogenous antagonist of GHSR, plays an important role in the regulation of feed intake. However, chicken ghrelin has also been reported to have an inhibitory effect on feed intake. The role of the GOAT-Ghrelin-GHSR-LEAP2 axis in chicken-feed intake remains unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the changes in the tissue expression levels of these genes under different energy states. In this study, broiler chicks in different energy states were subjected to starvation and feeding, and relevant gene expression levels were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Different energy states significantly modulated the expression levels of LEAP2 and GHSR but did not significantly affect the expression levels of GOAT and ghrelin. A high expression level of LEAP2 was detected in the liver and the whole small intestine. Compared to the fed group, the fasted chicks showed significantly reduced LEAP2 expression levels in the liver and the small intestine; 2 h after being refed, the LEAP2 expression of the fasted chicks returned to the level of the fed group. Transcription factor prediction and results of a dual luciferase assay indicated that the transcription factor CDX4 binds to the LEAP2 promoter region and positively regulates its expression. High expression levels of GHSR were detected in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Moreover, we detected GHSR highly expressed in the jejunum-this finding has not been previously reported. Thus, GHSR may regulate intestinal motility, and this aspect needs further investigation. In conclusion, this study revealed the function of chicken LEAP2 as a potential feed-intake regulator and identified the potential mechanism governing its intestine-specific expression. Our study lays the foundations for future studies on avian feed-intake regulation.

AB  - Camel milk has important role in human nutrition in desert and semi-desert regions; this milk provides the man with all essential nutrients in addition to its medicinal properties. A study was conducted to determine the impact of parity order on nutrition values of camel milk overall four months postpartum under modern system. Eight she-camels were selected immediately after calving and assigned to two equal groups, early lactation (GY) and mid lactation (GD). Both groups were managed together at the same environmental conditions under intensive system. Collection of milk samples started at second week postpartum and continued biweekly interval up to end of 4th month postpartum. The total fat, protein, lactose, solid non-fat (SNF) and density percentages were determined by automatic milk analyzer device (lactoscan Model-90, Europe). Results elucidated that there was no significant difference of lactose and fat content between two groups throughout experiment period. Where the significant difference (P<0.05) of protein, SNF and density contents of milk were detected during lactation stages throughout four months. Otherwise, the levels of fat, lactose, protein and SNF were increased significantly (P<0.05) with advancement of lactation stage, beside fluctuation of density values during experiment period. The current study revealed that milk produced by young is slightly richer in fat content, whereas milk of old camel is richer in protein content. The variation of nutrition values of milk should be attributed to parities, calve number and physiological factors.

AB  - Histamine is a neuromodulator that affects gut motility and visceral sensitivity through intrinsic and extrinsic neural pathways, yet the mechanisms regulating histamine availability in these pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that enteric glia contribute to histamine clearance in the enteric nervous system (ENS) through their expression of the enzyme histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT). Glial HNMT expression was initially assessed using immunolabeling and gene expression, and functionally tested using CRISPR-Cas9 to create a Cre-dependent conditional Hnmt ablation model targeting glia. Immunolabeling, calcium imaging, and visceromotor reflex recordings were used to assess the effects on ENS structure and visceral hypersensitivity. Immunolabeling and gene expression data show that enteric neurons and glia express HNMT. Deleting Hnmt in Sox10+ enteric glia increased glial histamine levels and altered visceromotor responses to colorectal distension in male mice, with no effect in females. Interestingly, deleting glial Hnmt protected males from histamine-driven visceral hypersensitivity. These data uncover a significant role for glial HNMT in histamine degradation in the gut, which impacts histamine-driven visceral hypersensitivity in a sex-dependent manner. Changes in the capacity of glia to clear histamines could play a role in the susceptibility to developing visceral pain in disorders of the gut-brain interaction.

AB  - In South Korea, environmental complaints related to livestock odors continue to increase, and various efforts are underway to overcome them. An objective of this study is to monitor indoor concentrations of ammonia and sulfur-based odorous substances emitted from laying hen houses in South Korea through on-site visits for one year to understand their temporal emission patterns. The highest concentration was found in ammonia (NH3), at 6.92 ppmv, followed by hydrogen sulfide (H2S), at 8.98 ppbv. The concentrations of methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) ranged from sub ppbv to 10 ppbv. In general, there was no consistent concentration distribution of ammonia and sulfur-based odorous substances in laying hen houses between those with forced ventilation and natural ventilation. Regarding the seasonal distribution of odorous compounds, their concentrations in winter season (December to February) when the ventilation rate in laying hen houses decreased were generally higher than those in the summer season (June to August) when the ventilation rate in poultry buildings was relatively high, which is applied to properly maintain the thermal environment in laying hen houses. The limitation of this study is that unexpected conditions such as clearance of laying hen houses, chicken shipments, and disorders of exhaust fans were not controlled for intentionally due to on-site investigations.

AB  - Memory is the ability to store, retrieve and use information that requires a progressive time-dependent stabilization process known as consolidation to be established. The hippocampus is essential for processing all the information that forms memory, especially spatial memory. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) affects memory, so in this study we investigated the participation and recruitment of NPY receptors during spatial memory consolidation in rats. Using the water maze test, we show that NPY (1 pmol) injected into the dorsal hippocampus impaired memory consolidation and that previous restraint stress (30 min) potentiates NPY effects, i.e. further impaired memory consolidation. Using selective antagonists for NPY Y-1 and Y-2 receptors we demonstrate that both receptors play a key role on spatial memory consolidation. Our data suggest that NPY modulates aversive and adaptive memory formation by NPY receptors activation.

AB  - The upper Hauterivian-lower Barremian sedimentary sequences of the Agua de la Mula Member of the Agrio Formation (Neuque & PRIME;n Basin, Argentina) represent shallow marine environments characterized by mixed silici-clastic-carbonate deposition. Ten benthic foraminiferal associations based on species composition were defined and evaluated in relation to explanatory variables such as facies, sequence stratigraphy, location and age. Variations in sedimentation rates, food and oxygen availability related to relative sea-level changes largely control distribution of the benthic foraminiferal associations. Four associations (Guttulina sp., Polymorphinids, Spiroplectammina sp.2-Haplophragmoides sp.1, and Planularia madagascariensis) are mostly composed by shallow infaunal, bacterial and detritivorous foraminiferal scavengers that largely occur in sandy facies within 3rd-order regressive systems tracts. These associations are thought to be indicative of well oxygenated and organic matter-rich sediments below the sediment-water interface. The remaining six associations consist of epifaunal, mainly opportunistic foraminifera with active herbivorous and detritivorous trophic strategies. Among them, Epistomina hechti -Epistomina australis and Reinholdella hofkeri associations occur in fine-grained, dark shales throughout 3rd-order transgressive systems tracts, and are considered related to oxygen and food stressed environment. An integrated approach, using benthic foraminifera (alpha diversity analysis, epifaunal/infaunal ratio) and multi-variate statistical methods (cluster analysis, RDA, partial-RDA, PERMANOVA, PCoA), allowed to evaluate the paleosynecological significance of benthic associations, and to relate certain paleoenvironmental settings to relative sea-level changes recorded in the Agua de la Mula Member. The application of foraminiferal associations analysis in the paleoenvironmental interpretations led to recognize the influence of major relative sea-level changes in shaping higher-frequency sequences for this sector of the Neuque & PRIME;n Basin. Such approach can also be applied to other sectors of the basin and to high-frequency sedimentary sequences of comparable shallow marine settings.

AB  - Bacterial infections are among the major factors that cause stress and intestinal diseases in piglets. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the Gram-negative bacteria outer membrane, is commonly employed for inducing an immune response in normal organisms for convenience. The association between LPS stimulation and gut immunity has been reported. However, the effects of gut immunity on microbial homeostasis and metabolism of host, especially bile acid and lipid metabolism in piglets, remain unclear. Hence, in the current study, we elucidated the effect of gut immunity on microbial balance and host metabolism. Twenty-one-day-old healthy piglets (male) were randomly assigned into the CON and LPS groups. After 4 hours of treatment, related tissues and cecal contents were obtained for further analysis. The obtained results showed that stimulated LPS considerably damaged the morphology of intestinal villi and enhanced the relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Besides, LPS partially changed the microbial structure as indicated by a-diversity and increased operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to Oxalobacter and Ileibacterium. Furthermore, bile acid, a large class of gut microbiota metabolites, was also assessed by many proteins related to the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. It was also revealed that LPS markedly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of TGR5 and FXR (bile acid receptors) in the ileum, which expressed negative feedback on bile acid de novo synthesis. Additionally, results indicated upregulated mRNA of genes associated with the production of bile acid in the liver tissues. Moreover, LPS reduced the expression of bile acid transporters in the ileum and liver tissues and further disturbed the normal enterohepatic circulation. Taken together, gut immunity and microbial dysbiosis are associated with altered bile acid metabolism in LPS-challenged piglets, which provided theoretical basis for revealing the potential mechanism of intestinal inflammation in swine and seeking nutrients to resist intestinal damage.

AB  - The concentrations of mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) in feather samples of nine bird's species (n = 65) were determined from southeastern areas of Iran, Hamun International Wetlands. Hg concentrations were ranged from 0.40 to 3.00 mg/kg dry wt and from 0.38 to 1.76 mg/kg for primary and secondary feathers, respectively. Furthermore, Pb concentrations were ranged from 1.43 to 4.10 mg/kg and from 1.28 to 3.65 mg/kg for primary and secondary feathers, respectively. Deposition of metals varied significantly among the primary and secondary feathers of systematic category (families) for Hg and Pb (p < 0.001). It was found that there is a significant difference in feather Hg and Pb concentrations across species (p < 0.001) with highest concentrations in saker falcon (Falconidae) (Hg = 3.00 mg/kg and Pb = 4.10 mg/kg, primary feather) followed by little owl (Strigidae). Grey francolin (Phasianidae) contained the least amount of Hg (0.40 mg/kg) and Pb (1.43 mg/kg) in primary feather. The results showed that the highest concentrations of heavy metals were related to carnivores. Fish predators, omnivores, and insectivores were examined at the next level of metal concentration, with herbivores having the lowest concentrations of lead (1.43 mg/kg) and mercury (0.40 mg/kg). Birds with an open grasslands feeding strategy had the highest mercury and lead concentration. The average value for Pb was on the border of harmful effects (4 mg/kg). The results of this study indicate that mercury levels are lower than the threshold level for reproductive and behavioral harm (5 mg/kg).

AB  - The present study investigates the impact of supplementing diets with a synergistic blend of short- and medium-chain fatty acids (SCFAs-MCFAs) during the peripartum and lactation phases on early microbial colonization and the subsequent growth performance of newborn pigs. The experiment involved 72 sows and their litters, with a follow-up on 528 weaned pigs. Sows were fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with SCFAs-MCFAs and the pigs were monitored for their growth performance and microbial populations. Subsequently, selected weaned pigs were allotted to an SCFAs-MCFAs diet according to the maternal diet. Results showed that SCFAs-MCFAs supplementation led to reduced backfat loss in sows and improved pig weight and uniformity at weaning (p < 0.05). Additionally, suckling pigs exhibited significant shifts in gut microbiota, including increased lactic acid bacteria and reduced Streptococcus suis populations (p < 0.05). Although there was no influence of maternal diet on pig growth after weaning, there was a modulation on bacterial populations at 7 and 35 days post-weaning. Pigs fed SCFAs-MCFAs demonstrated improved feed efficiency with notable reductions in E. coli and Streptococcus suis counts. The findings suggest that maternal dietary supplementation with SCFAs-MCFAs can positively influence both sow and pig performance, offering a potential strategy to enhance productivity and health in the commercial swine production.

AB  - Global cerebral ischemia is a significant medical and social challenge that necessitates the development of effective neuroprotectors and treatment strategies. Given that cerebral ischemia has a complex pathogenesis with a prolonged recovery period, the drugs with pleiotropic effects, including intranasal insulin (INI), are of primary interest. INI enters the brain and, through central mechanisms, regulates metabolism while exerting neuroprotective and neuromodulatory effects. Although INI is effective in neurodegenerative diseases, data on its neuroprotective action in cerebral ischemia remain fragmented. The aim of this study was to identify a "therapeutic window" for INI administration and evaluate the mechanisms of its neuroprotective effect in a two-vessel occlusion/hypotension model of forebrain ischemia in rats. INI was administered to rats 2 and 4 h after ischemic exposure at a dose of 0.5 IU/rat/day, and for 7 days onward, once a day, at the same dose. INI proved to be more effective when administered 2 rather than 4 h post exposure, despite subsequent 7-day treatment. When administered 2 h post-ischemically, INI sustained the expression of insulin signaling genes in the hippocampus, normalized cell counts in the CA1 hippocampal region, stimulated gene expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and reduced the expression of Gfap and Aif1 genes, markers of astrocytes and microglia, thereby suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. Additionally, INI stimulated thyroid system's activity, preventing the development of post-ischemic hypothyroidism, which may also contribute to INI-mediated neuroprotection. These effects were either poorly manifested or absent when INI was administered 4 h after cerebral ischemia. Thus, for the first time, we have identified a "therapeutic window" for INI administration in cerebral ischemia and evaluated some mechanisms of its neuroprotective action. The obtained data open new prospects for developing innovative neuroprotection strategies in cerebral ischemia.

AB  - The zoophytophagous mirid Pilophorus clavatus has been recently identified inhabiting citrus orchards in the Mediterranean region, where it feeds on several important citrus pests. In this work, we investigated whether the plant feeding by P. clavatus could induce defensive responses in citrus plants. Here, we show for the first time that the P. clavatus herbivory triggers the accumulation of the stress-related hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in citrus plants. Moreover, the SA and JA pathways enhanced plant defence mechanisms as the expression of genes encoding enzymes from both biosynthetic and responsive pathways were upregulated in P. clavatus-punctured plants. We also investigated whether the induced defences could affect the plant host selection of Tetranychus urticae and the predatory mites Phytoseilus persimilis and Neouseiulus californicus. Neither T. urticae nor N. californicus preferred the odour source emitted by intact or P. clavatus-punctured plants in a Y-tube olfactometer assay. However, P. persimilis were significantly attracted to P. clavatus-induced plants. The performance of T. urticae was also compared when mites were released on control or previously P. clavatus-induced plants. Compared to the control, the infestation of T. urticae was significantly reduced up to 70% on those citrus plants previously activated by P. clavatus. Our results show for the first time that feeding of P. clavatus on citrus plants can have a dual beneficial effect due to its known predatory action and, at the same time, by inducing the plant's immune system.

AB  - Mammary tumors occur in female and male guinea pigs. However, published data on their histology and sex predispositions are limited. Histologically, we examined proliferative mammary lesions of 69 female and 48 male pet guinea pigs. Lobular hyperplasia was observed only in females (n = 50). Benign tumors included simple adenomas (n = 20), adenolipomas (n = 3) and intraductal papillary adenomas (n = 5). All except two intraductal papillary adenomas occurred in females. Most malignancies were tubulopapillary and solid carcinomas (n = 54), and intraductal papillary carcinomas (n = 13). These were diagnosed more frequently in male (n = 41) than in female (n = 26) guinea pigs. The carcinomas of males had higher mitotic counts than those of females (p = 0.05). Three carcinosarcomas developed in adenolipoma, and one arose in adenoma. Results show that the mammary tumor classification of dogs and cats can be applied to guinea pigs. However, some tumors (adenolipoma, metaplastic carcinoma) are unique to guinea pigs and shared with laboratory rodents and humans, respectively. Benign tumors may undergo malignant progression. Male guinea pigs appear predisposed to ductal-associated and malignant tumors. Data suggest that male guinea pigs represent an animal model for human male breast cancer.

AB  - Learning and memory impairment is commonly noted in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is regarded as a progressive synaptic failure disease. Exercise is a nonpharmacological strategy that may help prevent cognitive decline and reduce the risk of AD, which is usually thought to be related to synaptic damage in the hippocampus. However, the effects of exercise intensity on hippocampal memory and synaptic function in AD remain unclear. In this study, senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) mice were randomly assigned to the control group (Con), low-intensity exercise group (Low), and moderate-intensity exercise group (Mid). Here, we showed that eight weeks of treadmill exercise beginning in four-month-old mice improved spatial memory and recognition memory in six-month-old SAMP8 mice, while the Con group exhibited impaired spatial memory and recognition memory. Treadmill exercise also improved hippocampal neuron morphology in SAMP8 mice. Furthermore, dendritic spine density and the levels of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) and Synaptophysin (SYN) increased significantly in the Low and Mid groups as compared with the Con group. We further showed that moderate-intensity exercise (60 % of maximum speed) was more efficacious in increasing dendritic spine density?PSD95 and SYN, than low-intensity exercise (40 % of maximum speed). In conclusion, the positive effect of treadmill exercise is closely related to exercise intensity, with moderate-intensity exercise showing the most optimal effects.

(Fabales: Fabaceae) were selected to study the multi-kingdom interactions among plants, arthropods, and entomopathogenic fungi. Real-Time PCR analysis of nine defense-related genes revealed that a broad range of plant defense mechanisms is activated in response to the endophytic growth of B. bassiana. Moreover, we studied the molecular mechanism adapted by the two-spotted spider mite that underlies resistance. The analysis of 41 detoxification genes revealed that relatively moderate, high, and few numbers of genes were changed in the adults, nymphs, and eggs stages of T. urticae, respectively, after inoculation on colonized tissues of P. vulgaris. The endophytic growth of B. bassiana can have a negative effect on the growth and performance of the pest, in a developmental stage-dependent manner, by priming plant defense pathways. In parallel, the herbivore induces a broad range of detoxification genes that could potentially be involved in adaptation to endophytically colonized plant tissues.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most important cash crops in the world. Theanine, as an important amino acid component in tea, is a key quality index for excellent tea quality and high economic value. People increase theanine accumulation in tea mainly through the application of nitrogen fertilizer, shading and pruning. However, these methods are not effective. In this study, we treated tea buds with a 100 mu M solution of GA(3) containing 1 parts per thousand tween-20, investigated the effects of GA(3) on theanine accumulation, bud yield, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and expression level of theanine biosynthesis pathway genes in tea plant by qPCR, LC-MS/MS etc. Results showed that change trends of theanine and GA(3) was extremely positively correlated with each other. Exogenous GA(3) upregulated the expression level of theanine biosynthesis pathway genes, caused an increase of theanine content (mg center dot g(-1)) by 27% in tea leaves compared with Mock, and accelerated the germination of buds and elongation of shoots, which lead to a significant increase of tea yield by 56% (w/w). Moreover, the decrease of chlorophyll contents, photochemical quenching coefficient (qP) and relative electron transport rate (rETR) under GA(3) treatment suggested that GA(3) reduced photosynthesis in the tender tea leaves, indicating that the decline of carbon assimilation in tea plants was conducive to the nitrogen metabolism, and it was beneficial to the accumulation of theanine. This study provided a new technical and theoretical support for the precise control of tea quality components and phenophase.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the perception, knowledge, and consumption preferences of veterinary students regarding meat products produced according to the five freedoms of animal welfare (AW) using a questionnaire. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 244 veterinary students. A survey was applied through a virtual form with a Likert-type scale. A varimax-rotated principal component analysis was performed. Cronbach's alpha was 0.96 and content validity was 0.85. Bartlett's sphericity test was significant (p < 0.0001). Forty-eight percent of the students participated. No differences were observed by gender or professional interest, but differences were observed by educational core. The chicken was the most consumed meat, but if the price per kilogram were similar, the preference for meat consumption would have the following hierarchy: beef > chicken > pork > fish > sheep > goat > turkey. 46 % had a positive perception of animal welfare as an attribute to be incorporated into meat during the production process. 77 % had a positive perception of the inclusion of Animal Welfare in the labeling process. 82 % had a high level of knowledge about this system. In conclusion, the questionnaire presents validity and reliability to be replicated in similar studies. The students prefer meat with AW, perceive, and have knowledge about the meat produced.

AB  - Skeletal muscle development is crucial for livestock production, and understanding the molecular mechanisms involved is essential for enhancing muscle growth in sheep. This study aimed to investigate the role of Nfix, a member of the nuclear factor I (NFI) family, in regulating muscle development in sheep, filling a significant gap in the current understanding of Nfix deficiency and its impact on skeletal muscle growth, as no similar studies have been reported in this species. Bioinformatic analysis, including temporal analysis of transcriptome data, identified Nfix as a potential target gene for muscle growth regulation. The effects of Nfix overexpression and knockout on the proliferation and differentiation of sheep skeletal muscle cells were investigated. Changes in the expression of associated marker genes were assessed to explore the regulatory link between Nfix and the myostatin (MSTN) gene. Additionally, target miRNAs for Nfix and MSTN were predicted using online databases such as miRWalk, resulting in the construction of an Nfix-miRNA-MSTN interactive regulatory network. The findings revealed that Nfix promotes the proliferation and differentiation of sheep skeletal muscle cells, with further analysis indicating that Nfix may regulate muscle cell development by modulating MSTN expression. This study provides preliminary insights into the function of Nfix in sheep skeletal muscle development and its regulatory interactions, addressing a critical knowledge gap regarding Nfix deficiency and its implications for muscle growth. These findings contribute to a better understanding of muscle biology in sheep and provide a theoretical foundation for future research into the regulatory mechanisms governing muscle development.

AB  - Salmonellosis is a zoonotic infection that has a major impact on human health; consuming contaminated pork products is the main source of such infection. Vaccination responses to classic vaccines have been unsatisfactory; that is why peptide subunit-based vaccines represent an excellent alternative. Immunopeptidomics was used in this study as a novel approach for identifying antigens coupled to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Three homozygous individuals having three different haplotypes (Lr-0.23, Lr-0.12, and Lr-0.21) were thus selected as donors; peripheral blood macrophages were then obtained and stimulated with Salmonella typhimurium (MOI 1:40). Although similarities were observed regarding peptide length distribution, elution patterns varied between individuals; in total, 1990 unique peptides were identified as follows: 372 for Pig 1 (Lr-0.23), 438 for Pig 2 (Lr.0.12) and 1180 for Pig 3 (Lr.0.21). Thirty-one S. typhimurium unique peptides were identified; most of the identified peptides belonged to outer membrane protein A and chaperonin GroEL. Notably, 87% of the identified bacterial peptides were predicted in silico to be elution ligands. These results encourage further in vivo studies to assess the immunogenicity of the identified peptides, as well as their usefulness as possible protective vaccine candidates.

AB  - Introduction Breed epigenetic diversity was recently detected in pig muscle and cattle blood, probably as a result of long-term selection for morphological adaptive and quantitative traits, persisting after embryo epigenetic reprogramming.Methods In our study, breed epigenetic diversity in the male germline from Holstein (H) and Montb & eacute;liarde (M) bulls was investigated using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) data publicly available at the NCBI database. Open-source Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from H and M animals were used to estimate genetic diversity between the two breeds and, thus, correctly assess CpG positions with low frequencies or absence of SNPs.Results Sperm epigenetic diversity was studied in 356,635 SNP-free CpG positions, and a total of 6,074 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) were identified. The analysis of the DMCs pattern of distribution revealed that DMCs: i) are partially associated with genetic variation, ii) are consistent with epigenetic diversity previously observed in bovine blood, iii) present long-CpG stretches in specific genomic regions, and iv) are enriched in specific repeat elements, such as ERV-LTR transposable elements, ribosomal 5S rRNA, BTSAT4 Satellites and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE).Discussion This study, based on publicly available data from two cattle breeds, contributes to the identification and definition of distinct epigenetic signatures in sperm, that may have potential implications for mammalian embryo development.

AB  - Chronic pain is a complex condition that directly affects the quality of life of patients. Regulation and treatment of chronic pain are associated with a number of difficulties, primarily due to the multifactorial nature of this condition. The causes of chronic pain can be associated not only with physical damage, such as various injuries, diseases and the development of neuroinflammation, but also with a violation of the synthesis of neurotransmitters, as well as complex processes of neurogenesis. In this review, we describe the complex and multifaceted interaction between dopaminergic regulation, neurogenesis and neuroinflammation on the development of chronic pain. Further studies of these relationships can lead to the creation of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at eliminating chronic pain. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms underlying analgesia associated with the dopamine reward system can form the basis for the development of new therapeutic approaches to relieve and control pain.

AB  - The potential for phosphorus (P) recovery from various sources in Southern Vietnam has been assessed in this study. Five types of waste were studied, namely sediment from catfish pond, manure from cattle and pig farming, and also sludge from domestic and rubber-latex processing wastewater-treatment plants. The study identifies P-reserve and assesses factors related to P recovery from waste sources such as distribution, collection, transportation conditions, and composition of wastes. P-reserve from catfish farming is estimated about 17.7 kt yr(-1) while reserve from pig farming is the highest, about 21.7 kt yr(-1). Total P-reserves from studied wastes are estimated about 50 kt yr(-1), equivalent to 37% of Vietnam's imported nutrient P quantity in 2019. Generated sludge from rubber-latex processing wastewater-treatment plants has the highest potential and favorable properties for P recovery. It turns out to be feasible to collect and recover P from this waste source under Vietnam's current conditions.

AB  - The aim of the present study was (1) to investigate what consumers include within the concept of food sustainability and its link with sustainable consumption, by identifying meaningful consumer typologies from the concept of food sustainability and food choice factors framed by SDG 12, and (2) to know how different farm systems attributes affecting purchase behavior are associated with such typologies. Consumers from two Spanish regions (n = 403) answered a paper questionnaire to know their degree of knowledge of sustainability, and beliefs, behavior, attitudes and preferences towards food sustainability, and the importance given to product characteristics and shopping practices. A principal component analysis was conducted to identify groups with similar answers, to average some of the questions before the final analysis of variance, which includes demographic classes as fixed effects. A cluster analysis using the most representative questions identified two clusters. cluster 1 (68.4%) responded to more sustainability-related attributes, and cluster 2 (31.5%) presented a less-expanded concept of sustainability. The origin of the product and quality certification (local, organic) was important for food purchase practices. The place of residence and gender differences of the consumers were the most influential factors. In the conjoint study, regarding the purchase of Iberian pork, cluster 1 remained unwilling to sacrifice outdoor systems and local breed at the expense of the price, in the case of the Iberian pig production. The most important demographic differentiator was the region of residence of the consumer. In conclusion, consumers are not aware of the wider aspects included in the sustainability concept. Moreover, the concept of sustainability elicits different meanings to the segments of the consumers identified.

AB  - Water supply deficits in droughts, groundwater pollution and climate change are the main challenges for the sustainability of groundwater resources from hard-rock aquifers in rural areas of Galicia (Spain). Here, we address the sustainability of groundwater resources of weathered and fractured schists in the rural areas of the Abegondo municipality. The conceptualization of the hydrogeology of the study area includes: (1) The weathered schist (regolith), (2) The decompressed highly fractured schist layer; and (3) An underlying slightly fractured schist. Groundwater flows mostly through the regolith and the highly fractured rock. Rainfall infiltration is the source of aquifer recharge. Groundwater discharges in seepage areas, springs and along creeks and valleys. The water table is generally shallow and shows seasonal oscillations of up to 4 m. The equivalent transmissivity of the regolith and the highly fractured schist ranges from 15 to 35 m(2)/days. The electrical resistivity tomography identifies a shallow water table and attests that the contact of the highly fractured schist and the slightly fractured schist is highly heterogeneous. Groundwater resources were quantified with a hydrological water balance model. The mean annual recharge is about 185 mm. Groundwater recharge at the end of the twenty-first century could decrease from 6 to 10% due to climate change. The decline in groundwater table could aggravate the shortages during droughts. Groundwater quality data show bacteriological and nitrate contamination due to the poor management of the manure in the fields and occasional discharges of slurry from pig and mink farms. Groundwater management and protection actions are proposed to prevent groundwater pollution and achieve a sustainable groundwater supply in the study area.

AB  - Glutathione (GSH) exhibits considerable potential in the cosmetic industry for reducing intracellular tyrosinase activity and inhibiting melanin synthesis. However, its efficacy is hindered by limited permeability, restricting its ability to reach the basal layer of the skin where melanin production occurs. The transdermal enhancer peptide TD1 has emerged as a promising strategy to facilitate the transdermal transfer of proteins or peptides by creating intercellular gaps in keratinocytes, providing access to the basal layer. The primary objective of this study is to enhance the transdermal absorption capacity of GSH while augmenting its inhibitory effect on melanin. Two coupling structures were designed for investigation: linear (TD1-linker-GSH) and branched (TD1-GSH). The study examined the impact of the peptide skeleton on melanin inhibition ability. Our findings revealed that the linear structure not only inhibited synthetic melanin production in B16F10 cells through a direct pathway but also through a paracrine pathway, demonstrating a significant tyrosinase inhibition of nearly 70 %, attributed to the paracrine effect of human keratinocyte HaCaT. In pigmentation models of guinea pigs and zebrafish, the application of TD1-linker-GSH significantly reduced pigmentation. Notably, electric two-photon microscopy demonstrated that TD1-linker-GSH exhibited significant transdermal ability, penetrating 158.67 +/- 9.28 mu m into the skin of living guinea pigs. Molecular docking analysis of the binding activity with tyrosinase revealed that both TD1-linker-GSH and TD1-GSH occupy the same active pocket, with TD1-linker-GSH binding more tightly to tyrosinase. These results provide a potential foundation for therapeutic approaches aimed at enriched pigmentation and advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying melanogenesis inhibition.

AB  - Media narratives in environmental communication often broadcast scientific and complex information from the perspective of professional experts, and while focusing on emotions, fear and worry are being among the most frequently studied. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in raising public awareness has been questioned. Animals are recognized as one of the critical indicators of the ecological environment, therefore defining the most effective strategies that will draw public's attention to wildlife conservation is an important issue. Actions aimed at increasing the public's interest and dissemination of related content are the key elements of environmental communication. Based on that, we focus our empirical research on the event known as the Wild Elephant Northward Migration in Yunnan, which gained global popularity in 2021. Choosing Twitter to collect our data, we used text mining methods to investigate 1230 tweets, exploring the mechanism of empathetic narrative in wildlife protection. The study has found that the themes such as warm feelings, diverse subjects, and scientific presentation can help to attract attention, enhance participation, and stimulate sympathetic responses. However, it is also necessary to pay attention to the lack of public participation in environmental issues, being a consequence of audience's preference for entertaining content, among others. Instead of focusing on negative emotions or scientific language, we aim to provide a new perspective on environmental communication narratives in the era of social media by emphasizing the role of warm emotions in triggering audience's interaction.

AB  - Gram-negative spirochete Leptospira spp. causes leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is still a neglected disease, even though it can cause potentially fatal infections in a variety of species including humans. The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of leptospirosis in pig farm captured rodents and characterize the isolated samples. Rats were captured, sampled, and euthanized in the vicinity of pig farms to obtain serum for microagglutination tests (MAT) and kidney tissues for PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA and LipL32 genes. A fraction of the 16S rRNA PCR product was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The results showed a Leptospira seroprevalence of 13.8% (77/555) among the 555 captured rats. PCR positivity for Leptospira spp. reached 31.2% (156/500), and the positivity for pathogenic Leptospira spp. was 4% (22/500). Phylogenetic analysis matched eight samples with L. interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae and two with L. interrogans serovar pyrogenes. Two sequences were located within the pathogenic Leptospira clade but did not match with any specific strain. The seroprevalence found in the rats around swine farms indicates a potential risk of transmission to the pigs. The identification of pathogenic Leptospira outlines the importance of more research as well as updating the current strategies for the diagnosis, control, and prevention of porcine leptospirosis in Colombia.

AB  - In order to solve the problem of accurately and robustly recovering fish trajectories from videos, the author proposes a physical habitat assessment model for fishery resources based on particle filter algorithm. The idea of "group tracking" was proposed, which divides all targets into several groups based on their mutual distance and processes different groups independently and in parallel, avoiding the extremely high dimensionality caused by estimating all zebrafish parameters simultaneously. The parameters of all individuals in the same group are estimated together, and it handles occlusion by modeling the interaction and occlusion of objects in the same group. The experimental results show that from frame 16 to frame 21, two fish suddenly turn around, especially the fish marked in red; From frame 34 to frame 42, these two fish interact for the first time, but do not intersect; From frame 49 to frame 58, these two fish interact and pass through each other for the second time. The algorithm proposed by the author, GCT, and contrast algorithm CT, can effectively handle the protruding and directional motion of fish. Conclusion: The algorithm is accurate and reliable.

AB  - Reproductive traits are important for farm profitability because failure to reproduce is the primary reason for culling animals. Study objectives were to estimate genetic parameters and evaluate the trends for reproductive traits. Age at first calving (AFC), gestation length (GL), postpartum interval to pregnancy (PPIP), calving interval (CI) and calving ease score (CE) were recorded. A total of 38,906 records were available from 2426 buffalo cows. There was evaluation of genetic parameters using three models. The first model was applied to the first three parities fitting animal as a random effect. There was also a repeatability model utilized where data from all parities were evaluated to estimate heritability and repeatability. There was also a bivariate model to estimate genetic correlations between reproductive traits. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.0001 to 0.12 for PPIP and CE, respectively. Repeatability estimates were low to moderate ranging from 0.13 to 0.38 for PPIP and GL, respectively. There were close genetic correlations of 0.99 and - 0.93 between PPIP-CI and GL-CE, respectively. Genetic correlations between the other reproductive traits were low to moderate. Genetic trends for all reproductive traits were negative with and of a small magnitude, and regression coefficients were significant only for AFC and PPIP. The results from the current study supported the urgent need, not only for genetic or genomic selection improvement programs, but also for improving the farm management practices for reproductive traits in Egyptian buffalo.

AB  - Maternal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been reported to cause learning and memory deficits in born offspring. However, little is known that this impairment is potentially caused by epigenetic modulation on the development of NMDA receptor subunits. This study investigates the effect of prenatal BPA exposure on the hippocampal miR19a and miR-539, which are responsible for regulating NMDA receptor subunits as well as learning and memory functions. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were orally administered with 5 mg/kg/day of BPA from pregnancy day 1 (PD1) until gestation day 21 (GD21), while control mothers received no BPA. The mothers were observed daily until GD21 for either a cesarean section or spontaneous delivery. The male offspring were sacrificed when reaching GD21 (fetus), postnatal days 7, 14, 21 (PND7, 14, 21) and adolescent age 35 (AD35) where their hippocampi were dissected from the brain. The expression of targeted miR-19a, miR-539, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B were determined by qRT-PCR while the level of GluN2A and GluN2B were estimated by western blot. At AD35, the rats were assessed with neurobehavioral tests to evaluate their learning and memory function. The findings showed that prenatal BPA exposure at 5 mg/kg/day significantly reduces the expression of miR-19a, miR-539, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B genes in the male rat hippocampus at all ages. The level of GluN2A and GluN2B proteins is also significantly reduced when reaching adolescent age. Consequently, the rats showed spatial and fear memory impairments when reaching AD35. In conclusion, prenatal BPA exposure disrupts the role of miR-19a and miR539 in regulating the NMDA receptor subunit in the hippocampus which may be one of the causes of memory and learning impairment in adolescent rats.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted at agriculture farm, ICAR-Central Institute for Research on Goats maize, sole cowpea; and intercropping of maize + cowpea in 1:1, 2:1, 1:2, 2:2, 3:1, 1:3 and 3:3 row ratios. The results revealed that maximum total green fodder yield, maize and cowpea equivalent yield, Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), Monitory Advantage Index (MAI), net returns and Benefit: Cost ratio were recorded with 2:1 row ratio of maize + cowpea intercropping combination followed by 3:1 row ratio. The highest value of nitrogen and potassium content both in fodder maize and cowpea were recorded with 1:3 row ratios of maize + cowpea intercropping combination. Further, the highest phosphorus content in fodder maize was recorded with 3:1 row ratio of maize + cowpea intercropping combination whereas in case of cowpea the highest phosphorus content was recorded with 1:3 row ratio of maize + cowpea intercropping combination. Thus, it was found that two rows maize + one row of cowpea (2:1) intercropping combination perform best in terms of yield, land use efficiency and profitability of fodder maize and cowpea.

AB  - Yurtman, ozer, Yuncu et al. provide an ancient DNA data set to demonstrate the impact of human activity on the demographic history of domestic sheep. The authors demonstrate that there may have been multiple domestication events with notable changes to the gene pool of European and Anatolian sheep since the Neolithic.
   Sheep were among the first domesticated animals, but their demographic history is little understood. Here we analyzed nuclear polymorphism and mitochondrial data (mtDNA) from ancient central and west Anatolian sheep dating from Epipaleolithic to late Neolithic, comparatively with modern-day breeds and central Asian Neolithic/Bronze Age sheep (OBI). Analyzing ancient nuclear data, we found that Anatolian Neolithic sheep (ANS) are genetically closest to present-day European breeds relative to Asian breeds, a conclusion supported by mtDNA haplogroup frequencies. In contrast, OBI showed higher genetic affinity to present-day Asian breeds. These results suggest that the east-west genetic structure observed in present-day breeds had already emerged by 6000 BCE, hinting at multiple sheep domestication episodes or early wild introgression in southwest Asia. Furthermore, we found that ANS are genetically distinct from all modern breeds. Our results suggest that European and Anatolian domestic sheep gene pools have been strongly remolded since the Neolithic.

AB  - We investigated the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of Yiqi Jiemin decoction (YJD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), in the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis (AR) model in guinea pigs. YJD significantly decreased infiltration of mast cells and eosinophils into the nasal mucosa of AR model guinea pigs. YJD also increased expression of TGF-beta in the nasal mucosa, restored the balance of Th1/Th2 immune cell responses, and decreased serum levels of various pro-inflammatory mediators, including histamine (HA), neuropeptide Y (NPY), acetylcholine (ACH), norepinephrine and immunoglobulin E (IgE). Metabolic analyses using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that YJD improved cellular metabolism in AR model guinea pigs and increased serum levels of glycocholic acid while decreasing levels 1-palmitoyl lysophosphatidic acid. RNA-sequencing analysis identified BPIFB2 as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for AR. Functional enrichment analyses showed that YJD significantly inhibited cytokine secretion pathways in AR model guinea pigs. These findings demonstrate that YJD protects against OVA-induced AR in guinea pigs by suppressing inflammation in the nasal mucosa, restoring Th1/Th2 balance, and improving cellular metabolism.

AB  - Cycloxaprid, 9-((6-chloropyrid-3-yl)methyl)-4-nitro-8-oxa-10,11-dihydroimidazo-[2,3-a]-bicyclo-[3,2,1]-oct-3-ene, is a cis-configuration neonicotinoid insecticide. In the present study, the lethal and sublethal effect of cycloxaprid against Formosan subterranean termites, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), was evaluated and compared with fipronil. Toxicity bioassays showed that cycloxaprid had slightly lower toxicity than fipronil. The minimum cycloxaprid concentration in sand and soil that causes 100% termite mortality was 100 ppm. Similar to fipronil, cycloxaprid significantly reduced wood consumption and tunneling activities of termites. In the tunneling-choice tests, termite tunneling activity measured in both length and area was significantly lower in sand treated with cycloxaprid (10 or 100 ppm) than that in untreated sand. In the aggregation-choice tests, cycloxaprid exhibited inhibition to termite aggregation starting from 100 ppm. In addition, cycloxaprid exhibited significant horizontal transfer effect at 10 ppm. In conclusion, our study showed that cycloxaprid is slightly less toxic than fipronil and more repellent to C. formosanus than fipronil. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of cycloxaprid against subterranean termites in the field.

AB  - The research utilized data from 662 Murrah buffaloes meticulously recorded over 24 years (1996-2019) from historical pedigree sheets maintained at the buffalo farm of the Department of Livestock Production and Management (LPM) at Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (LUVAS), Hisar. A series of six univariate animal models were employed to calculate estimates of (co)variance components and heritability for first lactation reproduction traits. Among these models, Model 2 was identified as the best fit for age at first calving (AFC) and calving interval (CI), while Model 1 proved optimal for service period (SP) and conception rate (CR). The heritability estimates for AFC, SP, CR and CI across the models were ranged between 0.11 and 0.32, 0.01 and 0.03, 0.05 and 0.06, and 0.01 and 0.06, respectively. Maternal effects (m(2)) were observed in AFC and CI, ranging from 0.10 to 0.20 and 0.01 to 0.03, respectively. Across all three traits, there was a consistent negative genetic correlation (-0.75 to -0.92) between direct additive and maternal effects. The breeding values for AFC, SP, CR and CI varied within specific ranges from -32.85 to 44.33 days, -15.61 to 28.42 days, -7.41 to 6.48% and -20.64 to 35.79 days, respectively. Significantly, Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed highly significant relationships (p < .01) between the breeding values of different models, indicating strong and consistent associations within these traits. These findings underscore the stable and reliable connections observed within the breeding values for these essential reproductive traits across the various models used in the study. The majority of reproductive traits showed favourable negative trends, indicating a positive outcome. A decrease in AFC, SP and CI suggests an extended economic life for the animals. Additionally, the upward trends in CR reflect positive indications of effective management practices and skilled operational procedures.

AB  - Weaned piglets, being immature, demand careful handling to mitigate post-weaning stress in order to avoid immunosuppression and the use of antimicrobials to palliate the effects of disease outbreaks due to poor management. The objective of this work is to design a quick scan calculator or multi-criteria evaluation model of management for weaned piglets, founded on 10 critical indices covering post-weaning management aspects based on hygienic measures and management of facilities and animals. These include pre-weaning handling, batch management, biosecurity, water management, feed management, health program, stockmen training, temperature, ventilation, and floor conditions and density to relate handling and hygiene practices with farm performance and the consumption of veterinary medication. Each index carries a maximum score of ten, with evaluations derived from different management factors that make up each index (from three to eight factors were evaluated per index). Their cumulative score reflects the degree of adequacy of on-farm management. Therefore, a perfectly managed farm would achieve 100 points. The calculator underwent testing on 23 intensive farms with a total population of close to 16,000 sows and more than 400,000 weaned piglets, revealing the highest mean scores in floor conditions and density (8.03 out of 10) and pre-weaning handling and health programs (6.87 and 6.28, respectively). Conversely, the lowest scores corresponded to temperature, ventilation, water management, and stockmen training (4.08, 4.32, 4.81, and 4.93, respectively). The assessed farms averaged a global score of 56.12 out of 100 (from 37.65 to 76.76). The calculator's global score correlated with key post-weaning productivity and piglet health indicators, such as the feed conversion ratio, mortality rate, and piglet production cost, with r values of -0.442, -0.437, and -0.435, respectively (p < 0.05). Additionally, it negatively correlated with medication costs per piglet (r = -0.414; p < 0.05) and positively with annual farm productivity (r = 0.592; p < 0.01). To enhance management, hygiene, and prevention, farms should prioritize addressing indices with the lowest scores, thereby reducing medication consumption and enhancing productivity and health outcomes. Additionally, this quick scan calculator can be used for benchmarking purposes.

AB  - Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive drugs in the world. It easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and caffeine-interacting adenosine and ryanodine receptors are distributed in various areas of the brain, including the hypothalamus and pituitary. Caffeine intake may have an impact on reproductive and immune function. Therefore, in the present study performed on the ewe model, we decided to investigate the effect of peripheral administration of caffeine (30 mg/kg) on the secretory activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit which regulates the reproductive function in females during both a physiological state and an immune/inflammatory challenge induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 400 ng/kg) injection. It was found that caffeine stimulated (p < 0.01) the biosynthesis of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the hypothalamus of ewe under both physiological and inflammatory conditions. Caffeine also increased (p < 0.05) luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in ewes in a physiological state; however, a single administration of caffeine failed to completely release the LH secretion from the inhibitory influence of inflammation. This could result from the decreased expression of GnRHR in the pituitary and it may also be associated with the changes in the concentration of neurotransmitters in the median eminence (ME) where GnRH neuron terminals are located. Caffeine and LPS increased (p < 0.05) dopamine in the ME which may explain the inhibition of GnRH release. Caffeine treatment also increased (p < 0.01) cortisol release, and this stimulatory effect was particularly evident in sheep under immunological stress. Our studies suggest that caffeine affects the secretory activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit, although its effect appears to be partially dependent on the animal's immune status.

AB  - Our previous investigations identified miR-30a-3p as a differentially expressed miRNA in ovine mammary tissue across sheep breeds with distinct lactation performance and different physiological stages. However, its regulatory mechanisms controlling mammary gland development and lactation remain unexplored. In this study, the effect of miR-30a-3p on the proliferation of ovine mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and the target genes of miR-30a-3p were investigated. The regulatory effects of miR-30a-3p on the expression of the target genes and the content of triglycerides in ovine MECs were also analyzed. The transfection of miR-30a-3p mimic was found to promote cell viability and the number of proliferated ovine MECs using CCK8 and Edu assays. On the contrary, the miR-30a-3p inhibitor showed the opposite results with the miR-30a-3p mimic. These results suggest that miR-30a-3p promotes the proliferation of ovine MECs. The dual luciferase assay revealed that Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) can be targeted with miR-30a-3p. The transfection of miR-30a-3p mimic into ovine MECs resulted in a significant decrease in expression levels of the target PTEN genes. However, it promotes five milk fat synthesis marker genes, ACSL4, AKT, SREBP1, mTOR, and LPL, and promotes the content of triglycerides. The opposite effect of miR-30a-3p inhibitor with mimic on the expression levels of these genes and the level of triglycerides was also observed. This is the first study to reveal the biological mechanisms by which miR-30a-3p promotes milk fat synthesis by targeting PTEN in sheep.

AB  - Febrile seizures (FS) in early childhood can lead to the development of epilepsy; however, in most cases, they resolve without consequences. The neurophysiological mechanisms that protect the brain from the effects of FS remain poorly understood. It is also known that the risk of epilepsy significantly increases if a child has congenital abnormalities in the structure of the cerebral cortex. In this study, we examined functional changes in the hippocampus of young rats subjected to FS on the 10th postnatal day (P10) with freezing-induced focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) on P0. Experiments were conducted on three groups of animals: (1) control group (Ctrl)-rats without FS and FCD; (2) FS group-rats subjected to hyperthermia-induced FS on P10; (3) FS+FCD group-rats with cortical freezing on P0 and FS on P10. Using recordings of local synaptic potentials in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, we found that FS led to significant changes in synaptic transmission. In the FS group, there was an increase in the threshold for population spike generation, a decrease in the synaptic transmission efficacy ratio, and an increase in the paired-pulse ratio. These changes indicate reduced activity of CA3-CA1 glutamatergic synapses, which may represent a compensatory response preventing epileptogenesis. However, in the FS+FCD group, such compensatory changes were absent: synaptic transmission parameters did not differ from those in the control group. This suggests that FCD impedes the activation of protective mechanisms in the hippocampus in response to FS. Thus, the presence of cortical dysplasia may increase the risk of epilepsy following FS by blocking natural compensatory processes. Our results highlight the importance of studying the interaction between congenital cortical developmental abnormalities and the consequences of FS for understanding the mechanisms of epileptogenesis.

AB  - Hybridization can alter the host-specificity and fitness of herbivorous insects when the hybridizing populations are adapted to different hosts. It is less clear what the effects of admixture may be when genetically distinct populations are crossed that have similar and narrow host ranges. We tested the effects of hybridization between an Italian and Swiss population of the ragwort flea beetle, Longitarsus jacobaeae, a biocontrol agent for tansy ragwort, Jacobaea vulgaris, in the USA. Development success, development time, and fecundity of parental and first- and second-generation hybrids were assessed on the primary host and ten closely related plant species in no-choice larval transfer experiments. Four of the non-target species supported limited development but none represented novel host use of hybrids compared to the parents. Development time showed maternal effects on one of the non-target species where offspring of crosses with Italian mother developed slower. Percent larval development was significantly greater for one replication of a non-target species, indicating a plant genotype effect. Overall, hybridization did not result in changes of the fundamental host range or improved performance of hybrids on non-target species even when some hybrid lineages exhibited hybrid vigor on the primary host. These findings underscore the reliability of currently-employed host-specificity testing procedures that identify the fundamental host range of potential agents. Our results also support the newly advocated approach to promote intraspecific hybridization in biocontrol agents when the parental populations have similar and narrow host ranges to increase genetic variation and create novel genotypes to facilitate adaptation and persistence in the new range.

AB  - Omorgus (Omorgus) suberosus (Fabricius, 1775) is a species of Trogidae whose feeding habits allow them to associate with any source of keratin, including the feces of various omnivorous species; however, it has not been reported in the feces of carnivorous mammals. The objective of this work is to report, for the first time, the attraction of O. suberosus to excreta of two species of carnivorous mammals in captive conditions in remnants of sub-evergreen forest in the central region of Chiapas, Mexico. Systematic monthly sampling was carried out for one year, using pitfall traps baited with feces of six species of mammals (herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores) native to the region, to verify their effectiveness in attracting beetles. Eighteen individuals of O. suberosus were captured during four months of the sampling cycle. Despite using a wide variety of excreta for beetle sampling, individuals were only attracted to feces of the two carnivorous mammal species: Canis latrans Say, 1823 and Panthera onca (Linnaeus, 1758). Their tolerance towards anthropized environments is reaffirmed and the capture of the specimens suggests a marked seasonal presence.

AB  - Farming with more than one livestock species has been discussed as being more sustainable compared to spe-cialised production systems. Some potentially positive effects of multi-species livestock farming can only occur when different species share space, e.g., by co-grazing. To date there is limited research on the behaviour of animals in multi-species livestock groups. If co-grazing is adopted more widely, it is important to investigate its effect on the animals' behaviour and subsequently their welfare. One of the most prevalent species combinations in a survey of 126 multi-species livestock farms was cattle and poultry. Therefore, we aimed to describe and quantify inter-species interactions between young cattle and broiler chickens when co-grazing and descriptively compare intra-species interactions as well as maintenance, comfort and social behaviours between single-and multi-species groups of cattle and broilers on pasture. Additionally, we assessed fearfulness in broilers grazing with or without cattle as measured by Tonic Immobility (TI), an Inversion test and a Novel Object test. Across five replicates we observed three groups in each six-week cycle: One single-species group of ten cattle, one single -species group of 54-61 broilers, and one multi-species group of ten cattle and 54-61 broilers. Once per week the multi-species group was observed for 120 min using behaviour sampling to quantify the occurrence of inter-and intra-species interactions. On two other days per week, single-and multi-species groups were observed in a balanced order using continuous focal animal sampling to assess frequency and duration of maintenance, comfort and social behaviours for ten animals per species for 6 min each. During all observations scan sampling was performed every 6 min to count the number of visible animals per pasture sector. Across observation methods, two independent observers achieved high agreement for most behaviours. Inter-species interactions occurred two to three times per hour and ten animals per species, whereas intra-species interactions occurred between 18 and 28 times per hour and ten cattle or broilers. The most frequently observed inter-species interactions were cattle displacing broiler and broiler approaching cattle. More generally, maintenance, comfort and social behaviours as well as measures of fearfulness did not differ between animals in single-and multi-species groups, but the variation was high across observations. These findings should be verified with a greater number of animals and groups to be more applicable to commercial settings, but we conclude tentatively that co-grazing did not affect cattle or broilers negatively.

AB  - Increased palmitic acid (PA) levels have been found in females with reduced fertility due to metabolic disorders. However, effective antioxidant astaxanthin (AXE) might positively affect animal reproduction. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the impact of a high concentration of PA on oocyte maturation and the possible protective effect of AXE against high PA concentration in pigs. Firstly, different concentrations (0.2, 0.5, 0.8 mM) of PA were conducted on in vitro maturation (IVM) of pig oocytes (PA0.2, PA0.5, and PA0.8), while no addition of PA was performed as the control group (Ctrl). Results showed that the cumulus cell expansion index (CCEI) was lower in PA0.5 and PA0.8 groups compared to Ctrl group (p < .05). In PA0.5 group, not only did the percentage of matured oocytes with the first polar body (PB1) reduced, that with more oocytes arrested at germinal vesicle (GV) stage (53.44% +/- 7.16% vs. 20.93% +/- 5.16%, p < .05), but also a higher number of transzonal projections (TZPs) was observed in PA0.5 than Ctrl group. Besides, supplement of PA resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in mitochondrial activity. Although no difference of lipid content was observed between PA0.5 and Ctrl groups, the lipid content was at a higher level in PA0.2 group than in the other three groups. Hence, concentration of 0.5 mM of PA was performed in the following experiments, and 2.5 mu M AXE carried out to investigate the possible relief effects of PA (PA0.5 + AXE). Results showed that the percentage of matured oocytes with PB1 was higher in PA0.5 + AXE than in PA0.5 group (63.43% +/- 1.50% vs. 55.33% +/- 0.81%, p < .01), and ROS levels both in oocytes and their cumulus cells (CCs) reduced in PA0.5 + AXE when compared to PA0.5 group. In addition, the rate of CCs with apoptosis decreased in PA0.5 + AXE, and the expression level of caspase 3 and BAX was lower than PA0.5 group. In conclusion, the maturation of pig oocytes was inhibited by the high concentration of PA; however, this negative effect of PA-induced might be relieved by the supplement of AXE.

AB  - This study explored the protective effect of broken tea on growth, antioxidant capacity, nutritional composition and lipid metabolism in fish fed a high-fat (HF) diet. A total of 450 Cyprinus carpio (18.79 +/- 3.16 g) were divided into five groups and fed for 8 weeks: the control diet group (C), HF diet group (HF), and the HF diet plus 1 %, 2 % and 3 % broken Xinyang Maojian tea (BTMaojian) groups (HF+1%BT, HF+2 %BT and HF+3 %BT). We found that the weight gain rate (WGR) of carp was increased significantly in the HF+ 3 %BT group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The elevated hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and triglyceride (TG) in the HF group were attenuated by BT(Maojian )treatment (P < 0.05). Moreover, the low total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) content in serum and hepatopancreas in the HF group were significantly increased by the addition of BTMaojian (P < 0.05). The total essential amino acid content in muscle was significantly increased in the HF+ 2%BT group compared with the HF group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the highest linoleic acid content in muscle was found in the HF+ 3% BT group. The excessive hepatopancreas fat accumulation caused by the HF diet was alleviated in the 2 % and 3 % BTMaojian supplementation groups. The mRNA level of most key lipid metabolism genes in the hepatopancreas, intestinal tract, muscle and adipose tissue tended to be increased in the HF group and decreased in the BTMaojian treatment groups. Taken together, these results indicated that the addition of 2 % or 3 % BTMaojian likely positively affected growth performance, enhanced flesh quality, and alleviated harmful symptoms, including low antioxidant capacity and excessive hepatic fat accumulation in carp fed a HF diet. Thus, BTMaojian can be used as a green feed additive in C. carpio feed.

AB  - The present research aimed to investigate the demineralizing effects of sulfuric acid on pig bone. Alterations in collagen and phosphate contents and changes in the elemental composition of the bone during the 14-day-long immersion in sulfuric acid solutions of different concentrations were estimated using ATR-FTIR, LIBS, and AAS. FTIR spectra at amide I (1800-1600 cm-1) and phosphate nu 1/nu 3 (PO43-) (1300-900 cm-1) domains were scrutinized using the deconvolution method for monitoring changes in the protein secondary structure and mineral content. The results implicated sulfuric acid as a powerful demineralization agent and effective in targeting mineral components, such as hydroxyapatite, while leaving the collagen matrix relatively preserved with a complex secondary structure. Collagen maturity marker values gave valuable insights into the structural integrity of the bone. LIBS and AAS indicated changes in bone hardness; phosphorous-to-carbon ratio; and calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium content in the solutions left after the immersion period. The changes in the ratio of ionic-to-atomic calcium lines in the LIBS spectra indicated hardening of the bone, with increasing acid concentration and prolonged action, due to the deposition of calcium sulfate on the surface. The calcium concentration in the solutions decreased with increased acid concentration, while the change in phosphorus and magnesium concentrations was reversed.

AB  - To enhance the sustainability of marginal olive and dairy farms in the Sorrento peninsula, two separate crossover trials were conducted on two farms in the area to evaluate olive pruning residue (OlPr) and olive mill leaves (OlLes) as forage sources for lactating cows. Each trial lasted six weeks and consisted of two treatment periods, each including a 15-day adaptation phase followed by a 6-day measurement phase. During the measurement phase, milk production, feed intake, and olive residue consumption were assessed for two homogeneous cow groups: one receiving a ration supplemented with olive by-products and the other receiving a control diet. The olive-supplemented groups exhibited higher dry matter intake and roughage consumption (hay + olive residue) compared to the control groups. The intake of OlLes was about 30% higher than that of OlPr. Compared to the respective control, milk from OlLe-fed cows a had higher fat content and a higher fat-to-protein ratio, a more favorable fatty acid composition in terms of higher monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid contents, a reduced atherogenic index, and a saturated-to-unsaturated ratio. Likely due to the lower level of olive by-product ingestion, only marginal differences were observed in milk fatty acid composition of cows fed OlPr compared to the control. We conclude that the use of OlLes in dairy cow diets may represent a promising strategy for improving milk quality, promoting a more circular agricultural system, reducing reliance on external feed inputs, and mitigating the environmental impact of both olive and milk production.

AB  - Folk medicine, including plants, has been utilized for humans and animals since the dawn of civilization. Because of the widespread problem of antimicrobial resistance around the world, one of the mainly significant challenges in microbiological research is to achieve a replacement antibiotic with the fewest adverse effects. Camel and ruminant grazing were provided by the wild shrub Halexylon salicornicum (Ramth). However, despite prior research demonstrating its antimicrobial action against human diseases, no investigations on its antimicrobial activity against animal pathogens have been conducted to far. The goal of this study is to investigate whether Halexylon salicornicum aqueous and solvent extracts have antimicrobial activity on a variety of animal pathogens isolated from cattle and poultry using the agar well diffusion method (Enterococcus faecium, Shigella flexneri, Bacillus Cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogens, Pseudomonas aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Candida albicans) moreover it's ethnobotanical and phytochemical. All of the extracts tested had antimicrobial efficacy against tested strains and included bioactive chemicals, particularly the acetone extract, had the highest antibacterial activity. As a result, it can be stated that Halexylon salicornicum is a promising important shrub that might be used as a natural antimicrobial alternative for animals or as a food additive.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The tea green leafhopper (Empoasca onukii Matsuda) is a severe pest for the tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze), which significantly reduces the tea yields and quality. Herbivore feeding events lead to the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to elicit plant defense. To examine the volatile release profiles of tea shoots infested by leafhoppers, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed. 23 volatiles were emitted in healthy tea shoots whereas 29 volatiles were identified from infested ones. The relative contents of volatiles were significantly increased during infestation. The volatile profiles from healthy and infested tea shoots could be well clustered into two groups by unsupervised clustering analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, a partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model can differentiate volatile profiles between healthy and infested tea shoots with a predictive power of 91.8%. From the variable importance for the projection (VIP), eight critical volatiles were identified. Collectively, we have identified a novel volatile release profile after leafhopper infestation in tea plant and provide clues for defensive strategies against herbivores.

AB  - The objectives were to determine effects of growth stages (experiment 1) of black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens) and processing methods (experiment 2) on in vitro nutrient digestibility of BSF for pigs and to develop prediction equations for estimating in vitro nutrient utilization in BSF. In experiment 1, in vitro ileal disappearance (IVID) and in vitro total tract disappearance (IVTTD) of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen in BSF larva (15 d of age), BSF prepupa (d 17), and BSF adults (d 34) were determined. The IVID of DM and nitrogen in BSF larva was higher (P < 0.001) than that in BSF prepupa and BSF adults. The IVTTD of DM in BSF larva and BSF prepupa was higher (P < 0.001) than that in BSF adults. In experiment 2, the BSF larva employed in experiment 1 was processed using 4 different methods to obtain dried larva press liquid, dried larva press cake, partially defatted larvae meal (PDLM), and fully defatted larvae meal. The IVID of DM and nitrogen in PDLM was higher (P < 0.001) than that in other 3 ingredients. The IVTTD of DM in dried larva press liquid and PDLM was higher (P < 0.001) than that in dried larva press cake or fully defatted larvae meal. Based on the feed ingredients employed in experiments 1 and 2, quadratic and linear prediction equations were developed for IVID of DM (r(2) = 0.80; P = 0.041) and IVTTD of DM (r(2) = 0.78; P = 0.009), respectively, in BSF-derived ingredients using nitrogen as an independent variable. Overall, the nutrients in BSF larva at 15 d of age were better utilized compared with older growth stages, and the nutrients in PDLM were better utilized compared with other processing methods. Equations for IVID and IVTTD of DM were developed using nitrogen concentrations as an independent variable in BSF-derived ingredients for pigs.

AB  - Mammalian milk exosomal miRNAs play an important role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and protecting epithelial barrier function, but the specific miRNAs and whether miRNA-mediated mechanisms are responsible for these benefits remain a matter of investigation. This study isolated sheep milk-derived exosomes (sheep MDEs), identifying the enriched miRNAs in sheep MDEs, oar-miR-148a, and oar-let-7b as key components targeting TLR4 and TRAF1, which was validated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. In dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice, administration of sheep MDEs alleviated colitis symptoms, reduced colonic inflammation, and systemic oxidative stress, as well as significantly increased colonic oar-miR-148a and oar-let-7b while reducing toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TNF-receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) level. Further characterization in TNF-alpha-challenged Caco-2 cells showed that overexpression of these miRNAs suppressed the TLR4/TRAF1-I kappa B alpha-p65 pathway and reduced IL-6 and IL-12 production. These findings indicate that sheep MDEs exert gastrointestinal anti-inflammatory effects through the miRNA-mediated modulation of TLR4 and TRAF1, highlighting their potential in managing colitis.

AB  - Simple Summary In litter-bearing species, fetal competition during pregnancy can decrease the availability of nutrients to some offspring, which can increase the prevalence of low body weight at birth and variability of birth weights. Low birth weight can increase the chance of death early in life and compromise lifetime growth and health. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a nutritional intervention, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), to improve uniformity of birth weight in mice. Mice received HMB at low and high doses and during a critical time during pregnancy. Dietary HMB did not influence average birth weight, uniformity of birth weight, growth performance, or body composition of mouse pups born to dams fed HMB during pregnancy. In our mouse model, dietary HMB fed to pregnant mice did not reduce prevalence of low-birth-weight offspring.Abstract This study was designed to determine if feeding beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) to pregnant mice would improve birth weight uniformity and growth performance of offspring. Dams (Agouti Avy) were assigned to one of four treatments: control (CON; n = 13), low-level HMB (LL; 3.5 mg/g; n = 14), high-level HMB (HL; 35 mg/g; n = 15), and low-level pulse dose fed from gestational days 6 to 10 (PUL; 3.5 mg/g; n = 14). Randomly selected dams (n = 27) were euthanized on gestational day 18 to collect placentae and pup weights. The remaining dams gave birth and lactated for 28 days. Dams only received HMB during gestation. Dietary HMB did not influence the performance of dams. Dietary treatment during gestation did not affect litter size or birth weight of pups. Variation was not different among treatments in terms of birth weight of offspring. Placental weights were not affected by treatments. Overall, growth performance of offspring after weaning was similar among all treatments. Body composition of offspring at 5 and 8 weeks of age was similar regardless of HMB treatment during gestation. In conclusion, dietary HMB supplementation in pregnant mice did not affect birth weight, variations in birth weight, or growth performance of offspring.

AB  - Seed priming with sorghum water extract (SWE) enhances crop tolerance to salinity stress; however, the application of SWE under salinity for camelina crop has not been documented so far. This study evaluated the potential role of seed priming with SWE in improving salt stress tolerance in camelina. Primed (with 5% SWE and distilled water-hydropriming) and nonprimed seeds were sown under control (no salt) and salt stress (10 dS m(-1)) conditions. Salinity reduced camelina's emergence and growth, while seed priming with SWE improved growth under control and stress conditions. Under salt stress, seed priming with SWE enhanced emergence percentage (96.98%), increased root length (82%), shoot length (32%), root dry weight (75%), shoot dry weight (33%), alpha-amylase activity (66.43%), chlorophyll content (60-92%), antioxidant enzymes activity (38-171%) and shoot K+ ion (60%) compared with nontreated plants. Similarly, under stress conditions, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and shoot Na+ ion were reduced by 60, 31, and 40% by seed priming with SWE, respectively, over the nonprimed seeds. Therefore, seed priming with SWE may be used to enhance the tolerance against salt stress in camelina.

AB  - AimEntomopathogenic fungi infect and kill a wide range of insects and other arthropod pests. They exhibit versatility as biological control agents, capable of targeting a wide range of hosts. Additionally, they have been used to develop various formulations of agricultural biopesticides. Although this sole role of pest management that has traditionally been ascribed to entomopathogenic fungi is well documented, recent findings provided evidence of other possible functions that can be harnessed to enhance soil-plant systems' productivity.MethodsThis study examines that aspect of entomopathogenic fungi through a comprehensive review of the literature and metadata and discusses the potential and prospects for further increased acceptance in the field. The first segment of this study primarily focuses on analysing the existing metadata, whereas the subsequent discussion section provides in-depth review of the topic.ResultsIt was revealed that entomopathogenic fungi positively influence soil aggregation through various mechanisms including the production of glomalin-like substances and other glycoprotein polysaccharides. Additionally, these fungi contribute to organic matter and nutrient recycling, promote plant growth, and facilitate overall soil health. Furthermore, they were found to initiate induced resistance in crop plants, thereby aiding in the prevention of herbivorous feeding, alleviation of stress, and reduction of diseases in the host plant.ConclusionAlthough some studies have reported limitations associated with these fungi, such as lengthy killing time, environmental specificity, toxicosis production, and challenges regarding isolation and characterization, we have reached the conclusion that these ubiquitous fungi may be important in nutrient recycling, soil health improvement, and as bodyguards for plant growth and productivity. More studies are still needed to understand the underlying mechanisms, and it should be added that different experimental designs can lead to contradictory results.

AB  - The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor with roles in cell development, apoptosis, oncogenesis, aging, and homeostasis in response to stresses and infections. p53 is tightly regulated by the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. The p53-MDM2 pathway has coevolved, with MDM2 remaining largely conserved, whereas the TP53 gene morphed into various isoforms. Studies on prevertebrate ancestral homologs revealed the transition from an environmentally induced mechanism activating p53 to a tightly regulated system involving cell signaling. The evolution of this mechanism depends on structural changes in the interacting protein motifs. Elephants such as Loxodonta africana constitute ideal models to investigate this coevolution as they are large and long-living as well as having 20 copies of TP53 isoformic sequences expressing a variety of BOX-I MDM2-binding motifs. Collectively, these isoforms would enhance sensitivity to cellular stresses, such as DNA damage, presumably accounting for strong cancer defenses and other adaptations favoring healthy aging. Here we investigate the molecular evolution of the p53-MDM2 system by combining in silico modeling and in vitro assays to explore structural and functional aspects of p53 isoforms retaining the MDM2 interaction, whereas forming distinct pools of cell signaling. The methodology used demonstrates, for the first time that in silico docking simulations can be used to explore functional aspects of elephant p53 isoforms. Our observations elucidate structural and mechanistic aspects of p53 regulation, facilitate understanding of complex cell signaling, and suggest testable hypotheses of p53 evolution referencing Peto's Paradox.

AB  - Simple Summary Flies are often associated with urban waste, myiasis and decomposing bodies. Helicobia aurescens is found in carcasses and could be useful to forensic entomologists in the determination of the postmortem interval. However, a few studies are available regarding the morphology and biology of this species. We describe aspects of the life cycle at two temperatures (27 +/- 1 degrees C and 29 +/- 1 degrees C) and analyze the morphological characteristics of the eggs, larvae, and puparia of H. aurescens using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A lower temperature affected the flesh fly development, increasing the total development time. The immature morphology was very similar to those of the others sarcophagids. No hatching lines or median areas were detected on the eggshells. The first-instar larva is very similar to those of the other species. The anterior spiracles have six or seven ramifications aligned regularly at the second instar. But, on the third instar, these structures have eight ramifications in a regular row and are located dorsolaterally. The puparia are similar to that of the third-instar larvae.Abstract Helicobia aurescens is a flesh fly associated with pig and rat carcasses. This study aims to describe the life cycle at two temperatures (27 +/- 1 degrees C and 29 +/- 1 degrees C) and analyze the morphological characteristics of the eggs, larvae, and puparia of H. aurescens using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Temperature is an abiotic factor that greatly influences the development of insects. The larval development of H. aurescens lasts longer at 27 +/- 1 degrees C than it does at 29 +/- 1 degrees C, affecting the growth of newly hatched larvae into adults. The females larviposited three times more at 27 degrees C than they did at 29 degrees C, and the number of days laying larvae was also greater. At 27 degrees C, they laid larvae for 38 days, whereas, at 29 degrees C, the females larviposited for 21 days. No hatching lines or median areas were detected on the exochorion with SEM, as in the other sarcophagid species. The first-instar larva is very similar to those of the other species. The second instar has anterior spiracles present on the first thoracic segment, with six or seven ramifications aligned regularly. On the third instar, these structures have eight ramifications in a regular row and are located dorsolaterally. The puparium morphology is similar to that of the third-instar larvae.

AB  - The growth, development and reproduction of herbivorous insects could be altered due to changes in quality and quantity of their host plants under elevated CO2. The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is one of the most serious and destructive economic pests in rice growing areas in Asia. In this study, we investigated the effect of elevated CO2 on the growth, development and reproduction of N. lugens and, in particular, on the hormonal regulation of the transcription factors in N. lugens. The results indicated that compared with ambient CO2, elevated CO2 significantly shortened the duration of egg and nymph, longevity of female adults and total adults, and significantly decreased the weight of adults; besides, elevated CO2 significantly improved the fecundity of female adults, egg hatching rata and the transcription levels of Vg. The relative expression levels of JHMAT- and FAMeT-regulated synthesis of JH were first down-regulated and then up-regulated with the development of the 5th instar nymph of N. lugens under elevated CO2. In addition, the relative expression level of cyp314a1 played an important role in synthesis of ecdysone was up-regulated in the 5th instar nymph of N. lugens under elevated CO2. We have demonstrated that elevated CO2 could accelerate the development and improve the reproduction of N. lugens, which is related to the transcription levels of JH, MH and Vg.

AB  - Patients with hyperthyroidism are commonly diagnosed with mood disorders. Naringin, (4 ',5,7-trihydrocyflavanone-7-O-rhamnoglucoside), a natural bioflavonoid, has many neurobehavioral activities including anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. The role of Wingless (Wnt) signaling in psychiatric disorders is considered substantial but debatable. Recently, regulation of Wnt signaling by naringin has been reported in different disorders. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the possible role of Wnt/GSK-3 ss/ss-catenin signaling in hyperthyroidism-induced mood disturbances and explore the therapeutic effects of naringin. Hyperthyroidism was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 mg/kg levothyroxine for 2 weeks. Naringin was orally administered to rats with hyperthyroidism at a dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg for 2 weeks. Hyperthyroidism induced mood alterations as revealed by behavioral tests and histopathological changes including marked necrosis and vacuolation of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Intriguingly, hyperthyroidism activated Wnt/p-GSK-3 ss/ss catenin/DICER1/miR-124 signaling pathway in the hippocampus along with an elevation in serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline contents and a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) content. Additionally, hyperthyroidism induced upregulation of cyclin D-1 expression, malondialdehyde (MDA) elevation, and glutathione (GSH) reduction. Naringin treatment alleviated behavioral and histopathological alterations and reversed hyperthyroidism-induced biochemical changes. In conclusion, this study revealed, for the first time, that hyperthyroidism could affect mental status by stimulating Wnt/p-GSK-3 ss/ss catenin signaling in the hippocampus. The observed beneficial effects of naringin could be attributed to increasing hippocampal BDNF, controlling the expression of Wnt/p-GSK-3 ss/ss-catenin signaling as well as its antioxidant properties.

AB  - Embryo transfer (ET) has transformed swine biotechnology, enabling genetic advancements and disease control. However, its success remains inconsistent, partly due to immune-mediated challenges at the maternal-fetal interface. This study explores the immunological environment of hemi-allogeneic pregnancies (via artificial insemination, AI) versus allogeneic pregnancies (via ET) in pigs during the critical implantation phase. Sows were categorized into groups based on pregnancy type and fetal counts, reflecting varying outcomes. Endometrial immune cell populations, including T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Notably, allogeneic pregnancies with poor outcomes displayed elevated NK cell and macrophage infiltration alongside reduced Treg presence, contributing to a proinflammatory environment. In contrast, allogeneic pregnancies with favorable outcomes exhibited immune profiles resembling hemi-allogeneic pregnancies, suggesting enhanced maternal-fetal tolerance. These findings underscore the immunological variability driving embryo survival rates in ET pregnancies and highlight key cellular targets for improving reproductive efficiency. Further research on immunomodulatory strategies is vital to optimize ET success in swine and other species.

AB  - Objective 5.8 GHz spectrum is gaining more attention in wireless technology. To explore the potential hazards, we investigated the effect of exposure to 5.8 GHz microwave on learning and memory ability of rats. Methods Morris Water maze (MWM), Novel object recognition (NOR) and Fear conditioning test (FCT) were used to evaluate the ability of spatial and non-spatial memory of rats. The hippocampal morphology, the level of brain injury factors in serum and the mitochondrial membrane potential of hippocampal neurons was examined to evaluate the damage of hippocampal neurons. The density of dendritic spines, the ultrastructure of synapses and the level of PSD95, Synaptophysin, p-CREB and CREB were detected to evaluate the hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Results Compared with Sham group, there was no significant difference in the performance of ethology (in MWM, NOR, FCT) in Microwave 2 h group or Microwave 4 h group. The hippocampal morphology, the serum level of brain injury factors and the content of mitochondrial JC-1 monomer in Microwave 2 h group or Microwave 4 h group did not change obviously, compared with Sham group. The density of dendritic spines, the ultrastructure of synapse and the level of PSD95, Synaptophysin, p-CREB and CREB in hippocampus in Microwave 2 h group or Microwave 4 h group did not significantly change, compared with Sham group. Conclusion Under this experimental condition, exposure to 5.8 GHz microwave could not affect the hippocampal synaptic plasticity of rats.

AB  - Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is involved in both establishment of first pluripotent lineage and pluripotency maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in mice. However, the histone substrates and role of CARM1 in early embryonic development remain largely unknown. Here, we show that CARM1 specifically catalyzes H3R26me2 to promote porcine blastocyst formation. The putative histone substrates of CARM1, including H3R2me2, H3R17me2, and H3R26me2, are present in pig early embryos. The changes of CARM1 mRNA during early embryogenesis parallel that of H3R26me2. Functional studies using a combinational approach of chemical inhibition and RNA interference (RNAi) showed that catalytic activity inhibition of CARM1 protein or knockdown (KD) of CARM1 mRNA did not alter the levels of both H3R2me2 and H3R17me2, but significantly reduced H3R26me2 levels in porcine embryos. Furthermore, CARM1 inhibition or KD did not affect embryo development to the 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and morula stages, but severely compromised blastocyst development. CARM1 knocked down embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage had fewer total cells, inner cell mass (ICM), and trophectoderm (TE) cells. Mechanistically, single embryo RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that CARM1 KD altered the transcriptome characterized by downregulation of key genes associated with Hippo and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CARM1 specifically catalyzes H3R26me2 in porcine embryos and participates in blastocyst development.

AB  - Different living organisms are used as applicable bioindicators to determine heavy metal pollutions. Recent studies have shown that helminths parasites can be used as efficient environmental sentinels. This study aimed to evaluate Fasciola hepatica and Dicrocoelium dendriticum as bioaccumulators of lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu). For this work. A total of 50 samples (F. hepatica, D. dendriticum, and livers from the infected and uninfected sheep, each of 10 samples) were collected from sheep slaughtered in Tabriz abattoir. One gram of each sample was incinerated and analyzed by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The analysis of samples showed that Pb, Cr and Cu values in F. hepatica were higher than those in D. dendriticum, but only the differences of Pb and Cu were significant. The values of heavy metals in F. hepatica were significantly higher than those in the infected livers (except for Cd), while in D. dendriticum, Cr and Cd were only higher. Based on metal levels in livers, it was found that bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of Cr, Pb and Cu for F. hepatica were much more than one, and BCFs of these three metals between two flukes were statistically significant. This study indicated that F. hepatica had a higher bioindicator potential than D. dendriticum to evaluate environmental pollutants by some metals. (c) 2022 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sod culture (SC) and conventional agriculture (CA) represent two distinct field management approaches utilized in the cultivation of tea plants in Taiwan. In this study, we employed gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence techniques to assess the impact of SC and CA methods on the photosynthetic machinery of Camellia sinensis cv. TTES No.12 (Jhinhsuan) in response to variable light intensities across different seasons. In spring, at photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) ranging from 800 to 2,000 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1), the net photosynthesis rate (Pn, 10.43 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), stomatal conductance (Gs, 126.11 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1)), electron transport rate (ETR, 137.94), and Delta F/Fm' and Fv/Fm (50.37) values for plants grown using SC were comparatively higher than those cultivated under CA. Conversely, the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) values for SC-grown plants were relatively lower (3.11) compared to those grown under CA at 800 to 2,000 PPFD in spring. Additionally, when tea plants were exposed to PPFD levels below 1,500 mu mol photon m(- 2) s(- 1), there was a concurrent increase in Pn, Gs, ETR, and NPQ. These photosynthetic parameters are crucial for devising models that optimize cultivation practices across varying seasons and specific tillage requirements, and for predicting photosynthetic and respiratory responses of tea plants to seasonally or artificially altered light irradiances. The observed positive impacts of SC on maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax), Fv/Fm, Gs, water-use efficiency (WUE), and ETR suggest that SC is advantageous for enhancing the productivity of tea plants, thereby offering a more adaptable management model for tea gardens.

AB  - The molecular evolution of the mammalian heater protein UCP1 is a powerful biomarker to understand thermoregulatory strategies during species radiation into extreme climates, such as aquatic life with high thermal conductivity. While fully aquatic mammals lost UCP1, most semiaquatic seals display intact UCP1 genes, apart from large elephant seals. Here, we show that UCP1 thermogenic activity of the small-bodied harbor seal is equally potent compared to terrestrial orthologs, emphasizing its importance for neonatal survival on land. In contrast, elephant seal UCP1 does not display thermogenic activity, not even when translating a repaired or a recently highlighted truncated version. Thus, the thermogenic benefits for neonatal survival during terrestrial birth in semiaquatic pinnipeds maintained evolutionary selection pressure on UCP1 function and were only outweighed by extreme body sizes among elephant seals, fully eliminating UCP1-dependent thermogenesis.

AB  - Through long-term coevolution with host plants, insects have evolved sophisticated detoxification systems to counteract plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). However, the precise mechanisms underlying these adaptations remain incompletely characterized. Our previous research identified epsilon glutathione S-transferases (GSTes) as critical mediators of xanthotoxin adaptation in Spodoptera litura, a model linear furanocoumarin. This study reveals that heterologous overexpression of five xanthotoxin-responsive GSTes in Escherichia coli significantly enhances bacterial tolerance to this PSM. Disk diffusion assays and metabolic studies demonstrated that both GSTe1 and GSTe16 mediate xanthotoxin adaptation via dual mechanisms involving antioxidant activity and catalytic metabolism. Fluorescent competitive binding experiments indicated that all five GSTes exhibit non- catalytic xanthotoxin sequestration capabilities. These in vitro observations were complemented by in vivo genetic manipulation of GSTe16, which exhibited the most potent defense activity against xanthotoxin. CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated GSTe16 knockout in S. litura significantly increased larval susceptibility to xanthotoxin, while transgenic Drosophila melanogaster overexpressing GSTe16 showed enhanced tolerance to xanthotoxin. Furthermore, the endogenous biosynthesis of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) was provoked upon exposure to xanthotoxin, and 20E application enhanced the larval tolerance to xanthotoxin as well as the expression levels of GSTe16. Dual-luciferase reporter assays identified two functional cis-regulatory elements in the GSTe16 promoter that facilitate transcriptional activation by the ecdysone receptor (EcR)/ultraspiracle (USP) heterodimer. Overall, this study elucidates the biochemical defense characteristics and transcriptional responses of GSTes to xanthotoxin in S. litura, providing novel insights into the counter-defense mechanisms of herbivorous insects against host plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Pigs have been used in various animal model studies on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) across both animal science and biomedical science fields. Recently, intestinal organoids have been used as a research tool for the GIT, and they have also been applied to farm animals, including pigs. However, to our knowledge, no functional studies of the porcine intestine using intestinal organoids have been conducted to date. In the present study, we developed two porcine intestinal organoid models (basal-out and apical-out organoids) and compared their characteristics. We also confirmed the possibility of conducting research related to intestinal functions, such as nutrient uptake and gut barrier function. The present study suggests that porcine intestinal organoids can be used as potential models for future GIT mechanism studies, such as host-microbe interactions, harmful ingredient tests, and nutritional research. Pig models provide valuable research information on farm animals, veterinary, and biomedical sciences. Experimental pig gut models are used in studies on physiology, nutrition, and diseases. Intestinal organoids are powerful tools for investigating intestinal functions such as nutrient uptake and gut barrier function. However, organoids have a basal-out structure and need to grow in the extracellular matrix, which causes difficulties in research on the intestinal apical membrane. We established porcine intestinal organoids from jejunum tissues and developed basal-out and apical-out organoids using different sub-culture methods. Staining and quantitative real-time PCR showed the difference in axis change of the membrane and gene expression of epithelial cell marker genes. To consider the possibility of using apical-out organoids for intestinal function, studies involving fatty acid uptake and disruption of the epithelial barrier were undertaken. Fluorescence fatty acid was more readily absorbed in apical-out organoids than in basal-out organoids within the same time. To determine whether apical-out organoids form a functional barrier, a fluorescent dextran diffusion assay was performed. Hence, we successfully developed porcine intestinal organoid culture systems and showed that the porcine apical-out organoid model is ideal for the investigation of the intestinal environment. It can be used in future studies related to the intestine across various research fields.

AB  - Metastasis is a crucial stage in tumour progression, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) support metastasis through their participation in extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. CD248 is a possible biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-derived CAFs, but its role in mediating ECM stiffness to promote NSCLC metastasis is unknown. We investigated the significance of CD248(+) CAFs in activating the Hippo axis and promoting connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression, which affects the stromal collagen I environment and improves ECM stiffness, thereby facilitating NSCLC metastasis. In this study, we found that higher levels of CD248 in CAFs induced the formation of collagen I, which in turn increased extracellular matrix stiffness, thereby enabling NSCLC cell infiltration and migration. Hippo axis activation by CD248(+) CAFs induces CTGF expression, which facilitates the formation of the collagen I milieu in the stromal matrix. In a tumour lung metastasis model utilizing fibroblast-specific CD248 gene knockout mice, CD248 gene knockout mice showed a significantly reduced ability to develop tumour lung metastasis compared to that of WT mice. Our findings demonstrate that CD248(+) CAFs activate the Hippo pathway, thereby inducing CTGF expression, which in turn facilitates the collagen I milieu of the stromal matrix, which promotes NSCLC metastasis.

AB  - Simple Summary The weight features of Alpine Merino Sheep, particularly their live weight in the 14th month (WT), are crucial in production and breeding, as they live at high altitudes and in highland areas where oxygen is scarce. Genome selection (GS) offers the advantages of minimizing breeding costs and generational intervals, and the main objective of genome selection breeding is the accuracy of GS. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were used in this study to extract the variation information related to the 14-month-old body weight trait of Alpine Merino Sheep, identify candidate genes associated with this trait, and employ GWAS results as prior information to conduct GS research on the trait to determine the most suitable GS breeding model for the target trait.Abstract Alpine Merino Sheep is a novel breed reared from Australian Merino Sheep as the father and Gansu Alpine Fine-Wool Sheep as the mother, living all year in cold and arid alpine areas with exceptional wool quality and meat performance. Body weight is an important economic trait of the Alpine Merino Sheep, but there is limited research on identifying the genes associated with live weight in the 14th month for improving the accuracy of the genomic prediction of this trait. Therefore, this study's sample comprised 1310 Alpine Merino Sheep ewes, and the Fine Wool Sheep 50K Panel was used for genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis to identify candidate genes. Moreover, the trial population (1310 ewes) in this study was randomly divided into two groups. One group was used as the population for GWAS analysis and screened for the most significant top 5%, top 10%, top 15%, and top 20% SNPs to obtain prior marker information. The other group was used to estimate the genetic parameters based on the weight assigned by heritability combined with different prior marker information. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of genomic breeding value estimation when combined with prior marker information from GWAS analysis with the optimal linear unbiased prediction method for genome selection (GBLUP) for the breeding value of target traits. Finally, the accuracy was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. This research provides theoretical and technical support to improve the accuracy of sheep genome selection and better guide breeding. The results demonstrated that eight candidate genes were associated with GWAS analysis, and the gene function query and literature search results suggested that FAM184B, NCAPG, MACF1, ANKRD44, DCAF16, FUK, LCORL, and SYN3 were candidate genes affecting live weight in the 14th month (WT), which regulated the growth of muscle and bone in sheep. In genome selection analysis, the heritability of GBLUP to calculate the WT was 0.335-0.374, the accuracy after five-fold cross-verification was 0.154-0.190, and after assigning different weights to the top 5%, top 10%, top 15%, and top 20% of the GWAS results in accordance with previous information to construct the G matrix, the accuracy of the WT in the GBLUP model was improved by 2.59-7.79%.

AB  - Nasal mites are endoparasites that spend their entire life cycle inside the nasal cavities and respiratory passages of birds. The brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater (Boddaert, 1783) (hereafter BHCO), is an icterid bird that uses brood parasitism as a reproductive strategy in which it lays eggs in the nests of other bird species and allows the host to raise its young. Interestingly, nasal mites previously collected from brown-headed cowbirds represent some species shared by other icterids and others known from common host taxa. In this study, we examined how nasal mite species richness and prevalence differed geographically across three of the four migratory flyways of North America in a large sample size of BHCO. In total, similar to 4000 nasal mites (similar to 3900 Rhinonyssidae (Mesostigmata) and 85 Ereynetidae (Trombidiformes)), representing nine species, were recovered from 856 cowbirds with a prevalence of 89%. Nasal mite prevalence was not significantly related with geographic location or host sex, suggesting that patterns of infection in BHCO occur similarly in all locations.

AB  - The angiosperm family Elaeagnaceae comprises three genera and ca. 100 species distributed mainly in Eurasia and North America. Little family-wide phylogenetic and biogeographic research on Elaeagnaceae has been conducted, limiting the application and preservation of natural genetic resources. Here, we reconstructed a strongly supported phylogenetic framework of Elaeagnaceae to better understand inter- and intrageneric relationships, as well as the origin and biogeographical history of the family. For this purpose, we used both nuclear and plastid sequences from Hyb-Seq and genome skimming approaches to reconstruct a well-supported phylogeny and, along with current distributional data, infer historical biogeographical processes. Our phylogenetic analyses of both nuclear and plastid data strongly support the monophyly of Elaeagnaceae and each of the three genera. Elaeagnus was resolved as sister to the well-supported clade of Hippophae and Shepherdia. The intrageneric relationships of Elaeagnus and Hippophae were also well resolved. High levels of nuclear gene tree conflict and cytonuclear discordance were detected within Elaeagnus, and our analyses suggest putative ancient and recent hybridization. We inferred that Elaeagnaceae originated at ca. 90.48 Ma (95% CI 1 / 4 89.91-91.05 Ma), and long-distance dispersal likely played a major role in shaping its intercontinentally disjunct distribution. This work presents the most comprehensive phylogenetic framework for Elaeagnaceae to date, offers new insights into previously unresolved relationships in Elaeagnus, and provides a foundation for further studies on classification, evolution, biogeography, and conservation of Elaeagnaceae.

AB  - The application of biogas slurry in agriculture production is regarded as a sustainable method for mitigating the environmental impacts of fertilization. To investigate the effects of biogas slurry application on soil nitrogen loss and crop yield, a field plot experiment was conducted within a wheat-maize rotation system. This study assessed the effects of three levels of biogas slurry nitrogen substitution, 50% (BSF), 100% (BS), and 150% (EBS), on the yield of silage maize and wheat, nitrogen use efficiency, and soil nitrogen loss. The findings revealed that in the first year (characterized by high rainfall), the application of the biogas slurry led to increased NH3 emissions and nitrogen leaching, resulting in a notable rise in the annual nitrogen loss. Additionally, it was observed that as the amount of applied biogas slurry increased, the nitrogen loss also rose correspondingly. However, in the second year (a period of drought conditions), despite the elevated NH3 emissions from the biogas slurry, there was a significant reduction in nitrogen leaching, which resulted in reductions of 14.2% and 20.0% in annual nitrogen loss for the BSF and BS treatments, respectively, with comparable nitrogen input to the fertilizer treatment. Throughout both years, the application of biogas slurry did not decrease the yield of silage maize and wheat, and notably, the BS treatment even enhanced the crop nitrogen utilization efficiency. Compared with other nitrogen fertilizer treatments, the EBS treatment did not increase crop yield even with an increased nitrogen application rate; it also reduced the nitrogen utilization efficiency and N loss. In conclusion, employing biogas slurry to replace chemical fertilizer (equivalent nitrogen substitution) during drought years can enhance nitrogen utilization efficiency, reduce nitrogen loss, and sustain crop yield. When applying biogas slurry in years with substantial rainfall, effective measures should be implemented to mitigate nitrogen loss.

AB  - The escalating global fecal waste and rising CO2 levels present dual significant environmental challenges, further intensified by urbanization. Traditional fecal waste management methods are insufficient, particularly in addressing the related health risks and environmental threats. This study explores the synthesis of biochar from pig manure as a carbon substrate to disperse and stabilize Cu nanoparticles, resulting in the formation of an efficient Cu-NB-2000 electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR). Through characterization analyses and electrolysis tests, the structure-activity relationships were evaluated, revealing enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity towards value-added multicarbon products. At an optimal potential, the catalyst achieved a remarkable faradaic efficiency for ECR (87.14%) and multicarbon products (44.80%), outperforming previously reported biochar-supported Cu catalysts. The high selectivity was attributed to the substantial presence of pyridine N and the distinctive Cu-N coordination structure. This work introduces, for the first time, a method for preparing an ECR catalyst by loading Cu nanoparticles onto biochar derived from pig manure. This approach not only promotes the valorization of organic waste but also efficiently converts CO2, offering an effective strategy for an integrated "pollution reduction-carbon mitigation" management system.

AB  - Simple Summary Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2; PGI2) is an important modulator of vascular functions and is involved in various reproductive processes. PGI2 was also described as a modulator of uterine contractility in several species, including the pig. However, its synthesis and role in the myometrium of the porcine uterus are still not fully described. The objective of this study was to evaluate profiles of PGI2 synthesis and PGI2 receptor expression in the myometrium of gilts throughout the estrous cycle and during early pregnancy and to investigate the in vitro effect of PGI2 on the mRNA expression of factors engaged in smooth muscle contraction, nutrient transport, prostaglandin synthesis and action, and inflammatory response. The obtained results showed that the synthesis of PGI2 changes in the myometrium of pigs during both the estrous cycle and early pregnancy, resulting in much greater concentrations of PGI2 in cyclic than in pregnant gilts. Moreover, PGI2 stimulated the expression of fatty acid transporters and contractility-related calponin 1 and caldesmon 1, whereas it decreased cytokine expression. This study indicates that PGI2 may participate in the regulation of myometrial functions modulating the availability of factors involved in smooth muscle activity and inflammatory reaction in the uterus of pigs. Although prostacyclin (PGI2) has been well described as a regulator of smooth muscle activity, limited data are available concerning its role in the myometrium of pigs. The present research aimed to examine profiles of PGI2 synthase (PTGIS) and PGI2 receptor (PTGIR) expression and 6-keto PGF1 alpha (a PGI2 metabolite) concentrations in the myometrium of gilts throughout the estrous cycle and during early pregnancy using qPCR, Western blot, and/or ELISA methods. Furthermore, myometrial explants were exposed to iloprost (a stable PGI2 analog) to investigate the effect of PGI2 on the mRNA expression of factors engaged in smooth muscle contraction, nutrient transport, prostaglandin synthesis and action, and inflammatory response. PTGIS mRNA expression was greater in cyclic than in pregnant gilts on days 11-12 after estrus and was accompanied by greater concentrations of 6-keto PGF1 alpha detected in cyclic than in pregnant animals on days 11-20. Iloprost stimulated fatty acid transporters and contractility-related calponin 1 and caldesmon 1 mRNA expression and decreased interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor transcript abundance. The obtained results indicate a physiologically relevant role of PGI2 during the estrous cycle in the porcine myometrium with its importance for regulating the expression of contractility-, nutrient transport- and inflammatory response-related factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The demand for animal products is increasing in developing countries due to population growth. However, livestock production contributes significantly to global warming, accounting for 25%. Probiotics can help improve livestock efficiency by enhancing gut microbes and fat metabolism. They can modify rumen populations, enhance fermentation, reduce methane emissions and improve feed digestion. In this study, the goal was to determine the most effective method of reducing methane emissions in the rumen of sheep in vitro by adding different concentrations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis. RESULTS: Adding 8 x 10(6) CFU g(-1)S. cerevisiae during fermentation reduced pH levels after 48 h. This also increased the concentrations of NH3-N, microbial protein and total gas production. At the same time, it decreased methane emissions. Furthermore, adding 20 x 10(6) CFU g(-1)B. subtilis to the mixture increased total gas production (TGP) and methane production, with the highest production observed after 48 h. However, it did not affect pH levels after 48 h. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that S. cerevisiae had significantly increased microbial protein and NH3-N concentrations after fermentation without altering pH. Additionally, the addition of S. cerevisiae enhanced TGP and reduced methane emissions. It is worth noting that TGP increased because B. subtilis was added at a concentration of 20 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), with no significant differences between concentrations. Therefore, we recommend adding S. cerevisiae and B. subtilis to the diet at doses of 8 and 20 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), as it resulted in higher TGP and reduced methane emissions. <br /> (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Stress, particularly during childhood, is a major risk factor for the development of depression. Depression is twice as prevalent in women compared to men, which suggests that biological sex also contributes to depression susceptibility. However, the neurobiology underpinning sex differences in the long-term consequences of childhood stress remains unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether stress applied during the prepubertal juvenile period (postnatal day 27-29) in rats induces sex-specific changes in anxiety-like behaviour, anhedonia, and antidepressant-like behaviour in adulthood in males and females. The impact of juvenile stress on two systems in the brain associated with these behaviours and that develop during the juvenile period, the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and hippocampal neumgenesis, were also investigated. Juvenile stress altered escape-oriented behaviours in the forced swim test in both sexes, decreased latency to drink a palatable substance in a novel environment in the novelty-induced hypophagia test in both sexes, and decreased open field supported rearing behavior in females. These behavioural changes were accompanied by stress-induced increases in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the prefrontal cortex of both sexes, but not other regions of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system. Juvenile stress did not impact anhedonia in adulthood as measured by the saccharin preference test and had no effect hippocampal neurogenesis across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. These results suggest that juvenile stress has long-lasting impacts on antidepressant-like and reward-seeking behaviour in adulthood and these changes may be due to alterations to catecholaminergic innervation of the medial prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Background The sorghum aphid Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) (Homoptera: Aphididae) is an important insect in the late growth phase of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). However, the mechanisms of sorghum response to aphid infestation are unclear. Results In this paper, the mechanisms of aphid resistance in different types of sorghum varieties were revealed by studying the epidermal cell structure and performing a transcriptome and metabolome association analysis of aphid-resistant and aphid-susceptible varieties. The epidermal cell results showed that the resistance of sorghum to aphids was positively correlated with epidermal cell regularity and negatively correlated with the intercellular space and leaf thickness. Transcriptome and metabolomic analyses showed that differentially expressed genes in the resistant variety HN16 and susceptible variety BTX623 were mainly enriched in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and differentially expressed metabolites were mainly related to isoflavonoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis. The q-PCR results of key genes were consistent with the transcriptome expression results. Meanwhile, the metabolome test results showed that after aphidinfestation, naringenin and genistein were significantly upregulated in the aphid-resistant variety HN16 and aphid-susceptible variety BTX623 while luteolin was only significantly upregulated in BTX623. These results show that naringenin, genistein, and luteolin play important roles in plant resistance to aphid infestation. The results of exogenous spraying tests showed that a 1 parts per thousand concentration of naringenin and genistein is optimal for improving sorghum resistance to aphid feeding. Conclusions In summary, the physical properties of the sorghum leaf structure related to aphid resistance were studied to provide a reference for the breeding of aphid-resistant varieties. The flavonoid biosynthesis pathway plays an important role in the response of sorghum aphids and represents an important basis for the biological control of these pests. The results of the spraying experiment provide insights for developing anti-aphid substances in the future.

AB  - Contemporary scientific animal research often relies on the synchronization and combination of various vital signs to obtain a complete picture of an animal's welfare. Observer XT software not only provides detailed and refined data on animal behaviour, but also allows the visualization of physiological data. It also facilitates the export and synchronization of ethological data with other physiological indicators. The aim of the present study is to review the practical use of Observer XT software for synchronizing and integrating ethological observations in large and small ruminants with different physiological parameters in relation to their welfare. To achieve this goal, we reviewed over 250 official documents and scientific publications through online databases, such as PubMed, Research Gate, and Elsevier. They are related to using Observer XT software to integrate data from video recordings of various behavioural reactions of large and small ruminants with their physiological, hormonal, biochemical, and other indicators concerning their poor and positive welfare. As a result, we summarized and systematized the scientific data from the practical use of Observer XT software to synchronize and integrate indicators from ethological observations in sheep and cattle with other multimodal data. This permitted us to establish relationships and regularities between the various vital indicators and, as a result, to obtain a more complete picture of animal welfare, as well as to significantly improve the quality of scientific research. Based on the obtained data, Observer XT software proved to be an optimal method for integrating and synchronizing ethological data in research with different physiological parameters in large and small ruminants in relation to their poor and positive welfare.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of spermatogenesis associated protein 6 (SPATA6) in Hu sheep testis and to ascertain the effects of SPATA6 on sheep Leydig cells (LCs) function linked to spermatogenesis. In the present study, we detected a 1970 bp cDNA fragment of SPATA6 included a 1467 bp coding sequence which encoded 487 amino acids. Meanwhile, sheep SPATA6 shared 51.70%-97.41% amino acid sequences with its orthologs compared with other species. In addition, SPATA6 was highly expressed in testis and localized in cytoplasm and nucleus of LCs as well as spermatogenic cells at different stages. Compared to the negative control (NC), SPATA6 interference promoted apoptosis of LCs with the increase of BAX/BCL-2 mRNA and protein levels, while the results of SPATA6 overexpression were on the contrary. Meanwhile, cell cycle was blocked at G2/M phase and CDK1 and CCNB1 were down-regulated after SPATA6 interference. SPATA6 overexpression induced cell cycle transfer G0/G1 into S and G2/M phase with upregulation of CDK1, CDK4, CCND1 and CCND2. Moreover, the secretion of testosterone hormone and the expression of StAR in LCs with SPATA6 overexpression were significantly promoted. Overall, our data suggest that SPATA6 is an important functional molecule of spermatogenesis, via regulating the proliferation, apoptosis and testosterone biosynthesis of Hu sheep LCs. These findings will enhance the understanding of the roles of SPATA6 in sheep spermatogenesis.

AB  - Most studies of collective animal behaviour rely on short-term observations, and comparisons of collective behaviour across different species and contexts are rare. We therefore have a limited understanding of intra- and interspecific variation in collective behaviour over time, which is crucial if we are to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape collective behaviour. Here, we study the collective motion of four species: shoals of stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), flocks of homing pigeons (Columba livia), a herd of goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and a troop of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). First, we describe how local patterns (inter-neighbour distances and positions), and group patterns (group shape, speed and polarization) during collective motion differ across each system. Based on these, we place data from each species within a 'swarm space', affording comparisons and generating predictions about the collective motion across species and contexts. We encourage researchers to add their own data to update the 'swarm space' for future comparative work. Second, we investigate intraspecific variation in collective motion over time and provide guidance for researchers on when observations made over different time scales can result in confident inferences regarding species collective motion.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Collective behaviour through time'.

AB  - Plant disease occurs simultaneously with insect attack. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) modify plant biotic stress response. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and pathogens may modify plant volatile organic compound (VOC) production and insect behavior. Nevertheless, such effects are rarely studied, particularly for mesocosms where component organisms interact with each other.Plant-mediated effects of leaf pathogen (Phoma medicaginis) infection on aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) infestation, and role of AMF (Rhizophagus intraradices) in modifying these interactions were elucidated in a glasshouse experiment. We evaluated alfalfa disease occurrence, photosynthesis, phytohormones, trypsin inhibitor (TI) and total phenol response to pathogen and aphid attack, with or without AMF, and aphid behavior towards VOCs from AMF inoculated and non-mycorrhizal alfalfa, with or without pathogen infection.AM fungus enhanced alfalfa resistance to pathogen and aphid infestation. Plant biomass, root : shoot ratio, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, salicylic acid, and TI were significantly increased in AM-inoculated alfalfa. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and pathogen significantly changed alfalfa VOCs. Aphids preferred VOCs of AM-inoculated and nonpathogen-infected to nonmycorrhizal and pathogen-infected alfalfa.We propose that AMF alter plant response to multiple biotic stresses in ways both beneficial and harmful to the plant host, providing a basis for strategies to manage pathogens and herbivore pests.

AB  - Trichomes are a first line of defense of plants against herbivorous arthropods, but they can also act as a barrier against natural enemies hampering biological control programmes. Despite the abundance of trichome types on tomato plants, many herbivorous arthropods can still evade these defenses. Over the past decades, numerous studies have evaluated the impact of tomato trichomes on phytophagous arthropods, yet few have examined their effects on biological control agents. Moreover, studies on the complex tri-trophic interactions among tomato plants, arthropod pests, and natural enemies remain limited, highlighting the need for further research to deepen our understanding of these relationships. Understanding the effects of tomato trichomes on both pests and biological control agents could enhance pest management strategies, informing tomato breeding and biological control programs. To support ongoing research and practical applications, this paper reviews the effects of tomato trichomes on the development of pests, including that of phytophagous mites and their natural enemies, with a particular focus on predatory mites. Current challenges and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Sin Nombre virus (SNV) is a zoonotic virus that is highly pathogenic to humans. The deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, is the primary host of SNV, and SNV prevalence in P. maniculatus is an important indicator of human disease risk. Because the California Channel Islands contain permanent human settlements, receive hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, and can have extremely high densities of P. maniculatus, surveillance for SNV in island P. maniculatus is important for understanding the human risk of zoonotic disease. Despite the importance of surveillance on these heavily utilized islands, SNV prevalence (i.e. the proportion of P. maniculatus that test positive to antibodies to SNV) has not been examined in the last 13-27 years. We present data on 1,610 mice sampled for four consecutive years (2014-2017) on five of the California Channel Islands: East Anacapa, Santa Barbara, Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente. Despite historical data indicating SNV-positive mice on San Clemente and Santa Catalina, we detected no SNV-positive mice on these islands, suggesting very low prevalence or possible loss of SNV. Islands historically free of SNV (East Anacapa, Santa Barbara, and San Nicolas) remained free of SNV, suggesting that rates of pathogen introduction from other islands and/or the mainland are low. Although continued surveillance is warranted to determine whether SNV establishes on these islands, our work helps inform current human disease risk in these locations and suggests that SNV prevalence on these islands is currently very low.

AB  - BackgroundFibrous scars frequently form at the sites of bone nonunion when attempts to repair bone fractures have failed. However, the detailed mechanism by which fibroblasts, which are the main components of fibrous scars, impede osteogenesis remains largely unknown.ResultsIn this study, we found that fibroblasts compete with osteogenesis in both human bone nonunion tissues and BMP2-induced ectopic osteogenesis in a mouse model. Fibroblasts could inhibit the osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) via direct and indirect cell competition. During this process, fibroblasts modulated the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of YAP in MSCs. Knocking down YAP could inhibit osteoblast differentiation of MSCs, while overexpression of nuclear-localized YAP-5SA could reverse the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation of MSCs caused by fibroblasts. Furthermore, fibroblasts secreted DKK1, which further inhibited the formation of calcium nodules during the late stage of osteogenesis but did not affect the early stage of osteogenesis. Thus, fibroblasts could inhibit osteogenesis by regulating YAP localization in MSCs and secreting DKK1.ConclusionsOur research revealed that fibroblasts could modulate the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of YAP in MSCs, thereby inhibiting their osteoblast differentiation. Fibroblasts could also secrete DKK1, which inhibited calcium nodule formation at the late stage of osteogenesis.

AB  - Simple Summary: Neurotrophin receptor B (NTRK2) is a member of the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) family, and recent studies have shown that the NTRK2 gene plays an important role in mammalian reproduction. The expression of the NTRK2 gene is often closely related to the production and quality of gametes in mammals. In the present study, we found that overexpression of the NTRK2 gene upregulated the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation and genes associated with steroid synthesis in sheep granulosa cells, and then verified this result by examining cell proliferation levels and hormone levels. We further demonstrated that NTRK2 activates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is well known to regulate cell proliferation. These findings suggest that NTRK2 plays a role in regulating the proliferation and hormone secretion of sheep GCs through the PI3K-AKT pathway. These studies provide valuable insights into the regulatory role of the NTRK2 gene in follicular development in sheep. Neurotrophin receptor B (NTRK2), also named TRKB, belongs to the neurotrophic factor family. Previous studies have shown that NTRK2 is associated with high fertility in mammals. However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory pathway of this neurotrophic factor remain unclear. In this study, NTRK2 overexpression and NTRK2-siRNA were constructed to detect the effects of NTRK2 on the proliferation and hormone secretion of the ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) of sheep. We successfully isolated follicular phase granulosa cells in vitro from the ovaries of sheep in simultaneous estrus, and the immunofluorescence results confirmed that NTRK2 was expressed in the collected cells. Subsequently, the effect of NTRK2 on the proliferation of sheep granulosa cells was examined via cell transfection experiments. The results showed that the expression of CDK4 and CyclinD2 was significantly increased after NTRK2 overexpression, while the opposite trend was observed after the inhibition of NTRK2 expression (p < 0.05). The EdU and CCK-8 assays showed that the proliferation rate of sheep GCs was significantly increased after NTRK2 overexpression, while the opposite trend was observed after the inhibition of NTRK2 expression (p < 0.05). Moreover, NTRK2 significantly increased the expression of steroidogenesis-related genes, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) and hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B1), and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1). The ELISA results showed that the secretion levels of E2 and P4 significantly increased after NTRK2 overexpression, while the opposite trend was observed after the inhibition of NTRK2 expression (p < 0.05). Previous studies had confirmed that NTRK2 gene belongs to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and participates in the signaling of this pathway. This was demonstrated by protein-protein interaction analysis and NTRK2 belongs to the PI3K-AKT pathway. The modification of PI3K and AKT, markers of the PI3K-AKT pathway, via phosphorylation was increased after NTRK2 overexpression in the sheep GCs, while the opposite trend was observed after the inhibition of NTRK2 expression (p < 0.05). Overall, these results suggest that the NTRK2 gene regulates the proliferation of GCs and the secretion of steroid hormones in sheep, and that it influences the phosphorylation level of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These findings provided a theoretical basis and new perspectives for exploring the regulation of NTRK2 gene in the development of ovine follicles.

AB  - The Southern Ocean circulation plays a central role in regulating the global ocean overturning, ventilating the deep ocean, and driving sea level rise by delivering heat to Antarctic ice shelves. Understanding heat and freshwater content in this region is key to monitoring these global processes and identifying multi-year changes; however, in situ observations are limited and often do not offer the spatial or temporal consistency needed to study long-term variability. Perturbations in steric height can reveal changes in oceanic heat and freshwater content inasmuch as they impact the density of the water column. Here, we show for the first time that the monthly steric height anomaly of the Southern Ocean south of 50 degrees S can be assessed using satellite altimetry and GRACE gravimetry data from 2002 to 2018. Steric height anomalies are validated against in situ Argo float and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data from tagged elephant seals. We find good agreement north of 65 degrees S, but there is increasing uncertainty towards the Antarctic continental shelf due to insufficient validation data, the leakage error, and anti-aliasing in GRACE. The Southern Ocean steric height anomalies capture the expected seasonal cycle of low (high) steric height in winter (summer) and show regionally variable trends during 2002-2018. We find that the variability in steric height is driven predominantly by anomalies in surface heat and freshwater content associated with positive and negative phases of the two major modes of Southern Hemisphere climate variability (the El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode). This steric height dataset provides a uniquely comprehensive insight into density anomalies and presents opportunities for further analysis of heat and freshwater fluxes, changes in stratification, or convective regimes across the Southern Ocean.

AB  - During mammalian oocyte meiosis, spindle migration and asymmetric cytokinesis are unique steps for the successful polar body extrusion. The asymmetry defects of oocytes will lead to the failure of fertilization and embryo implantation. In present study, we reported that an actin nucleating factor Formin-like 2 (FMNL2) played critical roles in the regulation of spindle migration and organelle distribution in mouse and porcine oocytes. Our results showed that FMNL2 mainly localized at the oocyte cortex and periphery of spindle. Depletion of FMNL2 led to the failure of polar body extrusion and large polar bodies in oocytes. Live-cell imaging revealed that the spindle failed to migrate to the oocyte cortex, which caused polar body formation defects, and this might be due to the decreased polymerization of cytoplasmic actin by FMNL2 depletion in the oocytes of both mice and pigs. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that FMNL2 was associated with mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins, and FMNL2 depletion disrupted the function and distribution of mitochondria and ER, showing with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and the occurrence of ER stress. Microinjecting Fmnl2-EGFP mRNA into FMNL2-depleted oocytes significantly rescued these defects. Thus, our results indicate that FMNL2 is essential for the actin assembly, which further involves into meiotic spindle migration and ER/mitochondria functions in mammalian oocytes.

AB  - PFASs are highly persistent in the environment and the potential exists for terrestrial biota to accumulate PFAS, which may result in exposure of higher tmphic level organisms to these compounds through consumption. However, trophic transfer of proteinophilic compounds such as PFAS has not been extensively studied and the degree to which plant-accumulated PFAS will be transferred to herbivorous consumers is unclear. Here, we exposed Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) plants to a suite of 7 different PFAS, including 4 carboxylic acids (PFOA, PFHxA, PFHpA and PFDA) and 3 sulfonates (PFBS, PFHxS and PFOS). Exposed leaf tissues were subsequently fed to Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) caterpillars. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) were all below 1 and patterns of uptake and elimination were similar between the different PFAS. However, PFOS bioaccumulated in the hornworms to a much higher concentration, with approximately 5-fold higher BMFs and assimilation efficiencies (AEs) than other PFAS tested. AE and BMF, as well as PFAS uptake by the plants, were positively correlated with PFAS carbon chain length for both sulfonates and carboxylic acids, providing evidence that longer chain PFAS may be more efficiently accumulated (or less efficiently eliminated) than shorter-chain PFAS in some contexts.

AB  - This study examines a hot issue that has received a lot of attention in 2019, Ethiopia, which is the death of over 28 hippos in Gibe-Sheleko National Park (GSNP) in southern Ethiopia, which has gone undiscovered until now. A psychometric explanation for the extinction of hippos was developed using a qualitative research approach that included in-depth interviews (28), focus groups (3), and key informant participants (3) who were carefully selected. Concerning the cause of the hippos' death we found three psychometric reasons: (1) the government-owned farm and the park's irresponsible management system are the primary causes of hippos' deaths, (2) crop, cattle, and property damage by the hippos, and (3) personal defense from the animals' attack. We found that the Ministry of Environment and Forests should support park administrative governments in upgrading habitat to boost food and water availability and prevent animal migration from park forests to habitations. Furthermore, we discovered that national and international media outlets performed their investigations into the interaction between the Gibe Woreda people and the animals following the deaths of over 28 hippos in the region. We understand that this had occurred for a political plot to get public attention and media publicity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of pasture (cocksfoot cv. porto (CFP) and lucerne) and supplementation of grazing lambs with pellets with or without plant oil infusion on performance and carcass characteristics. Forty-eight White Suffolk x Corriedale first-cross weaners were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a split-plot experimental design: (1) CFP or lucerne pastures only (control); CFP or lucerne pastures supplemented with pellets infused with oil from (2) canola (CO); (3) rice bran (RBO) and (4) no oil pellets (NOP). Lucerne and CFP pastures were considered as the main plot effect, and played the role of basal pastures. Lambs grazing lucerne or CFP pastures with pellet supplementation achieved carcass weights of >22 kg at 9 weeks, which met the specific requirements of Asian and United States of America export markets. Pellet supplementation did not affect final liveweight, average daily gain, body length, withers height and chest girth of grazing lambs. Dressing percentage of lambs grazing CFP pasture with pellet supplementation and lambs grazing lucerne pasture with RBO supplementation increased compared with lambs on pasture grazing only. Although supplementing lambs on CFP pasture with CO had relatively negligible impact on feed conversion efficiency, it significantly increased over the hook trade value compared with lambs grazing CFP pasture only. In conclusion, lucerne or CFP pasture plus pellet supplementation produced lamb carcasses >22 kg suitable for the export market. CO had relatively low feed cost per unit daily gain (0.9 $AU/kg on CFP pasture and 0.6 $AU/kg on lucerne pasture) and could also be used as a tactical supplementation tool for increasing the carcass weight of lambs grazing CFP pasture.

AB  - In gilts, puberty is marked by standing estrus in the presence of a boar. Delayed puberty (DP; failure to display pubertal estrus) is a major reason for gilt removal. To investigate the physiological determinants underlying DP in gilts, transcriptomic data from tissues relevant to estrus and puberty, such as mediobasal hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, ovarian cortex, olfactory bulb, amygdala, and hippocampus, were obtained from age-matched DP (n = 8) and cyclic control gilts at follicular phase (n = 8) and luteal phase (n = 8) of the estrous cycle. A gene expression module analysis via three-way gene x individual x tissue clustering using tensor decomposition identified pituitary and ovary gene modules contributing to regulation of pubertal development. Analysis of gene expression in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovary axis identified reduced expression of hypothalamic genes critical for stimulating gonadotropin secretion (KISS1 and TAC3) and reduced expression of LHB in the anterior pituitary of DP gilts compared with their cyclic counterparts. Consequently, luteinizing hormone-induced genes in the ovary important for folliculogenesis (OXTR, RUNX2, and PTX3) were less expressed in DP gilts. Other intrafollicular genes (AHR, PTGS2, PTGFR, and IGFBP7) and genes in the steroidogenesis pathways (STAR and CYP11A1) necessary to complete the ovulatory cascade were also less expressed in DP gilts. This is the first clustering of multi-tissue expression data from DP and cyclic gilts to identify genes differentially expressed in gilts of similar ages but at different levels of sexual development. A critical lack of gonadotropin support and reduced ovarian responsiveness underlie DP in gilts.

AB  - There is limited data on the effect of UV light exposure versus orally ingested vitamin D-3 on vitamin D metabolism and health. A 4-week study with 16 pigs (as a model for human physiology) was conducted. The pigs were either supplemented with 20 mu g/d vitamin D-3 or exposed to UV light for 19 min/d to standardize plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 levels. Important differences were higher levels of stored vitamin D-3 in skin and subcutaneous fat, higher plasma concentrations of 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 and increases of cutaneous lumisterol(3) in UV-exposed pigs compared to supplemented pigs. UV light exposure compared to vitamin D-3 supplementation resulted in lower hepatic cholesterol, higher circulating plasma nitrite, a marker of the blood pressure-lowering nitric oxide, and a reduction in the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, plasma metabolome and stool microbiome analyses did not reveal any differences between the two groups. To conclude, the current data show important health relevant differences between oral vitamin D-3 supplementation and UV light exposure. The findings may also partly explain the different vitamin D effects on health parameters obtained from association and intervention studies.

AB  - ObjectiveSheep are commonly used as large animal pre-clinical models for investigating cardiovascular therapies, interventions, anatomy and physiology. Further, novel small diameter vascular grafts are frequently tested via implantation into sheep carotid arteries (CAs). This is because, unlike humans, acute occlusion of one or both sheep CAs is not associated with morbidity or mortality and thus provides safer experimental testing, with reduced ethical constraints, animal numbers and costs. However, to date there has been no evidence regarding sheep tolerance of femoral artery (FA) occlusion.MethodsIn this study, seven sheep underwent CA graft surgery, with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the CAs performed every 2 months via femoral access, for a total of 8 months. Four months into the study, the left FA of two sheep became inaccessible due to a suspected FA occlusion. Thus, femoral angiography was performed, followed by FA dissection, FA histology and retrospective analysis of both veterinarian animal monitoring and pain scores.ResultsFA angiography and histology confirmed complete left FA occlusion in two sheep. Retrospective animal monitoring demonstrated sheep with occluded FAs did not display increased pain scores or deleterious effects on their gait or wellbeing.ConclusionOur data shows that sheep tolerate FA occlusion with no symptoms, similar to their cerebral circulation, making them an appropriate model for assessing small diameter femoral graft interposition studies and testing other cardiovascular interventions.

AB  - Out-of-season lambing is based in productive aims; however also modifies the basic physiology of the ewe. It might affect ewes and lambs' behaviours at birth, their bond, the process of lambs' independence from their mothers and their response to weaning. This study aimed to compare the ewe-lamb bond from birth to artificial weaning in out-of-season lambing (autumn) and spring lambing. A complementary aim was to determine if out of-season breeding affects ewes' udder size, milk yield and composition, body condition score (BCS) and body weight of the ewes and lambs. The study was performed with 26 multiparous single-lambing Corriedale ewes that lambed in spring (natural season: group SPR), and 26 ewes that lambed in autumn (out-of-season: group AUT) and their lambs. The ewe-lamb behaviours were recorded during a separation-reunion test performed 24-36 h after birth. Lambs' behaviours were recorded before and after weaning (at 80 days of age). Ewes' BCS and body weight were recorded at mating, lambing and weaning. Lambs' body weight was recorded at lambing, before and after weaning. Ewes' milk yield and composition were determined before weaning. During the separation reunion test, although AUT lambs vocalised more often than SPR lambs their mothers remained further away (P = 0.01). Before weaning, AUT ewe-lamb dyads were observed more often far from each other (P < 0.001); AUT lambs attempted to suckle more times (P < 0.001) and grazed less frequently than SPR lambs (P = 0.004). At weaning, AUT lambs walked more frequently, but were less often standing up than SPR lambs (P < 0.001 for both behaviours). While SPR lambs decreased their grazing frequency on the day of weaning, AUT lambs increased it, grazing more frequently than SPR lambs (P < 0.001). AUT ewes lambed with a greater BCS and body weight than SPR ewes (P = 0.01 and P = 0.031, respectively), but this was reverted at weaning (BCS: P < 0.001; body weight: P = 0.002). SPR ewes had a greater milk yield, with more fat, lactose and protein amount than AUT ewes (P < 0.001 for all variables). At weaning, SPR lambs were heavier than AUT lambs (P < 0.001). In conclusion, although AUT ewes were in better body condition after birth, the ewe-lamb bond of the AUT group was weaker. This was associated with a lower expression of maternal attention when AUT lambs requested maternal care. The better environmental conditions of SPR dyads during lactation might positively impact their social and nutritional behaviours. The difference between groups remained until weaning, so AUT and SPR lambs displayed different behavioural strategies to cope with artificial weaning.

AB  - Herbivorous insects generally choose host plants that optimize their growth. However, many specialists choose chemically defended host plants that slow their growth, prioritizing protection from natural enemies. Invasive specialist herbivores may have an added advantage in their non-native range where they lack co-evolved specialist natural enemies, in addition to being unpalatable to generalist predators. Here, we explore the diet preferences of the invasive yellowmargined leaf beetle, Microtheca ochroloma and those of native natural enemies. We measured M. ochroloma preferences among six Brassica cultivars varying in glucosinolate concentrations. In both field and laboratory experiments, M. ochroloma preferred the relatively less defended host plants, mizuna and Chinese cabbage. M. ochroloma grew quickest on mizuna. Generalist predators also preferred to eat M. ochroloma larvae that had been fed mizuna in choice trials, yet in the field, predatory insects were least commonly found on mizuna, and most commonly found on plants dominated by native herbivores. M. ochroloma consumes plants that increase their susceptibility to predators, but predation pressure in the field appears to be generally low. Our results suggest that invasive specialist herbivores may prioritize growth over protection against natural enemies. Weak top-down regulation of specialist herbivore invaders might enable them to exploit less-defended host plants in their novel range that facilitate faster growth and exacerbate crop damage. Invasive pests may be more effectively managed by leveraging plant preferences in the novel host range in trap crop systems.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread foodborne parasite that affects both humans and animals worldwide. The genetic characterization of this parasite has become crucial due to its epidemiological and clinical implications. The present study focused on the direct genetic characterization of T. gondii-positive DNA samples from Northern Italy, using three standardized genotyping methods. Of the 87 PCR-positive DNA samples obtained from livestock, wild, and captive animals, 9 were confirmed, quantified, and subsequently subjected to typing procedures: microsatellite analysis, PCR-RFLP, and partial sequencing of GRA6 and SAG3 genes. Most of the typed samples, derived from clinical cases of toxoplasmosis, specifically related to abortion outbreaks in small ruminants, as well as one case of systemic toxoplasmosis in lemur (Lemur catta). Predominantly, Type II strains were observed, with non-clonal variants identified in a sheep and a lemur. Sequencing of SAG3 revealed specific single nucleotide polymorphism, previously documented in European type-II variants, with phylogenesis suggesting a potential genetic relatedness between T. gondii population in Italy, Spain, and France. By utilizing three distinct genotyping methods, this study provides the first comprehensive microsatellite profiles of T. gondii in Italy, and additional insights into the molecular variability of T. gondii strains circulating in this country from different epidemiological settings.

AB  - This study investigated if in vitro supplementation of vitexin could mitigate the adverse effects of hyperthermia on buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BuMECs). Immortalized BuMECs were divided into seven groups (n = 3): (1) a negative control group at 37 degrees C; (2) BuMECs exposed to heat stress as a positive control at 42 degrees C for 1 h; (3-7) heat stressed BuMECs pre-treated or co-treated with different concentrations of vitexin (5 & mu;M, 10 & mu;M, 20 & mu;M, 50 & mu;M, and 100 & mu;M), respectively. Hyperthermia was induced by exposing the cells to 42 oC for 1 h. For the pre-treatment experiment, BuMECs were treated with vitexin for 2 h before hyperthermia exposure. For cotreatment, vitexin was added simultaneously with hyperthermia for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were allowed to recover for 12 h at 37 degrees C. Results showed that pre-treatment with vitexin was more effective than co-treatment in protecting BuMECs from hyperthermia in a dose-dependent manner, with higher concentrations (50 & mu;M and 100 & mu;M) being the most effective. Pre-treatment with vitexin maintained cellular viability and prevented inflammation by inducing the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene (BCL-2) and reducing the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene (Bax) and pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1 & beta;, IL-6) in heat-stressed BuMECs. Pre-treatment with vitexin reduced oxidative stress and induced thermotolerance by increasing the expression of antioxidants mediators such as SOD, GPx and CAT at mRNA and protein levels, and modulating the expression of heat shock proteins. The findings suggest that vitexin has the potential as a therapeutic agent to protect the mammary gland from the negative impact of hyperthermia in dairy cows.

AB  - Neuroscience techniques, including in vivo recording, have allowed for a great expansion in knowledge; however, this technology may also affect the very phenomena researchers set out to investigate. Including both female and male mice in our associative learning experiments shed light on sex differences on the impact of chronic implantation of tetrodes on learning. While previous research showed intact female mice acquired trace eyeblink conditioning faster than male and ovariectomized females, implantation of chronic microdrive arrays showed sexually dimorphic effects on learning. Microdrive implanted male mice acquired the associative learning paradigm faster than both intact and ovariectomized females. These effects were not due to the weight of the drive alone, as there were no significant sex-differences in learning of animals that received "dummy drive" implants without tetrodes lowered into the brain. Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry and western blot analysis suggest that significant alterations in the MAPK pathway, acute inflammation, and brain derived neurotrophic factor may underlie these observed sex- and surgery-dependent effects on learning.

AB  - Benzenoids (C-6-C-1 aromatic compounds) play important roles in plant defense and are often produced upon herbivory. Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) produces a variety of volatile and nonvolatile benzenoids involved in various defense responses. However, their biosynthesis in poplar is mainly unresolved. We showed feeding of the poplar leaf beetle (Chrysomela populi) on P. trichocarpa leaves led to increased emission of the benzenoid volatiles benzaldehyde, benzylalcohol, and benzyl benzoate. The accumulation of salicinoids, a group of nonvolatile phenolic defense glycosides composed in part of benzenoid units, was hardly affected by beetle herbivory. In planta labeling experiments revealed that volatile and nonvolatile poplar benzenoids are produced from cinnamic acid (C-6-C-3). The biosynthesis of C-6-C-1 aromatic compounds from cinnamic acid has been described in petunia (Petunia hybrida) flowers where the pathway includes a peroxisomal-localized chain shortening sequence, involving cinnamate-CoA ligase (CNL), cinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/dehydrogenase (CHD), and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT). Sequence and phylogenetic analysis enabled the identification of small CNL, CHD, and KAT gene families in P. trichocarpa. Heterologous expression of the candidate genes in Escherichia coli and characterization of purified proteins in vitro revealed enzymatic activities similar to those described in petunia flowers. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the CNL subfamily in gray poplar (Populus x canescens) resulted in decreased emission of C-6-C-1 aromatic volatiles upon herbivory, while constitutively accumulating salicinoids were not affected. This indicates the peroxisomal beta-oxidative pathway participates in the formation of volatile benzenoids. The chain shortening steps for salicinoids, however, likely employ an alternative pathway.

AB  - Herbivorous insects utilize olfactory and visual cues to orient on suitable host plants, and such cues can be employed to facilitate insect monitoring. Lygus lineolaris Palisot de Beauvois is a polyphagous pest throughout North America. Monitoring this pest as it moves between crop and non-crop hosts remains challenging, and a lack of effective monitoring tools complicates management of this insect. In this study, we examined the electrophysiological and behavioral responses of L. lineolaris to the volatile emissions of 2 crop hosts: alfalfa and strawberry. Gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection was applied to identify antennally active compounds in headspace extracts of flowering host plants, before responses to individual compounds were examined in the field. Five compounds consistently elicited antennal depolarizations in adults of L. lineolaris and, of these, (+/-)-linalool increased the capture rate of L. lineolaris females in the field. Subsequent experiments examined the influence of visual cues and stereochemistry on capture rate, revealing that lures containing (+/-)-linalool and (S)-(+)-linalool significantly increased the capture rate of L. lineolaris females compared with traps baited with (R)-(-)-linalool and controls, indicating that L. lineolaris is attracted to (S)-(+)-linalool. While lures increased capture on red traps, this was not the case for white traps, emphasizing the importance of visual cues in the movements and monitoring of L. lineolaris. This study demonstrates that L. lineolaris is attracted to (S)-(+)-linalool in the field, and that attraction depends on trap color. This knowledge is expected to improve monitoring strategies for L. lineolaris in agricultural systems.

AB  - The production of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) is a type of indirect defense used by plants to attract natural enemies and reduce herbivory by insect pests. In many crops little is known about genotypic variation in HIPV production or how this may affect natural enemy attraction. In this study, we identified and quantified HIPVs produced by 10 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) cultivars infested with a prominent aphid pest, the sorghum aphid (Melanaphis sorghi Theobald). Volatiles were collected using dynamic headspace sampling techniques and identified and quantified using GC-MS. The total amounts of volatiles induced by the aphids did not differ among the 10 cultivars, but overall blends of volatiles differed significantly in composition. Most notably, aphid herbivory induced higher levels of methyl salicylate (MeSA) emission in two cultivars, whereas in four cultivars, the volatile emissions did not change in response to aphid infestation. Dual-choice olfactometer assays were used to determine preference of the aphid parasitoid, Aphelinus nigritus, and predator, Chrysoperla rufilabris, between plants of the same cultivar that were un-infested or infested with aphids. Two aphid-infested cultivars were preferred by natural enemies, while four other cultivars were more attractive to natural enemies when they were free of aphids. The remaining four cultivars elicited no response from parasitoids. Our work suggests that genetic variation in HIPV emissions greatly affects parasitoid and predator attraction to aphid-infested sorghum and that screening crop cultivars for specific predator and parasitoid attractants has the potential to improve the efficacy of biological control.

AB  - While reperfusion, or restoration of coronary blood flow in acute myocardial infarction, is a requisite for myocardial salvage, it can paradoxically induce a specific damage known as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Our understanding of the precise pathophysiological molecular alterations leading to I/R remains limited. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive and unbiased time-course analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the post-reperfused myocardium of two different animal models (pig and mouse) and evaluated the effect of two different cardioprotective therapies (ischemic preconditioning and neutrophil depletion). In pigs, a first wave of irreversible oxidative damage was observed at the earliest reperfusion time (20 min), impacting proteins essential for cardiac contraction. A second wave, characterized by irreversible oxidation on different residues and reversible Cys oxidation, occurred at late stages (6-12 h), affecting mitochondrial, sarcomere, and inflammation-related proteins. Ischemic preconditioning mitigated the I/R damage caused by the late oxidative wave. In the mouse model, the two-phase pattern of oxidative damage was replicated, and neutrophil depletion mitigated the late wave of I/R-related damage by preventing both Cys reversible oxidation and irreversible oxidation. Altogether, these data identify protein PTMs occurring late after reperfusion as an actionable therapeutic target to reduce the impact of I/R injury.

AB  - Endothelin Receptor Type B (EDNRB) is expressed in a variety of cells during embryonic stage, including melanocyte precursors cells. Our previous studies found that 11 bp deletion of EDNRB caused the two-end black (TEB) coat color in Chinese pigs. In this study, we aimed to explore the mutant EDNRB on the formation of TEB coat color in Chinese pigs. We constructed recombinant plasmid for wild and mutant EDNRB and EDN1, respectively, and transfected the recombinant plasmid into mouse B16 melanoma cells in groups. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect expression of genes that participate in melanin pathway, including PLC gamma, Raf, MITF. Comparing to the wild-type EDNRB cells, expression of the three genes in the cell line expressing mutant EDNRB cells was significantly reduced. We measured the melanin content produced by transfected recombinant granulocytes of wild and mutant EDNRB and found that the amount of melanin in mutant EDNRB cells was significantly lower than that of the wild. Wound-healing assay confirmed that the migration and mobility rate of mutant EDNRB cells were significantly lower than the wild. Co-immunoprecipitation further confirmed that mutant EDNRB could not interact with the EDN1 protein. In conclusion, this study revealed that the 11 bp deletion of EDNRB reduced the melanin production, which may be caused by inhibiting the expression of PLC gamma, Raf, and MITF. The mutant EDNRB reduced melanocyte migration and could not interact with the EDN1 protein. We explored the effect of mutant EDNRB in Chinese pigs with TEB coat color, and the results provided a reference for exploring molecular mechanism of mutant EDNRB on the formation of TEB coat color pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding differential mechanisms of the subcutaneous adipose tissue between indigenous breeds and modern pig breeds is important. After transcriptome sequencing and liposome detection of the subcutaneous adipose tissue in Ningxiang pigs, Berkshires and F1 offspring, we retrieved differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and significantly changed lipids (SCLs) in different groups. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and lipidomic profiles and KEGG annotation revealed that the difference in fat deposition among Ningxiang pig, Berkshires, and F1 offspring may be caused by differences in the expression patterns of key genes in multiple enriched KEGG pathways. This study identified the key genes and lipids and also provided insights into selection for backfat thickness and the fat composition of adipose tissue for pig breeding.Abstract Adipose tissue composition contributes greatly to the quality and nutritional value of meat. Transcriptomic and lipidomic techniques were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the differences in fat deposition in Ningxiang pigs, Berkshires and F1 offspring. Transcriptomic analysis identified 680, 592, and 380 DEGs in comparisons of Ningxiang pigs vs. Berkshires, Berkshires vs. F1 offspring, and Ningxiang pigs vs. F1 offspring. The lipidomic analysis screened 423, 252, and 50 SCLs in comparisons of Ningxiang pigs vs. Berkshires, Berkshires vs. F1 offspring, and Ningxiang pigs vs. F1 offspring. Lycine, serine, and the threonine metabolism pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways were significantly enriched in comparisons of Berkshires vs. Ningxiang pigs and Berkshires vs. F1 offspring. The DEGs (PHGDH, LOC110256000) and the SCLs (phosphatidylserines) may have a great impact on the glycine, serine, and the threonine metabolism pathway. Moreover, the DEGs (FASN, ACACA, CBR4, SCD, ELOV6, HACD2, CYP3A46, CYP2B22, GPX1, and GPX3) and the SCLs (palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and icosadienoic acid) play important roles in the fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism of fatty acids. Thus, the difference in fat deposition among Ningxiang pig, Berkshires, and F1 offspring may be caused by differences in the expression patterns of key genes in multiple enriched KEGG pathways. This research revealed multiple lipids that are potentially available biological indicators and screened key genes that are potential targets for molecular design breeding. The research also explored the molecular mechanisms of the difference in fat deposition among Ningxiang pig, Berkshires, and F1 pigs, and provided an insight into selection for backfat thickness and the fat composition of adipose tissue for future breeding strategies.

AB  - This study checked the efficacy of progesterone (P4) device reinsertion during the early luteal phase on luteal function and embryo yield in superovulated crossbred ewes. Twenty multiparous ewes received an intravaginal P4 device for nine days (D0 to D9) followed by six decreasing doses (25, 25, 15, 15, 10, 10%) of 133 mg pFSH i.m. at 12 h intervals, starting 60 h before P4 device removal. Ewes were naturally mated at 12 h intervals while in estrus. On D13, ewes with viable corpora lutea (CL; n = 19) were equally allocated for receiving their P4 device reinsertion (G-P4; n = 10) or not (G-Control; n = 9). On D17, the P4 device was removed, and all females received the cervical relaxation protocol 16 h to 20 min before non-surgical embryo recovery. CL count and their functionality classification were performed on D13 and D17 by transrectal B-mode and color Doppler ultrasonography (US). Plasma P4 concentrations (ng/mL) of G-P4 ewes increased (P < 0.05) over the days, being greater on D17 (9.2 & PLUSMN; 2.8) than on D9 (1.9 & PLUSMN; 0.7) and D13 (1.6 & PLUSMN; 0.4). The overall CL count per ewe tended to be greater (P = 0.09) in G-P4 compared with GControl. The occurrence of premature regression of corpora lutea did not differ (P > 0.05) between G-P4 (30.0%) and G-Control (44.4%). The number of ova/embryos recovered was greater (P < 0.05) in G-P4 (11.6 & PLUSMN; 2.9) compared with G-Control (3.7 & PLUSMN; 2.0), respectively. Altogether, the reinsertion of the P4 device for four days after superovulation in ewes promotes greater P4 concentrations, resulting in greater ova/embryos recovered.

AB  - Background Oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1) is an endothelial receptor that binds and degrades oxidized low-density lipoproteins (Ox-LDL), thus having a physiological role in metabolism. Polymorphisms in the OLR1 gene are associated with animals with different production traits. Due to this, the study aimed to determine if OLR1 polymorphisms in Awassi ewes associate with live body weight and body measurement. Methods and results In this study, 200 ewes between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years, not pregnant or lactating, were selected. Phenotypic measurements including live body weight and body measurements were collected. A sheep's blood was collected to extract genomic DNA, genotyped, and sequenced to confirm the presence of the variants that arose from the amplified fragments. One novel C246A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified in the OLR1 gene (exon 3) that assigned two genotypes CC and CA. The study indicated significant differences (P <= 0.05) in live body weight and body measurements of the genotype CC compared with the genotype CA. The genotype CC correlated positively with live body weight, height at shoulder, height at hip, chest girth, and chest width (r = 0.67, P = 0.02), (r = 0.54, P = 0.03), (r = 0.61, P = 0.02), (r = 0.53, P = 0.01) and (r = 0.66, P = 0.04) respectively. Conclusions Sheep with the CC genotype had a higher live body weight and larger body measurement, making them better for productivity. These genotypic data and associations can be used to better select sheep for future marker-assisted selection programs.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) on ovarian vascularisation and plasma progesterone (P4) levels in Murrah buffaloes during an ovulation synchronisation protocol. Twenty buffaloes were divided into two groups: with eCG (n = 20) and without eCG (control, n = 20) in a crossover design. A 1.0 g progesterone intravaginal device (DIB) was inserted and 2 mg oestradiol benzoate was administered intramuscularly on Day 0. On Day 9, DIB was removed, PGF2 alpha was administered to all animals and eCG was given to half. GnRH was administered on Day 11. Daily Doppler ultrasounds assessed follicular and luteal development and vascularisation from D9 to D16 and on Days 20, 24, 28 and 32. Blood samples were collected before each ultrasound to analyse plasma P4. Ovulation occurred on Day 13.42 +/- 1.17 in the eCG group (19/20) and 13.53 +/- 0.19 (14/20) in the control (p = 0.34). The ovulation rate was higher in the eCG group (95%) than in the control (70%). eCG increased the vascularised follicle perimeter on Days 11 (p = 0.018) and 12 (p = 0.03) and enhanced corpus luteum (CL) diameter on Day 16 (p < 0.001). A larger vascularised area was observed on Days 14-16, 20 and 24 (p < 0.05). P4 concentrations were higher in the eCG group on Days 15, 16, 20 and 24 (p < 0.05). Significant correlations were found between CL size, vascularisation and P4 concentration (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). In conclusion, eCG improves ovarian vascularisation, ovulation rates and plasma P4 levels, supporting its use to enhance reproductive performance in buffalo herds.

AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of wool traits is crucial for improving wool production. In this study, we investigated the ovine KAP13 gene family, which in humans contains multiple members, while only one member has been identified to date in sheep. Three ovine KRTAP13 genes, likely representing KRTAP13-1, KRTAP13-2, and KRTAP13-4, were identified through sequence analysis and phylogenetic comparisons. These genes are positioned on chromosome 1, between KRTAP15-1 and KRTAP27-1, in a pattern that is like the arrangement in humans but not identical. Analyses revealed multiple sequence variants of each gene in 356 sheep from a variety of wool, meat, and dual-purpose breeds. The effect of these genes on four fibre traits: mean fibre curvature (MFC), mean fibre diameter (MFD), coefficient of variation of fibre diameter (CVFD), and fibre diameter standard deviation (FDSD), was assessed in 240 lambs of the Chinese Tan sheep breed. An allele of KRTAP13-2 was revealed to be associated with a decrease in FDSD and CVFD in heterotypic fibres. No associations were found between KRTAP13-4 variation and wool traits, and an association analysis for KRTAP13-1 was not conducted because no variation was found in this gene in the Chinese Tan sheep studied. These findings suggest a potential role for KRTAP13-2 in regulating wool traits, particularly fibre diameter uniformity in larger heterotypic hair fibres, and suggest its potential use as a marker for improving wool traits.

AB  - Tropane alkaloids (TAs) are the main secondary metabolites found in Datureae (Solanaceae). These compounds are neurotoxic to many organisms. However, some insect species can sequester and accumulate TAs in their bodies. Brugmansia suaveolens (Humb. and Bonpl. ex Willd.) Bercht. and J.Presl, a Neotropical shrub, is known to produce TAs. In this study, we report the sequestration of TAs from B. suaveolens by Chromacris speciosa (Thunberg, 1824) (Orthoptera: Rhomaleidae) and Lema daturaphila Kogan & Goeden (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Both of these insects have been observed feeding on leaves from various species of Solanaceae in the study site. We analyzed extracts from insects and the host plant using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In B. suaveolens, we identified five TAs, while in the insect bodies, we found four. Scopolamine was the most abundant alkaloid in all the samples. This is the first report of TAs in these insects. While TAS may play a role in defense against generalist herbivores, further investigation is needed to understand the association between TAs and predators since both insects exhibit moderately aposematic features.

AB  - Opioid abuse modifies synaptic plasticity, which leads to behavioral changes, such as morphine dependence, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. Glial cells play an important role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and are involved in addictive-like behaviors. The indisputable role of glutamate in opiate addiction has been shown. Astrocytes, a type of glial cells, which are integral functional elements of synapses, modulate the concentration of glutamate in the synaptic space. One of the most important mechanisms for glutamate concentration regulation is its uptake from the synaptic cleft. In this study, we evaluated the role of hippocampal glial glutamate transporter (GLT-1) in morphine dependence. Male rats received subcutaneous (s.c.) morphine sulfate (10 mg/kg) at an interval of 12 h for 9 days. In order to activate GLT-1, animals received an intrahippocampal injection of ceftriaxone (0.5 mmol/0.5 mu l) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, 30 min before each morphine administration. Rats were assessed for morphine dependence by monitoring naloxone hydrochloride-induced morphine withdrawal. Our results showed that hippocampal microinjection of ceftriaxone, as an activator of GLT-1, reduced some signs of morphine withdrawal, such as activity, diarrhea, head tremor, freezing, and ptosis. It seems that hippocampal GLT-1 can be affected by chronic morphine administration and involved in morphine dependence. Therefore, its activation may reduce morphine side effects by reducing hippocampal glutamate.

AB  - Mattress is among the main products of ectopic fermentation system (EFS); however, the research on the data of antimicrobial residues in the mattress of EFS and risk assessments of mattress have not been conducted. This study involved a scale survey to assess the levels and distributions of 54 antimicrobial residues, including 4 tetracyclines, 19 quinolones, 22 sulfonamides, 3 amphenicols, and 6 macrolides in mattress on 12 swine farms that use ectopic fermentation systems (EFS) in Zhejiang Province. A total of 25 antimicrobials were detected in mattress, and the total residue amount of antimicrobial in mattress samples of each farm was 0.77-28.2 g/T. Chlortetracycline had the highest contribution rate, and the residue amount of antimicrobial in mattress is not entirely determined by the start-up time of EFS but is related to the use of feed containing antimicrobial, medication habits, the level of mattress management, and maintenance methods of EFS. The risk assessments of antimicrobial in the mattress were carried out. The results show that the risk of using mattress of EFS for soil is low.

AB  - In the past decades, zebrafish have gathered immense attention and importance in the field of neurological sciences. In the case of epilepsy, zebrafish have appeared as a promising acute animal model for the screening and identification of potential antiepileptic molecules. However, the necessity for establishing competent chronic models of epilepsy in zebrafish is apparent. In this regard, recently we developed a chemo-kindling zebrafish model with a better clinical resemblance. In the present study, an attempt to examine the effect of pentylene-tetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling on the cognitive functions of zebrafish was made. In brief, adult zebrafish were repetitively given a sub-effective concentration of PTZ, till the onset of clonic-tonic seizures, entitled as kindled. Thereafter, T-maze test and social recognition memory test were conducted to evaluate spatial memory and social novelty recognition memory of the fish. At the end, both the groups were sacrificed and the brains were isolated to estimate neurotransmitter and gene expression levels. It was observed that PTZ kindling induced spatial cognition deficits and lower social exploration in zebrafish. However, it didn't change the novelty recognition memory of kindled zebrafish. The results of genes and neurotransmitters estimations in the brain also supported the behavioural findings. The results concluded that PTZ kindling alters spatial cognitive functions in adult zebrafish without affecting the social novelty recognition memory.

AB  - This study used machine learning, particularly k-means clustering, to identify distinct clusters of users and their technological readiness to adopt various precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies based on their responses to a carefully designed questionnaire. The analysis revealed initially two as well as three distinct clusters representing different levels of technological readiness among farmers considering the adoption of various PLF technologies. In addition to the validation of the cluster results by internal metrics, a related principal component analysis, and a focus group evaluation, this paper describes the application of a Decision Tree as an explainable supervised machine learning approach to investigate the predictive power of specific survey questions. In combination, this research aims to provide valuable insights for understanding farmers' technological readiness, to enhance further survey designs, and to support the development of targeted strategies to promote the successful adoption of PLF technologies in the agricultural sector generally.

AB  - Cetaceans exhibit remarkable wound healing capabilities. However, the specific immune mechanisms underlying this process, particularly the role of gamma delta T cells, remains largely unexplored. In ruminants, pigs, and camelids, which are members of the order Cetartiodactyla alongside cetaceans, gamma delta T cells express a unique receptor called workshop cluster 1 (WC1). Despite cetaceans also belonging to this order, the presence of WC1 in their gamma delta T cells has not yet been reported. This study aims to investigate the distribution and potential function of gamma delta T cells in cetacean skin during homeostasis and wound healing. Using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining, we identified gamma delta TCR+ and WC1+ cells in dolphin skin for the first time. These cells are predominantly located in the dermis and blubber, with an increased presence in healing wounds, suggesting their involvement in wound healing rather than pathogen defense. Furthermore, our findings revealed that gamma delta TCR+ cells constitute a small fraction of CD3+MHCII+ cells in dolphin skin, indicating their intricate role in cetacean immunology. Additionally, the appearance of WC1+ cells in cetaceans highlights unique immunological features within Cetartiodactyla. Comparative analysis demonstrates that gamma delta T cells in dolphins exhibit distinctive morphological and distributional characteristics compared to those in humans, mice, and ruminants, implying species-specific adaptations. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of cetacean immunology and underscore the potential evolutionary adaptations that support their exceptional wound healing capabilities. Future research on the genomic and functional aspects of gamma delta T cells in cetaceans is essential to further elucidate their roles in immune response and wound healing.

AB  - Zinc and copper have been used as growth promotors in alternative to antibiotics in pig's diet. The aim was the ascertainment of the Zn and Cu concentrations in piglets' liver and kidney and their impact in the reduced susceptibility to Zn, Cu, and antibiotics in enterococci, used as microbiota biomarker. Zn and Cu were determined in the livers and kidneys of 43 piglets slaughtered in Portugal, by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Enterococci were isolated from feces for determining the identification of species (E. faecalis, E. faecium, and Enterococcus spp.); susceptibility to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, tigecycline, ampicillin, imipenem, and metals; and Cu tolerance genes. In piglets with Zn and Cu high or toxic levels, enterococci had reduced susceptibility to ions, reinforced by the presence of Cu tolerance genes and by resistance to antibiotics. The study relevance is to show the relationship between these metals' levels and decreased susceptibility to Cu, Zn, and antibiotics by enterococci. From the results, it could be supposed that the piglets were being fed with high doses of Zn and Cu which could select more resistant bacteria to both antibiotics and metals that could spread to environment and humans.

AB  - Environmental factors, such as the duration of daylight, can significantly influence the predation ability of arthropod predators. This study aimed to examine the influence of photoperiods of 8:16 h, 12:12 h, and 16:8 h (L:D) on the predation rate of Phytoseiulus persimilis preying on Tetranychus urticae eggs under constant temperature. The daily predation rate (Dj) and the total number of prey eggs consumed (Pj) per predator increased with longer photophases, reaching their peak in the 16L:8D photoperiod. The highest net predation rate (C0) was observed under 16L:8D conditions (173.22 prey eggs/predator), while it was 170.28 and 89.77 prey eggs/predator under the 12L:12D and 8L:16D photoperiods, respectively. The finite predation rate (omega) also increased with longer photophases. The transformation rate (Qp) was highest under the 16L:8D photoperiod. Significant differences were noted in the stable predation rate (psi), with the highest value being 5.84 prey eggs/predator under 16L:8D conditions. The number of T. urticae eggs predated by P. persimilis was higher under longer photoperiods, and the 16L:8D photoperiod can thus be recommended as optimal for the biocontrol of spider mites in controlled environments. We suggest that future research explores other effects of the light cycle on plant-herbivore-predator interactions to optimize the lighting conditions for effective spider mite control.

AB  - Key messageNOI10 and NOI11 are two RIN4-like/NOI proteins that participate in the immune response of the Arabidopsis plant and affect the RIN4-regulated mechanisms involving the R-proteins RPM1 and RPS2.AbstractThe immune response in plants depends on the regulation of signaling pathways triggered by pathogens and herbivores. RIN4, a protein of the RIN4-like/NOI family, is considered to be a central immune signal in the interactions of plants and pathogens. In Arabidopsis thaliana, four of the 15 members of the RIN4-like/NOI family (NOI3, NOI5, NOI10, and NOI11) were induced in response to the plant herbivore Tetranychus urticae. While overexpressing NOI10 and NOI11 plants did not affect mite performance, opposite callose accumulation patterns were observed when compared to RIN4 overexpressing plants. In vitro and in vivo analyses demonstrated the interaction of NOI10 and NOI11 with the RIN4 interactors RPM1, RPS2, and RIPK, suggesting a role in the context of the RIN4-regulated immune response. Transient expression experiments in Nicotiana benthamiana evidenced that NOI10 and NOI11 differed from RIN4 in their functionality. Furthermore, overexpressing NOI10 and NOI11 plants had significant differences in susceptibility with WT and overexpressing RIN4 plants when challenged with Pseudomonas syringae bacteria expressing the AvrRpt2 or the AvrRpm1 effectors. These results demonstrate the participation of NOI10 and NOI11 in the RIN4-mediated pathway. Whereas RIN4 is considered a guardee protein, NOI10 and NOI11 could act as decoys to modulate the concerted activity of effectors and R-proteins.

AB  - Determining the harvest location of timber is crucial to enforcing international regulations designed to protect natural resources and to tackle illegal logging and associated trade in forest products. Stable isotope ratio analysis (SIRA) can be used to verify claims of timber harvest location by matching levels of naturally occurring stable isotopes within wood tissue to location-specific ratios predicted from reference data ("isoscapes"). However, overly simple models for predicting isoscapes have so far limited the confidence in derived predictions of timber provenance. In addition, most use cases have limited themselves to differentiating between a small number of predetermined location options. Here, we present a new analytic pipeline for SIRA data, designed to predict the harvest location of a wood sample in a continuous, arbitrarily large area. We use Gaussian processes to robustly estimate isoscapes from reference wood samples, and overlay with species distribution data to compute, for every pixel in the study area, the probability of it being the harvest location of the examined timber. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that this approach is applied to determining timber provenance, providing probabilistic results rather than a binary outcome. Additionally, we include an active learning tool to identify locations from which additional reference data would maximize the improvement to model performance, allowing for optimisation of subsequent field efforts. We demonstrate our approach on a set of SIRA data from seven oak species in the United States as a proof of concept. Our method can determine the harvest location up to within 520 km from the true origin of the sample and outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Incorporating species distribution data improves accuracy by up to 36%. The future sampling locations proposed by our tool decrease the variance of resultant isoscapes by up to 86% more than sampling the same number of locations at random. Accurate prediction of harvest location has the potential to transform worldwide efforts to enforce anti-deforestation legislation and protect natural resources.

AB  - ScopeValproic acid (VPA) postnatal exposure in mice results in behavioral impairment, aberrant sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and self-harming behavior, hallmarks of autism. According to previous reports, Coriolus versicolor (CV) has a protective effect on the brain. The goal of the current investigation was to assess how CV affected the neurobehavioral and metabolic changes caused by VPA in mice.Methods and ResultsMice pups were injected with VPA at 14 days of age and orally administered CV at a dose of 200 mg/kg daily from 14 to 40 days of age. Mice pups were placed through behavioral tests during the trial to evaluate motor skill growth, nociceptive response, locomotion, anxiety, and cognition. Following behavioral testing, mice were killed, and the brain was removed and subjected to biochemical analyses (glutathione, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide) and histopathological analysis. Additionally, to further investigate the role of the TLR-4/Myd88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway, we examined the modulation of this pathway and the alteration in gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) production using Western blot analysis.ConclusionAccording to our research, CV daily administration greatly reduced behavioral alteration, reversed the disorganization of the cerebellum and hippocampus, and significantly improved the VPA-induced neuroinflammation via the TLR-4/Myd88/NF-kappa B signaling cascade.

AB  - Background The sect. Chrysantha Chang of plants with yellow flowers of Camellia species as the "Queen of the Tea Family", most of these species are narrowly distributed endemics of China and are currently listed Grde-II in National Key Protected Wild Plant of China. They are commercially important plants with horticultural medicinal and scientific research value. However, the study of the sect. Chrysantha species genetics are still in its infancy, to date, the mitochondrial genome in sect. Chrysantha has been still unexplored. Results In this study, we provide a comprehensive assembly and annotation of the mitochondrial genomes for four species within the sect. Chrysantha. The results showed that the mitochondrial genomes were composed of closed-loop DNA molecules with sizes ranging from 850,836 bp (C. nitidissima) to 1,098,121 bp (C. tianeensis) with GC content of 45.71-45.78% and contained 48-58 genes, including 28-37 protein-coding genes, 17-20 tRNA genes and 2 rRNA genes. We also examined codon usage, sequence repeats, RNA editing and selective pressure in the four species. Then, we performed a comprehensive comparison of their basic structures, GC contents, codon preferences, repetitive sequences, RNA editing sites, Ka/Ks ratios, haplotypes, and RNA editing sites. The results showed that these plants differ little in gene type and number. C. nitidissima has the greatest variety of genes, while C. tianeensis has the greatest loss of genes. The Ka/Ks values of the atp6 gene in all four plants were greater than 1, indicating positive selection. And the codons ending in A and T were highly used. In addition, the RNA editing sites differed greatly in number, type, location, and efficiency. Twelve, six, five, and twelve horizontal gene transfer (HGT) fragments were found in C. tianeensis, Camellia huana, Camellia liberofilamenta, and C. nitidissima, respectively. The phylogenetic tree clusters the four species of sect. Chrysantha plants into one group, and C. huana and C. liberofilamenta have closer affinities. Conclusions In this study, the mitochondrial genomes of four sect. Chrysantha plants were assembled and annotated, and these results contribute to the development of new genetic markers, DNA barcode databases, genetic improvement and breeding, and provide important references for scientific research, population genetics, and kinship identification of sect. Chrysantha plants.

AB  - Background Energy demand for reproduction leads to a wide diversity of foraging and life-history strategy among wild animals, linking to a common objective to maximize reproductive success. Semelparous squid species in particular can use up to 50% of the total energy intake for reproduction. However, the energy acquisition strategy for reproduction is still a controversial issue regarding whether the squid shift in diet ontogenetically. Here we used Argentinean shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) as a case study to investigate the strategy of energy acquisition for reproduction, by analyzing energy density of the squid's reproductive tissues including ovary, nidamental glands and oviduct eggs, and stable isotopes and fatty acids of the squid's ovary. Results The reproductive energy (the sum of the energy accumulated in ovary, nidamental glands and oviduct eggs) increased significantly with maturation. The ovary nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15) showed a significant increase with maturation, but the increase by maturity stage was not equal to the typical enrichment of about 3 parts per thousand per trophic level. Isotopic niche width showed an increasing trend with maturation, and isotopic niche space exhibited greater overlap at advanced maturity stages. The relative amounts of 16:0, 20:5n3 and 20:4n6 in the ovary, tracing for carnivores and top predators, increased after the onset of maturation. The overall fatty acid profiles of the ovary showed significant differences among maturity stages, but obvious overlaps were found for mature squids. Mixed-effects model results revealed that reproductive energy was positively correlated with delta N-15 values. The reproductive energy was also positively related to the relative amounts of 18:0 and 20:4n6, respectively tracing for herbivores and top predators. Conclusions Our results validate that the squid shifts to feed on higher trophic prey for reproduction as energy demand increases once maturation commences. However, the squid does not shift feeding habits at a trophic level but instead broadens prey spectrum, coupled with increasing intake of higher trophic prey items, to meet the energy demand for reproduction. Such energy acquisition strategy may be selected by the squid to maximize reproductive success by balancing energy intake and expenditure from foraging, warranting future studies that aim to clarify such strategy for reproduction among semelparous species.

AB  - Milkweed-herbivore systems are characterized by cardenolide chemical defenses and specialized herbivore adaptations such as physiological target site insensitivity. Cardenolide defenses in milkweeds can vary in terms of the total concentration, differences in the polarity of individual cardenolides, and the substitution of the steroidal structures that can contribute to the molecule's reactivity. The variability in cardenolide defenses could represent the plant's response to natural selection and adaptation of resistant herbivores and is a characteristic of phenotype-matching between defensive and offensive traits resulting from coevolution. Here, we test the phenotypic match of the cardenolide composition of seeds of Asclepias curassavica and those sequestered by nymphs and adults of the specialized seed herbivore Oncopeltus fasciatus, combined with tests of the inhibitory capacity of a subset of seed cardenolides against the Na+/K+-ATPase of O. fasciatus and a non-adapted insect (Drosophila melanogaster). We compare this with the inhibitory capacity against the highly sensitive porcine Na+/K+-ATPase. Among the five most abundant cardenolides present in milkweed seeds, glucopyranosyl frugoside, glucopyranosyl gofruside, and glucopyranosyl calotropin were significantly more abundant in the seeds than in the adults and nymphs; the bugs contained higher concentrations of the deglucosylated compounds. The most abundant compound, glucopyranosyl frugoside, was also the most inhibitory for O. fasciatus, but O. fasciatus was significantly more tolerant to all compounds compared to D. melanogaster and the highly sensitive porcine enzyme. Our results add to the evidence that O. fasciatus sequesters specific individual cardenolides from its Asclepias host plants that are not directly linked to the concentration and inhibitory potency.

AB  - Proanthocyanidins (PAC) are dietary polyphenols with putative anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, whether dietary PAC can regulate type-2 immune function and inflammation at mucosal surfaces remains unclear. Here, we investigated if diets supplemented with purified PAC modulated pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immune responses during infection with the helminth parasite Ascaris suum in pigs. A. suum infection induced a type-2 biased immune response in lung and intestinal tissues, characterized by pulmonary granulocytosis, increased Th2/Th1 T cell ratios in tracheal-bronchial lymph nodes, intestinal eosinophilia, and modulation of genes involved in mucosal barrier function and immunity. Whilst PAC had only minor effects on pulmonary immune responses, RNA-sequencing of intestinal tissues revealed that dietary PAC significantly enhanced transcriptional responses related to immune function and antioxidant responses in the gut of both naive and A. suum-infected animals. A. suum infection and dietary PAC induced distinct changes in gut microbiota composition, primarily in the jejunum and colon, respectively. Notably, PAC consumption substantially increased the abundance of Limosilactobacillus reuteri. In vitro experiments with porcine macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells supported a role for both PAC polymers and PAC-derived microbial metabolites in regulating oxidative stress responses in host tissues. Thus, dietary PAC may have distinct beneficial effects on intestinal health during infection with mucosal pathogens, while having a limited activity to modulate naturally-induced type-2 pulmonary inflammation. Our results shed further light on the mechanisms underlying the health-promoting properties of PAC-rich foods, and may aid in the design of novel dietary supplements to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses in the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - Simple Summary An evolutionary shift in insect diapause strategy has been revealed in a historically univoltine population of Ostrinia furnacalis, a commonly facultative diapause species. Warmer climates are likely to stimulate facultative individuals in the population to shift from univoltinism to bivoltinism due to the compensatory effect of elevated temperature. Climate warming has driven the population to evolve toward dominantly bivoltine or even trivoltine, further leading to more severe damage. To accurately predict phenology and population dynamics in O. furnacalis, it is imperative to account for both the proportions of different diapause individuals with the population and temperature. Herbivorous insects having variable numbers of generations annually depending on climate and day length conditions are increasingly breeding additional generations driven by elevated temperature under the scenario of global warming, which will increase insect abundance and result in more frequent damage events. Theoretically, this relies on two premises, i.e., either an evolutionary shift to facultative diapause for an insect behaving an obligatory diapause or developmental plasticity to alter voltinism productively for an insect with facultative diapause before shortening photoperiods inducing diapause. Inter-population evidence supporting the premise (theory) comes primarily from a model system with voltinism linked to thermal gradients across latitude. We examined the intra-population evidence in the field (47 & DEG;24 & PRIME; N, 123 & DEG;68 & PRIME; E) with Ostrinia furnacalis, one of the most destructive pests, on corn in Asia and Pacific islands. The species was univoltine in high latitudinal areas (& LE;46 & DEG; N). Divergence of the diapause feature (obligatory and facultative) was observed within the field populations from 2016 to 2021. Warmer climates would provoke more facultative diapause individuals to initiate a second generation, which will significantly drive the population to evolve toward facultative diapause (multi-voltinism). Both divergent diapause and temperature must be considered for accurate prediction of phenology and population dynamics in ACB.

AB  - Objective: To investigate abnormalities in topological properties in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis and their correlations with cognitive functions.Methods: Thirty-eight patients with TLE and 19 age-and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this research and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations. Whole-brain functional networks of participants were constructed based on the fMRI data. Topological characteristics of the functional network were compared between patients with left and right TLE and HCs. Correlations between altered topological properties and cognitive measurements were explored.Results: Compared with the HCs, patients with left TLE showed decreased clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and local efficiency (Eloc), and patients with right TLE showed decreased Eloc. We found altered nodal centralities in six regions related to the basal ganglia (BG) network or default mode network (DMN) in patients with left TLE and those in three regions related to reward/emotion network or ventral atten-tion network in patients with right TLE. Patients with right TLE showed higher integration (reduced nodal shortest path length) in four regions related to the DMN and lower segregation (reduced nodal local effi-ciency and nodal clustering coefficient) in the right middle temporal gyrus. When comparing left TLE with right TLE, no significant differences were detected in global parameters, but the nodal centralities in the left parahippocampal gyrus and the left pallidum were decreased in left TLE. The Eloc and several nodal parameters were significantly correlated with memory functions, duration, national hospital sei-zure severity scale (NHS3), or antiseizure medications (ASMs) in patients with TLE.Conclusions: The topological properties of whole-brain functional networks were disrupted in TLE. Networks of left TLE were characterized by lower efficiency; right TLE was preserved in global efficiency but disrupted in fault tolerance. Several nodes with abnormal topological centrality in the basal ganglia network beyond the epileptogenic focus in the left TLE were not found in the right TLE. Right TLE had some nodes with reduced shortest path length in regions of the DMN as compensation. These findings provide new insights into the effect of lateralization on TLE and help us to understand the cognitive impairment of patients with TLE.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BackgroundAP2/ERF transcription factors (AP2/ERFs) are important regulators of plant physiological and biochemical metabolism. Evidence suggests that AP2/ERFs may be involved in the regulation of bud break in woody perennials. Green tea is economically vital in China, and its production value is significantly affected by the time of spring bud break of tea plant. However, the relationship between AP2/ERFs in tea plant and spring bud break remains largely unknown.ResultsA total of 178 AP2/ERF genes (CsAP2/ERFs) were identified in the genome of tea plant. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, these genes could be classified into five subfamilies. The analysis of gene duplication events demonstrated that whole genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication was the primary way of CsAP2/ERFs amplification. According to the result of the Ka/Ks value calculation, purification selection dominated the evolution of CsAP2/ERFs. Furthermore, gene composition and structure analyses of CsAP2/ERFs indicated that different subfamilies contained a variety of gene structures and conserved motifs, potentially resulting in functional differences among five subfamilies. The promoters of CsAP2/ERFs also contained various signal-sensing elements, such as abscisic acid responsive elements, light responsive elements and low temperature responsive elements. The evidence presented here offers a theoretical foundation for the diverse functions of CsAP2/ERFs. Additionally, the expressions of CsAP2/ERFs during spring bud break of tea plant were analyzed by RNA-seq and grouped into clusters A-F according to their expression patterns. The gene expression changes in clusters A and B were more synchronized with the spring bud break of tea plant. Moreover, several potential correlation genes, such as D-type cyclin genes, were screened out through weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Temperature and light treatment experiments individually identified nine candidate CsAP2/ERFs that may be related to the spring bud break of tea plant.ConclusionsThis study provides new evidence for role of the CsAP2/ERFs in the spring bud break of tea plant, establishes a theoretical foundation for analyzing the molecular mechanism of the spring bud break of tea plant, and contributes to the improvement of tea cultivars.

AB  - Simple Summary Camels have a high tolerance to hunger, thirst, cold, and drought, as well as the ability to travel over long distances. They are indispensable animals for agricultural production in desert areas in China. Old World camels have served humans in uses such as cross-continental caravans; transporting people and goods; connecting different cultures; providing milk, meat, and wool; and serving as draught animals. In view of the severe reduction in Bactrian camel germplasm resources, people now realize that it is particularly important to scientifically evaluate and protect the genetic integrity and diversity of native species. At the same time, there is a growing demand for intensive and sustainable meat and milk production. Using modern genomic tools for selection to improve milk and wool production is warranted. In this study, GBS technology was used to analyze the genetic diversity and genetic structure of Tarim and Junggar camels, and identify the genes important in their evolution. On this basis, the effects of resource conservation were evaluated by analyzing the differences between individuals and populations at the genome level. Screening candidate genes that may be responsible for the biological characteristics of Bactrian camels will aid research into genetic resource protection, important economic traits, and the mechanisms underlying biological characteristics, molecular breeding, and disease. In view of the severe reduction in Bactrian camel germplasm resources, scientific evaluation, protection, and utilization is particularly important. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the genetic diversity and genetic structure of this species, and identify the genes that have played important roles in its evolution. In this study, 21,971 SNPs were identified in 118 domestic Bactrian camels from the Tarim (n = 60) and Junggar (n = 58) populations using simplified GBS genome sequencing. The results show that Tarim and Junggar Bactrian camels have high nucleotide diversity. A phylogenetic tree constructed using structural analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and the adjacency method (NJ) showed that Tarim and Junggar Bactrian camels were clustered together. The selection signals revealed that the Tarim and Junggar Bactrian camels shared 108 genes under positive selection, including WNT1, WNT10B, CD14, SEC61A2, DPAGT1, FOXO6, etc. These selected genes were widely involved in the immune system, embryonic development, lipid metabolism, and other processes. From a genomic analysis perspective, the genetic relationship between TLM and ZGE camels is close, with an average Fst of 0.048 and a relatively low average differentiation coefficient between the two populations. In addition, shared selected genes in the long-term depression pathway were significantly enriched in Tarim and Junggar. These findings will offer support and assistance for the exploration of genetic resource preservation, economically significant traits, and the mechanisms underlying biological characteristics, molecular breeding, and disease.

AB  - The protective effect of Thymus atlanticus aqueous extracts against hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia in high-fat diet (HFD) fed guinea pigs was evaluated. Twenty-four male guinea pigs were randomly divided into four groups and orally administered daily for 3 months with a normal basal diet for the normal control group, normal basal diet supplemented with thyme extract (400 mg kg-1) for extract-treated group, HFD group, or HFD supplemented with thyme extract (400 mg kg-1) group. The results showed that HFD intake elevated blood and hepatic lipids and altered the markers and histology of the liver. The administration of T. atlanticus extract decreased liver weight (-26.61%) and plasmatic and hepatic lipids (cholesterol: -54.05%; triglycerides: -43.91%), compared to the HFD group. Additionally, thyme extract improved the altered hepatic markers and reduced hepatocyte ballooning and lipid droplets accumulation. Our findings suggest that the dietary intake of T. atlanticus aqueous extract could prevent the development of hepatic steatosis.

AB  - Since carbon dots (CDs) exhibit excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, and superior photostability, many types of CDs are considered as powerful candidates for photothermal therapy (PTT) applications. However, the development of a desirable CD is still difficult due to insufficient photothermal conversion, thus resulting in the use of high laser power densities at a high dose of CDs for the PTT effect. Herein, bioinspired sulfur-doped CDs (S-CDs) with strong NIR absorbance were prepared from Camellia japonica flowers via a facile hydrothermal method for enhancing the photothermal conversion efficiency. The as-prepared S-CDs exhibited various advantages including cost-effective preparation, good water-solubility, high biocompatibility, intense NIR absorption, and excellent photothermal effect with robust photostability. Most importantly, the optimal low dose of S-CDs (45 mu g mL(-1)) successfully led to efficient PTT performance with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (55.4%) under moderate laser power (808 nm, 1.1 W cm(-2)) for safe and effective cancer therapy.

AB  - The introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has spurred additional advancements in analyzing the cellular composition of tissues. The longissimus dorsi (LD) in pigs serves as the primary skeletal muscle for studying meat quality in the pig industry. However, the single-cell profile of porcine LD is still in its infancy stage. In this study, we profiled the transcriptomes of 16,018 cells in the LD of a newborn Suhuai pig at single-cell resolution. Subsequently, we constructed a cellular atlas of the LD, identifying 11 distinct cell populations, including endothelial cells (24.39%), myotubes (18.82%), fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs, 18.11%), satellite cells (16.74%), myoblasts (3.99%), myocytes (5.74%), Schwann cells (3.81%), smooth muscle cells (3.22%), dendritic cells (2.99%), pericytes (1.86%), and neutrophils (0.33%). CellChat was employed to deduce the cell-cell interactions by evaluating the gene expression of receptor-ligand pairs across different cell types. The results show that FAPs and pericytes are the primary signal contributors in LD. In addition, we delineated the developmental trajectory of myogenic cells and examined alterations in the expression of various marker genes and molecular events throughout various stages of differentiation. Moreover, we found that FAPs can be divided into three subclusters (NR2F2-FAPs, LPL-FAPs, and TNMD-FAPs) according to their biological functions, suggesting that the FAPs could be associated with the differentiation of tendon cell. Taken together, we constructed the cellular atlas and cell communication network in LD of a newborn Suhuai pig, and analyzed the developmental trajectory of myogenic cells and the heterogeneity of FAPs subpopulation cells. This enhances our comprehension of the molecular features involved in skeletal muscle development and the meat quality control in pigs.

AB  - This study represents the first examination of the feeding ecology of Sarmarutilus rubilio and Scar-dinius erythrophthalmus in the Sidi Salem reservoir, outside their native range, as well as the first investigation of the trophic overlap between these two species. A total of 951 stomach contents were analysed, with prey items identified and counted. The Prominence Values (PV) for each prey type and the diet overlap (alpha) between the species were estimated.Both species shared similar food resources, with macrophytes constituting the primary component of their diets, particularly for S.erythrophthalmus (%PV=76.6). Arthropods were the second most important prey category for both species. Additionally, other prey categories, such as cyanobacteria, microalgae, and nematodes, were consumed in low proportions (%PV<1.5). Diet variations were observed among stations for S.rubilio and among seasons for S.erythrophthalmus. The diets of the two species showed significant over-lap (alpha>0.6). Both species were found to have narrow niche breadths, indicating specialized feeding habits. Sarmarutilus rubilio shows feeding plasticity, while S.erythrophthalmus is predominantly herbivorous. This information is valuable for developing future fishery management plans and strategies for fish biodiversity pres-ervation in Tunisian freshwater systems, especially since S.rubilio is categorized as a near-threatened species.

AB  - Behavioral analysis of animals in the wild plays an important role for ecological research and conservation and has been mostly performed by researchers. We introduce an action detection approach that automates this process by detecting animals and performing action recognition on the detected animals in camera trap videos. Our action detection approach is based on SWIFT (segmentation with filtering of tracklets), which we have already shown to successfully detect and track animals in wildlife videos, and MAROON (mask-guided action recognition), an action recognition network that we are introducing here. The basic ideas of MAROON are the exploitation of the instance masks detected by SWIFT and a triple-stream network. The instance masks enable more accurate action recognition, especially if multiple animals appear in a video at the same time. The triple-stream approach extracts features for the motion and appearance of the animal. We evaluate the quality of our action recognition on two self-generated datasets, from an animal enclosure and from the wild. These datasets contain videos of red deer, fallow deer and roe deer, recorded both during the day and night. MAROON improves the action recognition accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art approaches by an average of 10 percentage points on all analyzed datasets and achieves an accuracy of 69.16% on the Rolandseck Daylight dataset, in which 11 different action classes occur. Our action detection system makes it possible todrasticallyreduce the manual work of ecologists and at the same time gain new insights through standardized results.

AB  - Agmatine, a polyamine derived from L-arginine, has been suggested to modulate memory. However, the available evidence regarding the effect of agmatine on the memory of intact animals is contradictory. This study aimed to assess the dose-response effect of subchronic agmatine on passive avoidance memory and anxiety-like parameters of elevated plus maze in adult intact mice. Furthermore, considering the roles of Akt/GSK-3 beta signaling pathway in memory and Alzheimer's disease, the hippocampal contents of phosphorylated and total forms of Akt and GSK-3 beta proteins were determined using the western blot technique. Agmatine was administered intraperitoneally at the doses of 10. 20, 30, 40 and 80 mg/kg/daily to adult male NMRI mice for 10 days after which the behavioral assessments were performed. Upon completion of the passive avoidance test, the hippocampi were removed for western blot analysis to detect the phosphorylated and total levels of Akt and GSK-3 beta proteins. Results showed the biphasic effect of agmatine on passive avoidance memory; in lower doses (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg), agmatine impaired memory whereas in higher ones (40 and 80 mg/kg) improved it. Though, agmatine in none of the doses affected animals' anxiety-like parameters in an elevated plus maze. Moreover, the memory-improving doses of agmatine augmented Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway. This study showed the biphasic effect of agmatine on passive avoidance memory and an augmentation of hippocampal Akt/GSK-3 beta signaling pathway following the memory-improving doses of this polyamine.

AB  - The Indian antelope or blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) is endemic to the Indian subcontinent, inhabiting scrublands and dry grasslands. Most of the blackbuck populations are small, isolated, and threatened by habitat fragmentation and degradation. Management of such disjunct populations requires genetic characterization, which is critical for assessing hazards of stochastic events and inbreeding. Addressing the scarcity of such information on the blackbuck, we describe a novel panel of microsatellite markers that could be used to monitor blackbuck demography and population genetic parameters using non-invasive faecal sampling. We screened microsatellites (n = 40) that had been reported to amplify in bovid and cervid species using faecal samples of the blackbuck collected from Kaimoor Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttar Pradesh, India and its vicinities. We selected 12 markers for amplification using faecal DNA extracts (n = 140) in three multiplex reactions. We observed a mean amplification success rate of 72.4% across loci (92.1-25.7%) with high allele diversity (mean number of alleles/locus = 8.67 +/- 1.03). Mean genotyping error rates across the markers were low to moderate (allelic drop-out rate = 0.09; false allele rate = 0.11). The proportions of first- and second-order relatives in the study population were 0.69% and 6.21%, respectively. Based on amplification success, genotyping error rates and the probability of identity (P-ID), we suggest (i) a panel of five microsatellite markers (cumulative P-ID = 1.24 x 10(-5)) for individual identification and population monitoring and (ii) seven additional markers for conservation genetics studies. This study provides essential tools capable of augmenting blackbuck conservation strategies at the landscape level, integral to protecting the scrubland-grassland ecosystem.

AB  - A single infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPSs) into the uterus induces inflammation in the mammary gland. This indicates that LPS can translocate from the uterus to the mammary gland. Natural endo-metritis is characterized by continuous intrauterine inflammation. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of repeated intrauterine infusion of two different types of LPSs obtained from Escherichia coli O111:B4 (LPS-O111) and O55:B5 (LPS-O55) on the inflammatory status of the mammary glands of goats. Goats were assigned to three groups: LPS-O111, LPS-O55, and saline (control). Saline with (LPS-O111 and 55 groups) and without (control) 100 mg LPS was infused into the uterus continuously for 7 days. Decreased milk yield was detected in both LPS-O111 and LPS-O55 groups 2 days after the first LPS infusion. While somatic cell count (SCC) was significantly increased in all groups 1 day after the first LPS infusion, both LPS infusions further increased SCC 2 days after the first infusion and showed a signifi-cantly higher SCC than that in the control group. Plasma LPS-binding protein (LBP) was significantly higher in both LPS groups than in the control group during the days after infusion. In addition, pro -inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1b (IL-1b), tumor necrosis factor -a (TNF-a), and IL-8, were signifi-cantly increased in both LPS infusion groups compared with those in the control group. The LPS-O111 infusion resulted in higher SCC, LBP, TNF-a, and IL-8 concentrations than those in the LPS-O55 group. These results suggest that repeated LPS infusion into the uterus can induce more severe mammary gland inflammation than a single infusion. Interestingly, the mammary tissues recovered from inflammation even though the LPS intrauterine infusion was continued.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), and Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), are two of the most destructive pests of cruciferous vegetables, and they are known to occur on the same plant simultaneously. Previous studies have shown that compared to healthy cabbage plants, cabbage plants damaged by P. rapae larvae are more attractive to P. xylostella for oviposition. However, to date, the reason for this is still unclear. We hypothesized that the silk vomited by P. rapae larvae are helpful to the oviposition of P. xylostella adults. In the present study, we found that P. xylostella laid more eggs on waxy plants pre-infested by P. rapae larvae, namely cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra), than on healthy plants, and they laid most of the eggs on the silk produced by P. rapae larvae. However, in the waxless edible rape (Brassica campestris), P. xylostella did not show a significant preference for oviposition between healthy leaves and those pre-infested with P. rapae larvae. Furthermore, in Chinese kale or cabbage plants pre-infested by P. rapae larvae, the number of P. xylostella eggs on the leaves without silk was significantly lower than that on the leaves with silk, and more P. xylostella eggs were laid on the larval silk than on the blank area of their leaves. The present study highlighted the important role of the silk of lepidopterous larvae in P. xylostella oviposition on waxy host plants. Our findings provided new insights into plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Background The South America pinworm, Tuta absoluta, is a destructive pest of tomato that causes important losses worldwide. Breeding of resistant/tolerant tomato cultivars could be an effective strategy for T. absoluta management but, despite the economic importance of tomato, very limited information is available about its response to this treat. To elucidate the defense mechanisms to herbivore feeding a comparative analysis was performed between a tolerant and susceptible cultivated tomato at both morphological and transcriptome level to highlight constitutive leaf barriers, molecular and biochemical mechanisms to counter the effect of T. absoluta attack. Results The tolerant genotype showed an enhanced constitutive barrier possibly as result of the higher density of trichomes and increased inducible reactions upon mild infestation thanks to the activation/repression of key transcription factors regulating genes involved in cuticle formation and cell wall strength as well as of antinutritive enzymes, and genes involved in the production of chemical toxins and bioactive secondary metabolites. Conclusions Overall, our findings suggest that tomato resilience to the South America pinworm is achieved by a combined strategy between constitutive and induced defense system. A well-orchestrated modulation of plant transcription regulation could ensure a trade-off between defense needs and fitness costs. Our finding can be further exploited for developing T. absoluta tolerant cultivars, acting as important component of integrated pest management strategy for more sustainable production.

AB  - Anthelmintics are used to control infestations of ruminants by gastrointestinal nematodes. The limited metabolism of anthelmintics in animals result in their excretion in feces. These could be piled up in the floor of livestock farms, constituting a point source of environmental contamination, or used as manures in agricultural soils where they persist or move to water bodies. Hence the removal of anthelmintics from feces could mitigate environmental contamination. We hypothesized that a thiabendazole-degrading bacterial consortium would also degrade other benzimidazole anthelmintics like albendazole, fenbendazole, ricobendazole, mebendazole and flubendazole. In liquid culture tests the consortium was more effective in degrading compounds with smaller benzimidazole substituents (thiabendazole, albendazole, ricobendazole), rather than benzimidazoles with bulky substituents (fenbendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole). We then explored the bioaugmentation capacity of the consortium in sheep feces fortified with 5 and 50 mg kg-1 of thiabendazole, albendazole and fenbendazole. Bioaugmentation enhanced the degradation of all compounds and its efficiency was accelerated upon fumigation of feces, in the absence of the indigenous fecal microbial community. The latter contributes to anthelmintics degradation as suggested by the significantly lower DT50 values in fumigated vs non-fumigated, non-bioaugmented feces. Overall, bioaugmentation could be an efficient means to reduce environmental exposure to recalcitrant anthelmintic benzimidazoles.

AB  - Ammonia has been reported to have a variety of toxicity to aquatic animals, farm animals and humans. However, its potential toxicity on the intestines remains unknown. L-selenomethionine is one of the important organic selenium sources. However, the mitigating effect of L-selenomethionine on ammonia exposure toxicity is still lacking. Therefore, in this study, the mechanism of toxic action of ammonia on intestinal tract and the detoxification effect of L-selenomethionine were examined. We evaluated the intestinal toxicity of ammonia and the alleviating effect of L-selenomethionine in an in vivo model, and then verified it in vitro model by a variety of cutting-edge experimental techniques. Our results showed that ammonia exposure causes oxidative stress, necroptosis, Th1/Th2 imbalance and inflammation in the intestinal tissue and the intestinal cells, and L-selenomethionine had a significant mitigation effect on the changes of these indexes induced by ammonia. In conclusion, ammonia exposure caused oxidative stress and Th1/Th2 imbalance in the porcine small intestine and IPEC-J2 cells, and that excessive ROS accumulation-mediated necroptosis targeted inflammatory responses, resulting in the destruction of tight connections of intestinal cells, thereby causing intestinal barrier dysfunction. L-selenomethionine could effectively reduce the intestinal injury caused by ammonia exposure and antagonize the toxic effect of ammonia.

AB  - Many living organisms of the animal kingdom have the fundamental ability to form and retrieve memories. Most information is initially stored as short-term memory, which is then converted to a more stable long-term memory through a process called memory consolidation. At the neuronal level, synaptic plasticity is crucial for memory storage. It includes the formation of new spines, as well as the modification of existing spines, thereby tuning and shaping synaptic efficacy. Cofilin critically contributes to memory processes as upon activation, it regulates the shape of dendritic spines by targeting actin filaments. We previously found that prolonged activation of cofilin in hippocampal neurons attenuated the formation of long-term object-location memories. Because the modification of spine shape and structure is also essential for short-term memory formation, we determined whether overactivation of hippocampal cofilin also influences the formation of short-term memories. To this end, mice were either injected with an adeno-associated virus expressing catalytically active cofilin, or an eGFP control, in the hippocampus. We show for the first time that cofilin overactivation improves short-term memory formation in the object-location memory task, without affecting anxiety-like behavior. Surprisingly, we found no effect of cofilin overactivation on AMPA receptor expression levels. Altogether, while cofilin overactivation might negatively impact the formation of long-lasting memories, it may benefit short-term plasticity.

AB  - Serine protease inhibitor E2 (SerpinE2), a serine protease inhibitor predominantly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs), plays a critical role in follicular development and ovulation in mammals. However, its exact role and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used buffalo GCs as a research model to investigate both the effects of SerpinE2 on GCs function and the mechanisms governing its expression. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that SerpinE2 expression was significantly higher in healthy follicles (HFs) compared to atretic follicles (AFs). Through comprehensive functional assays (CCK-8, EDU, flow cytometry and ELISA), we demonstrated that SerpinE2 promotes GCs proliferation, enhances steroidogenesis (progesterone and estradiol), and suppresses apoptosis. Mechanistically, dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed FOXL2 as a direct transcriptional activator of SerpinE2, with FOXL2 overexpression significantly enhancing both SerpinE2 expression and its steroidogenic effects. Additionally, Western blot analysis demonstrated that H3K9 methylation levels were significantly increased in AFs and FOXL2 knockdown GCs. CUT&RUN-qPCR further demonstrated that H3K9me3 was highly enriched in the promoter regions of SerpinE2 in AFs and FOXL2 knockdown GCs, leading to reduced SerpinE2 expression. These findings suggest that SerpinE2 promotes steroid hormone synthesis in GCs in a FOXL2-dependent manner; H3K9me3 is directly involved in FOXL2-mediated regulation of SerpinE2 transcription in GCs. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which SerpinE2 regulates mammalian follicular development.

AB  - Pennycress grain has a relatively high oil content (25-36%) and it is considered a desirable feedstock to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Pennycress crop can be integrated into the corn-soybean rotation as a winter cover crop in the midwestern U.S. to provide both ecosystem services and economic benefits for the farmers, while serving as a promising feedstock for SAF production. For pennycress-based SAF biorefineries to be established at the commercial scale, a sustainable design of the supply system is required to provide reliable information on feedstock availability and optimal facility locations. The objectives of this research were to assess the pennycress production potential in Ohio, and to identify the best locations to establish the SAF biorefineries. To estimate the pennycress production potential in Ohio, a geographic information system (GIS)-based model was developed using the spatially explicit six-year historical data on areas that were planted in the corn-soybean rotation for the period of 2013 through 2018, pennycress yield estimates from field-based experiments reported in the literature, and the soil productivity index for the region of study. Optimal SAF biorefinery locations were identified using a GIS-based location-allocation model. Annual land potentially available for pennycress production in Ohio was estimated to be similar to 0.6 million ha, which could produce similar to 1.1 million metric tons of pennycress grain as feedstock to produce similar to 210 million liters of SAF, depending on the pennycress yield level, oil content, and conversion efficiencies. In addition, the optimum locations for 12 biorefineries, each at an annual capacity of 18.9 million liters of SAF, were identified, and the average transportation distance was estimated to be 35 and 58 km for maximizing attendance and coverage conditions, respectively. The outcomes of this research would help minimize the risks associated with feedstock supply and cost variabilities for pennycress-based SAF production in the region.

AB  - Maternal separation as an early life stress can lead to long-lasting deleterious effects on cognitive and behavioral functions, and the mood state. On the other hand, Psilocybe cubensis (as one of the most well-known magic mushrooms) may be beneficial in the improvement or the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of P. cubensis extract (PCE) on depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors, and locomotor activity in mice exposed to early maternal separation. Also, we assessed the expression and methylation level of Slc6a4 and Nr3c1 in the hippocampus. Maternal separation was done in postnatal days (PNDs) 2-18. PCE was intraperitoneally injected at the dose of 20 mg/kg at PND 60, and our tests were done at days 1, 3, and 10, of administration. The results showed that maternal separation significantly induced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test and anxiety-like behavior in the open field test (OFT). Also, maternal separation decreased locomotor activity in the OFT. In addition, maternal separation decreased the expression and increased the methylation level of both Slc6a4 and Nr3c1 in the hippocampus. However, PCE significantly reversed all these effects. In conclusion, it seems that P. cubensis affects serotonergic signaling via altering Slc6a4 expression and methylation level in the hippocampus of mice. The effect of P. cubensis on Nr3c1 expression and methylation level may also lead to alter the function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and the stress response in mice exposed to maternal separation.

AB  - Antibacterial activity is a common and highly studied property of plant secondary metabolites. Despite the extensive literature focusing on identifying novel antibacterial metabolites, little work has been undertaken to examine variation in levels of antibacterial activity in any plant species. Here, we used large-scale sampling of leaves of the antibacterial plant, wild garlic (Allium ursinum L.), assembling a set of tissue extracts from 168 plants, with 504 leaves collected and analysed. We assayed extracts for antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and used LC-MS to carry out a chemometric analysis examining variation in individual metabolites, comparing them with several ecological parameters. We found that allicin was the only metabolite which was positively related to antibacterial activity. Soil temperature was a key determinant of variability in the concentrations of many foliar metabolites, however, neither allicin concentrations nor antibacterial activity was related to any of our measured ecological parameters, other than roadside proximity. We suggest that the synthesis of allicin precursors may be largely independent of growing conditions. This may be to ensure that allicin is synthesised rapidly and in sufficiently high concentrations to effectively prevent herbivory and pest damage. This finding contrasts with flavonoids which were found to vary greatly between plants and across sites. Our findings suggest that key biologically active metabolites are constrained in their concentration range compared to other compounds in the metabolome. This has important implications for the development of wild garlic as a health supplement or animal feed additive.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is highly toxic to the environment and human health. It is important to detect DON with ultrahigh sensitivity, ease of operation, and low cost. Inspired by the excellent stability and biocompatibility of polydopamine, a universal, portable and ultra-sensitive pipet immunoassay platform was reported for DON detection based on dopamine self-polymerization (polydopamine coating and polydopamine nanoparticles). The polydopamine coating acted as an effective strategy for biomolecule immobilization on the pipet to improve the coating efficiency that significantly reduced the required concentration of biomolecules. Performing the ELISA in pipets saved nearly 67% of the antigen amount and 83% of the antibody amount, which reduced the detection cost and simplified the experimental steps. The dual signal amplification in this pipet immunoassay enabled ultra-high sensitivity. Polydopamine nanoparticles acted as the enrichment carrier of horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG for the firstround signal amplification, followed by the tyramine-mediated loading of streptavidin-HRP for the second-round signal amplification. The dual-enriched HRP catalyzed the color-developing substrate to achieve highly sensitive colorimetric DON detection with a limit of detection of 0.435 ng/mL.

AB  - There is a growing interest and trend in new product development (NPD) from food waste. However, most qualitative approaches rarely use the lean entrepreneur concept in the context of new product development (NPD), which allows for understanding customer insight rather than the traditional qualitative approach. Therefore, this study aims to (1) explore the swine farmer behaviors, desired outcomes, and pain points in using swine feedstuffs, (2) select three representative segments and identify high-value customers of swine feeds, and (3) develop a sustainable swine feed prototype from the fermented fish industrial residues. The target users, 24 pig farmers from 11 provinces across the Northeastern Region of Thailand, were recruited to participate in this research. Qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis were conducted to analyze their behaviors, desired outcomes, and pain points towards pig feed usages. The framework was combined with in-depth qualitative interviews and the customer, problem, and solution zoom tools. The results revealed that household farmers were the target customer segment of swine feed made from fermented fish industrial wastes. In addition, the findings showed that the household farmers typically fed their pigs with instant feeds and alternative feeds. Moreover, their desired outcomes were the pellet feed with nutrients. Furthermore, the pain points of the household farmers were the expensive cost of feeds and mold in feeds. Therefore, this segment needs to minimize the cost of feeds by using other sustainable alternatives.

AB  - Euphorbiaceae is among the main angiosperm families with a high number of laticiferous species. Although many of its species remain to be studied in terms of their anatomy, chemistry, and uses, there are some of recognized economic importance due to useful secondary compounds present in the latex. Acalyphoideae, one of the three major subfamilies, has traditionally been distinguished from the rest of Euphorbiaceae by the absence of latex and laticifers. To test this long-standing assumption, we anatomically analysed 40 species in 10 genera, representing six of the nine subclades of Acalyphoideae s.s., to examine the presence of laticifers using leaf blade and petiole sections. Laticifers were observed in all the studied species and consisted of multinucleate, elongated cells with dense cytoplasm. They were articulated and branched in Acalypha, Bia, and Dalechampia; this was further confirmed by ontogenetic analyses in Acalypha accedens, A. brasiliensis, and A. poiretii. Histochemical tests revealed lipids, proteins, mucilage, and starch in laticifers. Our results demonstrate that laticifers are present and common in Acalyphoideae and thus more widespread in Euphorbiaceae than previously known. The scarcity of detailed anatomical studies, and the often imperceptible latex exudation of most Acalyphoideae, are probably the main reasons that have misled field botanists and systematists in the past.
   Our study shows that latex-secreting cells (laticifers) are widespread in the ecologically and economically important spurge family (Euphorbiaceae). Latex is a complex substance that plays key roles in plant ecology (e.g. defence against herbivores) and in benefits to human society (e.g. natural rubber, pharmaceuticals). Previous botanical knowledge pointed to the absence of laticifers as the main diagnostic feature of the subfamily Acalyphoideae, one of the three major groups of the spurge family. We analysed a representative sample of Acalyphoideae using methods of plant anatomy and found that laticifers were always present. As a result, the systematic characterization of Euphorbiaceae should be updated to consider laticifers as ubiquitous throughout the entire family.

AB  - Simple Summary In cow-calf operations, replacement heifers are bred to calve at 2 years of age or older. However, as beef production has become more intensive during the last 20 years, an increasing number of farmers have lowered the age at first service. Numerous studies have focused on determining the optimum reproductive development of beef heifers to ensure a maximum pregnancy rate. Maternal age during gestation has been suggested to be an important influence on the nutritional environment for the embryo and fetal growth. No studies have been conducted to determine the possible effects of heifer age at first gestation on fetal and postnatal growth and development. This study aimed to determine the effects of age at first gestation on offspring growth performance, glucose metabolism and insulin-like growth factor 1 concentration from birth to weaning of calves from adult cows and heifers at 15 or 27 months of service. First-breed heifers produce lighter progeny at birth than mature cows, and calves from younger heifers were lighter at weaning than calves from older heifers. Milk production was similar between heifers and lower than that from adult cows. Age at first gestation may affect offspring postnatal growth performance, glucose metabolism and IGF1 concentration. This study aimed to determine the effects of age at first gestation on offspring growth performance, glucose metabolism, and IGF1 concentration. Heifers impregnated by AI from a single bull at 15 months of age (15 M, n = 20), or 27 months of age (27 M, n = 20), and multiparous cows (adult, n = 20) were used. Dams from all groups were managed in a single group during gestation and lactation. Gestational length was longer in the 15 M and 27 M than in adult dams (p = 0.009). Bodyweight at birth, at weaning and ADG during lactation were higher in calves from adult dams than in those from 27 M dams, and higher in calves from the latter than in 15 M calves (p < 0.001). Calves from 15 M dams had an increased head circumference/BW ratio compared to calves from 27 M dams, while calves from this latter group had an increased ratio compared to calves from adults (p = 0.005). Body mass index was greater in calves from adults than in those from 15 M and 27 M dams (p = 0.002). Milk production from 15 M and 27 M dams was similar but lower than that from adults (p = 0.03). Calves born from adult dams had greater blood glucose concentrations than those from 15 M and 27 M dams (p < 0.05). Serum IGF1 concentrations were higher in calves from adults than in calves from 15 M and 27 M dams (p = 0.01). This study showed that age at first gestation affects offspring postnatal growth performance, glucose metabolism and IGF1 concentration.

AB  - Simple Summary
   This study evaluated the effects of exposure of the porcine fetus to in utero heat stress (IUHS) during the first half of gestation on carcass and meat quality attributes when market weight was reached. Pigs exposed to IUHS had lower head and heart weights at slaughter compared to the thermoneutral group. Most measures of carcass quality were not impacted by the treatments, but lower loin muscle area was observed for IUHS carcasses. Additionally, the loins from the heat stressed pigs were found to be tougher, regardless of the duration of aging. Accordingly, minimizing heat stress experienced by gestating pigs would be considered an important factor in improving both yield and quality of pork production systems.
   This study evaluated the impacts of in utero heat stress (IUHS) on the carcass and meat quality traits of offspring when market weight was reached. Twenty-four F1 Landrace x Large White gilts were blocked by body weight and allocated among thermoneutral (IUTN) or IUHS treatments from d 6 to d 59 of gestation. The offspring were raised under identical thermoneutral conditions, and gilts (n = 10/treatment) at market weight (117.3 +/- 1.7 kg) were harvested. At 24 h postmortem, the loins (M. longissimus lumborum) were obtained, and sections were allocated among 1 d and 7 d aging treatments at 2 degrees C. Carcasses from IUHS pigs had lower head and heart weights (p < 0.05), as well as decreased loin muscle area (p < 0.05) compared to IUTN pigs. Loins from the IUHS group had a higher shear force value than the IUTN group (p < 0.05). Treatments had no other impacts on carcass and meat quality traits (p > 0.05), and Western blots suggested increased toughness of IUHS loins would not be attributed to proteolysis. These results suggest minimizing IUHS during the first half of gestation may be beneficial in improving pork yield and quality, though in general the effects of IUHS would be minimal.

AB  - The Early Villafranchian (MN 16a, Late Pliocene) fossil site of Podari (Dolj County, Oltenia District, Southwestern Romania) is mainly known for its microvertebrate fossils. Nonetheless, the recent finding of a complete femur of a large cervid identified as Eucladoceros sp. confirms the presence of macrovertebrates at the site. In fact, Podari constitutes the oldest fossil site in Romania with the presence of this genus and one of the oldest localities in the whole European record. The studied femur has been taxonomically identified based on several anatomical characteristics that distinguish Eucladoceros from other Villafranchian large-sized deer, such as Praemegaceros, a deeper trochanteric fossa, a caudally prominent, robust, and broad lesser trochanter, and the absence of a small fossa on the medial condyle of the distal epiphysis. The different development of some of these structures in Eucladoceros and the extant species Cervus elaphus and Axis axis would imply the presence of larger attachment areas for several muscles of the thigh (mm. gemelli, m. obturatorius externus, m. iliacus, and m. psoas major) than those of Praemegaceros, and thus pointing towards differences in their line of action. Therefore, this strongly suggests that Eucladoceros had larger and relatively more powerful flexor, rotator, and abductor muscles of the thigh than Praemegaceros, as well as hind limb adaptations to open environments.

AB  - Cognitive function in aging is heterogeneous: while some older individuals develop significant impairments and dementia, others remain resilient and retain cognitive function throughout their lifespan. The molecular mechanisms that underlie these divergent cognitive trajectories, however, remain largely unresolved. Here, we utilized a high-resolution home-cage-based cognitive testing paradigm to delineate mechanisms that contribute to age-related cognitive heterogeneity. We cognitively stratified aged C57Bl/6N male mice by cognitive performance into intact (resilient) or impaired subgroups based on young performance benchmarks. Cognitively impaired males exhibited marked reactive gliosis in the hippocampus, characterized by microglial activation, increased astrocyte arborization, and elevated transcriptional expression of reactivity markers. These changes were accompanied by increased markers of cellular senescence and the associated senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in impaired animals, including p16INK4a, SASP factors (e.g., Il-6, Il-1b, Mmp3), and SA-beta-gal staining in the hippocampus. Notably, clearance of senescent cells using senolytic agents dasatinib and quercetin ameliorated the heterogeneity in cognitive performance observed with age and attenuated impairment-associated gliosis, senescence markers, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Aged female mice could not be stratified into subgroups yet showed increased neuroinflammation with age that was not resolved with senolytics. Collectively, our findings implicate cellular senescence as a central driver of sex-specific neuroinflammation that drives divergent cognitive trajectories in aging. Thus, we demonstrate that senolytic treatment is an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate cognitive impairment by reducing neuroinflammation and associated metabolic disturbances.

AB  - Here we review the effects of immune activation primarily via lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, on hippocampal and non-hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Rodent studies have found that LPS alters both the acquisition and consolidation of aversive learning and memory, such as those evoking evolutionarily adaptive responses like fear and disgust. The inhibitory effects of LPS on the acquisition and consolidation of contextual fear memory are discussed. LPS-induced alterations in the acquisition of taste and place-related conditioned disgust memory within bottle preference tasks and taste reactivity tests (taste-related), in addition to conditioned context avoidance tasks and the anticipatory nausea paradigm (place-related), are highlighted. Further, conditioned disgust memory consolidation may also be influenced by LPS-induced effects. Growing evidence suggests a central role of immune activation, especially pro-inflammatory cytokine activity, in eliciting the effects described here. Understanding how infection-induced immune activa-tion alters learning and memory is increasingly important as bacterial and viral infections are found to present a risk of learning and memory impairment.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have found that heavy alcohol use is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with frequent drinking earlier in adulthood increasing risk. The increases in neuroinflammation featured in both heavy alcohol use and AD may be partially responsible for this link. However, it is unknown if abstinence mitigates this risk. We hypothesized that binge ethanol during mid adult life would persistently increase AD pathology even after prolonged abstinence. Male and female 3xTg-AD mice (APPSwe, tauP301, Psen1(tm1Mpm)) which feature progressive amyloid (A beta) and tau pathology, received chronic binge ethanol (5g/kg/day, 5-days-on/2-days-off, i.g.) or water during adulthood (from 5.5 to 9 months of age), followed by abstinence and assessment at 14 months of age. The effects of ethanol on protective AD genes (e.g., APOE and TREM2) as well as proinflammatory genes were measured by PCR. Levels of pathologic tau and A beta were measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Ethanol caused persistent reductions in protective AD genes: APOE (25% reduction, *p < 0.05), TREM2 (28%, *p < 0.05), LPL (40%, *p < 0.01), and CTSD (24%, *p < 0.05) and promoted a proinflammatory gene signature in female, but not male cortex. Concurrently, ethanol increased total and hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8) in piriform cortex and hippocampus of females, but not males. Levels of AT8 were negatively correlated with APOE (R = -0.67, *p < 0.05) and TREM2 (R = -0.78, *p < 0.005) suggesting protective roles in pathogenesis. No differences were found in levels of main regulators of tau phosphorylation state (GSK3 beta, PKA, PP2A), suggesting ethanol disrupted clearance of tau. Therefore, we measured the effect of ethanol on lysosomes, which degrade tau, and lysosomal localization of tau using co-immunofluorescence. In females, ethanol caused a persistent reduction in mature LAMP1 lysosomes in CA1 of hippocampus (35%, *p < 0.05), along with a 60% increase in total tau (*p < 0.05). Thus, chronic binge ethanol during mid adult life causes a persistent enhancement of tau pathology in cortical and hippocampal brain regions of females. Persistent AD pathology was associated with an increased proinflammatory signature and a reduction of mature lysosomes. This implicates binge ethanol exposure with increased risk of AD pathologic progression in females.

AB  - Decellularized scaffolds are promising biomaterials for tissue and organ reconstruction; however, strategies to effectively suppress the host immune responses toward these implants, particularly those without chemical crosslinking, remain warranted. Administration of mesenchymal stem cells is effective against immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of isogeneic abdominal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (ADMSCs) on xenogeneic biomaterial-induced immunoreactions. Peripheral bronchi from pigs, decellularized using a detergent enzymatic method, were engrafted onto tracheal defects of Brown Norway (BN) rats. BN rats were implanted with native pig bronchi (Xenograft group), decellularized pig bronchi (Decellularized Xenograft), or Decellularized Xenograft and ADMSCs (Decellularized Xenograft+ADMSC group). In the latter group, ADMSCs were injected intravenously immediately post implantation. Harvested graft implants were assessed histologically and immunohistochemically. We found that acute rejections were milder in the Decellularized Xenograft and Decellularized Xenograft+ADMSC groups than in the Xenograft group. Mild inflammatory cell infiltration and reduced collagen deposition were observed in the Decellularized Xenograft+ADMSC group. Additionally, ADMSC administration decreased CD8+ lymphocyte counts but increased CD163+ cell counts. In the Decellularized Xenograft+ADMSC group, serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-10 were elevated and tissue deposition of IgM and IgG was low. The significant immunosuppressive effects of ADMSCs illustrate their potential use as immunosuppressive agents for xenogeneic biomaterial-based implants.

AB  - The mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cytb) of the Japanese field vole (Microtus montebelli), an herbivorous rodent, was subjected to an analysis of sequence variation with the objective of elucidating the population histories of this species. Construction of a phylogenetic tree revealed the existence of several region-specific lineages in Honshu and Kyushu, which were evenly separated from each other. In consideration of the documented time-dependent evolutionary rates of rodents, the estimated divergence times indicate that the region-specific lineages of M. montebelli emerged 160,000-300,000 years ago. In a haplotype network, the region-specific lineages from northern and central Honshu tended to show star-shaped clusters, with additional internal star-shaped clusters, indicative of two periods of population expansion. The onsets of these expansions were estimated to have occurred 15,000 and 10,000 years ago, respectively, suggestive of association with the two periods of rapid warming following the last glacial maximum (LGM). In contrast, such predicted post-LGM expansion events were less pronounced in the southern lineages, implying latitudinal dependence of the effect of the LGM on population dynamics. Sado Island haplotypes exhibited a network with a star-shaped pattern and a 10,000-yearold expansion signal, surrounded by a Honshu haplotype cluster with a 15,000-year-old expansion signal, suggesting that post-LGM expansion events contributed to the formation of the Sado population. A reanalysis of Cytb sequences of the Japanese hare (Lepus brachyurus), which has a similar geographic range to the voles, yielded results that were consistent with those of the vole analysis, confirming that the characteristics of the post-LGM expansion event were dependent on latitude, involved two successive expansion events, and enabled migration across deep straits. It seems reasonable to infer that the environmental changes that occurred during the warm periods following the LGM were a contributing factor in the expansion of the distribution range of newly emerged haplotype groups.

AB  - Simple Summary For the purposes of raising awareness of five historical cheeses of Southern Italy that are less known by consumers, and of restoring dignity to the breeders and producers of these cheeses, we studied their quality in terms of chemical composition, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), PUFA-omega 6, PUFA-omega 3, alpha-tocopherol, retinol, cholesterol, polyphenol content (TPC), total antioxidant capacity (FRAP and TEAC), and health index (GHIC). Two stretched-curd bovine cheeses, Caciocavallo Palermitano (CP) and Casizolu del Montiferru (CdM), two ovine cheeses, Vastedda della Valle del Belce (VVB) and Pecorino Siciliano (PS), and one caprine cheese, Caprino Nicastrese (CN), were evaluated. These cheeses are produced in different months, with raw milk from animals reared in an extensive feeding system. In April, the CP cheese showed high values for CLA, TPC, and GHIC, while the CN cheese exhibited high PUFA, PUFA-omega 6, PUFA-omega 3, TEAC, and GHIC. In May, the CdM cheese exhibited high content of fat, saturated fatty acids, PUFA-omega 3, alpha-tocopherol, TEAC, and GHIC, while the PS cheese showed high values of protein, CLA, PUFA, PUFA-omega 3, alpha-tocopherol, and GHIC. These measured parameters characterize and distinguish each cheese due to links with numerous factors: species, breed, feeding system, pasture biodiversity, climate, production technology, traditional tools, and ripening type. It is highlighted that, in general, the highest nutritional quality, linked to the highest presence of healthy compounds, originates from the pasture of cheese production in the spring. Five natural historic cheeses of Southern Italy were investigated-Caciocavallo Palermitano (CP), Casizolu del Montiferru (CdM), Vastedda della Valle del Belce (VVB), Pecorino Siciliano (PS), and Caprino Nicastrese (CN)-which are produced with raw milk and with traditional techniques and tools, from autochthonous breeds reared under an extensive system. The effects of the month of production on gross composition, MUFA, PUFA, PUFA-omega 6, PUFA-omega 3, alpha-tocopherol, retinol, cholesterol, TPC, TEAC, and GHIC were evaluated. In CP, CLA, TPC, and GHIC were higher in April than in February. CdM showed higher values in terms of fat, saturated fatty acids, PUFA-omega 3, alpha-tocopherol, TEAC, and GHIC in May than in February and September, while low values in terms of protein, moisture, and CLA were found. In VVB, MUFA, PUFA-omega 6, and alpha-tocopherol increased in June compared with April; conversely, protein, FRAP, and TEAC were higher in April. In PS, protein, CLA, PUFA, PUFA-omega 3, alpha-tocopherol, and GHIC increased in May compared with January; on the contrary, moisture, NaCl, and TEAC showed high values in January. CN showed higher values in terms of PUFA, PUFA-omega 6, PUFA-omega 3, TPC, TEAC, and GHIC in April and June compared with January. It is shown that each cheese is unique and closely linked to the production area. Cheeses produced in the spring months showed a high nutritional quality due to the greatest presence of healthy compounds originating from an extensive feeding system.

AB  - Simple Summary Livestock farming faces the necessity of reducing the use of medicines, particularly antimicrobials, without compromising animal welfare as one main challenge. A strategy to improve animal health, specifically in breeding stock, relies on improved nutrition of the mothers during late pregnancy and on management factors during early life. These could affect mother and offspring physiological functions (calostrogenesis, fetal development or maturation of lamb's immune system) and potentially modulate their stress-response capabilities. We studied the effect of pre-partum omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation on ewe colostrum composition and immunological quality and whether changes resulted in any advantage on lambs' passive immunization and on their physiological, behavioral, and inflammatory responses when subjected to a post-weaning stressor to confer stress resilience. Gestational supplementation with nutrients rich in essential fatty acids was effective to enhance colostrum quality related to biologically active molecules, such as conjugated linoleic acid, which plays a role in the regulation of the immune response. Stress resilience was studied by assessing lamb's behavioral response after exposing lambs to a combination of stressors and by measuring plasma cortisol concentrations and immunological responses to specific circulating cytokines. This work highlights the complex relationship between late pregnancy nutrition in the mothers and immune system development in the offspring and explores the potential for programming nutrition interventions to develop more resilient livestock and to tackle the need for a reduction in the use of antibiotics. We studied the effect of pre-natal supplementation with n-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) combined with a tannin-rich forage on colostrum composition and immunological quality and whether these changes had advantageous effects on lambs' survival and stress reaction to a post-weaning stressor. Forty-eight Latxa ewes were fed during the last five weeks of pregnancy with two experimental diets: a control diet based on a neutral concentrate and forage (tall fescue hay; CO-FES), and a supplemented diet based on polyunsaturated (PUFA)-rich concentrate and tanniferous forage (sainfoin; ALA-SAIN). After parturition, twenty ewes had their blood and colostrum sampled, and their lambs were monitored until post-weaning. Lambs were afterwards subjected to (i) an aversive handling period (AHP) followed by a behavioral assessment and (ii) inflammatory and lymphocyte proliferation challenge. Feeding ALA-SAIN resulted in changes in colostrum fatty acid composition, specifically higher alpha-linoleic acid (p < 0.001), conjugate linoleic acid (p = 0.005), vaccenic acid (p = 0.006) and long-chain n-3 PUFA (p = 0.004). Pre-partum nutrition did not affect lamb immunoglobulin (Ig) G apparent efficacy absorption, but circulating IgG tended to be higher (p = 0.054) in ALA-SAIN lambs. ALA-SAIN lambs interacted more frequently with other lambs (p = 0.002), whereas ALA-SAIN females spent more time closer to other lambs (p < 0.001). Plasma cortisol was higher (p = 0.047) and plasma interleukin (IL)-2 lower (p = 0.003) in CO-FES lambs. This research highlights the importance of prenatal nutrition on the immune system stimulation and lambs' behavior as a strategy to improve lambs' health and welfare during early life.

AB  - In this study, the heavymetal exposure riskmodelwas employed to assess the exposure risk to a predominantly herbivore waterfowl, Northern Pintail, wintering in two wetland habitats in the Purulia district ofWest Bengal, located on overlapping Central Asian Flyway (CAF) and East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF). Both wetlands were important staging and roosting grounds formigratorywaterfowl for ages. The exposure modelwas used to quantify the risk of exposure tometals through oral ingestion. Exposure doses of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cr through food plants ingestion and food-associated sediment consumption pathwayswere two potent sources of heavy metal exposure in the waterfowl under study. Exposure through water intake was ignored asmetalswere either of negligible concentrations or below the detection limit inwater samples. Heavy metal concentrations showed significant positive correlations between bottom sediment and plant at both sites. At Purulia Sahebbandh (Site 1), the total exposure dose of all four metals was much higher than their conforming tolerable daily intake (TDI), and thereby, the metals might pose threats to the migratory wintering herbivorous waterfowl populations. However, in Adra Sahebbandh (Site 2), total exposure doses of Pb, Zn and Cuwere much below their corresponding TDI. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) of Cr was highest followed by nonessential toxic Pb and these two elements could be considered as priority pollutants at Site 1. Prioritize threats were decreased in the following sequence: Cr > Pb > Cu > Zn at Site 1 and Cr > Zn > Pb > Cu at Site 2. Hazard Index was found to be >5 at Site 1 and formuch highermetal loads a significant correlation between metal concentrations in plants, bottom sediment and exposure doses were also recorded. Therefore, the peri-urban Purulia Sahebbandh wetland could immediately be considered for risk control and demanded holistic management of important waterfowl habitats.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) as the seed cells of cartilage tissue engineering. ADSCs were isolated from adipose tissue that was harvested under sterile conditions from the inguen fold of porcines and cultured in vitro. Acellular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACECM) scaffolds of pigs were then constructed. Moreover, inflammatory cells, as well as cellular and humoral immune responses, were detected using hematoxylin and eosin staining staining, immunohistochemical staining, and western blot analysis. The results showed that the cartilage complex constructed by ADSCs and ACECM through tissue engineering successfully repaired the cartilage defect of the pig knee joint. The in vivo repair experiment showed no significant difference between chondrocytes, ADSCs, and induced ADSCs, indicating that ADSCs do not require in vitro induction and have the potential for chondrogenic differentiation in the environment around the knee joint. In addition, pig-derived acellular cartilage scaffolds possess no obvious immune inflammatory response when used in xenotransplantation. ADSCs may serve as viable seed cells for cartilage tissue engineering.

AB  - Recent studies have established that the innate immune system of reptiles is broad and robust, but the question remains: What role does the reptilian adaptive immune system play? Conventionally, adaptive immunity is described as involving T and B lymphocytes that display variable receptors, is highly specific, improves over the course of the response, and produces a memory response. While reptiles do have B and T lymphocytes that utilize variable receptors, their adaptive response is relatively non-specific, generates a prolonged antibody response, and does not produce a typical memory response. This alternative adaptive strategy may allow reptiles to produce a broad adaptive response that complements a strong innate system. Further studies into reptile adaptive immunity cannot only clarify outstanding questions on the reptilian immune system but can shed light on a number of important immunological concepts, including the evolution of the immune system and adaptive immune responses that take place outside of germinal centers.

AB  - The effects and underlying mechanisms of adolescent exposure to combined environmental hazards on cognitive function remain unclear. Here, using a combined exposure model, we found significant cognitive decline, hippocampal neuronal damage, and neuronal senescence in mice exposed to cadmium (Cd) and high-fat diet (HFD) during adolescence. Furthermore, we observed a significant downregulation of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) expression in the hippocampi of co-exposed mice. UBCS039, a specific SIRT6 activator, markedly reversed the above adverse effects. Further investigation revealed that co-exposure obviously reduced the levels of La ribonucleoprotein 7 (LARP7), disrupted the interaction between LARP7 and SIRT6, ultimately decreasing SIRT6 expression in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. Overexpression of Larp7 reversed the combined exposure-induced SIRT6 decrease and senescence in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. Additionally, the results showed notably elevated levels of Larp7 m6A and YTH domain family protein 2 (YTHDF2) in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells treated with the combined hazards. Ythdf2 short interfering RNA, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA stability assays further demonstrated that YTHDF2 mediated the degradation of Larp7 mRNA under combined exposure. Collectively, adolescent co-exposure to Cd and HFD causes hippocampal senescence and cognitive decline in mice by inhibiting LARP7-mediated SIRT6 expression in an m6A-dependent manner.

AB  - RAC3 encodes a small GTPase of the Rho family, crucial for actin cytoskeleton organization and signaling pathways. De novo deleterious variants in RAC3 cause neurodevelopmental disorder with structural brain anomalies and dysmorphic facies (NEDBAF). Disease-causing variants thus far reported are thought to impact key conserved regions within RAC3, such as the P-loop, switch I/II, and G boxes, which are essential for the interaction with regulatory proteins and effectors. Recently, however, a novel variant, c.276T > A, p.N92K, was identified in a prenatal case with complex brain malformations. This variant, located outside the core functional regions, represents a unique class of RAC3 pathogenic mutations. We investigated the variant's effects using in vitro, in silico, and in vivo approaches. Overexpression of RAC3-N92K in primary hippocampal neurons impaired differentiation, leading to round cell shape with lamellipodia, suggesting that RAC3-N92K is active. Biochemical studies showed that RAC3-N92K is (1) resistant to GAP-mediated inactivation, (2) responsive to GEF activation, and (3) capable of interacting with RAC effectors PAK1 and MLK2, as well as Rho-kinase 1, activating gene expression through SRF, NF kappa B, and AP1 pathways. Structural analyses suggest that N92K disrupts GAP interactions but preserves interactions with GEF, PAK1, and MLK2. In vivo, RAC3-N92K expression in embryonic mouse cortical neurons led to migration defects and periventricular clustering during corticogenesis, along with impaired axon elongation. These findings indicate that RAC3-N92K's activated state significantly disrupts cortical development, expanding the genetic and pathophysiological spectrum of NEDBAF.

AB  - Angiogenic factor AGGF1 (AngioGenic factor with G-patch and FHA (Forkhead-Associated) domain 1) blocks neointimal formation (formation of a new or thickened layer of arterial intima) after vascular injury by regulating phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, the AGGF1 receptor on VSMCs and the underlying molecular mechanisms of its action are unknown. In this study, we used functional analysis of serial AGGF1 deletions to reveal the critical AGGF1 domain involved in VSMC phenotypic switching. This domain was required for VSMC phenotypic switching, proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and migration, as well as the regulation of cell cycle inhibitors cyclin D, p27, and p21. This domain also contains an RDDAPAS motif via which AGGF1 interacts with integrin alpha 7 (ITGA7), but not alpha 8. In addition, we show that AGGF1 enhanced the expression of contractile markers MYH11, alpha-SMA, and SM22 and inhibited MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and ELK phosphorylation in VSMCs, and that these effects were inhibited by knockdown of ITGA7, but not by knockdown of ITGA8. In vivo, deletion of the VSMC phenotypic switching domain in mice with vascular injury inhibited the functions of AGGF1 in upregulating alpha-SMA and SM22, inhibiting MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and ELK phosphorylation, in VSMC proliferation, and in blocking neointimal formation. Finally, we show the inhibitory effect of AGGF1 on neointimal formation was blocked by lentivirus-delivered shRNA targeting ITGA7. Our data demonstrate that AGGF1 interacts with its receptor integrin alpha 7 on VSMCs, and this interaction is required for AGGF1 signaling in VSMCs and for attenuation of neointimal formation after vascular injury.

AB  - Cheeks are essential for the overall integrity of the face. They play crucial roles in stabilization of food inside the mouth during chewing. Rahmani sheep is a main Egyptian sheep breed with great agricultural and industrial importance. Literature related to the micromorphological features of the cheeks in Rahmani sheep is scant. This study investigated the detailed anatomy of Rahmani sheep cheeks using gross morphology, histology, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The buccal mucosa appeared studded with several papillae of variable shape, type, length, and density. Grossly, the buccal papillae were arranged sequentially in 7-8 rows parallel to the cheek teeth, and their number and height decreased upon moving caudad. Using SEM, they appeared mainly conical shaped of either single or compound entity; other shapes included cylindrical, flattened, and dome shaped. The parotid papilla opposed the 3rd premolar tooth. Its lateral border revealed a round-shaped opening guarded by compound buccal papillae. Several openings of the buccal salivary glands were observed in between the buccal papillae. Histologically, two types of buccal salivary glands, mucous and seromucous were detected with differential distribution in their presence. The lining epithelium of the parotid duct at the parotid opening was stratified squamous, transitioned to stratified cuboidal toward its basal part. The latter contained numerous goblet cells positively reacted to PAS-alcian blue staining. In conclusion, this study reports for the first time several morphological characteristics of the Rahmani sheep cheeks and will improve understanding of the functional anatomy of the cheeks in relation to feeding.

AB  - Some Azteca ants are well-known symbionts that defend their Cecropia host plants against herbivory, although there is considerable variability in behavior among colonies, conditions, and species. In exchange, ants receive food, and also shelter within the plants' internodes. Here we demonstrate that ants repair damage to the host plant when their brood is directly threatened. Using comminuted plant fibers and an unidentified binding liquid (probably plant sap) ants generally began patching holes in the tree trunk immediately, and significantly reduced the size of the hole 2.5 hours after it was created, and they generally completed the repairs within 24 hours.

AB  - Exposure to air pollutants in wildfire smoke and indoor pollution causes lung diseases. Short-term exposure to wood smoke (WS) is partially known to alter the expression of human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), inflammatory cytokines, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Accordingly, we investigated the effect of exposing guinea pigs to WS for two and four three-hour periods on different days. The daily content of particles reported by indoor pollution was produced by 60 g of pinewood. We analyzed the cell profile and collagen content in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL). The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, MMPs, and TIMPs was studied in lung tissue. Cytokines and gelatinolytic activity were analyzed in BAL and serum. The results showed that total cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and collagen increased in BAL, whereas neutrophils and lymphocytes decreased. TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were upregulated in lungs, downregulating IL-12. TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta 1, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 were increased in BAL and serum, decreasing IL-12. Gelatinase activity was increased in serum. Thus, guinea pigs exposed to short-term domestic doses of WS overexpressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, MMPs, and TIMPs. These results are similar to ECM remodeling and pulmonary and systemic inflammation reported in humans.

AB  - ENVIRONMENT CARRYING CAPACITY OF ECOTOURISM IN AEK NAULI RESEARCH FOREST, SIMALUNGUN REGENCY, NORTH SUMATERA. Currently, ecotourism has become an important industry because of its rapid development. Many tourism practices have adverse environmental impacts. Due to the increasingly destructive commercialization of the natural resources on which we depend, there are several negative impacts. Aek Nauli Research Forest (ANRF), with an area of 1,900 hectares, is one of the natural tourist destinations around the Lake Toba Tourism area managed by the Aek Nauli Research Institute for Environmental and Forestry Development (BP2LHK). The location of the study is in Girsang District, Sipangan Bolon, Simalungun Regency, North Sumatera Province. The tourist objects are natural panorama, elephant conservation education tour, and siamang animal ape park. On average, the number of visitors of ANRF on regular days is 100-300 visitors/day and on holidays reaches 300-1,700 visitors/day. The increase in the number of visitors is perceived to have an impact on environmental sustainability. This study aims to determine the capacity of the ANRF ecotourism area to accommodate the number of tourists per day simultaneously. The method used is the effective carrying capacity by Cifuentes method based on several stages of analysis, namely Physical Capacity (PCC), Real Capacity (RCC), Management Capacity (MC), and Effective Capacity (ECC). The environmental carrying capacity analysis results showed that the PCC, RCC, ECC were 26,106 visitors/day, 3,007 visitors/day, 2,505 visitors/day respectively while MC was 0.83. This value can be used to advise managers to limit visitors, particularly during peak season, in order to preserve objects and the quality of visits.

AB  - Placental function is a key determinant of fetal growth and development that can be influenced by maternal and fetal environmental factors. The molecular mechanisms by which the placenta senses and responds to environmental cues are poorly understood. This exploratory study aimed to characterize the effect of birth rank (single vs. twin) and placentome morphologic subtype on expression of genes involved in nutrient transport, angiogenesis, immunity and stress response. Cotyledonary tissue was collected from type A, B and C placentomes from five single and six twin fetuses at 140 days of gestation. GLUT1 and GLUT3 were the most highly expressed genes consistent with the high demand for glucose to support fetal growth. Expression of BCKDHb and IGF-2 was 1.3-and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, and PCYT1A was 3-fold lower in singles compared to twins (P < 0.05) while no other differences in gene expression were observed between birth ranks. Expression of EAAT2 and LAT2 was higher while PCYT1A was lower in A compared to B type cotyledons. Expression of GUCY1B1/3 and IGF-1 was higher while CD98 and LAT2 were lower in type B compared to C cotyledons (P < 0.05). Compared to type C cotyledons, expression of EAAT2, IGF-1, IGF-2, LAT1 was higher, while TEK was lower in type A cotyledons. The effects of birth rank on placental gene expression in this study indicated that placental nutrient transport and/or function differs between single and twin pregnancies in sheep. Differences in gene expression between the placentome subtypes suggests that changes in placentome morphology are associated with shifts in amino acid transport and metabolism, oxidative stress and angiogenesis and/or blood flow. This study highlights that placental gene expression differs in response to birth rank and placentome morphologic subtype which suggests that both maternal and fetal factors may influence placental function in sheep. These associations provide insights into gene pathways for more targeted future investigations as well as potential adaptations to improve placental efficiency to support fetal growth in twin pregnancies.

AB  - We previously identified isopentylamine as a novel defence metabolite accumulated in rice (Oryza sativa L.) infested by brown planthoppers (BPHs, Nilaparvata lugens) and caterpillars, however the key biosynthetic gene(s) remained unknown. An analytical screen of genetically diverse rice cultivars was used to identify natural variation in isopentylamine production in rice, revealing that it can be produced at high levels in cv. Nipponbare but not in cv. Kasalath. Genetic approaches with chromosome fragment substitution lines and backcross inbred lines of Nipponbare and Kasalath were then used to identify genes potentially involved in biosynthesis of isopentylamine. The main candidate biosynthetic gene was knocked out with CRISPR/Cas9 to obtain three independent Nipponbare mutant lines, and correlations between gene function and isopentylamine were examined analytically. The gene Os10g0400500 was identified as the main biosynthetic gene for production of isopentylamine in rice. Furthermore, behavioural responses to isopentylamine in two-choice host assays were examined by placing BPHs in containers with mutant and wild-type Nipponbare leaves. Although BPHs were not always attracted to either wild-type or mutants, more BPHs, at least at some points, were found on the mutant leaves. Our results suggest that BPHs may show a preference for isopentylamine-deprived plants relative to wild types, which further corroborates the potential role of isopentylamine as defence against insect herbivores in chemically diverse rice species.

AB  - PremiseFloral traits are frequently under pollinator-mediated selection, especially in taxa subject to strong pollen-limitation, such as those reliant on pollinators. However, antagonists can be agents of selection on floral traits as well. The causes of selection acting on spring ephemerals are understudied though these species can experience particularly strong pollen-limitation. I examined pollinator- and antagonist-mediated selection in a narrowly endemic spring ephemeral, Trillium discolor. MethodsI measured pollen limitation in T. discolor across two years and evaluated its breeding system. I compared selection on floral traits (display height, petal size, petal color, flowering time) between open-pollinated, and pollen-supplemented plants to measure the strength and mode of pollinator-mediated selection. I assessed whether natural levels of antagonism impacted selection on floral traits. ResultsTrillium discolor was self-incompatible and experienced pollen limitation in both years of the study. Pollinators exerted negative disruptive selection on display height and petals size. In one year, pollinator-mediated selection favored lighter petals but in the second year pollinators favored darker petals. Antagonist damage did not alter selection on floral traits. ConclusionsResults demonstrate that pollinators mediate the strength and mode of selection on floral traits in T. discolor. Interannual variation in the strength, mode, and direction of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits could be important for maintaining of floral diversity in this system. Observed levels of antagonism were weak agents of selection on floral traits.

AB  - Reducing methane (CH4) emission from livestock production can be achieved by the treatment of manure in slurry pits and storage tanks. In the case of slurry pits, treating residual slurry left out after frequent flushing can largely reduce CH4 emission due to the decrease in methanogenic inoculum. In this study, three surfactants, two oxidants and a flocculant were screened for their efficiency in reducing CH4 emission from residual pig slurry in a headspace emission setup. All the surfactants reduced CH4 emission by >95% at dosage 8 g kg(-1) and particularly sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treatment was effective at low dosage of only 2.5 g kg(-1) with >95% reduction. Oxidants reduced CH4 emission by 30-85% at different dosages, with sodium hypochlorite being most effective. Flocculant treatment did not reduce CH4 emissions significantly. None of the studied treatments reduced ammonia emissions significantly. Similarities in methanogenic pathway were observed among the surfactant treated slurries, and among the oxidant treated slurries. Considering the cost and environmental effects of the studied additives, SDS at a 2.5 g kg(-1) dosage seems the most promising choice. Future work on SDS could either be as a combination treatment with other additives or on up-scaling and designing dosage solutions for pig houses.

AB  - Progesterone (P4) can participate in the development of female mammalian antral follicles through nuclear receptor (PGR). In this experiment, the differences of P4 synthesis and PGR expression in different developmental stages of sheep antral follicles (large > 5mm, medium 2-5mm, small < 2mm) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Secondly, sheep follicular granulosa cells were cultured in vitro. The effects of different concentrations of FSH and LH on P4 synthesis and PGR expression were studied. The results showed that acute steroid regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side chain lyase (P450scc) and 3 beta Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) and PGR were expressed in antral follicles, and with the development of antral follicles in sheep, StAR, P450scc and the expression of 3 beta-HSD and PGR increased significantly. In vitro experiments showed that FSH and LH alone or together treatment could regulate P4 secretion and PGR expression in sheep follicular granulosa cells to varying degrees, hint P4 and PGR by FSH and LH, and LH was the main factor. Our results supplement the effects of FSH and LH on the regulation of P4 synthesis during follicular development, which provides new data for further study of steroid synthesis and function in follicular development.

AB  - The populations of African savanna elephants have declined by an estimated 60 % since the 1970s, which can be attributed to a mixture of poaching and habitat loss. Human activities and environmental changes have caused unprecedented loss and fragmentation of elephant natural habitats, resulting in the isolation of elephant populations. Preserving habitat connectivity is thus increasingly important to conserve remaining elephants' populations and maintain ecological functions. A major challenge in large-scale connectivity modeling is data availability constraints. To tackle this issue, we developed an integrated modeling approach that leverages multiple, publicly available occurrence datasets, which vary in format and quality, with a multi-scale SDM to estimate spatial suitability of African savanna elephants. Two SDMs, based on polygon-based observations and presence-only occurrences, were separately calibrated using the Isolation Forest algorithm and then ensembled using Bayes fusion. Particularly, we included multiple landscape metrics derived from a high-resolution (similar to 5 m) land cover map as environmental predictors in the SDMs to characterize the landscape structure influencing elephant movement. The resulting environmental suitability was then used to map landscape connectivity through circuit theory, implemented in Circuitscape. Using species distribution modeling (SDM) and graph-based landscape connectivity modeling, we aimed to understand population connectivity and target vital corridors across Tanzania, one of the most important elephant range states. Shapley value-based variable analysis in SDM revealed that human modifications strongly influence elephant distribution at broad scales, while habitat fragmentation and connectivity impact their activities. Connectivity results further highlighted that both long- and short-distance connectivity are currently facing significant threats from intensive human activities (e.g., agriculture) in Tanzania and identified critical linkage zones that should be targeted for connectivity conservation efforts.

AB  - Vigna unguiculata is a vital vegetable crop in Southeast Asia, and Megalurothrips usitatus can cause huge damage to this crop. Enhancing the resistance of V. unguiculata against M. usitatus is a promising way to protect this crop; however, there is limited information regarding the mechanism underlying the resistance of V. unguiculata against M. usitatus. Here, a behavior assay was performed to explore the resistance of V. unguiculata against M. usitatus after insect damage or treatment by jasmonic acid (JA). Furthermore, transcriptome and metabonomics analysis was used to detect the putative mechanism underlying the resistance of V. unguiculata against M. usitatus. The pre-treatment of Vigna unguiculata with JA or infestation with Megalurothrips usitatus alleviated the damage resulting from the pest insect. We further identified differentially expressed genes and different metabolites involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism. Genes of chalcone reductase and shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, as well as lipoxygenase and acyl-CoA oxidase involved in alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, were upregulated in plants after herbivory or JA supplementation. The upregulation of these genes contributed to the high accumulation of metabolites involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and the alpha-linolenic acid metabolism pathway. These transcriptional and metabolite changes are potentially responsible for plant defense and a putative regulatory model is thus proposed to illustrate the cowpea defense mechanism against insect attack. Our study provides candidate targets for the breeding of varieties with resistance to insect herbivory by molecular technology.

AB  - This research work consists on valorizing poultry waste by biotransformation into biofertilizers, associating this agro-industrial waste with algae (abundant natural resources) and molasses (a by-product of the sugar refining industry) ensuring a good contribution of nutritional chemical elements and obtaining a balanced formulation. A total of seven different formulations of the above three components, were examined in a simplex centroid design. A fungal inoculum of Aspergillus niger was used as a fermentation agent for better quality of biotransformation. The monitoring of this biotransformation is ensured during 15 days by following the evolution of physicochemical and microbiological parameters and, to understand the bioconversion of the simple compounds of the biofertilizer mixture such as short aliphatic chains, sugar, and amino acids into soluble mineral compounds, a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was carried out before and after biotransformation. Finally, germination and fertilization tests were performed to evaluate the efficiency of the final product on a barley crop. The overall results of the present study showed that the mixture which contained 68.75% poultry waste, 12.5% molasses, and 18.75% algae presented the better microbiological and chemical safety criteria required for a good biofertilizer according to NF U44-551 standard.

AB  - Sect. Tuberculata Chang in the genus Camellia (Theaceae Mirb.) is named after the "tubercle-like projections on the surface of the capsule and ovary". Due to complex morphological variations in these taxon and insufficient field investigations, the interspecies relationships are unclear, the species' definitions are vague, and the names are confusing. This is not conducive to the conservation and study of these species. Therefore, herein, we systematically explore the taxonomic status of five sect. Tuberculata species using morphological, pollen morphological, and molecular phylogenetic methods. The results showed that (1) the morphological characteristics of the flower, fruit, and leaves of C. anlungensis and C. leyeensis are similar. Furthermore, the pollen characteristics and pollen wall ornamentation show that there is no significant difference between the two species; (2) there are significant differences between C. acutiperulata and C. anlungensis in terms of leaf shape (elliptic vs. obovate), calyx characteristics (sepal apex pointed vs. sepal oblong), and fruit shape (subglobose folds with shallow verruculose vs. flat folds and verruculose protuberances with pronounced internal cleavage); (3) C. pyxidiacea and C. rubituberculata differ in flower color (white or light color vs. red) and fruit verrucae (obviously deeply cleft vs. shallowly uncracked); (4) a phylogenetic tree based on the chloroplast genome shows that C. anlungensis and C. leyeensis form a single clade (BS = 100%, PP = 1.0) and are on a different branch, with C. acutiperulata on clade II (BS = 100%, PP = 1.0), and C. pyxidiacea and C. rubituberculata clustered on different branches of clade I (BS = 99%, PP = 1.00). Considering the above results together, we propose that C. leyeensis should be treated as a homonym of C. anlungensis, and C. acutiperulata, C. pyxidiacea, and C. rubituberculata should be considered as separate species. Clarifying the taxonomic status of these five species not only advances our understanding of the significance and complexity of the systematic classification of the genus Camellia but also has important implications for diversity conservation and population genetics.

AB  - Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment for brain tumors; however, it also causes brain injuries. The pediatric brain is considered especially vulnerable compared to the adult brain; thus, brain injuries caused by CRT may severely affect their quality of life. In this study, we determined the neuroprotective effects of nasal oxytocin administration following cranial radiation in mice. We investigated the cognitive behavior of mice (novel object recognition test and novel object location test), phos-phorylated histone H2AX (g-H2AX) and K+-Cl- transporter (KCC2) by immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampal sections, and neuronal cells by immunocytochemistry after radiation and oxytocin administration. We found that the number of gamma-H2AX foci was increased, and the surface signal intensity of KCC2 immunofluorescence was decreased in cells that were irradiated with X-rays (1.5 Gy, for three consecutive days) compared with cells that were not. Furthermore, using MQAE, we found that the intracellular chloride ion concentration was downregulated in oxytocin-treated cells by increasing sur -face KCC2 expression. These results indicate that nasal oxytocin administration after cranial irradiation attenuates cognitive dysfunction in mice and exerts multifaceted neuroprotective effects on DNA damage and maintains chloride ion concentration in neuronal cells.

AB  - Salmonella enterica is a bacterial pathogen known to cause gastrointestinal infections in diverse hosts, including humans and animals. Despite extensive knowledge of virulence mechanisms, understanding the factors driving host specificity remains limited. In this study, we performed a comprehensive pangenome-wide analysis of S. enterica to identify potential loci determining preference towards certain hosts. We used a dataset of high-quality genome assemblies grouped into 300 reference clusters with a special focus on four host groups: humans, pigs, cattle, and birds. The reconstructed pangenome was shown to be open and enriched with the accessory component implying high genetic diversity. Notably, phylogenetic inferences did not correspond to the distribution of affected hosts, as large compact phylogenetic groups were absent. By performing a pangenome-wide association study, we identified potential host specificity determinants. These included multiple genes encoding proteins involved in distinct infection stages, e.g., secretion systems, surface structures, transporters, transcription regulators, etc. We also identified antibiotic resistance loci in host-adapted strains. Functional annotation corroborated the results obtained with significant enrichments related to stress response, antibiotic resistance, ion transport, and surface or extracellular localization. We suggested categorizing the revealed specificity factors into three main groups: pathogenesis, resistance to antibiotics, and propagation of mobile genetic elements (MGEs).

AB  - Lately, the development of various mental illnesses, such as depression, personality disorders, and autism spectrum disorders, is often associated with traumatic events in childhood. Nonetheless, the mechanism giving rise to this predisposition is still unknown. Because the development of a disease often depends on a combination of a genetic background and environment, we decided to evaluate the effect of early-life stress on BTBR mice, which have behavioral, neuroanatomical, and physiological features of autism spectrum disorders. As early-life stress, we used prolonged separation of pups from their mothers in the first 2 weeks of life (3 h once a day). We assessed effects of the early-life stress on juvenile (postnatal day 23) and adolescent (postnatal days 37-38) male and female mice of strains C57BL/6 (B6) and BTBR. We found that in both strains, the early-life stress did not lead to changes in the level of social behavior, which is an important characteristic of autism-related behavior. Nonetheless, the early-life stress resulted in increased locomotor activity in juvenile BTBR mice. In adolescent mice, the stress early in life caused a low level of anxiety in B6 males and BTBR females and increased exploratory activity in adolescent BTBR males and females. In addition, adolescent B6 male and female mice with a history of the early-life stress tended to have a thinner motor cortex as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. As compared to B6 mice, BTBR mice showed reduced levels of social behavior and exploratory activity but their level of locomotor activity was higher. BTBR mice had smaller whole-brain, cortical, and dorsal hippocampal volumes; decreased motor cortex thickness; and increased ventral-hippocampus volume as compared to B6 mice, and these parameters correlated with the level of exploratory behavior of BTBR mice. Overall, the effects of early postnatal stress are sex- and strain-dependent.

AB  - Accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) is associated with synaptic dysfunction and destabilization of astrocytic calcium homeostasis. A growing body of evidence support astrocytes as active modulators of synaptic transmission via calcium-mediated gliotransmission. However, the details of mechanisms linking A beta signaling, astrocytic calcium dynamics, and gliotransmission are not known. We developed a biophysical model that describes calcium signaling and the ensuing gliotransmitter release from a single astrocytic process when stimulated by glutamate release from hippocampal neurons. The model accurately captures the temporal dynamics of microdomain calcium signaling and glutamate release via both kiss-and-run and full-fusion exocytosis. We investigate the roles of two crucial calcium regulating machineries affected by A beta: plasma-membrane calcium pumps (PMCA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). When we implemented these A beta-affected molecular changes in our astrocyte model, it led to an increase in the rate and synchrony of calcium events. Our model also reproduces several previous findings of A beta associated aberrant calcium activity, such as increased intracellular calcium level and increased spontaneous calcium activity, and synchronous calcium events. The study establishes a causal link between previous observations of hyperactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and A beta-induced modifications in mGluR and PMCA functions. Analogous to neurotransmitter release, gliotransmitter exocytosis closely tracks calcium changes in astrocyte processes, thereby guaranteeing tight control of synaptic signaling by astrocytes. However, the downstream effects of AD-related calcium changes in astrocytes on gliotransmitter release are not known. Our results show that enhanced rate of exocytosis resulting from modified calcium signaling in astrocytes leads to a rapid depletion of docked vesicles that disrupts the crucial temporal correspondence between a calcium event and vesicular release. We propose that the loss of temporal correspondence between calcium events and gliotransmission in astrocytes pathologically alters astrocytic modulation of synaptic transmission in the presence of A beta accumulation.

AB  - Citizen science and spatial ecology analyses can inform species distributions, habitat preferences, and threats in elusive and endangered species such as seahorses. Through a dedicated citizen science survey submitted to the Italian diving centers, we collected 115 presence records of the two seahorses occurring along the Italian coasts: Hippocampus hippocampus and H. guttulatus. From this dataset, we used 85 seahorse valitaded records to identify the ecological features of these two poorly known species and quantify the effects of human activities on their habitat suitability through geographic information systems and species distribution modelling. Our results indicated a continuous suitable area for both seahorses along the Italian coasts, with a single major gap in the central Adriatic Sea (Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions). They co-occurred in most of their Italian range, particularly in the central and southern Tyrrhenian coasts, and their ecological niches resulted to be significantly similar, although not equivalent. The least-cost paths of both species were concentrated in southern Italy (Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily), suggesting that more data is needed to improve the spatial resolution of the available information, especially in the northern and central Italy. Human activities influenced 38% and 42% of the habitat suitability of H. hippocampus and H. guttulatus, respectively, while only 25% and 30% of their potential distributions, respectively, are protected by Italy's existing conservation area system, in accordance with the global average for seahorses. In particular, the central Adriatic Sea represents a critical area where the occurrence of these seahorses is lower and the anthropic impact is higher. Considering all the Italian regions, fishing effort is the main human activity impacting both species. These findings will support the implementation of more efficient conservation actions. We encourage the application and interaction of citizen science and spatial ecology analyses to facilitate the assessment and sustainable management of elusive organisms.

AB  - Simple Summary Nowadays, there is a growing demand among consumers for products sourced from animals raised on a natural diet, relying solely on grazed natural resources. This is the case for Iberian pigs that forage for acorns and grass without any additional feed. However, current regulation does not consider any official analytical methodology for the discrimination and certification of their feeding regime. Although this objective was pursued in the past, it was performed by evaluating postmortem samples. This new research evaluates the potential of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to discriminate the diet of Iberian pigs in vivo, using spectral information from faecal samples and regression analysis. The final models demonstrated a robust performance in cross-validation, also achieving 94% prediction accuracy. These results suggest that NIRS analysis of faecal samples can be a valuable approach for achieving the objective above-mentioned and providing useful information for in vivo discrimination of diets in Iberian pig production.Abstract The Iberian pig is a native breed of the Iberian Peninsula, which holds an international reputation due to the superior quality and the added value of its products. Different rearing practices and feeding regimes are regulated, resulting in different labelling schemes. However, there is no official analytical methodology that is standardised for certification purposes in the sector. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technology that provides information about the physicochemical composition of a sample, with several advantages that have enabled its implementation in different fields. Although it has already been successfully used for the analysis of Iberian pig's final products, samples evaluated with NIRS technology are characterised by a postmortem collection. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of NIRS analysis of faeces for in vivo discrimination of the Iberian pig feeding regime, using the spectral information per se for the development of modified partial least squares regressions. Faecal samples were used due to their easy collection, especially in extensive systems where pig handling is difficult. A total of 166 individual samples were collected from 12 farms, where the three different feeding regimes available in the sector were ensured. Although slight differences were detected depending on the chemometric approach, the best models obtained a classification success and a prediction accuracy of over 94% for feeding regime discrimination. The results are considered very satisfactory and suggest NIRS analysis of faeces as a promising approach for the in vivo discrimination of the Iberian pigs' diet, and its implementation during field inspections, a significative achievement for the sector.

AB  - Loss of pasture lands and increased livestock population has resulted in higher livestock dependency on the forest lands. Kailadevi Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS) is an important landscape for maintaining a healthy tiger population in western India. The sanctuary is inhibited by 19,179 people and 78,122 livestock in 66 settlements. Livestock density in KWLS is 0.74 ACU ha(-1) which is much higher than the recommended stocking density. Heavy livestock population has degraded the habitat. The study was carried out to assess the grazing pressure in the KWLS. Livestock population has left very little space for the wild herbivores. There is an immense possibility of increased human-wildlife conflicts and endangered food security and livelihood for thousands of people. In view of such a situation, measures have been suggested for the management of livestock grazing impacts and conservation of this crucial habitat.

AB  - The role of neuroinflammation in the mechanisms of epileptogenesis has been widely discussed in recent years. One of the factors influencing inflammatory processes in the brain may be changes in the expression of nuclear transcription factors, in particular peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Agonists of these receptors have a pronounced neuroprotective effect in epilepsy models. Studies carried out on cells of various body tissues reveal a close functional relationship that exists between the genes of Ppars, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). This work aimed to study the peculiarities of Ppars gene expression in rat brain structures in a lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy and to evaluate the possible effect of IL-1ra (the drug anakinra) on these parameters. Pilocarpine was administered to Wistar rats at 7-8 weeks of age, one day after LiCl injections. Anakinra was administered for one week after pilocarpine (the first injection of 100 mu g/kg one hour after convulsions, then for 5 days at 100 mu g/kg and 2 days at 50 mu g/kg), after which brain samples were taken for biochemical analysis. Ppara, Ppard, and Pparg gene expression was assessed by reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, temporal cortex, and amygdala. Pilocarpine-induced seizures were shown to increase Ppard and Pparg gene expression in the ventral hippocampus and to decrease Ppara gene expression in all examined brain regions. Anakinra enhances the decrease in Ppara gene expression, has no effect on Ppard mRNA production, and levels out the increase in Pparg gene expression. Thus, Ppars gene expression in the brain changes during epileptogenesis; anakinra multidirectionally regulates Ppara and Pparg mRNA production, but has no effect on Ppard gene expression.

AB  - In many social species physical attributes correlate with dominance rankings and influence the outcomes of dyadic interactions. We investigated the processes that affect white rhinoceros' social behaviour in response to a reduction in horn size asymmetries within a group of subadult individuals. We monitored agonistic social interactions and the orderliness of social rankings between six free ranging rhinoceroses before and after they underwent a second dehorning procedure. We used a modified version of Landau's h' to measure linearity, a score of steepness to measure power asymmetry, and a measure of triangle transitivity to assess relationships in the presence of null dyads. Agonistic social interactions were significantly greater after the monitored dehorning procedure. Hierarchies possessed significant steepness and transitivity prior to the procedure, but not after. Linearity was non-significant and rank order did not correspond with changes in horn size or age. Our results provide the first evidence of a dominance hierarchy among free-ranging white rhinoceroses outside of reproductive competition, but indicate that physical attributes alone do not explain social rankings. Rhinoceroses transitioned to a more egalitarian dominance structure than a despotic one after the procedure, but dominance ranks were only weakly differentiated within the group. Although a reduction in horn asymmetries may increase agonistic behaviours via psychosocial or behavioural changes, drier climatic conditions cannot be ruled out as the causative factor and because the subadult group stayed together, rather than dispersing, any increased fitness costs are likely to be minimal and outweighed by the benefits of group membership.

AB  - Epidemiologic studies have indicated that dyslipidemia may facilitate the progression of neuronal degeneration. However, the effects of chronic dyslipidemia on brain function, especially in older individuals, remain unclear. In this study, middle-aged 37-week-old male Wistar-Kyoto rats were fed a normal diet (ND) or a 45% high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks (i.e., until 67 weeks of age). To study the effects of chronic dyslipidemia on the brain, we analyzed spontaneous locomotor activity, cognitive function, and brain tissues in both groups of rats after 30 weeks. Compared with age-matched rats fed a ND, Wistar-Kyoto rats fed a HFD had dyslipidemia and showed decreased movement but normal recognition of a novel object. In our brain analyses, we observed a significant decrease in astrocytes and tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus of rats fed a HFD compared with rats fed a ND. However, hippocampal pyramidal neurons were not affected. Our findings indicate that the long-term consumption of a HFD may cause lipid metabolism overload in the brain and damage to glial cells. The decrease in astrocytes may lead to reduced protection of the brain and affect the survival of tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons but not pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus.

AB  - Vertical migration is a geographically and taxonomically widespread behaviour among zooplankton that spans across diel and seasonal timescales. The shorter-term diel vertical migration (DVM) has a periodicity of up to 1 day and was first described by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1817. In 1888, the German marine biologist Carl Chun described the longer-term seasonal vertical migration (SVM), which has a periodicity of ca. 1 year. The proximate control and adaptive significance of DVM have been extensively studied and are well understood. DVM is generally a behaviour controlled by ambient irradiance, which allows herbivorous zooplankton to feed in food-rich shallower waters during the night when light-dependent (visual) predation risk is minimal and take refuge in deeper, darker waters during daytime. However, DVMs of herbivorous zooplankton are followed by their predators, producing complex predator-prey patterns that may be traced across multiple trophic levels. In contrast to DVM, SVM research is relatively young and its causes and consequences are less well understood. During periods of seasonal environmental deterioration, SVM allows zooplankton to evacuate shallower waters seasonally and take refuge in deeper waters often in a state of dormancy. Both DVM and SVM play a significant role in the vertical transport of organic carbon to deeper waters (biological carbon sequestration), and hence in the buffering of global climate change. Although many animal migrations are expected to change under future climate scenarios, little is known about the potential implications of global climate change on zooplankton vertical migrations and its impact on the biological carbon sequestration process. Further, the combined influence of DVM and SVM in determining zooplankton fitness and maintenance of their horizontal (geographic) distributions is not well understood. The contrasting spatial (deep versus shallow) and temporal (diel versus seasonal) scales over which these two migrations occur lead to challenges in studying them at higher spatial, temporal and biological resolution and coverage. Extending the largely population-based vertical migration knowledge base to individual-based studies will be an important way forward. While tracking individual zooplankton in their natural habitats remains a major challenge, conducting trophic-scale, high-resolution, year-round studies that utilise emerging field sampling and observation techniques, molecular genetic tools and computational hardware and software will be the best solution to improve our understanding of zooplankton vertical migrations.

AB  - Dominance behaviours have been collected for many groups of animals since 1922 and serve as a foundation for research on social behaviour and social structure. Despite a wealth of data from the last century of research on dominance hierarchies, these data are only rarely used for comparative insight. Here, we aim to facilitate comparative studies of the structure and function of dominance hierarchies by compiling published dominance interaction datasets from the last 100 years of work. This compiled archive includes 436 datasets from 190 studies of 367 unique groups (mean group size 13.8, s.d. = 13.4) of 135 different species, totalling over 243 000 interactions. These data are presented in an R package alongside relevant metadata and a tool for subsetting the archive based on biological or methodological criteria. In this paper, we explain how to use the archive, discuss potential limitations of the data, and reflect on best practices in publishing dominance data based on our experience in assembling this dataset. This archive will serve as an important resource for future comparative studies and will promote the development of general unifying theories of dominance in behavioural ecology that can be grounded in testing with empirical data. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'.

AB  - The diploid wild goat grass Aegilops tauschii (Ae. tauschii, 2n = 14; DD), as the D-sub genome of common wheat, provides rich germplasm resources for many aspects of wheat breeding. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential phytohormone that plays a pivotal role in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. However, the gene regulation network of Ae. tauschii in response to ABA stress remains unclear. Here, we conducted a time-course strand-specific RNA-sequencing study to globally profile the transcriptome that responded to ABA treatment in Ae. tauschii. We identified 4818 differentially expressed transcription units/genes with time-point-specific induction/repression patterns. Using functional annotation, one-to-one ortholog and comparative transcriptome profiling analyses, we identified 319 ABA-responsive Ae. tauschii orthologs that were also induced/repressed under ABA treatment in hexaploid wheat. On the quantitative trait loci (QTL) used in wheat marker-assisted breeding, we found that the ABA-responsive expression patterns of eight Ae. tauschii orthologs were associated with drought stress tolerance, flowering process and/or grain quality. Of them, the ABA-responsive gene encoding sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase in fructan and glucose metabolism pathways showed the most significant association with wheat drought tolerance. The characterization of ABA early-responsive genes in this study provides valuable information for exploring the molecular functions of the regulatory genes and will assist in wheat breeding.

AB  - Background BAHD acyltransferases are among the largest metabolic protein domain families in the genomes of terrestrial plants and play important roles in plant growth and development, aroma formation, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. Little is known about the BAHDs in the tea plant, a cash crop rich in secondary metabolites. Results In this study, 112 BAHD genes (CsBAHD01-CsBAHD112) were identified from the tea plant genome, with 85% (98/112) unevenly distributed across the 15 chromosomes. The number of BAHD gene family members has significantly expanded from wild tea plants to the assamica type to the sinensis type. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they could be classified into seven subgroups. Promoter cis-acting element analysis revealed that they contain a large number of light, phytohormones, and stress-responsive elements. Many members displayed tissue-specific expression patterns. CsBAHD05 was expressed at more than 500-fold higher levels in purple tea leaves than in green tea leaves. The genes exhibiting the most significant response to MeJA treatment and feeding by herbivorous pests were primarily concentrated in subgroups 5 and 6. The expression of 23 members of these two subgroups at different time points after feeding by tea green leafhoppers and tea geometrids was examined via qPCR, and the results revealed that the expression of CsBAHD93, CsBAHD94 and CsBAHD95 was significantly induced after the tea plants were subjected to feeding by both pricking and chewing pests. Moreover, based on the transcriptome data for tea plants being fed on by these two pests, a transcriptional regulatory network of different transcription factor genes coexpressed with these 23 members was constructed. Conclusions Our study provides new insights into the role of BAHDs in the defense response of tea plants, and will facilitate in-depth studies of the molecular function of BAHDs in resistance to herbivorous pests.

AB  - Hypotheses were tested that the proteome of pig kidney LLC-PK1 cells (i) contains Zn-proteins that react with a diversity of native and pharmacologically active metal-binding ligands to form ternary complexes and (ii) includes proteins that bind Zn2+ nonspecifically and together form ternary adducts with a variety of metal-binding agents. The method to observe ternary complex formation with Zn-proteins and proteome center dot Zn involved preformation of fluorescent TSQ [6-Methoxy-(8-p-toluenesulfonamido)quinoline]-Zn-proteins and/or proteome center dot Zn-TSQ adducts followed by competitive reaction with selected ligands. The loss of TSQ-dependent fluorescence signaled the replacement of TSQ by the competing ligand in the starting adducts. In vitro, 1,10-phenanthroline competed effectively with TSQ for binding to Zn-proteins in the proteome. The successful competition of 1,10-phenanthroline with TSQ-Zn-proteins was also observed in cells. Similarly, 1,10-phenanthroline was shown to bind to a sizable fraction of Zn2+ associated adventitiously with proteome (proteome center dot Zn). Other synthetic ligands that bind to Zn-proteins and proteome center dot Zn include 2,2-bipyridyl, 8-hydroxyquinoline, 2,2MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-dicarboxypyridine, and pyrithione. Such results suggest that ligand binding to such sites may play a role in the observed biological effects of these and other metal-binding molecules. Although cysteine does not significantly compete with TSQ, glutathione displaces TSQ from Zn-proteins and proteome center dot Zn at concentrations well below those found in cells, implying that ternary complex formation involving glutathione may be physiologically significant.

AB  - Simple Summary Sows' maternal behavior is important for piglet survival and growth. It is critical to explore their genetic mechanisms for better breeding. Comparative analysis showed that piglets' growth traits were strongly associated with sows' maternal behaviors. Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for biting piglets (BP), crushing piglets (CP), trampling piglets (TP) and screaming test (ST) traits, several candidate genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. These findings preliminarily elucidate the genetic basis of sows' maternal behavior traits and provide markers for molecular breeding.Abstract Sows' maternal behavior is important for improving piglet survival and growth; thus, breeding for good mothering sows is necessary for pig production. However, there is little research on the genetic mechanism of maternal behavior. In this study, a comparative analysis of piglets' growth traits between good and bad maternal behavior groups and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to elucidate the impact of sows' maternal behavior on piglet growth and identify candidate genes and markers of sow's maternal behaviors. Comparing the growth traits of piglets between good and bad sows' maternal behavior groups, the results showed that the growth traits of piglets from sows with good maternal behavior were better than those from sows with bad maternal behavior and especially for the multiparous sows group, this comparative difference was significant. For the intensive study of the genetic mechanisms of sows' maternal behavior, a total of 452 sows were genotyped using the Illumina Porcine 50K SNP Chip, and 4 traits, including biting piglets (BP), crushing piglets (CP), trampling piglets (TP) and screaming test (ST), were examined. Using a GWAS, 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to be associated with these traits. Within 1 Mb upstream and downstream of the significant SNPs screened, 138 genes were obtained. After pathway enrichment and gene annotation, HIP1, FZD9 and HTR7 were identified as important candidate genes affecting sows' maternal behaviors. These findings preliminarily elucidate the genetic basis of sows' maternal behavior traits and provide candidate genes and markers for molecular breeding in pigs.

AB  - Ruminants fed high-concentrate diets produce less enteric methane than those fed high-forage diets, but not all grains are equally effective in reducing methane production. This study aimed to examine, in farm conditions, the effects of a partial substitution of maize with barley on animal performance and rumen fermentation, including methane production, of intensively reared beef calves (ca. 0.9:0.1 concentrate to forage ratio). Ninety-six beef calves were fed a concentrate with 45.5% maize and 15% barley (n = 48; M) or a concentrate with 15.5% maize and 45% barley (n = 48; B). Both the concentrate and barley straw were offered ad libitum. The type of concentrate did not have a significant effect (p > 0.05) on final live weight, average daily gain, carcass dressing percentage or intake of concentrate and straw. Dry matter and organic matter digestibility were higher (p < 0.05) for the M (75.4% and 76.6%) than for the B (71.0% and 73.1%) treatment, but with no effect on digestible organic matter intake. In general, the majority cereal in the concentrate did not affect rumen fermentation, including methane production, or the degradability of dry matter and starch. A partial substitution of maize with barley in the concentrate offered to beef calves does not seem a promising strategy to decrease the emissions of enteric methane on-farm.

AB  - The tomato potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli Sulc (Hemiptera: Triozidae)) can cause significant losses to Solanaceous crop via direct feeding and by transmitting the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum. In the present study, an Australian native ladybird beetle, Coccinella transversalis Fabricius, was examined as a potential biological control agent of B. cockerelli. An age-stage, two sex life table of C. transversalis was constructed, demonstrating that C. transversalis could survive, develop, and reproduce successfully when fed B. cockerelli as a monotypic diet. Predation on B. cockerelli by C. transversalis third and fourth instar larvae and adults fit the Holling 'type II' disc equation. In a glasshouse trial using B. cockerelli-infested tomato plants, C. transversalis larvae reduced the population growth of B. cockerelli larvae by 66% and adults by 59% over one month, reducing loss of leaf chlorophyll and increasing plant biomass relative to controls. The results of the present study were compared with a previous study for the resident ladybird beetle species against B. cockerelli. Whereas C. transversalis suppressed B. cockerelli populations, the impact was less than that of the introduced ladybird, Hippodamia variegata Goeze, which showed higher voracity in previous work. However, B. cockerelli is suitable prey for C. transversalis and this species should aid in its biological control in agricultural ecosystems in Australia.

AB  - Poor maternal nutrition during gestation negatively affects offspring growth and metabolism. To evaluate the impact of maternal nutrient restriction and realimentation on metabolism in the fetal liver, skeletal muscle, and circulation, on day 50 of gestation, ewes (n = 48) pregnant with singletons were fed 100% (CON) or 60% (RES) of requirements until day 90 of gestation, when a subset of ewes (n = 7/treatment) were euthanized, and fetal samples were collected. The remaining ewes were maintained on a current diet (CON-CON, n = 6; RES-RES, n = 7) or switched to an alternative diet (CON-RES, RES-CON; n = 7/treatment). On day 130 of gestation, the remaining ewes were euthanized, and fetal samples were collected. Fetal liver, longissimus dorsi (LD), and blood metabolites were analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst. Then, 600, 518, and 524 metabolites were identified in the liver, LD, and blood, respectively, including 345 metabolites that were present in all three. Nutrient restriction was associated with changes in amino acid, carbohydrate, lipid, and transulfuration/methionine metabolic pathways, some of which were alleviated by realimentation. Fetal age also affected metabolite abundance. The differential abundance of metabolites involved in amino acid, methionine, betaine, and bile acid metabolism could impact fetal epigenetic regulation, protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, and signaling associated with glucose and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Glucosensing evokes complex neural and endocrine responses that control glucose utilization in mammals. Until now, the glucosensing mechanism studies in fish have been mostly concentrated in carnivorous fishes and omnivorous fishes, lacking in herbivorous fishes. To lay a better understanding of herbivorous fish glucosensing mechanism, we first established a high digestible carbohydrates (HDC) intake model of grass carp with steadily reduced daily food intake compared with control diet intake. The blood glucose level of the HDC group was significantly higher than the control group within postprandial 2 h, and then no further increasing blood glucose was detected within postprandial 6 h. Within postprandial 2 h, the higher circulating glucose levels induced by HDC intake might inhibit the appetite (decreased orexigenic npy and agrp while increased anorexigenic pomc expressions) through triggering brain glucosensing mechanism (increased central slc2a2 and gck expression). After that, the combined results of unselected slc2a2 and gck expression and elevated tas1r2e-f expression after a HDC diet intake within postprandial 2-6 h suggested that the vegetarian-adapted sweet taste receptors might suppress appetite (further increased anorexigenic cartpt and pomc expressions) through affecting peripheral appetite-regulating peptides in a GCK-independent way. This result raised up the possibility that sweet taste receptors are the potential mediators involved in appetite regulation of herbivorous grass carp in response to HDC intake through peripheral glucosensing system.

AB  - Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is one of the most economically important fish in China, and its production is commonly lost due to GCRV infection. To understand the molecular mechanism of GCRV resistance in grass carp, we compared the spleen transcriptome of the GCRV-resistant and susceptible individuals under GCRV infection (Res-Sus) and the GCRV-resistant individuals under different conditions of injection with GCRV and PBS (Res-Ctl). A total of 87.56 GB of clean data were obtained from 12 transcriptomic libraries of spleen tissues. A total of 379 DEGs (156 upregulated genes and 223 downregulated genes) were identified in the comparison group Res-Ctl. A total of 1207 DEGs (633 upregulated genes and 574 downregulated genes) were identified in the comparison group Res-Sus. And 54 DEGs were shared including immune-related genes of stc2 (stanniocalcin 2), plxna1 (plexin A1), ifn & alpha; (interferon alpha), cxcl 11 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11), ngfr (nerve growth factor receptor), mx (MX dynamin-like GTPase), crim1 (cysteine-rich transmembrane BMP regulator 1), plxnb2 (plexin B2), and slit2 (slit guidance ligand 2). KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of genes mainly involved in immune system and signal transduction, including antigen processing and presentation, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and Hippo signaling pathway. This study investigates the immune mechanism of the resistance to GCRV infection in grass carp and provides useful information for the development of methods to control the spread of the GCRV infection.

AB  - To understand the effect of fetal thyroid gland disruption on development in swine, we evaluated thyroid hormone levels, growth and developmental characteristics, and gene expression associated with thyroid hormone metabolism in late gestation fetuses exposed to methimazole (MMI). Pregnant gilts were given either oral MMI or equivalent sham from gestation day 85-106 (n = 4/group), followed by intensive phenotyping of all fetuses (n = 120). Samples of liver (LVR), kidney (KID), fetal placenta (PLC), and the corresponding maternal endometrium (END) were collected from a subset of fetuses (n = 32). Fetuses exposed to MMI in utero were confirmed hypothyroid, with a significant increase in thyroid gland size, goitrous thyroid histology, and dramatically suppressed thyroid hormone in serum. In dams, no differences in temporal measurements of average daily gain, thyroid hormone, or rectal temperatures relative to controls suggests that MMI had little effect on maternal physiology. However, fetuses from MMI-treated gilts exhibited significant increases in body mass, girth, and vital organ weights, but no differences in crown-rump length or bone measurements suggesting non-allometric growth. The PLC and END showed a compensatory decrease in expression of inactivating deiodinase (DIO3). Similar compensatory gene expression was observed in fetal KID and LVR with a downregulation of all deiodinases (DIO1, DIO2, DIO3). Minor alterations in the expression of thyroid hormone transporters (SLC16A2 and SLC16A10) were observed in PLC, KID, and LVR. Collectively, MMI crosses the PLC of the late gestation pig, resulting in congenital hypothyroidism, alterations in fetal growth, and compensatory responses within the maternal fetal interface.
   Methimazole crosses the late gestation pig placenta resulting in congenital hypothyroidism, non-allometric fetal growth, and compensatory changes in thyroid hormone metabolites.

AB  - Although liverworts (Marchantiophyta) are postulated to be one of the oldest lineages of land plants, their documented fossil record is sparse. This study describes five new fossil liverwort gametophytes, one of which bears antheridia, from the Paleocene Paskapoo Formation of Alberta, Canada. The thalli are bilaterally symmetrical, with two undissected wings that bear oppositely arranged dorsal lamellae. One specimen is dichotomously branched, and one bears clusters of antheridia along the midrib area of its dorsal surface. These characters are consistent with those of extant Petalophyllum Nees & Gottsche ex Lehm. (Fossombroniales: Petalophyllaceae), and the genus Petalophyllites gen. nov. (Fossombroniales: Petalophyllaceae) is here erected for these fossils. They are the first representatives of Petalophyllaceae and the Fossombroniales from the fossil record. Most of the specimens are in growth position. Their geologic setting and associated fossils indicate that Petalophyllites lived at the margin of a lake or pond in a habitat that may have been intermittently dry, as is also common in extant species of Petalophyllum. The well-preserved thalli and antheridia of these fossils, and their well-documented middle Paleocene age, provide new evidence of liverwort diversification at the dawn of the Cenozoic Era.

AB  - Whether chronic exposure to environmental doses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can lead to neurotoxic effects is still unclear. Hence, the neurotoxic effects of perinatal and juvenile exposure to 16 priority controlled PAHs were investigated. The mice were treated with 0, 0.5, 18.75, 50, 1875 mu g/kg/day of PAHs corresponding to various population exposure concentrations from gestation to postnatal day 60. Urinary 8hydroxy-2 & PRIME;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and hippocampal and cortical neurotransmitter levels were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Typical indicators or outcome of neurotoxicity, including, spatial learning and memory ability, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and dendritic spine density were evaluated via Morris water maze tests, electrophysiological experiments and Golgi-Cox assays, respectively. The results showed that exposure to different levels of PAH could not increase oxidative DNA damage level. Mice exposed to 0.5, 50 and 1875 mu g/kg/day PAHs had significantly longer escape latency than the control group only on the 1st day (p < 0.05). The number of platform crossings and the time spent in target quadrant were similar between the control and the PAHs-exposed mice. Compared with the control mice, only those exposed to 50 mu g/kg/day PAHs had significantly lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 region and dendritic spine density in hippocampal DG region (p < 0.05). Except for serotonin, no significant difference in hippocampal and cortical neurotransmitter concentrations was observed between the control and PAHs-exposed groups. Taken together, perinatal and juvenile exposure to environmental doses of PAHs had no profound effect on spatial learning and memory abilities, hippocampal LTP, dendritic spines density, and neurotransmitter levels. These unexpected findings were quite different from previous in vivo studies which commonly used 2-3 orders of magnitude higher PAHs doses to treat animals. Thus, the environmental dose is a crucial reference for future toxicological research to reveal the actual toxic mechanisms and human health effects of PAHs exposure.

AB  - Although ionic hydrogels have been developed recently for innovative wearable electronics, they necessitate high humidity to diffuse ions in water and fast self-healing, which negatively impacts their performance and stability in ambient conditions (e.g., dry environments). In this study, a series of p- and n-type polymeric ionic gels (PIGs) with different ratios of ionic side chains are synthesized to allow only single-type ions to pass through them. The results demonstrate that the repeatedly stretchable PIGs are transparent, thermally robust up to 125 & DEG;C, and self-healing. Among the series of PIGs, p- and n-type PIGs with 75% ion moieties (P75 and N75) exhibit the optimum ionic conductivity (& sigma;i) (4.1 x 10-4 and 2.7 x 10-4 S cm-1) and ionic Seebeck coefficients (Si) (5.84, and -4.18 mV K-1) under ambient conditions (25 & DEG;C and relative humidity (RH) of 30%), resulting in ZTi values of 1.87 x 10-3 and 1.18 x 10-3. Moreover, the & sigma;i and Si of PIGs are almost consistent under extremely low RH 10%. Accordingly, P(([EMIM+][SPA])0.75-r-MA0.25) (P75) and P(([APTA][TFSI-])0.75-r-MA0.25) (N75) are used to achieve stretchable ionic thermoelectrics (iTEs) with stable operability under ambient conditions (RH of 30%), satisfying all of the requirements. The iTEs with five pairs of p/n couples exhibit a thermovoltage of up to & SIM;0.8 V.
   Nonaqueous ionic thermoelectric (iTE) materials are proposed by synthesizing the p-/n-type polymeric ionic gels (PIGs) (P([EMIM+][SPA]-r-MA) and P([APTA][TFSI-]-r-MA)), respectively. They enable a thermo-diffusion of only single-type ions by immobile charged side chains in PIGs. The p-/n-type PIGs with 75% ion moieties are applied to the iTEs, which exhibit stretchable and self-healing properties under ambient conditions as well as consistent thermal and mechanical stabilities.image

AB  - Manure treatment to recover nutrients presents a great challenge to delocalize nutrients from overloaded areas to those needing such nutrients. To do this, approaches for the treatment of manure have been proposed, and currently, they are mostly under investigation before being upgraded to full scale. There are very few fully operating plants recovering nutrients and, therefore, very few data on which to base environmental and economic studies. In this work, a treatment plant carrying out fullscale membrane technology to treat manure to reduce its total volume and produce a nutrient-rich fraction, i.e., the concentrate, was studied. The concentrate fraction allowed the recovery of 46% of total N and 43% of total P. The high mineral N content, i.e., NNH4/total-N> 91%, allowed matching the REcovered Nitrogen from manURE (RENURE) criteria proposed by the European Commission to allow the potential substitution of synthetic chemical fertilizers in vulnerable areas characterized by nutrient overloading. Life cycle assessment (LCA) performed by using full-scale data indicated that nutrient recovery by the process studied, when compared with the production of synthetic mineral fertilizers, had a lower impact for the 12 categories studied. LCA also suggested precautions which might reduce environmental impacts even more, i.e., covering the slurry to reduce NH3, N2O, and CH4 emissions and reducing energy consumption by promoting renewable production. The system studied presented a total cost of 4.3 euro tons-1 of slurry treated, which is relatively low compared to other similar technologies.

AB  - Tea is the most frequently consumed natural beverage across the world produced with the young leaves and shoots of the evergreen perennial plant Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze. The expanding global appeal of tea is partly attributed to its health-promoting benefits such as anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, anti-allergy, anti -hy-pertension, anti-obesity, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The many advantages of healthy tea intake are linked to its bioactive substances such as tea polyphenols, flavonoids (catechins), amino acids (theanine), alkaloids (caffeine), anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, etc. that are produced through secondary metabolic pathways. Phytohormones regulate secondary metabolite biosynthesis in a variety of plants, including tea. There is a strong hormonal response in the biosynthesis of polyphenols, catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea under control and perturbed environmental conditions. In addition to the impact of preharvest plant hormone manipulation on green tea quality, changes in hormones of postharvest tea also regulate quality-related metabolites in tea. In this review, we discuss the health benefits of major tea constituents and the role of various plant hormones in improving the endogenous levels of these compounds for human health benefits. The fact that the ratio of tea polyphenols to amino acids and the concentrations of tea components are changed by environmental conditions, most notably by climate change-associated variables, the selection and usage of optimal hormone combinations may aid in sustaining tea quality, and thus can be beneficial to both consumers and producers.

AB  - In the context of global climate change, tea plants are at risk from elevating environmental stress factors. Coping with this problem relies upon the understanding of tea plant stress response and its underlying mechanisms. Over the past two decades, research in this field has prospered with the contributions of scientists worldwide. Aiming in providing a comprehensive perspective of the research field related to tea plant stress response, we present a bibliometric analysis of the this area. Our results demonstrate the most studied stresses, global contribution, authorship and collaboration, and trending research topics. We highlight the importance of flavonoid metabolites in tea plant stress response, particularly their role in maintaining redox homeostasis, yield, and adjusting tea quality under stress conditions. Further research on the flavonoid response under various stress conditions can promote the development of cultivation measures, thereby improving stress resistance and tea quality.

AB  - In this study, we explored the capacity for two promising macrophytes, Typha domingensis and Typha elephantina, to be used for the surveillance of contamination by six metals, i.e., Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn, in the mountainous area of Taif City in Saudi Arabia. Regression models were generated in order to forecast the metal concentrations within the plants' organs, i.e., the leaves, flowers, peduncles, rhizomes, and roots. The sediment mean values for pH and the six metals varied amongst the sampling locations for the respective macrophytes, indicating that similar life forms fail to indicate equivalent concentrations. For instance, dissimilar concentrations of the metals under investigation were observed within the organs of the two rooted macrophytes. The research demonstrated that the segregation of metals is a regular event in all the investigated species in which the metal concentrations vary amongst the different plant constituent types. In the current study, T. domingensis and T. elephantina varied in their capacity to absorb specific metals; the bioaccumulation of metals was greater within T. domingensis. The relationships between the observed and model-estimated metal levels, in combination with high R-2 and modest mean averaged errors, offered an appraisal of the goodness of fit of most of the generated models. The t-tests revealed no variations between the observed and model-estimated concentrations of the six metals under investigation within the organs of the two macrophytes, which emphasised the precision of the models. These models offer the ability to perform hazard appraisals within ecosystems and to determine the reference criteria for sediment metal concentration. Lastly, T. domingensis and T. elephantina exhibit the potential for bioaccumulation for the alleviation of contamination from metals.

AB  - Acetyl-triacylglycerols (acetyl-TAG) contain an acetate group in the sn-3 position instead of the long-chain fatty acid present in regular triacylglycerol (TAG). The acetate group confers unique physical properties such as reduced viscosity and a lower freezing point to acetyl-TAG, providing advantages for use as emulsifiers, lubricants, and 'drop-in' biofuels. Previously, the synthesis of acetyl-TAG in the seeds of the oilseed crop camelina (Camelina sativa) was achieved through the heterologous expression of the diacylglycerol acetyltransferase gene EaDAcT, isolated from Euonymus alatus seeds that naturally accumulate high levels of acetyl-TAG. Subsequent work identified a similar acetyltransferase, EfDAcT, in the seeds of Euonymus fortunei, that possesses higher in vitro activity compared to EaDAcT. In this study, the seed-specific expression of EfDAcT in camelina led to a 20 mol% increase in acetyl-TAG levels over that of EaDAcT. Coupling EfDAcT expression with suppression of the endogenous competing enzyme DGAT1 further enhanced acetyl-TAG accumulation, up to 90 mol% in the best transgenic lines. Accumulation of high levels of acetyl-TAG was stable over multiple generations, with minimal effect on seed size, weight, and fatty acid content. Slight delays in germination were noted in transgenic seeds compared to the wild type. EfDAcT transcript and protein levels were correlated during seed development with a limited window of EfDAcT protein accumulation. In high acetyl-TAG producing lines, EfDAcT protein expression in developing seeds did not reflect the eventual acetyl-TAG levels in mature seeds, suggesting that other factors limit acetyl-TAG accumulation.

AB  - Simple Summary In sheep pituitary pars tuberalis tissue, EYA3, TSH beta and CHGA are key genes regulating seasonal reproduction. Their high expression is the characteristic signal under long photoperiods (EYA3, TSH beta) and short photoperiods (CHGA). The epigenetic regulation of microRNAs and LncRNAs on their expression remains unknown. In this study, our results indicated that miR-25 could inhibit the expression of CHGA by specifically binding to its 3 ' UTR region in pituitary cells. Lnc107153 played the role of CeRNA, which can adsorb miR-25 and weaken the inhibitory effect of miR-25 on CHGA expression. Together, these results suggested the epigenetic regulative network of Lnc107153-miR-25-CHGA was involved in sheep seasonal reproduction. Pituitary pars tuberalis (PT) plays an important role as the transmission center in the seasonal reproduction of animals. It helps convert external photoperiod signals into intrinsic seasonal reproduction signals. In sheep PT, specific expression patterns of several genes (including short photoperiod-induced gene CHGA and long photoperiod genes EYA3 and TSH beta) under different photoperiods are crucial characteristics during this signal transduction. Recent studies have revealed the role of epigenetics in regulating the expression of seasonal reproductive key genes. Therefore, we explored whether microRNAs and LncRNAs regulated the expressions of the above key genes. Firstly, the expression of miR-25 and CHGA showed a significant negative correlation in sheep PT. Results of the dual luciferase reporter assay and miR-25 overexpression indicated that miR-25 could inhibit the expression of CHGA by specifically binding to its 3 ' UTR region in pituitary cells. Then, expression negative correlation and dual luciferase reporter analyses were used to screen and identify the candidate LncRNA (Lnc107153) targeted by miR-25. Finally, the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization and Lnc107153 overexpression suggested that Lnc107153 and miR-25 were involved in the epigenetic regulation of CHGA expression. However, the expressions of EYA3 and TSH beta were not regulated by miRNAs. These results will provide new insights into the epigenetic regulatory network of key genes in sheep seasonal reproduction.

AB  - U3Si2 is an advanced fuel candidate due to its relatively high fissile density and attractive thermal properties. Compared to standard UO2 fuel, there are significant data gaps for the thermophysical and thermomechanical properties of U3Si2. Point defect concentrations and mobilities under irradiation govern a number of important fuel performance properties, such as creep and fission gas release. In this work, we utilized density functional theory (DFT) data to inform a cluster dynamics framework to predict point defect concentrations in U3Si2 under irradiation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to examine the contribution of atomic mixing during ballistic cascades to diffusion, as well as the diffusivity of U and Si at grain boundaries. These atomic scale models for diffusivity were then used to inform a creep model based on bulk (Nabarro-Herring) and grain boundary (Coble) diffusional creep, and climb-limited dislocation creep. The model compares well against available experimental data and has been implemented in the BISON fuel performance code. A demonstration case using simple power profiles has been carried out, showing that negligible creep occurs due to the low temperatures experienced by U3Si2 in-reactor, a consequence of its high thermal conductivity.

AB  - Recordings of electric potential changes on plant surfaces have been utilized to identify the components and mechanisms involved in the formation and transmission of systemic signals elicited by stimuli such as herbivory, wounding, or burning. The recorded responses, commonly referred to as slow wave or variation potentials, exhibit striking variability in their waveform. The extent to which this variability is due to differences in experimental procedures or plant biological variability remains unclear. Here, we provide a detailed and robust protocol refined from years of experience in conducting leaf surface potential recordings of Arabidopsis thaliana in response to mechanical wounding. This protocol serves as a comprehensive tutorial covering plant growth, procedures for reproducible mechanical wounding, critical aspects of electrophysiological recordings, and statistical analysis of surface potential recordings. It particularly emphasizes the construction and maintenance of electrodes, placement of the reference or ground electrode, mechanisms for wounding, and data analysis. This protocol aims to promote and facilitate the adoption, standardization, and interoperability of plant surface potential recordings among research groups, thereby increasing the reproducibility and comparability of data within the field.

AB  - Among the etiological agents of acute gastroenterocolitis, group A Rotavirus stands out. Proper hygiene and basic sanitation are the prophylactic means. The present research aimed to carry out the tracking of Rotavirus in waters of rural communities. The collections were carried out in 86 residences, distributed in 16 communities, considering the types of sources: tubular wells, excavated wells, surface springs, cistern with rainwater and springs. The elution of membranes with negative charges was used to obtain viral particles. Extraction of the genetic material and cDNA synthesis were performed according to the rules of the kit used, then qPCR was performed with an Applied Biosystems StepOne((R)) thermal cycler. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata((R)) 16.0, BioEstat((R)) 5.3 and Minitab((R)) 1. Rotavirus was detected in 47 samples (54.6%), however, there was no significant association among municipalities and the presence of Rotavirus. There was a strong association with shallow excavated well OR = 3.59 [1.05-12.28, p = 0.04]. The virus to infect humans and non-human animals, it can infect poultry, cattle and pigs. The presence of Rotavirus in surface water qualifies it as a biological marker of water quality and would occur through fecal contamination in water surface and underground.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of dietary compound antioxidants on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, carcass traits, meat quality, and gut microbiota in finishing pigs. A total of 36 barrows were randomly assigned to 2 treatments with 6 replicates. The pigs were fed with a basal diet (control) or the basal diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg vitamin E, 0.3 mg/kg selenium-enriched yeast, and 20 mg/kg soy isoflavone. Dietary compound antioxidants decreased the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed to gain ratio (F/G) at d 14-28 in finishing pigs (p < 0.05). The plasma total protein, urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were decreased while the plasma glutathione (GSH) to glutathione oxidized (GSSG) ratio (GSH/GSSG) was increased by compound antioxidants (p < 0.05). Dietary compound antioxidants increased loin area and b* value at 45 min, decreased backfat thickness at last rib, and drip loss at 48 h (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of colonic Peptococcus at the genus level was increased and ileal Turicibacter_sp_H121 abundance at the species level was decreased by dietary compound antioxidants. Spearman analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the relative abundance of colonic Peptococcus and plasma MDA concentration and meat drip loss at 48 h. Collectively, dietary supplementation with compound antioxidants of vitamin E, selenium-enrich yeast, and soy isoflavone could improve feed efficiency and antioxidant capacity, and modify the backfat thickness and meat quality through modulation of the gut microbiota community.

AB  - Here we present a nearly complete species-level phylogeny including 23 of the 25 known species of the forestdwelling herbivorous scarab chafer beetle genus Pleophylla (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Sericinae), based on the analysis of 950 nuclear genes (metazoan-level universal single-copy orthologs; mzl-USCOs). DNA sequences were obtained from freshly collected, ethanol-preserved samples and from dried museum specimens by target enrichment or genome shotgun sequencing. Alignment completeness of mzl-USCOs newly obtained here by target DNA enrichment of ethanol samples were very heterogenous and lower (29-62 %) than in Dietz et al. (2023a), while that of sequences recovered from dried samples was even lower (similar to 19 %). Alignment completeness of the sequences obtained from low coverage shotgun sequencing was highest (similar to 92 %), although the average coverage was much lower than for the target enrichment samples. We used the resulting phylogeny to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the group. To estimate a time-calibrated tree, we combined the mzlUSCO data of Pleophylla with a nucleotide alignment from an available transcriptomic dataset of Scarabaeoidea and used two different sets of secondary calibration points. Despite the problems associated with the capture rate of mzl-USCO sequences from museum specimens, we were able to infer a well-resolved phylogeny of the genus Pleophylla that also provided reliable estimates of the phylogenetic position of species for which we had little sequence data. Our study clearly identified South Africa as the geographic origin of Pleophylla. Timing and biogeographic history confirm a persistent fragmentation of forests since the Eocene. The occurrence of only one long-distance dispersal event from southern Africa to the Eastern African Arc even during the Miocene highlights the limited dispersal possibilities for these forest-adapted chafers, which do not seem to have had important northerly range expansions along hypothetical forest corridors during the Pleistocene.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are key factors in the regulation of hypoxia, and can transcriptionally activate multiple genes under hypoxic conditions, thereby initiating large hypoxic stress in the network. The liver and kidneys are important metabolic organs of the body. We assessed the expression of EPO, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and VEGF in liver and kidney tissues of plain and Tibetan sheep using hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, and RT-qPCR. The results showed that EPO, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and VEGF were expressed in tubular epithelial cells, collecting duct epithelial cells, mural epithelial cells, and the glomerular cytoplasm of Tibetan sheep, and their expression was significantly higher in Tibetan sheep than in plain sheep (P<0.05). EPO, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and VEGF are expressed in hepatocytes, interlobular venous endothelial cells, and interlobular bile duct epithelial cells. In plain sheep, positive signals for EPO, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and VEGF were localized mainly in interlobular venous endothelial cells, whereas VEGF and HIF-2 alpha were negatively expressed in interlobular bile duct epithelial cells and positively expressed in EPO and HIF-1 alpha. The differences in EPO, HIF-1 alpha, and HIF-2 alpha in Tibetan sheep were significantly higher than those in plain sheep (P<0.001). In the liver and kidney tissues of Tibetan sheep, EPO was associated with HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and VEGF (P<0.05). RT-qPCR results showed that EPO was not expressed, and HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and VEGF were expressed (P<0.05). The results showed that the expression of EPO, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and VEGF in the kidney and liver of Tibetan sheep was higher than that in of plain sheep. Therefore, EPO, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and VEGF may be involved in the adaptive response of plateau animals, which provides theoretical clarity to further explore the adaptive mechanism of plateau hypoxia in Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Many omnivorous predaceous coccinellids consume both pests like aphids and a range of plant-derived foods including pollen. It is critical to understand how plant-derived food like pollen could affect the fitness and interspecific interactions of predaceous coccinellids. This study investigated the effect of pollen consumption on the development, reproduction and intraguild predation (IGP) of two naturally co-existing aphidophagous ladybirds, Harmonia axyridis and Propylea japonica. Both species were provided with three diets including a moist canola pollen, the aphid Myzus persicae, or moist canola pollen together with aphids. The 1st instar larval of both H. axyridis and P. japonica could not survive and develop to the next larval stage when supplied with water alone. When fed on pollen only, 53 % of the H. axyridis larvae and 25 % of the P. japonica larvae successfully developed to adult. Both species exhibited an elongated development time, shorter larval body length and lower adult body weight than when offered with aphids and the mixed diet. In addition, P. japonica could not reproduce when fed on pollen alone. Interestingly, when pollen was provided as additional food, the overall IGP between larvae of H. axyridis and P. japonica was significantly reduced compared with water control or aphid as food alone. The results of this study indicated that pollen not only supports the survival of H. axyridis and P. japonica when prey is scarce, but also could benefit the co-existence of these species. For future study, it is necessary to investigate how pollinivory could benefit the fitness and biological control potential of H. axyridis and P. japonica under field conditions.

AB  - Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) maintain spermatogenesis through self-renewal and differentiation. The proliferation of SSCs in culture systems can provide a valuable source of germ cells. Several studies have investigated new reproductive technologies, including the production of transgenic animals and recombinant proteins secreted from milk in goats. While studies in other species exist, research on goat SSC culture remains limited. We investigated the impact of different testosterone concentrations on the survival and colonisation of cocultured goat SSCs with Sertoli cells. Cells were isolated from immature goats using two-step enzymatic digestion and enriched by differential exclusion method. DMEM/F12 culture medium containing 1% antibiotic and 5% FBS, supplemented with GDNF (20 ng/mL), EGF, bFGF and LIF (10 ng/mL), was used with different testosterone concentrations (0, 60, 120 and 240 mu g/mL) and cultured for 10 days. SC subpopulations were confirmed using PGP9.5 immunocytochemistry, and the expression of germ cell markers (ID-4, UCHL-1, THY-1, beta 1-integrin, BCL6B, VASA, PLZF and OCT-4) was evaluated through RT-PCR. Alkaline phosphatase activity provided additional SSC presence. The survival rate of SSCs after isolation and the number and area of colonies on Days 4, 7 and 10 were measured using an inverted microscope. The presence of PGP 9.5 antigens and germ cell markers (ID-4, UCHL-1, THY-1, beta 1-integrin, BCL6B, VASA, PLZF and OCT-4) was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively. According to the results, the group with 60 mu g/mL testosterone had the highest number and area of colonies. The number of colonies in the 60 mu g/mL testosterone group was significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05), but no significant difference was observed compared to other groups (p >= 0.05). This study suggests that a low testosterone concentration (60 mu g/mL) is optimal for goat SSC colonisation and viability in coculture with Sertoli cells, potentially leading to advancements in goat reproductive technologies.

AB  - This study investigated the role of nocturnal melatonin secretion in the cognitive performance of diurnal animals. An initial experiment measured the cognitive performance in Indian house crows treated for 11 days with 12 h light at 1.426 W/m(2) (~150 lux) coupled with 12 h of 0.058 W/m(2) (~6-lux) dim light at night (dLAN) or with absolute darkness (0 lux dark night, LD). dLAN treatment significantly decreased midnight melatonin levels and negatively impacted cognitive performance. Subsequently, the role of exogenous melatonin (50 mu g; administered intraperitoneally half an hour before the night began) was assessed on the regulation of cognitive performance in two separate experimental cohorts of crows kept under dLAN; LD controls received vehicle. Exogenous melatonin restored its mid-night levels under dLAN at par with those under LD controls, and improved the cognitive performance, as measured in the innovative problem-solving, and spatial and pattern learning-memory efficiency tests in dLAN-treated crows. There were concurrent molecular changes in the cognition-associated brain areas, namely the hippocampus, nidopallium caudolaterale and midbrain. In particular, the expression levels of genes involved in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (bdnf, dcx, egr1, creb), and dopamine synthesis and signalling (th, drd1, drd2, darpp32, taar1) were restored to LD control levels in crows treated with illuminated nights and received melatonin. These results demonstrate that the maintenance of nocturnal melatonin levels is crucial for an optimal higher-order brain function in diurnal animals in the face of an environmental threat, such as light pollution.

AB  - Bottom-up effects modulated by abiotic factors play an important role in influencing plant-herbivorous insect interactions. Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is an important factor that regulates plant resistance to agricultural arthropod pests. Yet, addressing the bottom-up effects of UV-B radiation on plant-insect interactions by a holistic approach from insect development and behavior to plant metabolome analyses has rarely been documented. This study examined how UV-B radiation influences tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum)-aphid (Myzus persicae) interactions. Tobacco seedlings were irradiated with a UV-B lamp for 14 consecutive days, with a daily exposure time of 2 h (UV2h) and 4 h (UV4h). Here, UV-B radiation was found to enhance the resistance of tobacco plants to M. persicae in terms of the development, body size, population growth, and feeding behavior of the pest. Broad targeted metabolome analyses revealed that the tobacco plants produced higher concentrations of defensive secondary compounds, such as salicylic acid, rutin, kaempferol derivatives, and isochlorogenic acid B, after exposure to UV-B radiation. These results suggest that UV-B radiation enhanced the resistance of tobacco to M. persicae; thus, exposing seedlings to UV-B radiation could be utilized to enhance pest control.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides L. subsp. mongolica 'Shenqiuhong' is an excellent cultivar of sea buckthorn unique to China that is characterised by large fruits, high yield and no fruit drop even in winter, but this cultivar is poorly adapted to areas south of China's northern latitude of 40 degrees. In this study, 358 free-pollinated offspring of 'Shenqiuhong' were evaluated for genetic diversity using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to comprehensively resolve the genetic diversity information of this population. The results of the present study revealed that the 'Shenqiuhong' half-sib family presented high genetic diversity. The 12 pairs of SSR primers amplified a total of 228 clearly identifiable loci, with an average of 19 loci per marker. The mean values of the observed number of alleles (Na), effective number of alleles (Ne), Shannon's information index (I) and polymorphism information content (PIC) of the primers were 2.000, 1.361, 0.359, and 0.588, respectively. The results of the structural analysis, neighbour-joining (NJ) cluster analysis, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were consistent, suggesting that the 358 offspring could be divided into two subgroups. The results provide a theoretical basis and material support for sea buckthorn breeding.

AB  - Salmonella Typhimurium is a highly lethal pathogenic bacterium in weaned piglets, causing significant treatment costs and economic losses in the swine industry. Additionally, due to its ability to induce zoonotic diseases, resulting in harm to humans through the transmission of the pathogen from pork, it presents a serious public health issue. Bacteriophages (phages), viruses that infect specific bacterial strains, have been proposed as an alternative to antibiotics for controlling pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we isolated SLAM_phiST1N3, a phage infecting a multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Typhimurium wild-type strain isolated from diseased pigs. First, comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis revealed that SLAM_phiST1N3 belongs to the Cornellvirus genus. Moreover, utilizing a novel classification approach introduced in this study, SLAM_phiST1N3 was classified at the species level. Host range experiments demonstrated that SLAM_phiST1N3 did not infect other pathogenic bacteria or probiotics derived from pigs or other livestock. While complete eradication of Salmonella was not achievable in the liquid inhibition assay, surprisingly, we succeeded in largely eliminating Salmonella in the FIMM analysis, a gut simulation system using weaned piglet feces. Furthermore, using the C. elegans model, we showcased the potential of SLAM_phiST1N3 to prevent S. Typhimurium infection in living organisms. In addition, it was confirmed that bacterial control could be achieved when phage was applied to Salmonellacontaminated pork. pH and temperature stability experiments demonstrated that SLAM_phiST1N3 can endure swine industry processes and digestive conditions. In conclusion, SLAM_phiST1N3 demonstrates potential environmental impact as a substance for Salmonella prevention across various aspects of the swine industry chain.

AB  - Simple Summary Nectar robbers affect plant fitness in different degrees and in different ways, potentially constituting an important part of pollination interactions. While the negative effects of nectar robbing on plant reproductive success have been widely reported, the positive effects are quite unclear. Hence, our study was designed to assess the effects of nectar robbers on reproductive success of Symphytum officinale. This will help in understanding the evolutionary significance of mutualistic relationships between plants and their visitors. Nectar robbers, which affect plant fitness (directly or indirectly) in different degrees and in different ways, potentially constitute a significant part of mutualistic relationships. While the negative effects of nectar robbing on plant reproductive success have been widely reported, the positive effects remain unknown. The target of our study was to evaluate the effects of nectar robbers on the reproductive success of Symphytum officinale (Boraginaceae). We observed the behavior, species and times of visitors in the field, and we assessed the effect of nectar robbers on corolla abscission rate and time. To test the fitness of corolla abscission, we detected the changes in stigma receptivity, pollen viability, pollen amount and appendage opening size along with the time of flower blossom. The flowering dynamics and floral structure were observed to reveal the mechanism of self-pollination. Finally, pollen deposition seed set rate and fruit set rate were determined to estimate the effect of nectar robbers on reproduction success. We observed 14 species of visitors and 2539 visits in 50 h of observation; 91.7% of them were nectar robbers. The pressure and nectar removal of nectar robbers significantly promoted corolla abscission during a period when pollen grains are viable and the stigma is receptive. In addition, corolla abscission significantly increased the pollen deposition and seed setting rate. Our results demonstrate that nectar robbing contributes to enhancing seed production and positively and indirectly impacts the reproductive success of S. officinale. This mechanism involved the movement of anthers and indirect participation by nectar robbers, which was rarely investigated. Considering the multiple consequences of nectar robbing, understanding the impact of nectar robbers on plant reproduction is essential to comprehend the evolutionary importance of relationships between plants and their visitors.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides (H. rhamnoides) is the primary tree species known for its ecological and economic benefits in arid and semi-arid regions. Understanding the response of H. rhamnoides roots to drought stress is essential for promoting the development of varieties. One-year-old Yulu H. rhamnoides was utilized as the experimental material, and three water gradients were established: control (CK), moderate (T1) and severe (T2), over a period of 120 days. The phenotypic traits and physiological indies were assessed and analyzed, while the roots were subjected by RNA-Seq transcriptome and Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) proteome analysis. Drought stress significantly reduced the plant height, ground diameter, root biomass and superoxide dismutase activity; however, the main root length increased. In comparison with CK, a total of 5789 and 5594 differential genes, as well as 63 and 1012 differential proteins, were identified in T1 and T2, respectively. The combined analysis of transcriptome and proteome showed that the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) associated with T1, T2 and CK was 28 and 126, respectively, with 7 and 36 genes achieving effective KEGG annotation. In T1 and T2, the differential genes were significantly enriched in the plant hormone signal transduction pathway, but there was no significant enrichment in the protein expression profile. In T2, 38 plant hormone signal transduction function genes and 10 peroxisome related genes were identified. With the increase of drought stress, the combined expression of DEGs and DEPs increased. Yulu H. rhamnoides may allocate more resources toward CAT while simultaneously decreasing SOD and POD to mitigate the oxidative stress induced by drought. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying plant hormone signal transduction and peroxisome-related genes in the roots of H. rhamnoides were discussed in greater detail.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that activated astrocytes in the hypothalamus could disrupt GnRH secretion in offspring after maternal di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) exposure, indicating that the effect of DBP on astrocyte activation and crosstalk between astrocytes and neurons is still worthy of further investigation. In this study, pregnant mice were intragastrically administered DBP dissolved in corn oil from gestational days (GD) 12.5-21.5. Maternal DBP exposure resulted in hippocampal astrocyte activation, abnormal synaptic formation, and reduced autonomic and exploratory behavior in offspring on postnatal day (PND) 22. Further studies identified that mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) in-duced astrocyte activation and proliferation by activating the AKT/NF-kappa B/IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, upregulated thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) in activated astrocytes regulated synaptic-related protein expres-sion. This study highlights the neurotoxicity of maternal DBP exposure to offspring, which provides new insights into identifying potential molecular targets for the treatment of diseases related to neurological development disorders in children.

AB  - The diet in early life is essential for the growth and intestinal health later in life. However, beneficial effects of a diet enriched in branched short-chain fatty acids (BSCFAs) for infants are ambiguous. This study aimed to develop a novel fermented protein food, enriched with BSCFAs and assess the effects of dry and wet ferment products on young pig development, nutrient absorption, intestinal barrier function, and gut microbiota and metabolites. A total of 18 young pigs were randomly assigned to three groups. The dry corn gluten-wheat bran mixture (DFCGW) and wet corn gluten-wheat bran mixture (WFCGW) were utilized as replacements for 10% soybean meal in the basal diet. Our results exhibited that the WFCGW diet significantly increased the growth performance of young pigs, enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins, and regulated associated cytokines expression in the colonic mucosa. Simultaneously, the WFCGW diet led to elevated levels of colonic isobutyric and isovaleric acid, as well as the activation of GPR41 and GPR109A. Furthermore, more potential probiotics including Lactobacillus, Megasphaera, and Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group were enriched in the WFCGW group and positively associated with the beneficial metabolites such as 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Differential metabolite KEGG pathway analysis suggested that WFCGW might exert gut health benefits by modulating tryptophan metabolism. In addition, the WFCGW diet significantly increased ghrelin concentrations in serum and hypothalamus and promoted the appetite of young pigs by activating hypothalamic NPY/AGRP neurons. This study extends the knowledge of BSCFAs and provides a reference for the fermented food application in the infant diet.

AB  - The fossil record of macroscelidean mammals is notoriously patchy, with a significant spatial and temporal gap separating faunas from the early Oligocene localities of northern Africa and the early Miocene localities of eastern and southern Africa. Here we describe fossil macroscelideans representing Myohyracinae and Rhynchocyoninae recovered from a rift-fill sequence of richly fossiliferous sandstones in the late Oligocene Nsungwe Formation in the Rukwa Rift Basin of southwestern Tanzania. Radiometrically dated to 25.2 Ma, a new Palaeogene myohyracine taxon (Rukwasengi butleri) is represented by a partial maxilla (RRBP 05409) preserving a lightly worn M2-M3. The M2 exhibits a less hypsodont and mesiodistally elongate morphology than the early Miocene Myohyrax oswaldi, and the three-rooted M3 exhibits a tiny mesially positioned fossette. A new rhynchocyonine (Oligorhynchocyon songwensis) is represented by specimens more brachyodont than the early Miocene Miorhynchocyon. Taken together these finds document a rare window into macroscelidean evolutionary history with diversification of the group near the Palaeogene-Neogene Transition (PNT). Continued exploration offers a refined perspective on mid-Cenozoic faunal and ecosystem dynamics on continental Africa, expanding opportunities for recognising trends in palaeobiological diversity across habitat types and through time.

AB  - Concurrent exposure to cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) is prevalent in the environment, but information on the long-term impacts of complex Cd-Pb exposure on herbivorous insects, especially at low doses, is scant. We studied the effects of complex Cd-Pb exposure (4.06 mg/kg Cd and 12.5 mg/kg Pb) on the growth and food utilization of the herbivorous insect Spodoptera litura for 10 continuous generations. Cd or Pb ingestion, excretion and accumulation by insect at the different developmental stages was determined for ten generations. The weighted scores calculated by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) on the basis of the parameters of survival, growth and food utilization indicated that complex Cd-Pb exposure had positive impacts on the insects, regardless of generations. Compared with Cd (4.06 mg/kg Cd) and Pb (12.5 mg/kg Pb) alone, complex Cd-Pb exposure showed antagonistic interactions. After exposure to complex Cd-Pb, although larvae significantly increased heavy metal uptake along with the elevated ECD and ECI, insects enhanced heavy metal excretion via the feces and puparium; consequently, heavy metal accumulation in the insect body significantly decreased. With increasing generations, the positive impacts of complex Cd-Pb stress on insects became increasingly obvious, and the uptake of Cd or Pb decreased while the excretion of Cd or Pb increased, which demonstrated that insect tolerance to Cd-Pb exposure at low concentrations increased over generations.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel. is an important woody oil species; however, the shortage of rapid and industrialized seedling culture is a large constraint on the development of the tea oil industry. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is one of the main powerful biotechnological tools for plant mass regeneration, but the largely unknown SE in C. oleifera limits the scale production of clonal plants. In this study, we described a high-efficiency SE system via direct and indirect pathways in C. oleifera and investigated the effect of genotype, explant age and phytohormones on SE. In the direct pathway, somatic embryos were highly induced from immature seeds 220 days after full blossom, and the development of embryoids was achieved with a combination of 0.19 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 0.05 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ). In the indirect pathway, embryogenic calli were induced from the same explants in medium containing 1.5 mg/L 2,4-D, while 0.75 mg/L 2,4-D treatment led to high proliferation rates for embryogenic calli. The addition of 0.19 mg/L 2,4-D alone stimulated the production of globular embryos while causing a 75% loss of the induction rate in the heart embryo stage. Upon transfer of the globular embryos to phytohormone-free medium, an optimal induction rate of 62.37% from globular embryos to cotyledonary embryos was obtained. These data suggest that the subsequent differentiation process after the globular embryo stage in ISE is more similar to an endogenous phytohormones-driven process. Mature embryos germinated to produce intact plantlets on half-strength MS basal medium with a regeneration rate of 63.67%. Histological analysis confirmed the vascular bundle isolation of embryoids from the mother tissue. We further studied the different varieties and found that there were no significant genotype differences for SE induction efficiency in C. oleifera. Thus, we established a high-efficiency induction system for direct and indirect somatic embryogenesis (ISE) in C. oleifera and regenerated intact plantlets via SE, not organogenesis. ISE has a more complicated induction and regulatory mechanism than direct somatic embryogenesis. The improved protocol of SE would benefit mass propagation and genetic manipulation in C. oleifera.

AB  - High serum estrogen concentrations are associated with asthma development and severity, suggesting a link between estradiol and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). 17 beta-estradiol (E2) has non-genomic effects via Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms; however, its effect on the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCA1 and 4) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is unknown. Hence, in the present study, we aim to demonstrate if E2 favors AHR by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in guinea pig airway smooth muscle (ASM) through a mechanism involving Ca2+-ATPases. In guinea pig ASM, Ca2+ microfluorometry, muscle contraction, and Western blot were evaluated. Then, we performed molecular docking analysis between the estrogens and Ca2+ ATPases. In tracheal rings, E2 produced AHR to carbachol. In guinea pig myocytes, acute exposure to physiological levels of E2 modified the transient Ca2+ peak induced by caffeine to a Ca2+ plateau. The incubation with PMCA inhibitors (lanthanum and carboxyeosin, CE) partially reversed the E2-induced sustained plateau in the caffeine response. In contrast, cyclopiazonic acid (SERCA inhibitor), U-0126 (an inhibitor of ERK 1/2), and choline chloride did not modify the Ca2+ plateau produced by E2. The mitochondrial uniporter activity and the capacitative Ca2+ entry were unaffected by E2. In guinea pig ASM, Western blot analysis demonstrated PMCA1 and PMCA4 expression. The results from the docking modeling demonstrate that E2 binds to both plasma membrane ATPases. In guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle, inhibiting the PMCA with CE, induced hyperresponsiveness to carbachol. 17 beta-estradiol produces hyperresponsiveness by inhibiting the PMCA in the ASM and could be one of the mechanisms responsible for the increase in asthmatic crisis in women.

AB  - The amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are interconnected regions that serve as key nodes in brain circuits supporting social and affective behaviors. An important question that has come into focus is whether these regions also play a fundamental role in responding to novelty. One possibility is that these regions are important for discriminating novel from familiar stimuli. An alternative possibility is that these regions contribute to affective responses to stimuli in novelty-based tasks. For example, the amygdala and OFC could contribute to assessing novel stimuli as being threatening or previously selected stimuli as having reward value. The present study tested rhesus macaque monkeys with damage to the amygdala or OFC, along with sham-operated control monkeys, across six variants of novelty-based memory tasks. The results showed that monkeys with damage to the amygdala or OFC performed better overall than control monkeys across the tasks. The results indicated that neither region was essential for discriminating novel from familiar stimuli. Instead, the findings suggested that the improved performance observed in novelty-based tasks following damage to these regions was more likely attributable to influences on affect.

AB  - Main conclusion Based on transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and mutant tomato plants, ARPC1 was found to be important for trichome formation and development and it plays a key role in terpene synthesis. Trichomes are protruding epidermal cells in plant species. They function as the first defense layer against biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite the essential role of tomato trichomes in defense against herbivores, the understanding of their development is still incomplete. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify genes involved in trichome formation and morphology and terpene synthesis, using transcriptomic techniques. To achieve this, we examined leaf morphology and compared the expression levels of some putative genes involved in trichome formation between wild-type (WT) and hairless-3 (hl-3) tomato mutant. The hl-3 plants displayed swollen and distorted trichomes and reduced trichome density (type I and IV) and terpene synthesis compared with that of the WT plants. Gene expression analysis showed that Actin-Related Protein Component1 (ARPC1) was expressed more highly in the WT than in the hl-3 mutant, indicating its critical role in trichome morphology and density. Additionally, the expression of MYC1 and several terpene synthase genes (TPS9, 12, 20), which are involved in type VI trichome initiation and terpene synthesis, was lower in the hl-3 mutant than in the WT plants. Moreover, transformation of the hl-3 mutant with WT ARPC1 restored normal trichome structure and density, and terpene synthesis. Structural and amino acid sequence analysis showed that there was a missplicing mutation in the hl-3 mutant, which was responsible for the abnormal trichome structure and density, and impaired terpene synthesis. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrated that ARPC1 is involved in regulating trichome structure and terpene synthesis in tomato.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is hypothesized to underlie "replay"of salient experience during hippocampal sharpwave/ripple (SWR)-based ensemble activity and to facilitate systems-level memory consolidation coordinated by SWRs and cortical sleep spindles. It remains unclear how molecular changes at synapses contribute to experience-induced modification of network function. The synaptic protein KIBRA regulates plasticity and memory. To determine the impact of KIBRA-regulated plasticity on circuit dynamics, we recorded in vivo neural activity from wild-type (WT) mice and littermates lacking KIBRA and examined circuit function before, during, and after novel experience. In WT mice, experience altered population activity and oscillatory dynamics in a manner consistent with incorporation of new information content in replay and enhanced hippocampal-cortical communication. While baseline SWR features were normal in KIBRA conditional knockout (cKO) mice, experience-dependent alterations in SWRs were absent. Furthermore, intra-hippocampal and hippocampal-cortical communication during SWRs was disrupted following KIBRA deletion. These results indicate molecular mechanisms that underlie network-level adaptations to experience.

AB  - This study investigated the performance of a novel coagulant-aided biomass filtration for rapid pretreatment of biogas slurry to prevent subsequent membrane concentration from severe fouling for maximum resource recovery. Potassium aluminum sulfate (PAS) and chitosan were used as representative inorganic and organic coagulant, respectively. Cornstalk was used as the biomass media. Results show that blending PAS with cornstalk as filtration media could increase the removal of suspended solids (SS), organic matter, and nutrients from biogas slurry in comparison with single PAS coagulation or cornstalk filtration. Thus, PAS-aided cornstalk filtration could significantly reduce membrane fouling to double water flux in subsequent ultrafiltration of biogas slurry. Compared to PAS, chitosan with polyacrylamide led to more SS sedimentation in coagulation of biogas slurry. Nevertheless, chitosan has low dissolution and could be flushed to permeate when mixed with cornstalk to compromise the filtration performance. After biogas slurry pretreatment, the spent PAS-aided cornstalk was highly compostable with rapid temperature increase to above 60 degrees C within three days. Heavy metals and antibiotics retained from biogas slurry could be effectively passivated and removed in composting, respectively. As such, spent PAS-aided cornstalk media could be transformed to mature compost with seed germination index of >120%. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ants use environmental volatiles to forage, and are attracted by the odors of food. Some species of ants have been reported as natural enemies of the coffee borer Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). In coffee trees, it is also possible to find lacewings, that act on the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella (Gu & eacute;rin-M & egrave;neville & Perrottet) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae). The objective of this work was to evaluate, in the laboratory, the attractiveness of Crematogaster quadriformis Roger (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) to berries at different stages of maturation, in addition to evaluating its role on H. hampei, and its interference on Chrysoperla externa (Hagen) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). The olfactory combinations consisted of unripe or ripe coffee berries, infested or not by H. hampei. In each combination, 40 responses were obtained. For the predation experiment, a colony of C. quadriformis was used for each replication. The attack preference of the ant was evaluated on lacewing first-instar larvae/eggs vs. coffee borer adults. Ants were attracted to coffee berries and showed a preference for ripe over unripe berries (p < 0.01). However, they did not show preference between infested and uninfested berries (p > 0.05). Ants showed preference for attacking coffee borer adults over eggs (p < 0.05) and lacewing larvae (p < 0.01). However, the probability of attacking only the coffee borer is the same as attacking both the coffee borer and lacewing larvae and both coffee borer and lacewing eggs (p > 0.05). Therefore, even though C. quadriformis has potential as a natural enemy of H. hampei, it also performs intraguild predation on C. externa.

AB  - Background Wound healing can result in various outcomes, including hypertrophic scar (HTS). Pigs serve as models to study wound healing as their skin shares physiologic similarity with humans. Yorkshire (Yk) and Duroc (Dc) pigs have been used to mimic normal and abnormal wound healing, respectively. The reason behind this differential healing phenotype was explored here. Methods Excisional wounds were made on Dc and Yk pigs and were sampled and imaged for 98 days. PCR arrays were used to determine differential gene expression. Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) scores were given. Re-epithelialization was analyzed. H&E, Mason's trichrome, and immunostains were used to determine cellularity, collagen content, and blood vessel density, respectively. Results Yk wounds heal to a "port wine" HTS, resembling scarring in Fitzpatrick skin types (FST) I-III. Dc wounds heal to a dyspigmented, non-pliable HTS, resembling scarring in FST IV-VI. Gene expression during wound healing was differentially regulated versus uninjured skin in 40/80 genes, 15 of which differed between breeds. Yk scars had a higher VSS score at all time points. Yk and Dc wounds had equivalent re-epithelialization, collagen disorganization, and blood vessel density. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that Dc and Yk pigs can produce HTS. Wound creation and healing were consistent among breeds, and differences in gene expression were not sufficient to explain differences in resulting scar phenotype. Both pig breeds should be used in animal models to investigate novel therapeutics to provide insight into a treatment's effectiveness on various skin types.

AB  - Alfalfa (Medicago satiua L.) is a major forage legume in semi-arid regions such as North China Plain and is the material foundation for the development of herbivorous animal husbandry. How to improve the yield of alfalfa per unit area from a technical perspective and achieve high-yield cultivation of alfalfa is the focus of research by scientific researchers and producers. To evaluate the effects of irrigation and P fertilization as well as the P residual effect on alfalfa yield, we conducted a six-year (2008-2013) field experiment in loamy sand soil. There were four irrigation levels (W0: 0 mm, W1: 25 mm, W2: 50 mm, W3: 75 mm per time, four times a year) and three P fertilization levels (F0: 0 kg P2O5 ha(-1), F1: 52.5 kg P2O5 ha(-1), F2: 105 kg P2O5 ha(-1) per time, twice a year). The highest dry matter yield (DMY) was obtained in the W2F2 treatment, with an annual mean of 13,961.1 kg ha(-1). During 2009-2013, the DMY of first and second-cut alfalfa increased significantly with increasing irrigation levels, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in fourth-cut alfalfa. Regression analysis revealed that the optimal amount of water supply (sum of seasonal irrigation and rainfall during the growing season) to obtain maximum DMY was between 725 and 755 mm. Increasing P fertilization contributed to significantly higher DMY in each cut of alfalfa during 2010-2013 but not in the first two growing seasons. The mean annual DMY of W0F2, W1F2, W2F2, and W3F2 treatments was 19.7%, 25.6%, 30.7%, and 24.1% higher than that of W0F0 treatment, respectively. When no P fertilizer was applied in F2 plots in 2013, soil availability and total P concentrations, annual alfalfa DMY, and plant nutrient contents did not differ significantly compared with those in fertilized F2 plots. Results of this study suggest that moderate irrigation with lower annual P fertilization is a more environmentally sound management practice while maintaining alfalfa productivity in the semi-arid study area.

AB  - Coxiella burnetii is an important zoonotic pathogen of worldwide distribution that can infect a wide range of wild and domestic species. The European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) can play a role as a reservoir for this bacterium in certain epidemiological scenarios, but, to date, a very limited numbers of large-scale serosurveys have been conducted for this species worldwide. Although exposure in hare species has also been described, C. burnetii in Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) has never been assessed. Here, we aimed to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with C. burnetii exposure in wild lagomorphs in the Mediterranean ecosystems of southern Spain. Between the 2018/2019 and 2021/2022 hunting seasons, blood samples from 638 wild lagomorphs, including 471 wild rabbits and 167 Iberian hares, were collected from 112 hunting grounds distributed across all eight provinces of Andalusia (southern Spain). The overall apparent individual seroprevalence was 8.9% (57/638; 95% CI: 6.8-11.4). Antibodies against C. burnetii were found in 11.3% (53/471; 95% CI: 8.4-14.1) of the wild rabbits and 2.4% (4/167; 95% CI: 0.1-4.7) of the Iberian hares. Seropositive animals were detected for 16 (14.3%; 95% CI: 7.8-20.8) of the 112 hunting grounds tested and in all the hunting seasons sampled. A generalized estimating equations model showed that the geographical area (western Andalusia) and presence of sheep were risk factors potentially associated with C. burnetii exposure in wild lagomorphs. A statistically significant spatial cluster (p < 0.001) was identified in the south-west of Andalusia. Our results provide evidence of moderate, endemic and heterogeneous circulation of C. burnetii in wild lagomorph populations in Spanish Mediterranean ecosystems. Risk-based strategies for integrative surveillance programs should be implemented in these species to reduce the risk of transmission of the bacterium to sympatric species, including humans.

AB  - Nanoplastics (NPs), the emerging contaminants in recent years, widely distributed in the environment and are bioaccumulated and biomagnified in organisms through food chain. A growing number of studies have detected plastic particulates in human placenta and blood. However, few studies have focused on their effects during human pregnancy. Herein, human trophoblast HTR-8/Svneo cells were used to evaluate the effects and the possible mechanism of 100-nm polystyrene NPs on placental trophoblasts at the maternal-fetal interface. The results showed that NPs entered the trophoblastic cytoplasm, decreased cell viability, caused cell cycle arrest, reduced the cell migration and invasion abilities, increased level of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, global transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on HTR-8/Svneo cells with or without 100 mu g/mL PS-NP exposure for 24 h. A total of 344 differentially expressed genes were detected. The gene functions for regulation of leukocyte differentiation, response to stimulus, cell cycle, apoptotic process, and cell adhesion were enriched. Thyroid hormone, Hippo, TGF-beta and FoxO signaling pathways were activated. Collectively, our data provided evidences for the adverse consequences of NPs on the biological functions of trophoblasts, which provided new insights into the potential trophoblast toxicity of NPs in mammals.

AB  - Schizophrenia impacts about 1 % of the global population, with clozapine (CLZ) being a critical treatment for refractory cases despite its limitations in effectiveness and adverse effects. Therefore, the search for more effective treatments remains urgent. Light treatment (LT) recognized for enhancing cognition and mood, presents a promising complementary approach. This study investigated the effects of CLZ and LT on cognitive impairments in a sub-chronic MK-801 induced schizophrenia mouse model. Results showed that both CLZ and CLZ + LT treatment elevate cognitive performance of sub-chronic MK-801 treated mice in serial behavioral tests over two months. Histological analysis revealed increased dendritic spine density and branching, and synaptic repair in the hippocampus with CLZ and CLZ + LT interventions. Furthermore, both treatments increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus, likely contributing to cognitive amelioration in MK-801 treated mice. Additionally, BrdU labeling revealed that CLZ + LT further enhances neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) and lateral ventricle (LV) of sub-chronic MK-801 treated mice. These findings may have implications for the development of noninvasive and adjunctive treatment strategies aimed at alleviating cognitive impairments and improving functional outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia.

AB  - The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important leguminous crop providing low-cost protein in developing countries worldwide. Insect pests are the main threats to common bean production, and this article focuses on the soybean looper (SL) Chrysodeixis includens (Walker, 1858) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), which feeds on leaves and pods. The recurrent use of synthetic chemicals may lead to pest resistance. Genetically resistant plants may diminish their use. Thus, the objective was to study common bean genotypes' resistance toward SL. The plants were grown in greenhouse conditions. The biology, fertility life table, oviposition preference and free-choice feeding preference were analyzed. Phenol and flavonoid content were assessed in leaves using a biology assay. Uirapuru genotype negatively affected C. includens biology and reproduction. Tangara genotype favored these parameters. Genotypes Quero-Quero, Nhambu, Corujinha, Andorinha, ANFC 9, Siriri, BRS Radiante and Verdao were more attractive for third-instar larvae. Negative correlations between phenolic and flavonoid compounds with survival rate (from egg to adult) rate were found. Common bean genotypes with dark leaves are less preferred for oviposition.

AB  - Background Grapevine (Vitis) is one of the world's most valuable fruit crops, but insect herbivory can decrease yields. Understanding insect herbivory resistance is critical to mitigating these losses. Vitis labrusca, a wild North American grapevine species, has been leveraged in breeding programs to generate hybrid grapevines with enhanced abiotic and biotic stress resistance, rendering it a valuable genetic resource for sustainable viticulture. This study assessed the resistance of V. labrusca acc. 'GREM4' and Vitis vinifera cv. 'PN40024' grapevines to Popillia japonica (Japanese beetle) herbivory and identified morphological and genetic adaptations underlying this putative resistance. Results 'GREM4' displayed greater resistance to beetle herbivory compared to 'PN40024' in both choice and no-choice herbivory assays spanning periods of 30 min to 19 h. 'GREM4' had significantly higher average leaf trichome densities than 'PN40024' and beetles preferred to feed on the side of leaves with fewer trichomes. When leaves from each species that specifically did not differ in trichome densities were fed on by beetles, significantly less leaf area was damaged in 'GREM4' (3.29mm(2)) compared to 'PN40024' (9.80mm(2)), suggesting additional factors beyond trichomes contributed to insect herbivory resistance in 'GREM4'. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed 'GREM4' exhibited greater constitutive (0 h) expression of defense response and secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes compared to 'PN40024', indicative of heightened constitutive defenses. Upon herbivory, 'GREM4' displayed a greater number of differentially expressed genes (690) compared to 'PN40024' (502), suggesting a broader response. Genes up-regulated in 'GREM4' were enriched in terpene biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, phytohormone signaling, and disease defense-related functions, likely contributing to heighted insect herbivory defense, while genes differentially expressed in 'PN40024' under herbivory were enriched in xyloglucan, cell wall formation, and calcium ion binding. The majority of genes implicated in insect herbivory defense were orthologs with specific expression patterns in 'GREM4' and 'PN40024', but some paralogous and genome-specific genes also likely contributed to conferring resistance. Conclusions Our findings suggest that 'GREM4' insect herbivory resistance was attributed to a combination of factors, including trichomes and unique constitutive and inducible expression of genes implicated in terpene, flavonoid, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as pathogen defense.

TI  - SIN3A Regulates Porcine Early Embryonic Development by Modulating CCNB1 Expression

KW  - SIN3A
KW  - CCNB1
AB  - SIN3A is the central scaffold protein of the SIN3/histone deacetylase (HDAC) transcriptional repressor complex. SIN3A participates in the mouse preimplantation development by fine-tuning HDAC1 expression. However, it remains unresolved if this functional significance of SIN3A was conserved in other mammals. Herein, RNA-seq results show a large amount of SIN3A mRNA is present in oocytes and early embryos prior to embryonic genome activation and a low amount thereafter, suggesting a maternal origin of SIN3A in pigs, cattle, mice, and humans. Interestingly, immunofluorescence data show that SIN3A protein level peaks at four-cell stage in pigs compared with morula stage in cattle. SIN3A depletion in early embryos causes a developmental arrest at two-cell stage in pigs but does not affect bovine early embryonic development. In contrast with mouse data, SIN3A depletion results in only a slight decrease and even no difference in HDAC1 expression in porcine and bovine early embryos, respectively. In addition, HDAC1 knockdown does not cause two-cell block but leads to a reduced blastocyst rate. By using unbiased RNA-seq approach, we found that Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) transcript level is dramatically reduced. Moreover, CCNB1 knockdown results in a similar phenotype as SIN3A depletion. Injection of exogenous CCNB1 mRNA into SIN3A-depleted embryos could partly rescue embryonic development to pass two-cell stage. In conclusion, our results indicate SIN3A plays an essential role in porcine early embryonic development, which probably involves the regulation of CCNB1 expression.

AB  - The impact of antibiotic therapy on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and its relationship to gut microbiota remains unclear. This study investigated changes in ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and gut microbial composition following tilmicosin administration in pigs. Thirty pigs were randomly divided into control (CK), low-concentration (0.2 g/kg; L), and high-concentration (0.4 g/kg; H) groups. Tilmicosin concentration in manure peaked on day 16 of dosing and dropped below detectable levels by day 13 of the withdrawal period. While tilmicosin did not significantly affect the total abundance of macrolide resistance genes (MRGs) (p > 0.05), it significantly increased the abundance of the multidrug resistance gene tolC in the H group compared with the L and CK groups during the withdrawal period (p < 0.05). This increase was associated with a coincidental rise in the abundance of MGEs (e.g., int1 and int2) and the growth of potential tolC-hosting bacteria such as Paenalcaligenes and Proteiniclasticum. Redundancy analysis showed gut microbial composition as the primary driver of MRG abundance, with MGEs, tilmicosin concentration, and manure physicochemical properties playing secondary roles. These findings suggest that high-dose tilmicosin may alter the gut microbiota and promote ARG spread via MGE-mediated transfer.

AB  - Dex is a drug commonly used as an immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agent in humans and animals. GCs have a profound impact on melatonin expression and biological rhythm. However, the effect of chronic exposure to Dex on melatonin secretion and biological clock gene expression in ruminants is still unclear. Ten goats were randomly divided into two groups: the control group was injected with saline, and the Dex-treated group was intramuscularly injected daily for 21 d with 0.2 mg/kg Dex. The rhythm of melatonin secretion in the plasma was disturbed in the Dex group, and the plasma and colon levels of melatonin were lower in the Dex group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Dex leads to a significant decrease in the expression of Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), a key melatonin synthase, in the pineal gland and colon. Detecting intestinal leakage-related indices showed that diamine oxidase (DAO) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content increased significantly in the Dex group (p < 0.05). We also detected genes associated with biological rhythms in the plasma. In the control group, the five tested genes showed circadian rhythms, but the circadian rhythms of Clock, Cry1, Cry2, and Per2 were abolished or blunted by the Dex (p < 0.05). Protein levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 in the colon changed significantly (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the above experimental results show that chronic exposure to Dex leads to the disorder of the circadian rhythms of melatonin secretion and clock genes.

AB  - To better understand the population dynamics and dispersal ability of insect species, it is often helpful to derive a life table containing fundamental demographic data. The aim of this study was to determine a life table for the predatory necrophagous species Synthesiomyia nudiseta (van der Wulp, 1883) on a pig liver diet and under controlled laboratory conditions (29.5 +/- 2.5 degrees C, RH 50 +/- 15%, and a photoperiod of 12:12). This species has medical and veterinary importance and its distribution extends in tropical and subtropical areas and now it has been established in the southwestern of Europe. The mean adult longevity was 36.18 +/- 2.06 d and the net reproduction rate, R, was 27.65 offspring/female, the mean generation time, T, was 22.09 d, the finite rate of increase, lambda, was 1.16 d(-1), and the intrinsic rate of increase, r, was 0.15 d(-1). These results indicate that S. nudiseta cannot be considered an r-strategist as the most common synanthropic necrophagous blowflies due to its predatory behavior; however, its invasive and colonist abilities are discussed. This is the first life table study of this species from Palearctic region to analyze the effect of its dispersal ability.

AB  - (1) Background: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (EUS-RFA) is an alternative treatment for pancreatic tumors. Currently, EUS-RFA has been trialled to treat hepatic tumors. However, little has been reported about optimal settings for EUS-RFA in patients with hepatic tumors. We evaluated the ablation effect after in vivo RFA using a new EUS-RFA electrode in a pig model. (2) Methods Four pigs were used for the in vivo test. The in vivo testing was divided into two tests based on the length of the RFA electrode (0.5, 0.7, 1 or 1.5 cm), the ablation power (30 W or 50 W), and the ablation time (10 or 15 s). In test one, ablation effect was evaluated based on the electrode length and power. In test two, ablation effect was assessed based on power and time. (3) Results: In test one, the ablation width and depth correlated with the length of the electrode and power (0.5 cm, 10 W, 10 s: width 0.46 cm, depth 0.65 cm vs. 1.5 cm, 75 W, 10 s: width 0.77 cm, depth 1.80 cm). In test two, ablation width and depth were similar when RFA was set at 1.5cm, 50 W, and 10 s or 1 cm, 30 W, and 15 s (0.65 cm, 1.14 cm vs. 0.65cm, 1.26 cm). (4) Conclusions: The relationship between electrode length, ablation power, and ablation time, and the resulting ablation effect in pig livers suggest that EUS-RFA produces effective ablation while minimizing thermal injury.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine circovirus (PCV2 and PCV3) currently stands as the primary viral agent afflicting intensive pig farming, inflicting substantial economic losses on farms. This study endeavored to explore the prevalence and genetic diversity of PCVs that have circulated in Guangdong province in recent years, a prominent hub for pig production within China. In the current investigation, the prevalence of PCV2, PCV3, and PCV2/3 co-infection was found to be 56.48%, 8.81%, and 8.81%, respectively. Nonetheless, no evidence of PCV4 presence materialized in the course of this study. Moreover, the co-occurrence of PCV2 with classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), pseudo-rabies virus (PRV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged as a common phenomenon, with the co-infection rate with PEDV (23.85%) surpassing that of PRV (9.17%), PRRSV (18.35%), or CSFV (0.92%). Subsequently, a detailed analysis of the Cap protein sequence of the PCV2 and PCV3 isolates unveiled several high-frequency mutation sites within the epitope regions. Collectively, this study imparts valuable insights into the prevalence and evolution of PCV2 and PCV3 in China between 2017 and 2023, thereby contributing to the formulation of efficacious prevention and control strategies.Abstract Porcine circovirus disease poses a significant threat to the pig farming industry. Globally, four genotypes of porcine circovirus are circulating, with porcine circovirus type 2 and 3 (PCV2 and PCV3) being most strongly associated with clinical manifestations. The recently discovered porcine circovirus type 4 (PCV4) exhibits clinical symptoms resembling porcine dermatitis nephropathy syndrome. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PCVs in Guangdong province, China. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 193 samples collected from 83 distinct pig farms during the period of 2017-2023. A conventional PCR was employed to investigate the presence of PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4. Among the samples, 56.48%, 8.81%, and 8.81% tested positive for PCV2, PCV3, and PCV2/3 co-infection, respectively. Interestingly, PCV4 was not detected. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 80 PCV2 isolates and 7 PCV3 isolates. A phylo-genetic analysis revealed that 12 strains belonged to PCV2a, 8 strains belonged to PCV2b, and 60 strains belonged to PCV2d, indicating the prevailing presence of PCV2d in Guangdong province, China. Furthermore, two PCV3 isolates were classified as PCV3a and five strains as PCV3b. Notably, an in-depth analysis of the Cap protein sequence of the PCV2 and PCV3 isolates identified high-frequency mutation sites located in predicted epitope regions. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and evolution of PCV2 and PCV3 during the period of 2017-2023 in Guangdong province, China, thereby contributing to the development of effective prevention and control measures.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been widely adapted for blackwater treatment, however, the effect of water-conserving toilet generated blackwater on the AD process is still unknown. In this study, the anaerobic digestion process of dry toilet generated blackwater was investigated by means of a biomethane potential test. It was demonstrated that anaerobic digestion was inhibited and then adapted because of a high total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) level (3673.3 mg/L). The start-up period was 14.04 days and the biomethane potential of dry toilet blackwater was 402.36 mLCH(4)/gVS (55 days, 38 degrees C). Inhabitation and adaptation could be described as the increase of free ammonia nitrogen content and acetic acid concentration, followed by an enhancement of the relative abundance of acetic acid-type methanogens (from 33.53-61.52%). The main pathogen in dry toilet blackwater fermentation broth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, kept multiplying in the first 8 days and then stabilized at a higher level than that of the beginning. This work showed the self-adjustment process and pathogen dynamics of dry toilet blackwater anaerobic digestion and highlights the significance of dry toilet blackwater characteristics when designing and maintaining anaerobic digestion sanitary treatment and reuse systems.

AB  - Although inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have been identified in poultry, the induction efficiency is low, because different culture media, feeder cells and feeder layer treatments affect the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming. We investigated improvement of the feeder culture system for induction of chicken iPSC by comparing the effects of different types and treatments of feeder cells on the growth and proliferation of chicken iPSC. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF), but not Sandoz inbred mouse-derived thioguanine-resistant and ouabain-buffalo rat cells, were suitable feeder cells that supported proliferation of chicken iPSC. Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice, but not Kunming mice, were suitable for preparing MEF that support cell proliferation. Also, MEF feeder cells that had been inactivated by mitomycin C were effective. Leukemia inhibitory factor was not required for chicken iPSC culture when MEF feeder cells were used. The optimal feeder culture system for growth and proliferation of chicken iPSC consisted of MEF feeder cells derived from ICR mice that were inactivated by mitomycin C combined with embryonic germ cell culture medium.

AB  - kappa-Carrageenan is a sulfated polysaccharide from red seaweed with substantial antioxidant activities. This study aimed to investigate the effect of kappa-Carrageenan treatment on frozen-thawed (FT) porcine semen quality. Therefore, the spermatozoa were diluted and cryopreserved in a freezing extender supplemented with 0 (control), 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/mL kappa-Carrageenan. Sperm kinematics were assessed immediately after thawing (AT) and post-incubation for 120 min. The viability, acrosome integrity, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and intracellular caspase activity were measured AT. The results indicated that 0.2 mg/mL kappa-Carrageenan increased total and progressive motility AT and post-incubation for 120 min (p < 0.05). Moreover, the viable sperm percentage and MMP after 0.2 mg/mL treatment were higher than those after control and other kappa-Carrageenan concentration treatments. The proportion of acrosome-intact spermatozoa was significantly higher after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/mL kappa-Carrageenan treatment than that after control and other kappa-Carrageenan concentration treatments. The intracellular caspase activity was not significantly different among the experimental groups. However, the MDA concentration after 0.2 mg/mL kappa-Carrageenan treatment was lower (p < 0.05) than that after the control treatment. Taken together, adding kappa-Carrageenan to the porcine semen freezing extender improved the FT sperm quality mainly by influencing membrane stability and protecting against oxidative stress.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaned piglets must rely only on solid feed without sow milk; consequently, weaning affects the intestinal architecture and is a critical period in which the gut microbiota changes and develops in weaned piglets. This study investigated the effects of long-term probiotic supplementation (6 weeks) on the gut microbiome and growth performance in healthy weaned pigs. As a result, the growth performance of the weaned piglets with probiotics was improved compared to the piglets without probiotics. In the gut microbiome analysis, the alpha-diversities of the piglets with probiotics significantly increased compared to those of the piglets without probiotics. In the changes of bacterial relative abundance, the Ruminococcaceae, Prevotella and Eubaterium coprostanoligenes groups significantly increased in the piglets with probiotics compared to the piglets without probiotics, whereas Muribaculaceae significantly increased in the piglets without probiotics compared to the piglets with probiotics. Taken together, significant differences on the gut microbiome were found according to probiotic supplementation in the weaned piglets and these gut microbiome changes appeared to improve the growth performance. Thus, long-term probiotic supplementation is recommended for piglets in the nursery stage after weaning. This study aimed to investigate effects of long-term probiotic supplementation on gut microbiota and growth performance in health weaned piglets. The non-probiotic group (N-PrB) was fed only a basal diet, while the probiotic group (PrB) was fed a basal diet + probiotic combination (E. faecium 1.6 x 10(8) CFU/g, B. subtilis 2.0 x 10(8) CFU/g, S. cerevisiae 3.0 x 10(8) CFU/g). The probiotics combination was provided to the PrB, mixing with the basal diet in 5 kg/ton. As a result, the PrB exhibited significantly improved weight gain compared to the N-PrB (p = 0.00991). In the gut microbiome analysis, the PrB exhibited a significant increasing tendency of alpha-diversity compared to those of the N-PrB (p < 0.01). In the bacterial relative abundance changes in bacteria comprising the gut microbiota, Ruminococcaceae (p = 0.00281) and Prevotella (p = 0.00687) tended to significantly increase in the PrB, but decreased in the N-PrB. The Eubaterium coprostanoligenes group exhibited an increasing tendency in both groups, but tended to increase more significantly in the PrB compared to the N-PrB (p = 0.00681). Muribaculaceae tended to significantly increase in the N-PrB, but decreased in the PrB (p = 0.002779). In this study, significant differences on the gut microbiome were found according to the probiotics supplementation in the weaned piglets and these gut microbiome changes appeared to improve the growth performance.

AB  - Simple Summary Potato is one of the most universally cultivated horticultural crops and is vulnerable to a range of herbivorous insects. One of them is the brown marmorated stink bug, an invasive polyphagous sap-sucking agricultural insect pest that penetrates the phloem to sieve elements and removes sap via a specialized mouthpart, the stylet. By using the chlorophyll fluorescence imaging methodology, we examined potato photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry responses in the area of feeding on the whole leaf area. Highly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was observed as rapidly as 3 min after feeding to initiate defence responses and can be considered the primary plant defence response mechanism against herbivores. Our experimental results confirmed that chlorophyll fluorescence imaging methodology can detect spatial heterogeneity of PSII efficiency at the whole leaf surface and is a promising tool for investigating plant response mechanisms of sap-sucking insect herbivores. We suggest that PSII responses to insect feeding underlie ROS-dependent signalling. We conclude that the potato PSII response mechanism to sap-sucking insect herbivores is described by the induction of the defence response to reduce herbivory damage, instead of induction of tolerance, through a compensatory photosynthetic response mechanism that is observed after chewing insect feeding. Potato, Solanum tuberosum L., one of the most commonly cultivated horticultural crops throughout the world, is susceptible to a variety of herbivory insects. In the present study, we evaluated the consequence of feeding by the sap-sucking insect Halyomorpha halys on potato leaf photosynthetic efficiency. By using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging methodology, we examined photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry in terms of feeding and at the whole leaf area. The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in potato's defence response mechanism immediately after feeding was also assessed. Even 3 min after feeding, increased ROS generation was observed to diffuse through the leaf central vein, probably to act as a long-distance signalling molecule. The proportion of absorbed energy being used in photochemistry (phi(PSII)) at the whole leaf level, after 20 min of feeding, was reduced by 8% compared to before feeding due to the decreased number of open PSII reaction centres (qp). After 90 min of feeding, phi(PSII) decreased by 46% at the whole leaf level. Meanwhile, at the feeding zones, which were located mainly in the proximity of the leaf midrib, phi(PSII) was lower than 85%, with a concurrent increase in singlet-excited oxygen (O-1(2)) generation, which is considered to be harmful. However, the photoprotective mechanism (phi(NPQ)), which was highly induced 90 min after feeding, was efficient to compensate for the decrease in the quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (phi(PSII)). Therefore, the quantum yield of non-regulated energy loss in PSII (phi(NO)), which represents O-1(2) generation, remained unaffected at the whole leaf level. We suggest that the potato PSII response to sap-sucking insect feeding underlies the ROS-dependent signalling that occurs immediately and initiates a photoprotective PSII defence response to reduce herbivory damage. A controlled ROS burst can be considered the primary plant defence response mechanism to herbivores.

AB  - Cells respond dynamically to multiple cues in complex microenvironments, which influence their behaviour, function, and molecular pathways. Despite recent advances, understanding cell interactions in such environments remains challenging. While biophysical cues are recognized for interacting with mechano-transduction proteins like YAP/TAZ, their role under glioblastoma electrotaxis is unclear. Our study investigates the functional role of mechano-transduction proteins under a physiological electric field (EF) with different rigidities. EF exposure highlights rigidity-dependent responses involving focal adhesion, cytoskeletal remodelling and YAP/TAZ coactivators relocation, showing to induce a shuttling in a rigidity-dependent manner. Further inhibition of PI3K/Akt and pharmacologically disrupting YAP/TAZ-TEAD interaction was shown to induce marked cytoskeletal remodelling under EFs. Our work characterises the therapeutic opportunities and limitations of EFs and uncovers the intricate interplay of physical cues and molecular signalling pathways in glioblastoma, offering potential insights for the development of therapeutic interventions in the future.

AB  - The tea plants cultivated in acidic soils are vulnerable to excessive manganese (Mn), which increases the risk of Mn2+ toxicity to physiology and development. Mn-cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family genes have been implicated in regulating Mn homeostasis and tolerance. However, the mechanism of Mn tolerance of tea plants in acidic environments is still unknown. In this study, we initially examined the phenotypic characteristics and Mn contents variability in different tissues of tea plants under various Mn concentration at pH 5 and 4. We observed that tea plants exhibited remarkably high Mn tolerance at pH 4, with Mn accumulation notably elevated in the aboveground tissues under pH 4 condition after 28-day treatment. We found the expression levels of Mn-CDF genes, had different subcellular localization, were tissue-specific and significantly induced by high Mn concentrations at pH 4 condition. Furthermore, the yeast complementation assays indicated that the heterologous expression of Mn-CDF genes restored the growth of a Mn2+ sensitive yeast strain, Delta pmr1. Taken together, these results suggest that Mn-CDF family genes function as Mn transporters to participate in Mn tolerance in acidic environments. This study provides reference for further study on the mechanism of maintaining Mn homeostasis in tea plants under soil acidification.

AB  - To efficiently digest food resources that may vary spatially and temporally, animals maintain physiological flexibility across levels of organization. For example, in response to dietary shifts, animals may exhibit changes in the expression of digestive enzymes, the size of digestive organs or the structure of their gut microbiome. A 'Grand Challenge' in comparative physiology is to understand how components of flexibility across organizational levels may scale to cumulatively determine organismal performance. Here, we conducted feeding trials on three rodent species with disparate feeding strategies: footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and carnivorous grasshopper mice (Onychomys torridus). For each species, four groups of individuals were presented with diets that varied in carbohydrate, fiber and protein content. After 4-5 weeks, we measured organismal performance in the form of nutrient digestibility (dry matter, nitrogen, fiber). We also measured gut anatomy and organ size, and conducted enzyme assays on various tissues to measure activities of carbohydrases and peptidases. We found some shared physiological responses, e.g. fiber generally increased gut size across species. However, the specifics of these responses were distinct across species, suggesting different capacities for flexibility. Thus, in the context of digestion, we still lack an understanding of how flexibility across organizational levels may scale to determine whole-animal performance.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in air quality and atmospheric chemistry, yet studies on the characteristics and impacts of NH3 are limited. Herein, we revealed the spatial distribution of atmospheric NH3, as measured by passive samplers, at three different sites (R1, R2, and R3) in the rural area (livestock environment) of Jeongeup, South Korea, from September 2019 to August 2020. At site R1, the boundary of a large-scale pig farm, dramatically high daily mean concentrations of NH3 were observed (118.7 ppb), whereas sites R2 and R3, located ~1 km from R1, exhibited lower concentrations of 18.2 and 30.4 ppb, respectively. In the rural environment, the monthly NH3 variations showed a peak in June (34.2 ppb), which was significantly higher than in the urban and remote areas. To examine the impact of NH3 from the rural area on a nearby urban area in June 2020, simultaneous measurements were performed using a real-time instrument in Jeonju. When high NH3 events occurred in the urban area in June, the results for the NH3 concentrations and observed meteorological conditions in the rural and urban areas showed that the rural area influenced the NH3 levels in the adjacent urban area.

AB  - Ketamine is an NMDAR antagonist that has been widely used for clinical anesthesia. In addition, low-dose ketamine has analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects, which have attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, how low-dose ketamine can affect the higher cognitive functions remain unclear. Here we review the effects of low-dose ketamine on working memory (WM). WM is the ability to temporally hold and manipulate information in the brain. It mainly relies on a network involving several key brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, etc. WM plays a key role in many complex cognitive processes, thus to understand how it may be affected by low-dose ketamine is informative and important for its clinic use. Here we review the studies showing that acute or chronic use of low-dose ketamine will impair working memory in a sophisticated way. The possible mechanisms underlying such impairments include breaking the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in the PFC, changing the short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, activating the DA pathway, etc. We also pointed out that to fully reveal the effects of low-dose ketamine on WM and related neural mechanism, future multi-facet studies combining behavioral tests, electrophysiology, neuroimaging, histology, etc, and with more comparable dosage and time of medication would be needed. We hope that this review will be instrumental for facilitating appropriate use of low-dose ketamine in clinical settings.

AB  - The objective of this study is to observe the effect of high selenium on the antioxidant and immune functions of growing goats based on transcriptome sequencing. Eighteen goats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) the control (CON) group was fed a basal diet, and (2) the treatment 1 group (LS) and treatment 2 group (HS) were fed a basal diet with 2.4 and 4.8 mg/kg selenium-yeast (SY), respectively. The results indicate that HS treatment significantly (p < 0.05) increased the apparent digestibility of either extract and significantly increased (p < 0.05) total antioxidant capacity, whereas it significantly (p < 0.05) decreased plasma aspartate aminotransferase and malondialdehyde relative to the control group. The LS treatment had significantly (p < 0.05) increased glutathione S-transferase and catalase compared to CON. A total of 532 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the CON and HS were obtained using transcriptome sequencing. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis identified upregulated (p < 0.05) DEGs mainly related to vascular smooth muscle contraction, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, the VEGF signalling pathway, and proteoglycans in cancer; downregulated (p < 0.05) DEGs mainly related to the NOD-like receptor signalling pathway, influenza A, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, haematopoietic cell lineage, and African trypanosomiasis. Ontology analyses of the top genes show that the identified DEGs are mainly involved in the regulation of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor production for biological processes, the external side of the plasma membrane for cellular components, and carbohydrate derivative binding for molecular functions. Seven genes are considered potential candidate genes for regulating antioxidant activity, including selenoprotein W, 1, glutathione peroxidase 1, glutathione S-transferase A1, tumour necrosis factor, tumour necrosis factor superfamily member 10, tumour necrosis factor superfamily member 8, and tumour necrosis factor superfamily member 13b. The experimental observations indicate that dietary supplementation with 4.8 mg/kg SY can enhance antioxidant and immune functions by improving muscle immunity, reducing the concentrations of inflammatory molecules, and modulating antioxidant and inflammatory signalling pathways in growing goats.

AB  - Objective Head direction cell and place cell spatially tuned firing is often anchored to salient visual landmarks on the periphery of a recording environment. What is less well understood is whether structural features of an environment, such as orientation of a maze sub-compartment or a polarizing barrier, can likewise control spatial firing.
   Method We recorded from 54 head direction cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and subicular region of male Lister Hooded rats while they explored an apparatus with four parallel or four radially arranged compartments (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we recorded from 130 place cells (in Lister- and Long-Evans Hooded rats) and 30 head direction cells with 90 degrees rotations of a cue card and a barrier in a single environment (Experiment 2).
   Results We found that head direction cells maintained a similar preferred firing direction across four separate maze compartments even when these faced different directions (Experiment 1). However, in an environment with a single compartment, we observed that both a barrier and a cue card exerted comparable amounts of stimulus control over head direction cells and place cells (Experiment 2).
   Conclusion The maintenance of a stable directional orientation across maze compartments suggests that the head direction cell system has the capacity to provide a global directional reference that allows the animal to distinguish otherwise similar maze compartments based on the compartment's orientation. A barrier is, however, capable of controlling spatially tuned firing in an environment in which it is the sole polarizing feature.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder and sometimes deadly consequence of exposure to severe psychological trauma. However, there has been little known about the definitive molecular changes involved in determining vulnerability to PTSD. In the current study, we used proteomics to quantify protein changes in the hippocampus of foot shocks rats. A total of 6151 proteins were quantified and 97 proteins were significantly differentially expressed. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis showed that oxidationreduction process and glutathione homeostasis may be the potential key progress of being vulnerable to PTSD. The Gene Ontology analysis revealed enriched GO terms in the protein groups of Susceptible group vs Control group rats for glutathione binding,oligopeptide binding,modified amino acid binding,and glutathione transferase activity for their molecular functions (MF) and in the process of cellular response to toxic substance,xenobiotic metabolic process, urea metabolic process, and response to drug for the biological process (BP).SIGNIFICANCE:In recent years, there has been a growing interest in mental illness associated with trauma exposure. We found that stress susceptibility was associated with increased expression of arginase 1 indicated as a potential treatment target. Our results also proposed that carbonic anhydrases 3 could be a biomarker for the development of PTSD. This research helps to explain the potential molecular mechanism in PTSD and supply a new method for ameliorating PTSD.

AB  - The creatine (Cr) biosynthesis pathway buffers adenosine triphosphate in metabolically active tissues. We investigated whether sex of fetus and day of gestation influence Cr in endometrial and conceptus tissues from gilts on days 60 and 90 (n = 6 gilts/day) of gestation. Uterine and conceptus tissues associated with one male and one female fetus from each gilt were analyzed for creatine, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and proteins for Cr biosynthesis. Total Cr decreased in amniotic fluid but increased in allantoic fluid between days 60 and 90 of gestation for male (P < 0.05) but not for female fetuses (P > 0.05). Endometrial expression of creatine kinase, muscle (CKM), creatine kinase mitochondrial type 1 (CKMT1), and solute carrier family 6, member 8 (SLC6A8) mRNAs increased (P < 0.05) between days 60 and 90 only for female fetuses. On day 60, expression of creatine kinase, brain (CKB) and CKMT1 mRNAs was greater (P < 0.05) for placentae of female than male fetuses. Livers of male fetuses had greater expression of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and CKB than for females on day 60, while kidneys of female fetuses had greater expression of guanidinoacetate-N-methyltransferase (GAMT) than male fetuses on day 90 (P < 0.05). Localization of GAMT, CKB, CKMT1, and SLC6A8 proteins to uterine and chorionic epithelium was not influenced by gestational age or fetal sex. Arginine-glycine amidinotransferase localized to fetal kidneys and appeared greater on day 90 than on day 60 in both sexes. Thus, expression of the creatine-creatine kinase-phosphocreatine system at the uterine-conceptus interface is affected by gestational age and fetal sex to influence energy homeostasis in pigs.

AB  - This work reports an environmentally friendly method for removing small-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) synthesized from pasteurized cow and goat milk and iron salts. IONPs were prepared at room temperature using FeSO4 (2.0 g in 500 mL) and 10.0 mL of milk at pH 12. Results show that IONPs were formed with low crystallinity. The presence of Fe was confirmed through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data show smaller semi-spherical nanometer-size particles in an aggregated state. The PAH removal process was monitored using a fluorescence spectrometer, and the results showed that the type of iron salt used (Fe2+/Fe3+) in the preparation of IONPs had no significant effect on the removal of model PAHs. However, the ring structure of the PAHs plays a role in the time taken for the removal process. All PAHs were removed from water efficiently with naphthalene, anthracene, and fluorene removal efficiencies of 75%, >90%, and 70%, respectively. The current study shows that IONPs formed using milk have the potential to be used to remove PAHs from water. {GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT}

AB  - Cyst echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, remains a zoonotic disease posing a great threat to public health and meat production industry. Sheep infected with E. granulosus show relatively high abundance of egr-miR-71 in the sera, but its role is unknown. Using bioinformatics and cell migration and Transwell assays, we comparatively analyzed the proteomes and cell invasion of sheep PBMCs in response to egr-miR-71 over-expression. The results showed that the egr-miR-71 induced a total of 157 proteins being differentially expressed and mainly involved in immune responses. In sheep PBMCs, egr-miRNA-71 overexpression induced significant downregulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and accordingly promoted cell migration and invasion compared with the control. The results will provide a clue for further investigation of a role of circu-lating egr-miR-71 in immune responses during E. granulosus infection.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important regulators of diverse biological processes of plants. However, the evolution and potential functions of circRNAs during winter dormancy and spring bud flushing of tea plant is largely unknown. Using RNA-seq data, a total of 1184 circRNAs were identified in the winter dormant and spring bud flushing leaf samples of tea plants in two different cultivars exhibiting different duration of winter dormancy. A total of 156 circRNAs are found to be differentially expressed and the weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) analysis revealed that 22 and 20 differentially expressed-circRNAs (DE-circRNAs) positively correlated with the flushing and dormant leaf traits, respectively, in both the tea cultivars used. Some transcription factors (TFs) viz. MYB, WRKY, ERF, bHLH and several genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways are found to co-express with circRNAs. DE-circRNAs also predicted to interact with miRNAs and can regulate phytohormone biosynthesis and various signalling pathways in tea plant. This study uncovers the potential roles of circRNAs to determine winter dormancy and spring bud flushing conditions in tea plants.

AB  - Cashmere is initiated and develops in the fetal stages and the number and density of secondary hair follicles (SHFs) determine cashmere production and quality. Growing evidence indicates that both microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) play an indispensable role in hair follicle (HF) growth and development. However, little is known about miRNAs, lncRNAs, and their functions as well as their interactions during cashmere initiation and development. Here, based on lncRNA and miRNA high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we identified 10,485 lncRNAs, 40,639 mRNAs, and 605 miRNAs in cashmere goat skin during HF induction, organogenesis, and cytodifferentiation stages. Among them, 521 lncRNAs, 5976 genes, and 204 miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE). KEGG analysis of DE genes indicated that ECM-receptor interaction and biosynthesis of amino acids were crucial for HF development. Notch, TGF-beta, and Wnt signaling pathways were also identified, which are conventional pathways associated with HF growth and development. Then, the ceRNA regulatory network was constructed, and the impact of lncRNA H19 was investigated in dermal papilla (DP) cells. The MTT, CCK-8, and EdU assays showed that the viability and proliferation of DP cells were promoted by H19, and mechanistic studies suggested that H19 performed its function through the chi-miR-214-3p/beta-catenin axis. The present study created a resource for lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA studies in cashmere morphogenesis. It could contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of ncRNAs involved in the regulation of HF growth and development.

AB  - This study aimed to verify the impact of high-fat diet consumption for a prolonged period on oxidative stress, fetal growth, umbilical vascular system, and placental structures in pregnant goats. Twenty-two pregnant goats were grouped into the control diet (n= 11) and fat diet (n = 11). Flaxseed meal was added to the fat diet, replacing the corn grain of concentrate, from gestational day 100 to delivery date. Diets were isonitrogenous and isoenergetic, differing in fat content (2.8% vs. 6.3% dry matter). The fat group showed higher feed intake and total plasma lipid levels than the control group (P < 0.001). No difference was found in placentome, and umbilical vascular development. Fat diet-fed goats exhibited a lower systolic peak in the umbilical artery. At delivery, placental traits were similar with the exception of the cotyledon width (P = 0.0075), which was smaller in the fat group and cotyledon surface (P = 0.0047) for multiple pregnancy of fat diet. Cotyledonary epithelium showed more intense staining of lipid droplets and a greater area for lipofuscin staining in the fat group compared to control group (P < 0.001). The mean live weight of the kids was lower in the fat group in the first week after delivery than in control group. Thus, in goats, the continuous administration of a high-fat diet during pregnancy does not appear to modify the fetal-maternal vascular structures but has an impact on a part of the placental structure; therefore, its use must be evaluated.

AB  - A growing number of studies have demonstrated that repeated exposure to sevoflurane during development results in persistent social abnormalities and cognitive impairment. Davunetide, an active fragment of the activitydependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), has been implicated in social and cognitive protection. However, the potential of davunetide to attenuate social deficits following sevoflurane exposure and the underlying developmental mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, ribosome and proteome profiles were analyzed to investigate the molecular basis of sevoflurane-induced social deficits in neonatal mice. The neuropathological basis was also explored using Golgi staining, morphological analysis, western blotting, electrophysiological analysis, and behavioral analysis. Results indicated that ADNP was significantly downregulated following developmental exposure to sevoflurane. In adulthood, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons exposed to sevoflurane exhibited a decrease in dendrite number, total dendrite length, and spine density. Furthermore, the expression levels of Homer, PSD95, synaptophysin, and vglut2 were significantly reduced in the sevoflurane group. Patch -clamp recordings indicated reductions in both the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Notably, davunetide significantly ameliorated the synaptic defects, social behavior deficits, and cognitive impairments induced by sevoflurane. Mechanistic analysis revealed that loss of ADNP led to dysregulation of Ca2+ activity via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in decreased expression of synaptic proteins. Suppression of Wnt signaling was restored in the davunetide-treated group. Thus, ADNP was identified as a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of neurodevelopmental toxicity caused by general anesthetics. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying social and cognitive disturbances caused by sevoflurane exposure in neonatal mice and elucidates the regulatory pathways involved.

AB  - Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) can regulate mammary gland development and lactation physiological activities. However, the molecular genetic mechanisms of lncRNA in mammary gland involution and cell remodeling remain unclear. This work analyzed the expression characteristics and molecular functions of lncRNA in goat mammary gland tissue at the late lactation (LL), dry period (DP), and late gestation (LG) stages. Sequencing results showed that 3074 lncRNAs were identified in non-lactating goat mammary gland tissue. Statistical analysis of lncRNA length characteristics and exon number found that goat lncRNAs were shorter in length, had fewer exons, and significantly lower expression levels than those of protein-coding genes. 331 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in the three comparison groups (LLvsDP, DPvsLG, and LLvsLG), which indicated that the lncRNAs expression at the transcriptional level were changed during mammary involution. Interestingly, lncRNAs were more actively expressed during the dry period compared to lactation, suggesting that lncRNAs in mammary glands are developmentally specific. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed that lncRNAs could regulate immune function, cell proliferation, apoptosis, hormones, substance metabolism, transport, and intercellular communication in the mammary gland through various action modes. Among them, cis-acting lncRNAs enhanced the protection of mammary gland health during the dry period and late gestation. The above reflects the particular mechanisms of lncRNA to adapt to the developmental needs of mammary involution and remodeling. Furthermore, in the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network associated with mammary gland development, the expression of LOC102168552 was higher in late gestation than in the dry period and late lactation. Its expression was positively correlated with PRLR and negatively correlated with chi-miR-324-3p. Overexpression of LOC102168552 in goat mammary epithelial cells cultured in vitro could up-regulate PRLR to activate the prolactin signaling pathway by competitively binding to chi-miR-324-3p, promoting cell proliferation, reducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 / S phase, and inhibiting apoptosis. However, overexpression of LOC102168552 alone did not affect mammary cell growth status and the prolactin signaling pathway. This indicates that LOC102168552 must rely on chi-miR-324-3p to inhibit mammary cell apoptosis. In conclusion, the above analysis revealed that lncRNAs in goat mammary tissue are differentially expressed at different stages of involution. As expected, lncRNAs adaptively regulate various physiological activities during mammary gland involution through multiple modes of action, in preparation for a new round of lactation. These findings provide a reference and help further understand the regulatory role of lncRNAs in mammary cell involution and remodeling.

AB  - Memory can be controlled by multiple brain systems that may compete for control of behavior. It is by now well established that acute stress can bias this competition and favor dorsal striatum-dependent 'habit' learning over hippocampusdependent 'cognitive' learning. Recent evidence in humans suggests that stress modulates the preferential engagement of multiple memory systems not only during memory formation but also at retrieval, after both hippocampal and dorsal striatal memory traces have been formed. The nature of this stressinduced shift of the brain systems guiding retrieval appears to depend on the intensity of initial training and may promote efficient responding during stressful encounters.

AB  - Sleep deprivation-induced degenerative changes in the brain lead to the impairment of memory, anxiety, and quality of life. Several studies have reported the effects of sleep deprivation on CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus; in contrast, there is less known about the impact of chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) and sleep recovery on CA3 neurons and behavior. Hence, the present study aimed to understand the effect of CSD and sleep recovery on hippocampal CA3 neurons and spatial memory, and anxiety-like behavior in rats. Sixty male rats (Sprague Dawley) were grouped as control, environmental control (EC), CSD, 5 days sleep recovery (CSD + 5D SR), and 21 days sleep recovery (CSD + 21D SR). CSD, CSD + 5D SR and, CSD + 21D SR group rats were sleep deprived for 21 days (18 h/day). After CSD, the CSD + 5D SR and CSD + 21D SR rats were sleep recovered for 5and 21-days respectively. Oxidative stress, dendritic arborization of CA3 neurons, spatial memory, and anxietylike behavior was assessed. Spatial memory, basal, and apical dendritic branching points/intersections in hippocampal CA3 neurons were reduced, and anxiety-like behavior and oxidative stress increased significantly in the CSD group compared to control (p < 0.001). The CSD + 21D SR showed a significant improvement in spatial memory, reduction in anxiety-like behavior, and oxidative stress when compared to the CSD group (p 0.05). The basal and apical dendritic branching points/intersections in hippocampal CA3 neurons were increased after CSD + 21D SR, however, it was not significant (p 0.05). Even though the CSD + 21D SR showed a significant improvement in all the parameters, it did not reach the control level. There was an improvement in all the parameters after CSD + 5D SR but this was not significant compared to the CSD group (p > 0.05). Overall results indicate that the CSD-induced impairment of spatial memory and anxiety-like behavior was associated with oxidative stress and reduced dendritic arborization of hippocampal CA3 neurons. The CSD + 21D SR significantly reduced the damage caused by CSD, but it was not sufficient to reach the control level.

AB  - Testosterone is an important steroid hormone that is indispensable for male sexual development and the reproductive system. Leydig cells (LCs), where autophagy is extremely active, reside in the testicular interstitium and are the major sites of testosterone production. However, the ultrastructural character-istics and the functional role of autophagy in LCs of livestock remain unknown. In this study, the LCs of the dairy goats were investigated to identify the steroidogenic activity and autophagy levels at different ages of development by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Morphological results showed that the steroidogenic activity (3b-HSD staining) and ultrastructural characteristics of the LCs were changed with increasing age. TEM results demonstrated that the organelles involved in testosterone synthesis, e.g., smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and lipid droplets, were abundantly distributed within the cytoplasm of LCs in pubertal and adult testes. Moreover, autophagy activity was enhanced in the testes at pubertal and adult stages compared with that at the juvenile stage. Several different autophagic vacuoles, including pre-autophagosomes, autophagosomes, and autolysosomes, were observed within the cytoplasm of LCs from pubertal and adult testes. However, immunofluorescent staining and TEM results showed that no typical lipophagic or mitophagic vacuoles were observed in the cytoplasm of LCs. Furthermore, primary LCs from dairy goats were used to study the effect of autophagy on testosterone production. After treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor), the primary LCs decreased testos-terone production. In contrast, treatment with rapamycin (an autophagy activator), enhanced ste-roidogenesis in LCs. Collectively, these in vivo and in vitro results suggested that autophagy activity is related to steroidogenesis in LCs of dairy goats, which may ultimately influence the spermatogenesis and fertility of these animals.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Anastrepha obliqua Macquart (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a polyphagous species with hog plums (Spondias spp.) (Sapindales: Anacardiaceae) and mangoes (Mangifera indica L.) (Sapindales: Anacardiaceae) as primary host fruits. In this study, the olfactory preference of A. obliqua for three stages of ripeness of two mango cultivars ('Coche' and 'Ataulfo') was investigated. The female flies were more attracted to ripe 'Coche' fruits compared to those ripe 'Ataulfo'. Further, they were more attracted to the 'Coche' half-ripe and ripe fruits than to the unripe ones, but they did not discriminate among the stages of ripeness of 'Ataulfo' fruits. The male flies did not show preference for any specific mango cultivars or ripeness stage tested. Four compounds from ripe 'Coche' mangoes, and two from ripe 'Ataulfo' fruits were identified using coupled gas chromatography-electroantennographic (GC-EAD) recording and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. 'Coche' mango volatiles eliciting responses from the female antennae were ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl heptanoate, and ethyl octanoate. The two 'Ataulfo' mango volatiles were identified as 3-carene and ethyl octanoate. These compounds were absent in unripe mangoes of both cultivars. Synthetic blends of these compounds were attractive to females as mango extracts in field cage tests. Our results suggest that the olfactory preference of A. obliqua for attractive hosts is based on the presence or absence of the compounds associated with fruit maturity.

AB  - The biotic and abiotic factors including the agricultural implementation can modify soil acidification. We hypothesized that soil pH should as repercussion, alter the plant physiological and physical properties and eventually affect insect herbivores including agricultural pests. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of seven levels of soil pH on the performance of cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora on Vicia faba. Significant relationships between soil pH and growth of host bean seedlings or development and reproduction of the aphid were detected. Data demonstrated significant differences in the total longevity, the pre-reproductive, reproductive, post-reproductive and pre-viviparity periods. Within a suitable range of pH for bean growth between pH 5.3 and pH 7.2, the aphid performance was worse on seedlings growing better, however, under unfavorable extreme pH conditions, plant quality measured as height did not affect the aphids anymore and their performance was uniformly low except the case in pH 8.1 condition in which the best aphid reproduction was observed. The results confirm that soil pH affect the performance of cowpea aphid A. craccivora and also exhibited strong influence on the growth of broad bean plants. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - During lung development, the embryonic airway originates as a wishbone-shaped epithelial tube, which undergoes a series of branching events to build the bronchial tree. This process depends crucially on cell proliferation and is thought to involve distinct branching modes: lateral branching, wherein daughter branches emerge along the length of a parent branch, and bifurcations, wherein the tip of a parent branch splits to form two new daughter branches. The developing airway is fluid-filled, and previous studies have shown that altered luminal pressure can influence rates of branching morphogenesis. However, it is not clear if altered tissue mechanics influence patterns of proliferation along the embryonic airway epithelium nor if individual branching modes are affected differently by changes in luminal pressure. Here, we focused on mechanisms of lateral branching and used as a model system the embryonic avian lung, which forms exclusively via this branching mode during early development. We used microinjected fluid droplets or pharmacological modulators of fluid secretion to alter luminal fluid pressure either locally or globally within cultured embryonic lungs. Somewhat surprisingly, we found both local and global increases in luminal pressure to suppress the formation of new lateral branches while also promoting increased epithelial proliferation. In a consistent manner, decreased luminal pressure led to an increase in lateral branching morphogenesis. Morphometric analysis of airway branching patterns revealed that altered luminal pressure shifts the overall branching program, rather than simply changing rates of morphogenesis. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of mechanical forces during airway branching and suggest that different branching modes may be affected differently by luminal fluid pressure.

AB  - The length-weight relationships (LWRs) of 11 fish species from one national park and three nature reserves, in northern Vietnam, totaling 737 individuals between October 2018 and November 2021, are described in this study. The following species, representing 11 genera and seven families, were studied: Aphyocypris normalis Nichols et Pope, 1927, Barbodes semifasciolatus (G & uuml;nther, 1868), Beaufortia minutus Nichols, 1926, Rhinogobius duospilus (Herre, 1935). All regressions were highly significant (P < 0.001). Positive allometric growth was seen in six species (b > 3, P < 0.01) and isometric growth in five species (b = 3, P > 0.05). This is the first report on the LWRs of six fish species, including Beaufortia pingi, Barbodes semifasciolatus, Neolissochilus benasi, Opsariichthys minutus, Glyptothorax honghensis, and Rhinogobius duospilus from four conservation areas. The presently reported study provides foundational data for future stock assessment works and management initiatives in protected areas, as well as facilities comparisons of LWRs from different habitats.

AB  - BACKGROUND The tomato potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) is a new invasive pest in Western Australia, which may disperse across the whole of Australia within a few years and cause significant economic losses. Chemical control is the most widely used approach to manage B. cockerelli, but insect resistance, chemical residue and effects on non-target species have become an increasing concerned. Therefore, in this study, the biocontrol potential of variegated lady beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) was investigated. The impact of utilizing B. cockerelli as a food source on the predator's development and reproduction was assessed by formulating age-stage, two sex life tables. The predatory potential of H. variegata on B. cockerelli nymphs was assessed in a closed arena and the effects of releasing H. variegata for the control of B. cockerelli were then evaluated. RESULTS H. variegata could successfully develop and oviposit when feeding on B. cockerelli. However, both survival and the rate of development were higher for H. variegata feeding on Myzus persicae (Sulzer) than B. cockerelli or a mixed population of B. cockerelli and M. persicae. A type II functional response was observed for H. variegata. In the greenhouse, the releases of H. variegata larvae reduced the number of B. cockerelli nymphs by up to 66% and adults by up to 59%, which positively influenced the plant chlorophyll content and biomass. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the potential of the resident generalist predator, H. variegata as a biocontrol agent for the invasive pest, B. cockerelli, which may help improving current management strategies.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) continues to be used today to examine the role of sleep across diverse cognitive domains. Extensive research has been conducted to investigate the impact of SD on memory, though findings across studies have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis systematically assessed the effects of SD on memory performance in rats and identified the factors that may moderate these effects. PubMed, PsychInfo, Google scholar, and Scopus databases were used to search for studies. Out of 128 identified studies, 25 studies with 78 reports were included in the final analysis. A random effects meta-analysis was performed, along with subgroup analysis and metaregression. The results showed that overall, SD has a negative impact on memory in rats. Additionally, sex, memory response type, and number of learning trials for spatial tasks can act as moderators of the relationship between SD and memory. The type of memory task and assessment method used contributed to variability in observed outcomes, with hippocampus-dependent tasks showing the most pronounced memory impairments. The number of learning trials for spatial tasks also moderated the effects, with more trials mitigating the impact of SD. These findings reinforce the role of sleep in memory, particularly for hippocampus-dependent tasks.

AB  - Pituitary specific transcription factor-1 (Pit-1) gene is responsible for pituitary development and growth hormone expression, which is considered a pivotal candidate gene for growth in pig. This study aims to detect novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in porcine Pit-1 gene, investigate its effect on growth traits in the Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire pigs. Two novel polymorphisms were detected, one located in the intron 2 (g. 13700 A>G) and another located in exon 4 (g.25783 C>T) which caused an amino acid change from threonine to methionine (Thr36Met). At g.13700 A>G site, the frequency of A allele was higher than G allele in Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire. At the g.25783 C>T site, it was remarkable differences in allelic frequencies and genotypic frequencies among the three pig breeds. This study demonstrated the significant genotype effect of Pit-1 on body weights at 70 d, age when reached 30kg, 50kg, 100kg and average daily gain from 30kg to 100kg. According to our results, the novel Pit-1 polymorphisms may be useful in pig selection as molecular markers and required in future studies.

AB  - AimsTo evaluate the effects of Jiawei Kongsheng Zhenzhong Pill (JKZP) on rats with ischemic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and investigate the underlying mechanisms.MethodsThe components of JKZP were analyzed using Q-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The MCI rat model was prepared through gradual bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). The cognitive function, hippocampal pathological lesions, dendritic spine damage, synapse-related, and S100 calcium-binding protein A10 (S100A10)/tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway-associated molecules alterations were measured. Primary hippocampus neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury, and JKZP-containing serum was utilized for treatment. Lentiviral-infected neurons were constructed with S100A10 knockdown using RNAi technology to investigate whether JKZP exerted its anti-MCI effects via S100A10/tPA/BDNF pathway.ResultsA total of 64 major components, including beta-asarone, ferulic acid, loganin, senkyunolide H, and cryptotanshinone, were identified by Q-Orbitrap HRMS technology. JKZP had a notable impact on enhancing the cognitive abilities of rats with MCI. JKZP reduced the damage to the hippocampal CA1 region neuron and synaptic structure, reversed the decrease in dendritic spines, and increased the expressions of synapse-associated proteins such as synaptophysin (SYN), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). Furthermore, JKZP treatment dramatically reduced the ratio of protein of BDNF (proBDNF)/mature BDNF (mBDNF) by activating S100A10/tPA, which was confirmed in primary hippocampus neurons in vitro. Moreover, sh-S100A10 tremendously mitigated the inhibitory action of JKZP on OGD/R-mediated synapse injury, decreased the activity of tPA, and thus improved the downstream pathway targets' ratio, proBDNF/mBDNF.ConclusionsThese results manifested that JKZP promoted neurological recovery after chronic cerebral ischemia by alleviating synaptic damage and activating the S100A10/tPA/BDNF pathway, thereby providing a novel perspective and a solid foundation against MCI.

AB  - Although plants possess a suite of structural defenses, most studies have focused on trichomes. Trichomes can have both pre- and post-ingestive effects and have been consistently found to reduce herbivory. Along with trichomes, a few studies have focused on epicuticular waxes as an important defense; however, manipulated comparisons examining herbivore growth and development are limited. In this study, using two Solanum species (Solanum glaucescens Zuccarini and Solanum macrocarpon Linnaeus) that vary in both defenses, we tested the hypothesis that variation in defenses will affect herbivore feeding, primarily by restricting feeding commencement. We used electron microscopy together with a series of plant- and diet-based manipulative experiments, using tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta Linnaeus; Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) as the herbivore. We found that Solanum glaucescens leaves had significantly fewer trichomes and significantly higher wax content when compared to Solanum macrocarpon. We also found that Solanum glaucescens waxes acted as a strong physical barrier resulting in lower mass gain and higher mortality of caterpillars compared to Solanum macrocarpon. Artificial diet manipulation experiments also suggested the possible toxicity of waxes. Collectively, we show that epicuticular waxes can play a significant role as a strong surface barrier and should be examined further.

AB  - Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) possesses extensive biological activities, pharmacological effects, and anti -fatigue function. MiR-133a is a specifically expressed miRNA in skeletal muscle that participates in the regu-lation of myoblast proliferation and differentiation. However, little is known about the role of APS in the development of sheep skeletal muscle. In this study, we aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of APS and miR-133a on the differentiation of sheep skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) and the regulatory rela-tionship between APS and miR-133a. The results suggested that APS plays a positive regulatory role in the proliferation and differentiation of sheep SMSCs. Moreover, miR-133a significantly promotes SMSC differenti-ation and the activity of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Importantly, we found that APS function requires the mediation of miR-133a in the differentiation of sheep SMSCs. Taken together, our results indicate that APS accelerates SMSC differentiation by regulating miR-133a via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in sheep.

AB  - Metal-ion hybrid capacitors represent an innovative class of electrochemical energy storage systems. However, hybrid capacitors made from traditional carbon-based materials struggle to simultaneously achieve both high specific capacity and long-cycle stability. A hierarchical porous carbon material with an optimized pore structure was synthesized using pig kidney proteins and tannic acid as precursors, employing cross-linking polymerization and carbonization activation strategies. The as-synthesized sample features an exceptionally high specific surface area and abundant porosity, which efficiently accommodate the adsorption and transport of solvated zinc and magnesium ions. The zinc-ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) achieved a reversible capacity of 221 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1, while the magnesium-ion hybrid capacitor (MHC) delivered 132 mA h g-1 under the same conditions. Additionally, DFT calculations revealed the critical influence of pore size on metal ion storage. In a 2 M ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte solution, when the pore size of the carbon material was 1.13 nm, solvated zinc ions exhibited the highest adsorption energy. In contrast, in a 0.4 M (MgPhCl)2-AlCl3 organic electrolyte, a pore size of 2.29 nm optimized the storage capacity of solvated magnesium ions. This study provides important theoretical insights into designing ZHCs and MHCs.

AB  - Robust and easy-to-use NMR sensor technology is proposed for accurate, on-site determination of fat and protein contents in milk. The two parameters are determined using fast consecutive H-1 and Cl-35 low-field NMR experiments on milk samples upon the 1:1 addition of a low-cost contrast solution. Reliable and accurate measurements are obtained without tedious calibrations and the need for extensive database information and may readily be conducted by non-experts in production site environments. This enables on-site application at farms or dairies, or use in laboratories harvesting significant reductions in costs and time per analysis as compared to wet-chemistry analysis. The performance is demonstrated for calibration samples, various supermarket milk products, and raw milk samples, of which some were analyzed directly in the milking room. To illustrate the wide application range, the supermarket milk products included both conventionally/organically produced, lactose-free milk, cow's, sheep's and goat's milk, homogenized and unhomogenized milk, and a broad nutrient range (0.1-9% fat, 1-6% protein). Excellent agreement between NMR measurements and reference values, without corrections or changes in calibration for various products and during extensive periods of experiment conduction (4 months) demonstrates the robustness of the procedure and instrumentation. For the raw milk samples, correlations between NMR and IR, NMR and wet-chemistry, as well as IR and wet-chemistry results, show that NMR, in terms of accuracy, compares favorably with the other methods.

AB  - The efficient management of slurry, which is a by-product rich in nutrients derived from feces, urine, cleaning water, and animal waste that stands out for its high concentration of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is of vital importance, highlighting the importance of slurry management in storage ponds, which. The Murcia-Spain region has an important number of pig farms. Hence, infrastructures dedicated to managing by-products are necessary to prevent environmental pollution and eutrophication of groundwater. The aim of a recent study was to evaluate the relationship between electrical values and geochemical parameters of pig slurry stored in a pond using ERT and geochemical analysis. In addition, the study was designed to monitor the pond to determine the geochemical characteristics of the slurry and to assess the risk of lateral contamination. The study results indicate a noticeable decrease in electrical resistivity values at 0.4 and 1.6 m depth in surveys 1 and 2. The reduction ranges from 50 to 100 percent. This paper presents a new method for monitoring slurry ponds using electrical resistivity tomography. This non-invasive method provides detailed information on the distribution and characteristics of the fluids, as well as a clear picture of the electrical resistivity of the subsurface.

AB  - Over the last decades, micro-archaeological and ethnoarchaeological approaches have demonstrated the importance of animal dung deposits for reconstructing past human lifeways, primarily within caves and rock-shelters. The case study of Tossal de Baltarga (eastern Pyrenees) provides evidence from simultaneous storage and penning, along with the in situ remains in anatomical connection of several ovicaprines and a horse within a building destroyed by fire, dating to the second half of the third century BC. The current study provides new evidence for animal management and organisation of space at the site through examination in micromorphological thin-section and integrated phytolith and dung spherulite analyses. Micromorphological results reveal spatial variations in dung accumulation, possibly related to differences in the use of space. Phytolith records further provide insights into herbivorous regimes, dominated by a range of grass matter suggested to derive from fodder and/or grazing through the penning lifetime. This integrated approach contributes to the understanding of depositional pathways and taphonomy of penning deposits within built environments, critical for the reconstruction of activity areas and practices related to animal management, foddering/grazing patterns, site formation processes, concepts of space within the settlement, health and the complexity of interactions between people and animals in mountain areas.

AB  - Background and AimsThe deposition of atmospheric nitrogen has increased globally and interfered with plant growth and development. However, only a few studies have examined the influence of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on plant-herbivore interactions in the framework of plant invasion, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, we examined the changes in growth and herbivore resistance of the invasive weed Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native co-occurring congener Alternanthera sessilis in response to simulated nitrogen deposition. We further investigated the competitive ability of these two plant species grown in mono- and mix-culture conditions with or without herbivore pressures.ResultsThe results indicated that simulated nitrogen deposition largely increased the growth of both plant species, while A. philoxeroides produced more biomass than A. sessilis. The specialist and generalist herbivores showed contrasting preferences for the two plant species in the controls, whereas A. philoxeroides showed greater resistance to both herbivore species under simulated nitrogen deposition. Further investigation of host plant traits related to leaf structural and chemical defences suggested that such difference in herbivore resistance between the two plant species could be attributed to the increased levels of structural defense in A. philoxeroides and reduced levels of defensive metabolites in A. sessilis. The inter-specific competition test revealed that simulated nitrogen deposition largely increased the competitive advantage of A. philoxeroides over A. sessilis, regardless of the presence or absence of herbivores.ConclusionOur study suggests that the invasiveness of A. philoxeroides may be enhanced by increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition.

AB  - In this work, an algorithm for enhancing the rating prediction accuracy in collaborative filtering, which does not need any supplementary information, utilising only the users' ratings on items, is presented. This accuracy enhancement is achieved by augmenting the importance of the opinions of 'black sheep near neighbours', which are pairs of near neighbours with opinion agreement on items that deviates from the dominant community opinion on the same item. The presented work substantiates that the weights of near neighbours can be adjusted, based on the degree to which the target user and the near neighbour deviate from the dominant ratings for each item. This concept can be utilized in various other CF algorithms. The experimental evaluation was conducted on six datasets broadly used in CF research, using two user similarity metrics and two rating prediction error metrics. The results show that the proposed technique increases rating prediction accuracy both when used independently and when combined with other CF algorithms. The proposed algorithm is designed to work without the requirements to utilise any supplementary sources of information, such as user relations in social networks and detailed item descriptions. The aforesaid point out both the efficacy and the applicability of the proposed work.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that has become a leading cause of death in recent years. The present study aimed to explore the possible prophylactic effects of Poria cocos essential oil (PCEO) against memory deficits in A beta rats. Adult male Wistar rats were given A beta 1-42 via ICV injection. The effect of 30 d administration of PCEO by oral gavage was investigated. Novel object recognition (NOR) test, Morris water maze (MWM) test, and passive avoidance memory retention (PAM) task were performed. AP decreased the cognitive memory in NOR, spatial memory in MWM, and passive avoidance memory in PAM tests. In contrast, PCEO improved learning and memory in the treated group. The PCEO treatment halts the activity of AChE in the hippocampus and cortex of the AD rats. The central neuronal degeneration in A beta-injected rats was not only ascertained by the histopathological changes but also confirmed indirectly by the concomitant increase in GFAP immunostaining. The beneficial effects in AD of increasing cellular GPx, GR, CAT, Na+ K+ ATPase and GST through the administration of PCEO may not only result in protection against neurodegeneration but also result in improvement in cognitive function. PCEO may be recommended as a prophylactic and/or adjunct medication for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - 1. Surveillance of wildlife diseases poses considerable logistical challenges compared to that of humans or livestock. Citizen science can enable broader coverage, but building an efficient disease monitoring system that relies on hunters is challenging. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a lethal and infectious prion disease of cervids. Improving surveillance is important with the detection of CWD in wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Norway. 2. This study describes the components of an efficient CWD monitoring system utilizing recreational hunters. We report the success of data capture after 6 years of surveillance. We provide an overview of CWD occurrence among the 24 wild reindeer areas and quantify the likelihood of disease absence in areas without detection.. 3. Surveillance aimed to test hunted reindeer aged >= 1 year. With higher quotas and extended hunting seasons, proactive surveillance was implemented in at risk areas. There were several challenges of population demarcation and the lack of surveys required for risk based sampling. Several specific tools for hunters have been developed, including digital apps for rapid reporting and feedback. Laboratory capacity was expanded, and novel statistical tools were developed for the specifics of the sampled tissues. 4. The surveillance (2016-2021) achieved a sample return rate of 61.5% from a maximum of 22,123 harvested reindeer aged >= 1 year. Among these, 64.1% included both relevant tissues (retropharyngeal lymph nodes and brain), yielding 9412 (42.5%) complete samples of harvested reindeer. Samples originating from harvest constituted similar to 5. CWD was detected in 2 of the 24 wild reindeer management areas. The remaining populations had a probability of CWD-freedom from 60% to 99% (mean = 77%) at a design prevalence of 0.5%. 6. Utilizing hunters to monitor wildlife disease appears to be the most realistic option for cervid species. However, the logistical and economic constraints are substantial and pose long -term challenges. Considerable uncertainty about disease occurrence remains even after massive surveillance, and whether management should take preventive actions remains a challenge.

AB  - In this study, we examined whether the frequency of exogenous oestrogen treatment affects the induction of artificial lactation and milk production. Furthermore, we analysed changes in milk components obtained from artificially lactating sows. Pseudopregnant induced by treatment with 30 mg of estradiol dipropionate (EDP) on Day 10 (Day 0 = the last day of estrus) were divided into three groups: those administered 5 mg of EDP once on Day 39 (n = 5), twice on Days 32 and 39 (n = 5) and three times on Days 25, 32 and 39 (n = 6). All animals were treated with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on Day 46 for induced lactation. Artificial lactation was induced in 66.7%-80.0% of sows, and the EDP treatment frequency before PGF2 alpha administration had no significant effect on either the induction rate of artificial lactation or the milk yield during the experimental period. The milk composition (levels of crude protein, crude fat, crude ash, lactose and immunoglobulin) did not differ among the groups. In conclusion, the number of EDP treatments prior to PGF2 alpha administration had no effect on either the efficiency of artificial lactation induction or milk production.

AB  - In this study we assessed the presence and abundance of the rare stem-boring moth Papaipema eryngii (Eryngium stem borer moth) in 24 patches of its host plant (Eryngium yuccifolium) in central Illinois for a period of 3 years. Papaipema eryngii was found consistently in patches with E. yuccifolium, but the percent of E. yuccifolium with evidence of P. eryngii larvae differed from year to year. Furthermore, differences were found among patches and years for E. yuccifolium abundance. This study provides a comprehensive field assessment of the rare moth P. eryngii, allowing for a better understanding of the persistence of the species at a host plant patch, and through time.

AB  - -Comparison of specimens of the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus of two age groups did not show any significant differences. L-cysteine, L-lysine and citric acid have an attractive taste for juveniles (age 1.5 months, body length 6.5-7.0 cm, weight 5-7 g); L-cysteine and citric acid have an attractive taste for adult fish (4 months, 12-15 cm, 45-50 g). The other eight L-amino acids have an indifferent taste for fish of both age groups. Based on the data obtained and the results of other studies, a hypothetical scheme is proposed, according to which the fastest functional transformations of taste reception in fish ontogeny occur after the start of exogenous feeding of larvae and are completed before maturation. Fish of both age groups rarely re-grasp pellets flavored with taste substances, but juveniles spend much more time on pellets orosensory evaluation, up to 1.4-1.6 times. Regardless of the fish age, such an assessment requires more time if the testing of pellets ends with their ingestion. The differences may indicate an undeveloped stereotype of feeding behavior in juveniles of Nile tilapia.

AB  - The hippocampus plays a crucial role in learning and memory, and its progressive deterioration with age is functionally linked to a variety of human neurodegenerative diseases. Yet a systematic profiling of the aging effects on various hippocampal cell types in primates is still missing. Here, we reported a variety of new aging-associated phenotypic changes of the primate hippocampus. These include, in particular, increased DNA damage and heterochromatin erosion with time, alongside loss of proteostasis and elevated inflammation. To understand their cellular and molecular causes, we established the first single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of primate hippocampal aging. Among the 12 identified cell types, neural transiently amplifying progenitor cell (TAPC) and microglia were most affected by aging. In-depth dissection of gene-expression dynamics revealed impaired TAPC division and compromised neuronal function along the neurogenesis trajectory; additionally elevated pro-inflammatory responses in the aged microglia and oligodendrocyte, as well as dysregulated coagulation pathways in the aged endothelial cells may contribute to a hostile microenvironment for neurogenesis. This rich resource for understanding primate hippocampal aging may provide potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions against age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Recycling citrus peel waste offers several significant contributions to sustainability, transforming what would otherwise be discarded into valuable resources. In this study, the colour of sausages stored for 16 days, with varying amounts of orange extract added to the modified casing solution, was evaluated using response surface methodology (RSM) and a hyperspectral imaging system within the spectral range of 350-1100 nm for the first time. To enhance model performance, spectral pre-treatments such as normalisation, first derivative, standard normal variate (SNV), second derivative, and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) were applied. Both raw and pre-treated spectral data, along with colour attributes, were fitted to a partial least squares regression model. The RSM results indicated that the highest R-2 value, 80.61%, was achieved for the b* (yellowness) parameter using a second-order polynomial model. The interactive effects of soy oil and orange extracts on b* were found to be significant (p < 0.05), and the square effects of soy oil on b* were significant at the 1% level. The identified key wavelengths for colour parameters can simplify the model, making it more suitable for practical industrial applications.

AB  - Simple Summary The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly interested in the extraction of phenolic compounds from bergamot pulp, which becomes less available for use in animal feeding. On the other hand, the extraction of phenol compounds generates a new bergamot by-product characterized by a low moisture content and a small concentration of phenolic compounds which are residual after extraction. In light of the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of supplementation of exhausted bergamot by-product in pigs' performance and on the quality of meat and meat products. An investigation was carried out on the effect in pig diet of supplementation with exhausted bergamot by-product, stemming from pharmaceutical industry after extraction of phenolic compounds, on growth performance and on the quality of meat and meat products. Twenty pigs were assigned to two dietary treatments and fed a conventional concentrate (control) or a concentrate including exhausted bergamot by-product at the level of 15% on a DM basis (EB). No significant differences between dietary treatments were found for final weight (p = 0.243), carcass weight (p = 0.679), dry matter intake (p = 0.321). In EB pork, the proportion of docosapentaenoic acid was significantly increased (p < 0.05); it tended to have a greater proportion of n-3 PUFA (p = 0.09), and the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio was lower in EB treatment (p = 0.01). In salami from EB pigs fed, the proportion of alpha-linolenic acid and the total n-3 PUFA were higher than in the control group (p < 0.001). In salami, the TBARS value was lower after 5 days of storage (p < 0.001) in the EB group. Therefore, the present results suggest that the inclusion of exhausted bergamot by-product in pig diet resulted in a qualitative improvement of meat and meat products.

AB  - The intention of the present investigation was to compare a GnRH agonist and hCG as ovulation inducing agents to apply fixed-time insemination in ovsynch synchronized superovulated goats. Three groups of 17 does of the Boer goat breed were synchronized, superovulated and ovulation induced with a GnRH analog, hCG or physiological saline, followed by mating and non-surgical embryo collection. Part of the does were provided with subcutaneous progesterone implants after mating to compensate for frequently occurring premature corpus luteum regression. Estrus detection was conducted with aproned bucks, ovarian function was monitored sonographically and by progesterone analyses and blood samples were drawn to generate LH profiles. Practically all does responded to treatment and occurrence and duration of estrus as well as the ovulatory response were unaffected by treatment. The LH surge provoked by administration of the GnRH analog buserelin emerged within 1.0 h and was closely synchronized, significantly more so than after administration of hCG or physiological saline, commencing after 11.8 and 14.9 h, respectively, with no significant differences amongst each other. It would seem that hCG is not effective in bringing about a LH surge. The interval between commencement of the LH surge and ovulation was, across treatment groups, 24.2 h with no significant difference among groups. Ovulatory response and yield of transferable embryos obtained by nonsurgical collection were modest with no significant differences among groups. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Achieving the appropriate primary stability for immediate or early loading in areas with low-density bone, such as the posterior maxilla, is challenging. A three-dimensional (3D) stabilization implant design featuring a tapered body with continuous cutting flutes along the length of the external thread form, with a combination of curved and linear geometric surfaces on the thread's crest, has the capacity to enhance early biomechanical and osseointegration outcomes compared to implants with traditional buttressed thread profiles. Commercially available implants with a buttress thread design (TP), and an experimental implant that incorporated the 3D stabilization trimmed-thread design (TP 3DS) were used in this study. Six osteotomies were surgically created in the ilium of adult sheep (N = 14). Osteotomy sites were randomized to receive either the TP or TP 3DS implant to reduce site bias. Subjects were allowed to heal for either 3 or 12 weeks (N = 7 sheep/time point), after which samples were collected en bloc (including the implants and surrounding bone) and implants were either subjected to bench-top biomechanical testing (e.g., lateral loading), histological/histomorphometric analysis, or nanoindentation testing. Both implant designs yielded high insertion torque (ITV >= 30 N.cm) and implant stability quotient (ISQ >= 70) values, indicative of high primary stability. Qualitative histomorphological analysis revealed that the TP 3DS group exhibited a continuous bone-implant interface along the threaded region, in contrast to the TP group at the early, 3-week, healing time point. Furthermore, TP 3DS's cutting flutes along the entire length of the implant permitted the distribution of autologous bone chips within the healing chambers. Histological evaluation at 12 weeks revealed an increase in woven bone containing a greater presence of lacunae within the healing chambers in both groups, consistent with an intramembranous-like healing pattern and absence of bone dieback. The TP 3DS macrogeometry yielded a similar to 66% increase in average lateral load during pushout testing at baseline (T = 0 weeks, p = 0.036) and significantly higher bone-to-implant contact (BIC) values at 3 weeks post-implantation (p = 0.006), relative to the traditional TP implant. In a low-density (Type IV) bone model, the TP 3DS implant demonstrated improved performance compared to the conventional TP, as evidenced by an increase in baseline lateral loading capacity and increased BIC during the early stages of osseointegration. These findings indicate that the modified implant configuration of the TP 3DS facilitates more favorable biomechanical integration and may promote more rapid and stable bone anchorage under compromised bone quality conditions. Therefore, such improvements could have important clinical implications for the success and longevity of dental implants placed in regions with low bone density.

AB  - A juvenile of Rhinopias cf. argoliba 28 mm SL collected in the western part of the Pacific Ocean eastward of the Philippines is described. It is characterized by an incomplete metamorphosis with some larval characters retained such as the developed spination and relatively straight dorsal contour of the head, absence of the scales and the branched fin rays (except in pelvic fins), and a long penultimate dorsal-fin spine. Comparison of this juvenile with juveniles of R. aphanes 11-22 mm SL reveals the diagnostic importance of the pigmentation of the pectoral fin which disappears in the adult fishes. A possible synonymy of the genera Rhinopias and Pogonoscorpius was repeatedly supposed by the former authors. The poorly-known Pogonoscorpius sechellensis retains the features characteristic for the species of Rhinopias from the earliest ontogenetic stages only, and probably represents a neotenic species of the latter genus.

AB  - In the context of xenotransplantation, the production of genetically modified pigs is essential. For several years, knock-out pigs were generated through somatic cell nuclear transfer employing donor cells with the desired genetic modifications, which resulted in a lengthy and cumbersome procedure. The CRISPR/Cas9 system enables direct targeting of specific genes in zygotes directly through microinjection or electroporation. However, these techniques require improvement to minimize mosaicism and low mutation rates without compromising embryo survival. This study aimed to determine the gene editing potential of these two techniques to deliver multiplexed ribonucleotide proteins (RNPs) to generate triple-knock-out porcine embryos with a multi-transgenic background. We designed RNP complexes targeting the major porcine xenoantigens GGTA1, CMAH, and B4GALNT2. We then compared the development of mosaicism and gene editing efficiencies between electroporation and microinjection. Our results indicated a significant effect of voltage increase on molecule intake in electroporated embryos, without it notably affecting the blastocyst formation rate. Our gene editing analysis revealed differences among delivery approaches and gene loci. Notably, employing electroporation at 35 V yielded the highest frequency of biallelic disruptions. However, mosaicism was the predominant genetic variant in all RNP delivery methods, underscoring the need for further research to optimize multiplex genome editing in porcine zygotes.

AB  - Commercial gestation housing systems for sows generally fail to cater fully for their needs in terms of comfort or the ability to perform highly motivated behaviours, which can lead to chronic stress and an impairment to welfare. We compared a typical gestation system (CONTROL) with an IMPROVED one as regards oral stereotypies, aggressive behaviour, skin lesions, locomotion, and tear staining. Sows were mixed into 12 stable groups (six groups per treatment, 20 sows per group), 29 days post-service in pens with free-access, full-length individual feeding/lying stalls. CONTROL pens had fully slatted concrete floors, with two blocks of wood and two chains suspended in the group area. IMPROVED pens were the same but with rubber mats and a length of manila rope in each feeding stall, and straw provided in three racks in the group area. Direct observations of oral stereotypical (30 instantaneous scans per sow per day) and aggressive (all-occurrence sampling, 3 h per sow per day) behaviours were conducted 72 h post-mixing, in mid and late gestation. Skin lesions were counted 24 h and three weeks post-mixing, and in late gestation. Sows' locomotion (locomotory ability) was scored using a visual analogue scale in mid and late gestation. Right and left eye tear staining was scored in late gestation. Indications of better welfare in IMPROVED sows included performance of fewer oral stereotypies in mid and late gestation, and lower tear stain scores. These sows performed more aggression in late gestation, which was associated with access to enrichment, but skin lesion counts were not affected. Thus, the changes made in the IMPROVED treatment benefitted aspects of sow welfare.

AB  - Despite its importance in gamete utilization for livestock production, poultry semen cryopreservation in a liquid state, is limited in the poultry industry due to a significant decline in sperm viability and functionality during liquid storage. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is released from gram-negative bacteria and impairs sperm function in mammals. Using exogeneous LPS, we show this endotoxin compromises sperm viability and function, including motility and penetrability to the inner peri-vitelline layer (IPVL) during liquid storage at 4 degrees C. This outcome was supported by LPS quantification showing an extreme increase in the first 24 h of storage. Polymyxin B (PMB) is an LPS neutralizer previously shown to improve fertility in boar semen, thus we explored the effect of PMB on chicken semen quality during liquid storage. Sperm viability and penetrability tests showed that PMB completely abolishes the deleterious effect by LPS. However, co-addition of PMB with penicillin G (PenG), an antibiotic against gram positive bacteria, reduces IPVL-penetrability while improving sperm viability post-storage. Furthermore, artificial insemination trials showed that PMB addition improves semen fertility at the post liquid storage. Our results show that chicken semen quality during liquid storage is impaired by bacterial LPS, but improved by PMB addition due to cancelled endotoxic effects, which offers a new approach for prolonged fertility of poultry semen storage in a liquid state.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pharma-grade extractive chondroitin sulfate (CS) is widely used for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Recently, unsulfated biofermentative chondroitin (BC) proved positive effects in OA in vitro model. This study, based on primary pathological human synoviocytes, aimed to analyze, by a multiplex assay, a panel of OA-related biomarkers in response to short-term treatments with bovine (CSb), pig (CSp) and fish (CSf) chondroitins, in comparison to BC. As expected, all samples had anti-inflammatory properties, however CSb, CSf and especially BC affected more cytokines and chemokines. Based on these results and molecular weight similarity, CSf and BC were selected to further explore the synoviocytes' response. In fact, Western blot analyses showed CSf and BC were comparable, downregulating OA-related biomarkers such as the proteins mTOR, NF-kB, PTX-3 and COMP-2. Proteomic analyses, performed by applying a nano-LC-MS/MS TMT isobaric labelling-based approach, displayed the modulation of both common and distinct molecules to chondroitin treatments. Thus, CSf and BC modulated the biological mediators involved in the inflammation cascade, matrix degradation/remodeling, glycosaminoglycans' synthesis and cellular homeostasis. This study helps in shedding light on different molecular mechanisms related to OA disease that may be potentially affected not only by animal-source chondroitin sulfate but also by unsulfated biofermentative chondroitin.

AB  - Featured Application Based on beneficial properties involving postbiotic activity, the strain Lactococcus lactis MK1/3 was indicated as a potential additive for the dairy industry.Abstract Raw goat milk-derived Lactococcus lactis MK1/3 (CCM 9209) was studied to show its potential for use in the dairy industry. Finding an innovative strain indicates having a new safe, original additive for functional food. The strain has been shown to be safe using a model experiment with Balb/c mice, when no mortality was noted. Its counts were increased continually during 120 days, with the highest value on day 90 (4.38 +/- 1.24 colony-forming unit per gram (CFU/g, log 10). In vivo (in the experimental mice), anti-staphylococcal effect was noted with difference 1.82 log cycles. The safety of the strain MK1/3 has been also indicated by the fact that it did not produce damaging enzymes, it has been susceptible to antibiotics, and it has shown low-grade biofilm-forming ability (0.126 +/- 0.35). This strain has tolerated bile, and low pH sufficiently. It produced a postbiotic active substance with inhibitory activity against cheese and milk contaminants (Enterococci), reaching antimicrobial activity up to 3200 AU/mL. The count of the strain MK1/3 was higher in yogurts from ewe goat milk (4.66 +/- 0.30 CFU/g, log 10), in comparison with its count in yogurts from ewe milk (4.10 +/- 0.10 CFU/g, log 10), with no influencing yogurt pH. Its use in 100% starter culture to process fresh cheese based on goat milk was revealed in the standard cheese quality with sufficient amount of lactic acid microbiota. To support the benefit of the strain MK1/3, additional human trials have been reinforced.

AB  - Heat stress is causing serious problems in crop production, leading to catastrophic losses in crop yield worldwide. The study was conducted to evaluate the role of thiourea to ameliorate the negative impact of high-temperature stress on plant growth, seed yield, and seed oil content in camelina. The study comprised of (i) camelina genotypes, Australian and Canadian; (ii) temperature stress, normal (25/18 degrees C) and heat stress (38/25 degrees C); (iii) thiourea supplementation (1000 mg L-1), NA= no application (control), WA(1)= water application at vegetative stage-31 DAS, TU1= thiourea application at vegetative stage, WA(2)= water application at the reproductive stage-59 DAS, and TU2= thiourea application at the reproductive stage. Water application at both growth stages was taken as control. Heat stress caused significant reduction in plant water relations and photosynthetic pigments which suppressed plant growth and yield attributes of camelina genotypes. High-temperature stress reduced the seed yield and seed oil content in the tested camelina genotypes, whereas an increase in seed protein content was noted under heat stress as compared with no stress (control). However, thiourea applications ameliorated the injuries caused by heat stress-induced oxidative damages through increase in antioxidative enzymes activities, osmotic adjustment, and maintenance of tissue water relations which contributed to improving seed yield and seed oil contents over no thiourea application (control). Thiourea application at the reproductive stage was more effective than the vegetative stage. Among the genotypes, the Canadian genotype was more heat-tolerant than the Australian genotype. Moreover, the Canadian camelina was more responsive to thiourea application than the Australian genotype as indicated by improvement in plant physicochemical attributes, seed yield, and seed oil content. Thiourea applications improved the seed and oil yields in camelina genotypes by modulating the plant water relations, regulation of soluble sugars, and the activation of enzymatic antioxidants under heat stress.

AB  - In maize (Zea mays ssp. mays), agriculturally damaging herbivores include lepidopteran insects, such as the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis), and distantly related arthropods, like the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae). A small number of maize lines, including B96 and B75, are highly resistant to both herbivores, and B96 is also resistant to thrips. Using T. urticae as a representative pest that causes significant leaf tissue damage, we examined the gene expression responses of these lines to herbivory in comparison with each other and with the susceptible line B73. Upon herbivory, the most resistant line, B96, showed the strongest gene expression response, with a dramatic upregulation of genes associated with jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling, as well as the biosynthesis of specialized herbivore deterrent compounds, such as death acids and benzoxazinoids. Extending this work with allele-specific expression analyses in F-1 hybrids, we inferred that the concerted upregulation of many defense genes, including the majority of benzoxazinoid biosynthetic genes in B96, as compared with B73, for the herbivore treatment, resulted from an assemblage of trans control and multiple cis effects acting with similar directionality on gene expression. Further, at the level of individual and potentially rate limiting genes in several major defense pathways, cis and trans effects acted in a reinforcing manner to result in exceptionally high expression in B96. Our study provides a comprehensive resource of cis elements for maize lines important in breeding efforts for herbivore resistance, and reveals potential genetic underpinnings of the origins of multi-herbivore resistance in plant populations.

AB  - Background Older individuals have been reported to suffer from cognitive disorders after surgery. Various types of surgical trauma have been used to establish postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) animal models in preclinical studies. However, few comparative analyses of these animal models were conducted.
   Methods Tibial surgery, abdominal surgery, and extended abdominal surgery were performed on aged ICR mice to establish POCD models. Behavioral tests included open field, novel object recognition, fear conditioning, and Morris water maze tests. The Z-score methodology was adopted to obtain a comprehensive and integrated memory performance profile. The changes in hippocampal neuroinflammation were analyzed by ELISA, PCR, and immunofluorescence.
   Results In this study, we found that each type of non-cardiac surgical trauma has a different effects on locomotor activity. Tibial and extended abdominal surgeries led to more significant cognitive impairment than abdominal surgery. Inflammatory cytokines peaked on postoperative day 1 and decreased to control levels on days 3 and 7. Hippocampal neuroinflammation indicators between the three surgery types on postoperative day 1 had no statistical differences.
   Conclusion Overall, the type and intensity of non-cardiac surgical trauma can affect cognitive behavioral outcomes and central inflammation. The shortcomings and emerging issues of POCD animal research methods need to be further studied and solved.

AB  - Simple Summary Antibiotics benefit animal growth performance and health. However, an overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic residue and the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Considering the possible serious consequences of antibiotic overuse, non-antibiotic alternatives, such as yeast and yeast products, are widely used in animal diets to improve growth and productive performance. Geese are important poultry, and their meat provides high-quality protein to humans, but studies showing how yeast culture affect geese are limited. On this basis, the effects of dietary yeast culture supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood metabolites, and immune functions of geese were studies. The results showed that the dietary addition of yeast culture could improve growth performance and nutrient digestibility and can modulate the immune response of geese. This dietary strategy based on feed additives is an effective method for improving the growth efficiency of the geese. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary yeast culture (YC) supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood metabolites, and immune functions in geese. One-day-old Sichuan white geese (n = 300) were randomly divided into five groups containing 0 (control), 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 4.0% of YC in the diet for 70 days. In general, the dietary supplementation of YC significantly increased the average daily gain and feed conversion ratio (p < 0.05) in which the 1.0% or 2.0% levels were better and significantly reduced the average daily feed intake at the 2.0% level (p < 0.05). YC supplementation increased digestibility of P (quadratic, p = 0.01) and gross energy (quadratic, p = 0.04) from days 23 to 27 and crude protein from days 23 to 27 and days 64 to 68 (quadratic, p <= 0.05), with the 2.0% level being the most effective. Serum metabolites were significantly affected by dietary YC (p < 0.05). Supplemental YC increased IL-2 on day 28 (linear, p = 0.01; quadratic, p = 0.04) and lysozyme on day 70 (quadratic, p = 0.04) and decreased complement C4 on day 70 (linear, p = 0.05). Interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha genes were mostly up-regulated after YC supplementation, and interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 gene expression levels were significantly increased at the 2.0% level (p < 0.05). Taken together, dietary YC supplementation improved growth performance and affected nutrient digestibility, serum metabolites, and immune function in geese, which was optimized at the 2% YC level in the present study.

AB  - Upon damage by herbivores, plants release herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). To find their prey, the pest's natural enemies need to be fine-tuned to the composition of these volatiles. Whereas standard methods can be used in the identification and quantitation of HIPVs, more recently introduced techniques such as PTR-ToF-MS provide temporal patterns of the volatile release and detect additional compounds. In this study, we compared the volatile profile of apple trees infested with two aphid species, the green apple aphid Aphis pomi, and the rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea, by CLSA-GC-MS complemented by PTR-ToF-MS. Compounds commonly released in conjunction with both species include nonanal, decanal, methyl salicylate, geranyl acetone, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl 2-methyl-butanoate, (E)-beta-caryophyllene, beta-bourbonene and (Z)-3-hexenyl benzoate. In addition, benzaldehyde and (E)-beta-farnesene were exclusively associated with A. pomi, whereas linalool, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene were exclusively associated with D. plantaginea. PTR-ToF-MS additionally detected acetic acid (AA) and 2-phenylethanol (PET) in the blends of both trees attacked by aphid species. In the wind tunnel, the aphid predator, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens), responded strongly to a blend of AA and PET, much stronger than to AA or PET alone. The addition of common and species-specific HIPVs did not increase the response to the binary blend of AA and PET. In our setup, two host-associated volatiles AA + PET appeared sufficient in the attraction of C. carnea. Our results also show the importance of combining complementary methods to decipher the odor profile associated with plants under pest attack and identify behaviourally active components for predators.

AB  - Simple Summary Cytochrome P450s are a group of detoxification enzymes found in all animals. They are highly diverse, with multiple copies of different families of these genes in individual organisms, especially those that need to digest chemically-defended foods, such as toxic plants. The stick insects are a group of leaf-feeding herbivores whose diets can include toxic species, such as Eucalyptus, so this study sought to identify what groups of cytochrome P450s are expressed in the digestive tracts of six species of stick insects and how they evolved. The results show a complement of detoxification genes comparable to or slightly more limited than those of other insects, except for multiple enzymes per species in the subfamily CYP15A1, while most insects will only have one enzyme in this group. The functions of these expanded enzyme groups should be investigated further. Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are xenobiotic detoxification genes found in most eukaryotes, and linked in insects to the tolerance of plant secondary chemicals and insecticide resistance. The number and diversity of CYP clans, families, and subfamilies that an organism produces could correlate with its dietary breadth or specialization. This study examined the CYP diversity expressed in the midguts of six species of folivorous stick insects (Phasmatodea), to identify their CYP complement and see if any CYPs correlate with diet toxicity or specialization, and see what factors influenced their evolution in this insect order. CYP genes were mined from six published Phasmatodea transcriptomes and analyzed phylogenetically. The Phasmatodea CYP complement resembles that of other insects, though with relatively low numbers, and with significant expansions in the CYP clades 6J1, 6A13/14, 4C1, and 15A1. The CYP6 group is known to be the dominant CYP family in insects, but most insects have no more than one CYP15 gene, so the function of the multiple CYP15A1 genes in Phasmatodea is unknown, with neofunctionalization following gene duplication hypothesized. No correlation was found between CYPs and diet specialization or toxicity, with some CYP clades expanding within the Phasmatodea and others likely inherited from a common ancestor.

TI  - The role of rye bran and antibiotics on the digestion, fermentation process and short-chain fatty acid production and absorption in an intact pig model
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - The effects of arabinoxylan (AX)-rich rye bran based diet (RB) and antibiotics on digestion, fermentation and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) absorption were studied compared with an iso-dietary fibre (DF) cellulose based diet (CEL). Thirty female pigs (body weight 72.5 +/- 3.9 kg) were fed a standard swine diet in week 1, CEL as wash-out for bran-associated bioactive components in week 2 and then divided into 3 groups fed either the CEL (n = 10) or RB (n = 20) for 2 weeks, where 10 pigs from RB had daily intramuscular antibiotic injections (RB+) and the other 10 pigs were untreated (RB-) in week 4. In RB, the degradation of AX mainly occurred in caecum and proximal colon (P < 0.01) and to a higher extent than cellulose, which on the other hand, irrespective of antibiotic treatment, was less degraded in the RB groups than in the CEL (P < 0.01). The apparent digestibility of fat and protein in the distal small intestine was lower for RB than CEL (P < 0.05), the protein digestibility remained lower in most of the colon, and the digestibility was not affected by treatment with antibiotics. The colonic concentrations of SCFA, acetate and propionate as well as the butyrate concentration in the distal colon were lower with the RB treatments compared with CEL (P < 0.01). Caecal butyrate concentrations were on the other hand higher, and a significant reduction was seen with antibiotic treatment (P < 0.001). The daily net absorption of SCFA and acetate was lower with RB than with CEL (P < 0.01). In conclusion, RB resulted in different DF degradation processes and SCFA production compared with CEL, whereas antibiotic treatment had marginal effects on the intestinal DF degradation but hampered butyrate production.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd), an environmental toxic heavy metal, has been reported to cause testicular toxicity, which contributes to the recent decline in male fertility worldwide. Quercetin (Qcn), a major dietary antioxidant, has been shown to have protective effects under various pathological conditions. However, whether Qcn provides protection against Cd-stimulated testicular toxicity remains obscured. The present study was therefore aimed at investigating the ameliorative effect of Qcn supplementation on Cd-induced toxicity in the goat testis in vitro in a dose-(10, 50, and 100 mu M) and time-dependent (4 and 8 h) manner. Different cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and biochemical analyses have been carried out using appropriate methods. Cytotoxicity in testicular cells induced by Cd treatment was apparently mitigated by Qcn treatment, evidenced by decreased apoptotic attributes or frequency in Qcn plus Cd-treated groups compared to the only Cd-treated groups. Qcn treatment provides substantial protection to the Cd-triggered aggression in oxidative (increased MDA levels) and total antioxidant capacity (reduced FRAP activity) in testicular tissue, indicating the anti-oxidative function of Qcn against Cd exposure. Moreover, Cd-induced decline in antioxidant status (CAT, SOD, and GST activity) was markedly restored by Qcn supplementation in testicular tissue. In conclusion, this study shows that Qcn treatment significantly attenuated the Cd-evoked testicular damage, suggesting its beneficial potential in preventing or at least in managing the gonadotoxicity in males induced by steadily increasing Cd contamination in the environment.

AB  - Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) affects many women, especially after menopause. POP occurs due to the descent of weakened supportive tissue. Current prolapse surgeries have high failure rates, due to disturbed wound healing caused by lower tissue regeneration and estrogen depletion. Absorbable poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) knit implants exhibited improved cell and tissue response leading to less complications from prolapse surgery. This study aims to enhance wound healing and improve surgical outcomes by using an electrospun (ES) P4HB scaffold (ES P4HB) that emulates natural tissue structure. Further 17 beta-estradiol (E2)-a prominent wound healing factor-is incorporated into the scaffold (ES P4HB-E2). Parous Dohne Merino sheep underwent posterior vaginal wall implantation of either P4HB (n = 6) or 17 beta-estradiol relasing P4HB-E2 (n = 6) scaffolds, or underwent native tissue repair (NTR) (n = 4). Vaginal explants were compared for short-term host response in terms of gross necropsy, histomorphology, biomechanics, tissue-integration, and degradation of P4HB at 3-months post-implantation. Both scaffolds show promising results with enhanced mechanical properties and increased macrophage infiltration compared to NTR, but without differences between scaffolds. Thus, it seems electrospun P4HB scaffolds already improve tissue integration and healing. Further long-term studies are needed before these scaffolds can be used in clinical practice.

AB  - Lipids in cumulus-oocyte complexes are important actors in molecular signalling pathways and are influenced by maturation conditions. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) is a carrier involved in fatty acid transport and is a promoter of beta-oxidation. Although the embryonic development potential of oocytes can be improved when ALC is added to the maturation medium, the effects of ALC on the lipid content and composition of oocytes and cumulus cells remain unknown. In this study, the effect of ALC supplementation on the lipid profiles of buffalo oocytes and cumulus cells after in vitro maturation was evaluated using positive-ion matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis was used to analyse the data. The lipid profiles of oocytes and cumulus cells differed following ALC treatment. Four lipids were significantly different in oocytes and eight in granulosa cells. ALC treatment significantly reduced the cellular content of these lipids, with the exception of phosphatidylcholine [PC(36:3) + H] + in oocytes and triacylglycerol [TAG(58:8) + NH4] + in granulosa cells. Further staining experiments confirmed that ALC treatment reduced the total lipid content in oocytes. Therefore, ALC treatment alters lipid metabolism in oocytes and cumulus cells during their maturation and accelerates lipid metabolism in oocytes. The findings of this study demonstrate that ALC enhances the rate of oocyte maturation by altering lipid metabolism in oocytes, providing both a clear direction for further research into regulatory mechanisms as well as a foundation for further improving oocyte maturation rates.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of tea residue combined with complex enzymes on the growth performance, serum biochemistry, meat quality, and intestinal microbiota of Xiangling fattening pigs. A total of 120 healthy Xiangling fattening pigs, with an average weight of 47.93 kg (+/- 15.28 kg), were randomly assigned to five treatment groups, each comprising four replicates of six pigs. The control group (CON) received a basal diet; the experimental groups received a diet containing 5.8% fermented tea residue as an alternative energy and protein source (dry matter basis) and mixed additional 0 (CZ), 200 (M200), 400 (M400), and 800 (M800) complex enzymes. The trial lasted for 83 days. The results showed that tea residue and complex enzymes failed to affect growth performance (p > 0.05). Tea residue reduced the serum aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities (p < 0.01), and complex enzyme supplementation lowered the total cholesterol levels and reduced the alanine aminotransferase activity (p < 0.05). Additionally, tea residue decreased the pH(24h) and b*(1h) values (p < 0.05), and complex enzyme supplementation increased the L*(24h) value and pork shear force (p < 0.05). In terms of amino acid content, tea residue significantly elevated aspartic acid and inosine monophosphate (p < 0.05), and complex enzyme addition increased the glutamic acid, lysine, alanine, valine, tyrosine, isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine levels (p < 0.05). The 800 mg/kg complex enzyme group exhibited a reduction in the C10:0, C15:0, and C17:0 contents (p < 0.05). Microbial analysis showed that tea residue promoted the abundance of Oribacterium and Butyricicoccus, while enzyme supplementation enriched Eggerthellaceae, Oscillospirales, and Peptococcaceae. Overall, the combination of tea residue and complex enzymes improved the pork quality, enhanced metabolic health markers, and modulated the gut microbiota composition, with the 400 mg/kg enzyme dose (M400) achieving the most pronounced benefits. These findings suggest a potential feeding strategy for improving pork quality without compromising growth performance.

AB  - Models of transient synovitis that can be controlled with antiinflammatory and analgesic drugs have been used to study pain amelioration. To this end, we aimed to determine the dose of intraarticularly administered E. coli LPS that induced signs of synovitis without systemic signs in clinically healthy male castrated sheep (n = 14). In phase 1, a single dose of LPS (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 ng in a total volume of 0.5 mL) was administered into the right stifle joint. In phase 2, a dose of LPS (1.0 or 2.0 mu g) in 0.3 mL was administered to 4 naive sheep. In phase 3, 4 sheep from phase 1 were inoculated after a 60 d washout period with either 0.5 or 1.0 mu g of LPS. During the first 48 h after LPS administration, the following were performed: assessment of clinical parameters; scoring for lameness, pain on limb flexion, and local swelling; and ultrasonography of the joints were performed. The doses tested during phase 1 produced subtle signs. During phase 2, mild to moderate lameness with no evidence of systemic signs occurred at both doses. In phase 3, clinical responses were similar between the 0.5- and 1-mu g doses. Signs of swelling were not observed at any time. Therefore, we consider the 0.5-mu g to be the most appropriate for this model, because it was the lowest dose tested capable of causing lameness without signs of systemic inflammation in all animals.

AB  - Asian and African elephants show morphological adaptations to their ecological niche including the oral cavity. Variety and preferences of forage plants differ between both herbivorous elephant species. Diet can affect salivary enzymes. Asian elephants were shown to have a higher salivary amylase activity than African elephants. Species-specific differences were presumed to be influenced by feeding during collection procedure. This study aimed to determine the influence of feeding on enzyme activities in saliva of both elephant species to differentiate from species-specific effects. Additionally, season and housing conditions on salivary enzyme activities in non-fed elephants of both species were investigated. Salivary amylase (sAA), lysozyme (sLYS) and peroxidase (sPOD) activity were measured photometrically or fluorometrically. Results of this study reinforce previous observations of higher basic sAA activity in Asian elephants compared to African elephants. Salivary LYS and sPOD activity showed neither species-specific nor housing-specific differences. Independent from season, most elephants of both species revealed a lack of or low sPOD activity. Feeding caused a temporary decrease of sAA, sLYS and sPOD activity in both elephant species kept in four of eight tested zoos. Furthermore, sAA activity in Asian elephants was higher and sLYS activity lower in Spring than in Autumn. This study summarizes that sAA and sLYS are components of Asian and African elephant saliva in an active conformation in contrast to sPOD. Diet varying between season and zoos might influence sAA and sLYS activities primarily in Asian elephants but temporary low effects suggest sufficient buffer capacity of elephant saliva of both species.

AB  - Infantile amnesia, the inability to form long-lasting episodic memories, is a phenomenon extensively known but with no clear understanding of its origins. However, a recent study showed that high rates of hippocampal postnatal neurogenesis degrade episodic-like memories in infants a few days after memory acquisition. Additionally, new studies indicate that exposure to an enriched environment in mice leads to high hippocampal neurogenesis in their offspring. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how this intergenerational trait affects the persistence of hippocampal memories. Therefore, we evaluated spatial memory retention in the offspring of enriched female mice after weaning to address this question. Ten days after spatial learning, we tested memory retention, observing that the offspring of enriched dams increased spatial memory failure; this finding correlates with high proliferation rates in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we evaluated the causal relationship between postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis and memory failure using the antiproliferative drug Temozolomide (TMZ), which rescued spatial memory retrieval. Finally, we evaluated neuronal activity in the hippocampus quantifying the cells expressing the immediate early gene c-Fos. This evaluation showed engram modifications between groups. This neural activity pattern indicates that the high neurogenesis rates can modify memory engrams and cognitive performance. In conclusion, the inherited increase of hippocampal neurogenesis by enriched dams leads to plastic changes that exacerbate infantile amnesia in a spatial task.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPlant pathogenic fungal infections have become a severe threat to the yield and quality of agricultural products, and new green antifungal agents with high efficiency and low toxicity are needed. In this study, a series of thiasporine A derivatives containing phenylthiazole-1,3,4-oxadiazole thione (ketone) structures were designed and synthesized, and their antifungal activities against six invasive and highly destructive phytopathogenic fungi were evaluated. RESULTSThe results found that all compounds showed moderate to potent antifungal activity against six phytopathogenic fungi, and most of the E series compounds showed remarkable antifungal activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Colletotrichum camelliaet. In particular, compounds E1-E5, E7, E8, E13, E14, E17, and E22 showed more significant antifungal activity against S. sclerotiorum, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 0.22, 0.48, 0.56, 0.65, 0.51, 0.39, 0.60, 0.56, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.45 mu g mL(-1), respectively, which were superior to that of carbendazim (0.70 mu g mL(-1)). Further activity studies showed that compound E1 possessed superior curative activities against S. sclerotiorum in vivo and better inhibitory effects on sclerotia germination and the formation of S. sclerotiorum compared with those of carbendazim. CONCLUSIONSThis study indicates that these thiasporine A derivatives containing phenylthiazole-1,3,4-oxadiazole thione structures might be used as antifungal agents against S. sclerotiorum.

AB  - The establishment of lateral organs and subsequent plant architecture involves factors intrinsic to the stem apical meristem (SAM) from which they are derived. KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes are a family of plant-specific homeobox transcription factors that especially act in determining stem cell fate in SAM. Although KNOXs have been studied in many land plants for decades, there is a dearth of knowledge on KNOX's role in Orchidaceae, the largest and most diverse lineage of flowering plants. In this study, a total of 32 putative KNOX genes were identified in the genomes of five orchid species and further designated into two classes (Class I and Class II) based on phylogenetic relationships. Sequence analysis showed that most orchid KNOX proteins retain four conserved domains (KNOX1, KNOX2, ELK, and Homeobox_KN). Comparative analysis of gene structure showed that the exon-intron structure is conserved in the same clade but most orchids exhibited longer intron, which may be a unique feature of Orchidaceae. Cis-elements identified in the promoter region of orchid KNOXs were found mostly enriched in a function of light responsiveness, followed by MeJA and ABA responsiveness, indicative of their roles in modulating light and phytohormones. Collinear analysis unraveled a one-to-one correspondence among KNOXs in orchids, and all KNOX genes experienced strong purifying selection, indicating the conservation of this gene family has been reinforced across the Orchidaceae lineage. Expression profiles based on transcriptomic data and real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed a stem-specific expression of KNOX Class I genes and a broader expression pattern of Class II genes. Taken together, our results provided a comprehensive analysis to uncover the underlying function of KNOX genes in Orchidaceae.

AB  - Nitrogen and phytopathogen alter plant organic volatiles that attract insect herbivores and their natural enemies. However, the interactive effects of nitrogen input and pathogen infection on volatile-mediated insect behavior are poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of nitrogen application and bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) on tri-trophic interactions involving rice plant, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, and its egg parasitoid Anagrus nilaparvatae on a temporal scale. Both N. lugens and A. nilaparvatae showed an obvious preference for Xooinfected rice plants, but such preferences depended on nitrogen application. With prolonged Xoo infection and nitrogen fertilizer input, N. lugens and A. nilaparvatae preferred Xoo-infected plants. One possible mechanism was that the input nitrogen increased plant resistance to Xoo, which thus delayed the impact of Xoo infection on behavior of N. lugens and A. nilaparvatae. Further analyses indicated that the plant phytohormone JA regulated rice volatiles composition altering N. lugens preference, while SA regulated N. lugens-induced rice volatiles composition altering A. nilaparvatae preference. Moreover, with the development of the disease, Xoo infection had greater effects on plant volatiles and phytohormones than nitrogen fertilizer. Together, this finding provides new insights into how nitrogen application interacts with Xoo infection to modulate interactions among rice plants, N. lugens, and A. nilaparvatae.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) contamination in plants and soil poses significant risks to livestock, particularly sheep. Cd exposure often leads to severe gastrointestinal diseases in sheep that are difficult to treat. Milk-derived exosomes, particularly those from sheep milk (SM-Exo), have shown potential in treating gastrointestinal disorders, though their efficacy in Cd-induced colitis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of SM-Exo in a Cd-induced colitis model. Hu sheep were exposed to Cd, and their fecal microbiota were collected to prepare bacterial solutions for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice. The changes in gut microbiota and gene expression were analyzed through microbiome and transcriptomics. Our results showed that prior to treatment, harmful bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides and Parabacteroides) were increased in FMT mice. SM-Exo treatment increased beneficial bacteria, particularly Lachnoclostridium, and activated the Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) pathway, upregulating genes like Adcy1, Adcy3, CREB, and Sst. These changes were linked to reduced Cd-induced cell death and alleviation of colonic inflammation. In conclusion, SM-Exo appears to be a promising treatment for Cd-induced colitis, likely through modulation of the gut microbiota and activation of the cAMP pathway.

AB  - Based on research 1995-2020, abundant and potentially commercial fish in Russian watersof the Chukchi Sea have been identified. In total, 72 species were recorded in trawl catches, 16 species from six families were abundant, among which smelts (Osmeridae), salmons (Salmonidae), and herrings (Clupeidae) accounted for an average of 1.5, 0.2, and 0.1% of the total commercial marine fish biomass, respectively. For the species of the analyzed families, the size-age and weight characteristics, features of linear and weight growth, timing, scale and conditions of spawning were considered. The biological indicators of fish from the Chukchi and Bering seas and other water bodies were compared. Saffron cod Eleginus gracilis, Arctic rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax dentex, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, and some species of sculpins were represented mainly by juveniles and immature individuals, older fish appeared in climatically warm years. Walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, Pacific salmons, Alaska plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, and starry flounder Platichthys stellatus were characterized by the presence of older individuals. In polar cod Boreogadus saida, Bering flounder Hippoglossoides robustus, yellowfin sole Limanda aspera, Sakhalin sole L. sakhalinensis, longhead dab L. proboscidea, Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, Pacific capelin Mallotus villosus catervarius, and warty sculpin Myoxocephalus verrucosus smaller body sizes were recorded for the specimens caught at the Chukchi Sea shelf comparing to those from the Bering Sea.

AB  - Sturgeon species are commercially important species in finfish aquaculture industry. Till now, a small number of studies have been reported on the immune responses in sturgeon species against infectious diseases. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in fish immunoglobulins (Igs) are essential to evaluate the humoral immune response. This study aimed to produce, characterize, and evaluate the polyclonal antisera against stellate sturgeon Igs. For the production of polyclonal antibodies against fish Igs, stellate sturgeon serum Igs was isolated using the ammonium sulfate precipitation method. The purified Igs with the Freund adjuvant was injected subcutaneously in to sheep ( Ovis aries ). Then, anti- stellate sturgeon Ig antibody titer and specificity were determined using ELISA and Western blot techniques. Stellate sturgeon Ig antibodies were detected in the immunized animals and were significantly higher in the immunized group compared to the non -immunized group. The polyclonal antisera showed a high specificity to the immunoglobulin heavy )H( chain of stellate sturgeon and moderately crossreacted with the immunoglobulin H chain in Siberian ( Acipenser baerii ) and ship ( A. nudiventris ) sturgeons but did not show reactivity with rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) serum Igs . It was indicated that the produced polyclonal antisera should be further investigated to be used for immune -diagnostic purposes in sturgeon species upon exposure to various infectious diseases.

AB  - Distance determination with pulsed EPR has become an important technique for the structural investigation of biomacromolecules, with double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER) as the most important method. GdIII-based spin labels are one of the most frequently used spin labels for DEER owing to their stability against reduction, high magnetic moment, and absence of orientation selection. A disadvantage of GdIII-GdIII DEER is the low modulation depth due to the broad EPR spectrum of GdIII. Here, we introduce laser-induced magnetic dipole spectroscopy (LaserIMD) with a spin pair consisting of GdIII(PymiMTA) and a photoexcited porphyrin as an alternative technique. We show that the excited state of the porphyrin is not disturbed by the presence of the GdIII complex and that herewith modulation depths of almost 40% are possible. This is significantly higher than the value of 7.2% that was achieved with GdIII-GdIII DEER.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease leading to spontaneous abortions and stillbirths in sows and lowered life quality and expectancy in growing pigs. PRRS is prevalent worldwide and has significant economic impacts to swine industries around the globe. Co-expression of the two most abundant proteins in the viral envelope, the matrix protein (M) and glycosylated protein 5 (GP5), can produce a neutralizing immune response for the virus providing a potentially effective subunit vaccine against the disease, but these proteins are difficult to express. The goal of this research was to display antigenic portions of the M and GP5 proteins on the surface of tobacco mosaic virus-like particles. A modified tobacco mosaic virus coat protein (TMVc) was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and targeted to three subcellular compartments along the secretory pathway to introduce glycosylation patterns important for M-GP5 epitope immunogenicity. We found that accumulation levels in the apoplast were similar to the ER and the vacuole. Because glycans present on plant apoplastic proteins are closest to those present on PRRSV proteins, a TMVc-M-GP5 fusion construct was targeted to the apoplast and accumulated at over 0.5 mg/g of plant fresh weight. TMVc virus-like particles self-assembled in plant cells and surface-displayed the M-GP5 epitope, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy and immunogold localization. These promising findings lay the foundation for immunogenicity and protective-immunity studies in animals to examine the efficacy of this vaccine candidate as a measure to control PRRS.

AB  - Simple Summary Ammonia is a major environmental pollutant. Previous estimates of ammonia emissions have focused on livestock sources in agricultural systems. Livestock continues to be the main source of ammonia emissions. Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia can cause varying degrees of damage to tissues and organs. However, the damage of ammonia exposure to the spleen of pigs in the fattening pigs is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the mechanism at the gene level of exogenous ammonia-induced spleen toxicity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), spleen histomorphological observation, and transcriptome technology. The results showed that ammonia exposure led to oxidative stress, activation of inflammatory pathways, and splenic injury. In addition, the genes that encode histone methyltransferase were found to be significantly upregulated. Therefore, histone methylation may be the epigenetic mechanism of splenic poisoning induced by ammonia. Our findings provide a novel direction for exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of ammonia toxicity. Ammonia is one of the major environmental pollutants that seriously threaten human health. Although many studies have shown that ammonia causes oxidative stress and inflammation in spleen tissue, the mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, the ammonia poisoning model of fattening pigs was successfully established. We examined the morphological changes and antioxidant functions of fattening pig spleen after 30-day exposure to ammonia. Effects of ammonia in the fattening pig spleen were analyzed from the perspective of oxidative stress, inflammation, and histone methylation via transcriptome sequencing technology (RNA-seq) and real-time quantitative PCR validation (qRT-PCR). We obtained 340 differential expression genes (DEGs) by RNA-seq. Compared with the control group, 244 genes were significantly upregulated, and 96 genes were significantly downregulated in the ammonia gas group. Some genes in Gene Ontology (GO) terms were verified and showed significant differences by qRT-PCR. The KEGG pathway revealed significant changes in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is strongly associated with inflammatory injury. To sum up, the results indicated that ammonia induces oxidative stress in pig spleen, activates the MAPK signaling pathway, and causes spleen necrosis and injury. In addition, some differential genes encoding epigenetic factors were found, which may be involved in the response mechanism of spleen tissue oxidative damage. The present study provides a transcriptome database of ammonia-induced spleen poisoning, providing a reference for risk assessment and comparative medicine of ammonia.

AB  - Avian gut microbial communities are complex and play a fundamental role in regulating biological functions within an individual. Although it is well established that diet can influence the structure and composition of the gut microbiota, foraging behaviour may also play a critical, yet unexplored role in shaping the composition, dynamics, and adaptive potential of avian gut microbiota. In this review, we examine the potential influence of coprophagic foraging behaviour on the establishment and adaptability of wild avian gut microbiomes. Coprophagy involves the ingestion of faeces, sourced from either self (autocoprophagy), conspecific animals (allocoprophagy), or heterospecific animals. Much like faecal transplant therapy, coprophagy may (i) support the establishment of the gut microbiota of young precocial species, (ii) directly and indirectly provide nutritional and energetic requirements, and (iii) represent a mechanism by which birds can rapidly adapt the microbiota to changing environments and diets. However, in certain contexts, coprophagy may also pose risks to wild birds, and their microbiomes, through increased exposure to chemical pollutants, pathogenic microbes, and antibiotic-resistant microbes, with deleterious effects on host health and performance. Given the potentially far-reaching consequences of coprophagy for avian microbiomes, and the dearth of literature directly investigating these links, we have developed a predictive framework for directing future research to understand better when and why wild birds engage in distinct types of coprophagy, and the consequences of this foraging behaviour. There is a need for comprehensive investigation into the influence of coprophagy on avian gut microbiotas and its effects on host health and performance throughout ontogeny and across a range of environmental perturbations. Future behavioural studies combined with metagenomic approaches are needed to provide insights into the function of this poorly understood behaviour.

AB  - Based on research materials for 1995-2020 mass and potentially commercial fish species have been identified in Russian waters of the Chukchi Sea. Among the 72 species recorded in trawl catches, 16 species from six families were mass species; among them, the average proportions of the families Pleuronectidae and Cottidae were 4.8 and 0.9% of the total commercial marine fish biomass, respectively. The main stock of these fishes was formed by Bering flounder Hippoglossoides robustus; catches of other species were not so significant. The size-age and weight characteristics of mass flounder and cottid species, features of their linear and weight growth, and their spawning period, scale, and conditions have been analyzed. The biological parameters of the fish species from the Chukchi and Bering seas have been compared. It has been revealed that most of the species (Bering flounder, yellowfin sole Limanda aspera, Sakhalin sole L. sakhalinensis, longhead dab L. proboscidea, and shorthorn sculpin Myoxocephalus verrucosus) had a smaller body size within the Chukchi shelf than in the northwestern part of the Bering Sea. Larger individuals has been recorded among some representatives (Alaska plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, starry flounder Platichthys stellatus, and Arctic staghorn sculpin Gymnocanthus tricuspis). Other species (Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides and several sculpin species) were represented exclusively by juveniles and immature individuals.

AB  - Asexual queen succession (AQS) species produce queens via thelytokous parthenogenesis, which significantly impacts their social life history. For the first time, we discovered that Reticulitermes aculabialis exhibits the phenomenon of parthenogenesis under experimental conditions, and we also investigated the genetic structure of wild colonies of this species using polymorphic microsatellite loci. Our genetic analysis revealed that 93.2% of the secondary queens in the wild colonies were homozygous at all loci, indicating parthenogenesis in these secondary queens, while workers (2.5%), soldiers (0%), nymphs (0%), and alates (6.7%) had low rates. Genetic analysis revealed that the mean number of alleles per group (Na) ranged from 2.000 +/- 0.000 to 2.500 +/- 0.428, with 83.3% polymorphic loci (PPL). The observed heterozygosity (Ho) varied from 0.467 +/- 0.141 to 0.583 +/- 0.098, indicating significant genetic diversity among workers and soldiers. In contrast, soldiers and nymph develop predominantly through sexual reproduction than alates and workers. The occurrence of AQS in R. aculabialis suggests a different mechanism of ploidy restoration, highlighting the diversity of reproductive mechanisms across various lineages of the Termitidae and non-Termitidae termites.

AB  - The current study aimed to validate the mice model of alcohol (ALC), high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD + ALC combination affecting neurobehavioral and neurochemical anomalies via inflammatory cascade, lowered neurogenesis, enhanced microgliosis, reactive astrogliosis, activated IDO-1 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase), and reduce CHAT (choline acetyltransferase) signaling in the hippocampus (HIP). The adult male Swiss albino mice were provided with ALC (3-15%) and in-house prepared HFD for continuous 12 weeks. The HFD and HFD + ALC consumption impacted the liver and mediated HIP damage. The liver biomarkers (AST, ALT, gamma-GT, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C), oxidative stress, and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-beta and TNF-alpha) level were found significantly higher in the liver and HIP tissue of HFD + ALC. Furthermore, the neurobehavioral deficits that include cognitive dysfunction, depressive, and, anxiety-like behavior were found severely affected in HFD + ALC consumed mice. The overactivated HPA axis, intense oxidative insults, and increased AChE activity were seen in the HIP of HFD + ALC grouped mice. The gene and protein expression also confirmed disrupted NF-cB-mediated inflammatory and Nrf2-regulated antioxidant balance and dysregulated TrcB/BDNF signaling. Hence, our new findings explain the insight mechanism of chronic alcoholism in exacerbating the deleterious effect of chronic high-fat diet consumption on the HIP.

AB  - The search for new probiotics has been regarded as an important approach to improving intestinal health in animals. Bacillus has many advantages, such as strong resistance to harmful external factors, wide distribution, and easy colonization of the intestine. Hence, this study aims to screen for a probiotic Bacillus strain that improves animal intestinal health and to elucidate its probiotic mechanism so as to provide probiotic resources for the development of feed-using probiotic formulations. In this research, a strain of Bacillus was isolated from adult pig feces and named B. tequilensis YB-2. In vitro probiotic experiments showed that B. tequilensis YB-2 had strong acid and bile salt resistance, indicating that this strain can customize in the intestine. To further explore the effect of B. tequilensis YB-2 upon animal intestinal health, DSS-induced murine colitis models were established, and the body weight, colonic morphology, inflammatory cytokines level, and intestinal-barrier- and TLR4/NF-kappa B-pathway-related protein were determined. The results showed that mice receiving drinking water with 3% DSS were found to develop colitis symptoms, including body weight loss and increased disease activity index (DAI); colon length and microvilli shedding were shortened; tight junctions were disrupted; goblet cells decreased; anti-inflammatory cytokines were inhibited; and pro-inflammatory cytokines and the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway were activated. Notably, orally received B. tequilensis YB-2 alleviated symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice. The above results indicated that B. tequilensis YB-2 was capable of improving colitis in mice by weakening inflammation and intestinal barrier damage, and its mechanism may involve the TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway. Overall, this research suggests that B. tequilensis YB-2 has the potential to serve as an animal feed additive to prevent intestinal inflammation.<br />

AB  - Object recognition, the ability to discriminate between a novel and a familiar stimulus, is critically dependent upon the perirhinal cortex. Neural response reductions upon repetition of a stimulus, have been hypothesized to be the mechanism within perirhinal cortex that supports recognition memory function. Thus, investigations into the mechanisms of long-term depression (LTD) in perirhinal cortex has provided insight into the mechanism of object recognition memory formation, but the contribution of long-term potentiation (LTP) to object recognition memory formation has been less studied. Inhibition of atypical PKC activity by Zeta Inhibitory Pseudosubstrate (ZIP) impairs the maintenance of LTP but not LTD, thus here infusion of ZIP into the perirhinal cortex allowed us to investigate the contribution of LTP-like mechanisms to object recognition memory maintenance. Infusion of ZIP into the perirhinal cortex of rats 24 h after the sample phase impaired performance in an object recognition but not an object location task, in contrast infusion of ZIP into the hippocampus impaired performance in an object location but not an object recognition task. The impairment in object recognition by ZIP was prevented by administration of the peptide GluA2(3y), which blocks the endocytosis of GluA2 containing AMPA receptors. Finally, performance in a perceptual oddity task, which requires perirhinal cortex function, was not disrupted by ZIP. Together these results demonstrate the importance of LTP-like mechanisms to the maintenance of object recognition memory in the perirhinal cortex.

AB  - Simple Summary The modern pig meat production chain is increasingly focused on farm biosecurity, animal health, meat quality, and safety. The substantial increase of the global pork meat consumption is associated with many challenges that have impact on world meat markets, such as animal disease outbreaks, sanitary restrictions, and trade regulations and policies. To overcome such challenges and assure more consistent pork meat quality (and safety), there is a need to develop effective and reliable monitoring system in a farm-abattoir continuum. The use of specific biomarkers for proactive assessment of the pig chain characteristics is therefore of importance. Namely, the introduction of new user-friendly methodology, based on selected biomarkers, e.g., stress hormones and inflammation markers (acute phase proteins) may contribute to evaluation of the quality of processes, detection of critical points in the production system, and may anticipate the pork meat traits (quality and safety). In addition, such an approach can also contribute to the better understanding of interrelations between farm biosecurity and animal health versus meat quality and safety and can be used for detection of failures in the pig production system and with potential to be incorporated in certification programs for the pork meat industry. The modern pig production chain is increasingly focused on biosecurity, quality, and safety of meat and is associated with many challenges impacting world meat markets, such as animal disease outbreaks and sanitary restrictions, trade regulations and quality requirements. To overcome such challenges and assure more consistent pork meat quality (and safety), there is a need to develop an effective and reliable monitoring system in a farm-abattoir continuum that can be based on selected biomarkers. This study assessed interrelations of selected stress and inflammation biomarkers (acute phase proteins (APP)) between farm biosecurity score versus pork meat quality traits after two different lairage periods. Briefly, the maximum recorded levels of stress hormones (436.2 and 241.2 ng/mL, for cortisol and Chromogranin A (CgA), respectively) and APP (389.4 and 400.9 mu g/mL, Pig Major Acute Proteins (MAP) and Haptoglobin (Hp), respectively) at four commercial farms were within the recommended threshold values. Cortisol and APP were negatively correlated to the internal and total biosecurity scores of farms. The increase of level of both sets of biomarkers was found at bleeding (after transportation and lairage period), but with lower values after long (18-20 h) versus short (1-3 h) lairage lay-over time. In general, negative correlation was confirmed between stress and inflammation biomarkers and carcass/meat quality traits. The farm total biosecurity level significantly affected chilling yield, meat temperature, and a* value. Pig-MAP emerged as a good biomarker with a promising potential for assessment and anticipation of broad aspects in the pork meat chain. It can be used for detection of failures in the pig production system and might be incorporated in certification programs for the pork meat industry.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Diarrhea is often the main cause of neonatal deaths on dairy goat farms. Poor management leads to infection with pathogenic bacteria and viruses causing enteritis, the main cause of diarrhea. Efficient drugs should be developed to prevent and treat kids with diarrhea. In the current study, the role of GBacillus-9 in the prevention and treatment of Saanen kids suffering diarrhea was assessed. Our data showed that GBacillus-9 restored the intestinal microbial disorder that resulted from diarrhea and suggested that GBacillus-9 could be used as a product to improve the gut health of kids.
   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens-9 (GBacillus-9), derived from the intestinal tract of the white-spotted bamboo shark, secretes a variety of antimicrobial compounds that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. In this study, the role of GBacillus-9 in the prevention and treatment of Saanen kids with diarrhea was assessed. Six healthy kids (HL) and six kids with diarrhea (DL) were selected. All kids were fed with 0.3% (w/v) GBacillus-9 (spray power) in raw milk for two weeks. The proportion of kids with diarrhea decreased gradually as the trial progressed, and 100% DL kids were cured at day 15. GBacillus-9 increased the serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-6 concentration (p < 0.05). The amplicon sequencing analysis of the fecal bacterial community revealed that the fecal microbiota was remarkably different between the HL and the DL groups at day 0. After two weeks of feeding with GBacillus-9, no significant difference in fecal microbiota was observed between HL and DL groups at the phylum level. GBacillus-9 restored the intestinal microbial disorder associated with serum immunoglobulin and interleukin concentration. Correlation analysis showed that GBacillus-9 altered globulin and interleukin concentration and that immunoglobulin was associated with Firmicutes. Collectively, our results revealed that GBacillus-9 improved the gut health of kids by improving microbial homeostasis.

AB  - Simple Summary: In this study, we investigated the immune and antioxidant properties of Lactobacillus johnsonii RS-7 in weaned pigs. We found that dietary supplementation of Lactobacillus johnsonii RS-7 can effectively improve growth performance, enhance immune function, and improve the antioxidant performance of weaned pigs. The results of this study provide a feasible nutritional means to solve the weaning stress of piglets effectively.
   We investigated the effects of dietary supplementation of lactic acid bacteria on the immune and antioxidant performance of weaned pigs. A total of 128 Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire piglets weaned on day 28 with an average body weight of 8.95 +/- 1.15 kg were selected and randomly divided into four treatment groups according to body weight and sex for a 28-day study. The four dietary treatments were basal diet (CON), and CON with 0.05% (LJ0.05), 0.1% (LJ0.1), and 0.2% (LJ0.2) Lactobacillus johnsonii RS-7, respectively. The lowest feed-to-gain ratio (F:G) was found when LJ0.1 was added to the diet. The addition of compound lactic acid bacteria to the diet increased the concentrations of TP, ALB, IgA, and IgM on day 14 and IgG, IgA, and IgM on day 28 (p < 0.05) in the blood, with trait values greater for pigs fed LJ0.1 than CON pigs (p < 0.05). Concentrations of antioxidants (CAT, T-AOC, MDA, T-SOD, and GSH) in serum, intestinal mucosa, spleen, liver, and pancreas improved. In summary, dietary supplementation of Lactobacillus johnsonii RS-7 improved the antioxidant and immune function of weaned piglets.

AB  - Many efforts have been made to reveal the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle development because of its importance in animals. However, knowledge on chromatin accessibility, a prerequisite for gene expression, remains limited. Here, dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility were analyzed in the skeletal muscles of Min pigs at the ages of 30, 90, and 210 d using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq). A total of 16,301 differentially accessible regions (DARs) associated with 7455 genes were identified among three developmental stages. Seven out of eight DARs selected for a functional analysis were found to regulate reporter gene expression significantly (p < 0.05), indicating that DARs are active in gene expression. A total of 2219 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Through integrated analyses of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, 54 DEG_DAR_genes and 61 transcription factors (TFs) were characterized as critical for muscle development. Among them, Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), targeted to 36 DEG_DAR_genes, was the most important TF. The effects of KLF5 on DEG_DAR_gene expression were then analyzed with molecular biology techniques. KLF5 was found to regulate SLPI (secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor) expression by directly binding to the promoter; KLF5 was also involved in APOA1 (apolipoprotein A-I) expression through affecting the regulatory role of DAR located in the intron. These results indicate that the TFs identified were functional. Altogether, the chromatin accessibility region, TFs, and genes important for muscle development in Min pigs were identified. The results provide novel data for further revealing the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic regulation of muscle development.

AB  - Production of secreted leaf bud resin is a mechanism for temperate trees to protect dormant leaf buds against frost damage, dehydration, and insect herbivory. Bud resins contain a wide variety of special metabolites including terpenoids, benzenoids, and phenolics. The leaf bud resins of Populus trichocarpa and P. balsamifera contain high concentrations of O-methylated dihydrochalcones, but the enzymes for methylating these compounds remain enigmatic. We used transcriptomics and differential gene expression analyses to identify a gene encoding a P. trichocarpa dihydrochalcone-specific O-methyltransferase, which we named PtDOMT1. Detailed enzymatic analyses demonstrated PtDOMT1 to be a highly selective and regiospecific O-methyltransferase which methylates 4 and 4 ' positions of dihydrochalcones using S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl donor. PtDOMT1 did not methylate any other flavonoid or phenolic substrate tested. These findings establish the final step in the biosynthesis of O-methylated dihydrochalcones in poplar and represent the first molecular analysis of leaf bud resin biosynthesis in plants.
   Transcriptomic analysis of poplar leaf bud resin rich in O -methylated dihydrochalcones has allowed us to identify the first O -methyltransferase enzyme which specifically O -methylates dihydrochalcones.

AB  - The severe doxorubicin (DOXO) side effect of cardiomyopathy limits it clinical application as an effective anticancer drug. Although Ca2+ overload was postulated as one of the mechanisms for this toxicity, its role was, however, disputable in terms of the contractile dysfunction. In this work, the dynamics of the intracellular Ca2+ signal were optically mapped in a Langendorff guinea pig heart. We found that DOXO treatment: (1) Delayed the activation of the Ca2+ signal. With the reference time set at the peak of the action potential (AP), the time lag between the peak of the Ca2+ signal and AP (Ca-AP-Lag) was significantly prolonged. (2) Slowed down the intracellular Ca2+ releasing and sequestering process. Both the maximum rising (MRV) and falling (MFV) velocity of the Ca2+ signal were decreased. (3) Shortened the duration of the Ca2+ signal in one cycle of Ca2+ oscillation. The duration of the Ca2+ signal at 50% amplitude (CaD50) was significantly shortened. These results suggested a reduced level of intracellular Ca2+ after DOXO treatment. Furthermore, we found that the effect of tachypacing was similar to that of DOXO, and, interestingly, DOXO exerted contradictory effects on the tachypaced hearts: it shortened the Ca-AP-Lag, accelerated the MRV and MFV, and prolonged the CaD50. We, therefore, concluded that DOXO had a different effect on intracellular Ca2+. It caused Ca2+ underload in hearts with sinus rhythm; this might relate to the contractile dysfunction in DOXO cardiomyopathy. It led to Ca2+ overload in the tachypaced hearts, which might contribute to the Ca2+-overload-related toxicity.

AB  - Chironomus calligraphus Goeldi, 1905 has a flexible life cycle with several generations per year, which can be modified by the quality and type of food. To categorize the functional feeding group of the species, food preference was evaluated in larval instars III and IV, through laboratory experiments and gut content analysis. To evaluate the influence of the type of food on the duration of the life cycle growth and maturation, experiments were carried out. Instar III preferred conditioned leaves and animal food, while instar IV preferred algae and fine particulate organic matter. Gut contents of instar IV collected from streams showed increased consumption of fine particulate organic matter than other items. All these observations allowed us to assign the species to the gatherer collector group. The duration of the life cycle varied between the different types of foods, being the conditioned leaves, animal food, and algae the items that caused a greater growth in the larvae and a faster passage to the pupal instar. Our results suggest that the opportunistic feeding behavior of C. calligraphus allows it to use several different foods, but the quality of the foods influences the length of the life cycle and this contributes to its plasticity.

AB  - PremiseHerbivore pressure can vary across the range of a species, resulting in different defensive strategies. If herbivory is greater at lower latitudes, plants may be better defended there, potentially driving a latitudinal gradient in defense. However, relationships that manifest across the entire range of a species may be confounded by differences within genetic subpopulations, which may obscure the drivers of these latitudinal gradients.MethodsWe grew plants of the widespread perennial grass Panicum virgatum in a common garden that included genotypes from three genetic subpopulations spanning an 18.5 degrees latitudinal gradient. We then assessed defensive strategies of these plants by measuring two physical resistance traits-leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf ash, a proxy for silica-and multiple measures of herbivory by caterpillars of the generalist herbivore fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda).ResultsAcross all genetic subpopulations, low-latitude plants experienced less herbivory than high-latitude plants. Within genetic subpopulations, however, this relationship was inconsistent-the most widely distributed and phenotypically variable subpopulation (Atlantic) exhibited more consistent latitudinal trends than either of the other two subpopulations. The two physical resistance traits, LMA and leaf ash, were both highly heritable and positively associated with resistance to different measures of herbivory across all subpopulations, indicating their importance in defense against herbivores. Again, however, these relationships were inconsistent within subpopulations.ConclusionsDefensive gradients that occur across the entire species range may not arise within localized subpopulations. Thus, identifying the drivers of latitudinal gradients in herbivory defense may depend on adequately sampling the diversity within a species.

AB  - Pregnant sheep have been used to model complications of human pregnancies including placental insufficiency and intrauterine growth restriction. Some of the hallmarks of placental insufficiency are slower uterine and umbilical blood flow rates, impaired placental transport of oxygen and amino acids, and lower fetal arterial concentrations of anabolic growth factors. An impact of fetal sex on these outcomes has not been identified in either human or sheep pregnancies. This is likely because most studies measuring these outcomes have used small numbers of subjects or animals. We undertook a secondary analysis of previously published data generated by our laboratory in late-gestation (gestational age of 133 +/- 0 days gestational age) control sheep (n = 29 male fetuses; n = 26 female fetuses; n = 3 sex not recorded) and sheep exposed to elevated ambient temperatures to cause experimental placental insufficiency (n = 23 male fetuses; n = 17 female fetuses; n = 1 sex not recorded). The primary goal was to determine how fetal sex modifies the effect of the experimental insult on outcomes related to placental blood flow, amino acid and oxygen transport, and fetal hormones. Of the 112 outcomes measured, we only found an interaction between fetal sex and experimental insult for the uterine uptake rates of isoleucine, phenylalanine, and arginine. Additionally, most outcomes measured did not show a difference based on fetal sex when adjusting for the impact of placental insufficiency. Exceptions included fetal norepinephrine and cortisol concentrations, which were higher in female compared to male fetuses. For the parameters measured in the current analysis, the impact of fetal sex was not widespread.

AB  - The epithelial cell is the main basic unit of the udder in which milk synthesis takes place. Curcumin is well known for its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study was performed to test whether in vitro curcumin supplementation can alleviate the unfavorable impact of hyperthermia on buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BuMECs). The spontaneously immortalized BuMECs were divided into 7 groups (n = 9); 1) unstressed BuMECs (negative control, 37 degrees C); 2) BuMECs exposed to hyperthermia without curcumin treatment (positive control); 3-7) BuMECs cultured with different concentrations of curcumin (5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 mu M), respectively, followed by hyperthermic exposure (42 degrees C) for 1 h and then returned to 37 degrees C. Changes in viability (MTT assay), proliferation (BrdU colorimetric immunoassay) and concentrations of antioxidant enzymes, CAT, and SOD (ELISA) of BuMECs were recorded. The gene expression study was performed using qRT-PCR. Lower concentrations of curcumin (5, 10 mu M) maintained viability, enhanced proliferation, and content of antioxidant enzymes of heat stressed BuMECs. Curcumin induced thermotolerance and antioxidant status by upregulating the expression of antioxidants genes, anti-apoptotic genes and heat shock proteins in heat stressed BuMECs compared to the positive control group. Besides, curcumin reduced apoptosis and inflammation in BuMECs exposed to hyperthermia by downregulating the expression of genes and transcriptional factors associated with apoptosis and inflammatory immune response. The results reveal the potential roles of curcumin in eliminating the negative impact of hyperthermia on BuMECs by regulating the pathways of apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

AB  - Diagnosing age-specific influences on demographic trends and their drivers in at-risk wildlife species can support the development of targeted conservation interventions. Such information also underpins understanding of life history. Here, we assess age-specific demography in wild African elephants, a species whose life history is marked by long life and extreme parental investment. During the 20-yr study, survival and its variation were similar between adults and juveniles in contrast to relationships found among many large-bodied mammals. Prospective analysis on age-specific Leslie matrices for females demonstrated survival is more influential than fecundity on lambda, with sensitivity of both decreasing with age. Results aggregated by stage classes indicate young adults (9-18 yr) demonstrated the highest elasticity, followed by preparous juveniles (3-8 yr). Mature adults (36+ yr) had the lowest aggregate elasticity value. Retrospective analysis parameterized by data from the early and latter periods of the study, characterized by low then high human impact (faster and slower growth, respectively), demonstrated fecundity (particularly for adults; 19-35 yr) explained the greatest variation in lambda observed during the period of low human impact, while survival (particularly juvenile and adult) was more influential during the high human impact period. The oldest females (mature adult stage) weakly influenced population growth despite demonstrating the highest fecundity and their behavioral importance in elephant society. Multiple regression models on survival showed the negative effects of human impacts and population size were the strongest correlates across sexes and ages. Annual rainfall, our metric for environmental conditions, was weakly informative. The presence of dependent young was positively correlated with survival for breeding females, suggesting condition-based mortality filtering during pregnancy. Notwithstanding the stabilizing effect of high juvenile survival on elephant population growth, demographic processes in elephants were similar to those shaping life history in other large herbivores. Implications of the study results with respect to the conservation of elephants and analysis of demographic impact of poaching are discussed, along with the study's relevance to theories regarding the evolution of life history and parental care.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are known to be perceived by neighboring plants, resulting in induction or priming of chemical defenses. There is little information on the defense responses that are triggered by these plant-plant interactions, and the phenomenon has rarely been studied in rice.
   Using chemical and molecular analyses in combination with insect behavioral and performance experiments, we studied how volatiles emitted by rice plants infested by the striped stemborer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis affect defenses against this pest in conspecific plants.
   Compared with rice plants exposed to the volatiles from uninfested plants, plants exposed to SSB-induced volatiles showed enhanced direct and indirect resistance to SSB. When subjected to caterpillar damage, the HIPV-exposed plants showed increased expression of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling genes, resulting in JA accumulation and higher levels of defensive proteinase inhibitors. Moreover, plants exposed to SSB-induced volatiles emitted larger amounts of inducible volatiles and were more attractive to the parasitoid Cotesia chilonis.
   By unraveling the factors involved in HIPV-mediated defense priming in rice, we reveal a key defensive role for proteinase inhibitors. These findings pave the way for novel rice management strategies to enhance the plant's resistance to one of its most devastating pests.

AB  - Background: Ginseng has been used as a traditional medicine and functional cosmetic ingredients for many years. Recent studies have focused on the potential biological effects of the ginseng berry and its ingredients. (+)-Syringaresinol (SYR) is enriched in ginseng berry and its beneficial effects on the skin have been recently reported. However, little is known about the its effects on the wound healing process of skin.
   Methods: Here, we evaluated the skin wound healing effect of (+)-SYR using the human fibroblast Hs68 cell and ex vivo pig and human skin tissue model. Scratch wound test and hydrogen peroxide (HPO) induce chemical wound model were employed.
   Results: (+)-SYR promoted the migration and proliferation of Hs68 cells without significant cytotoxicity at the tested concentrations. Especially, in ex vivo pig and human skin tissue, HPO-induced chemical wound was recovered almost completely by (+)-SYR. In line with the finding in Hs68, the protein expression levels of TGF-beta and PCNA, a proliferation marker were increased, demonstrating the beneficial effects of (+)-SYR on skin wound repair.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a highly toxic gas in many environmental and occupational places. It can induce multiple organ injuries particularly in lung, trachea and liver, but the relevant mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we used a TMT-based discovery proteomics to identify key proteins and correlated molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of acute H2S-induced toxicity in porcine lung, trachea and liver tissues. Pigs were subjected to acute inhalation exposure of up to 250 ppm of H2S for 5 h for the first time. Changes in hematology and biochemical indexes, serum inflammatory cytokines and histopathology demonstrated that acute H2S exposure induced organs inflammatory injury and dysfunction in the porcine lung, trachea and liver. The proteomic data showed 51, 99 and 84 proteins that were significantly altered in lung, trachea and liver, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) annotation, KEGG pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed that acute H2S exposure affected the three organs via different mechanisms that were relatively similar between lung and trachea. Further analysis showed that acute H2S exposure caused inflammatory damages in the porcine lung and trachea through activating complement and coagulation cascades, and regulating the hyaluronan metabolic process. Whereas antigen presentation was found in the lung but oxidative stress and cell apoptosis was observed exclusively in the trachea. In the liver, an induced dysfunction was associated with protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid metabolism. Further validation of some H2S responsive proteins using western blotting indicated that our proteomics data were highly reliable. Collectively, these findings provide insight into toxic molecular mechanisms that could potentially be targeted for therapeutic intervention for acute H2S intoxication.

AB  - The role of mesoscale features in structuring trophic transfer in the mesopelagic zone is poorly understood. Deploying sensors on marine animals, or "biologging," is a powerful tool to infer the organism's behavior and simultaneously collect high-resolution oceanographic data to describe physical-biological interactions. We investigated whether mesoscale eddies are used by a mesopelagic predator, the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), and if so, what mechanisms might create beneficial foraging conditions in association with eddies. We hypothesized seals would increase their foraging behavior in both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies due to nutrient enhancement and physical aggregation of prey and that seals would dive deeper in anticyclonic eddies in response to a deeper prey field. We used tracking data and continuous in situ temperature measurements from 221 adult female northern elephant seals collected between 2004 and 2019. These predators primarily targeted myctophid fishes and squid throughout the northeast Pacific mesopelagic zone, foraging between approximately 400-800 m. Eddy encounters were identified using remotely sensed sea level anomaly data and confirmed visually with collocated sea level anomaly, in situ temperature, and in situ temperature anomaly. Over more than 30,000 days of data and >3 million temperature casts collected by seals, we found 129 high confidence en-counters with anticyclonic eddies and 83 with cyclonic eddies. Overall, seals traveled more slowly and in a less directed manner while associated with eddies, particularly anticyclonic eddies, suggesting increased foraging behavior, especially in the California Current. Elephant seals spent more time at the edges of cyclonic eddies than their center. In contrast, they utilized both the interior and edge of anticyclonic eddies. This suggests that the aggregation of prey at the frontal region of an eddy is an important mechanism, whereas nutrient upwelling associated with an eddy play a more minor role in enhancing the seals' prey field. Seal foraging behavior was not influenced by eddy age, size, amplitude, or rotational speed. The large sample size in this study showed considerable variation between individual behavioral responses, suggesting caution when extrapolating indi-vidual behavior to a population level. Our data show that both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies can affect the seals' prey field as demonstrated by enhanced foraging behavior. Still, the variation in behavioral responses resulting from individual foraging strategies, eddy histories, and possible spatiotemporal mismatches between eddy physics and biological responses relevant to mesopelagic predators merit further investigation.

AB  - Camellia oil extracted from Camellia seeds is rich in unsaturated fatty acids and secondary metabolites beneficial to human health. However, no oil-tea tree genome has yet been published, which is a major obstacle to investigating the heredity improvement of oiltea trees. Here, using both Illumina and PicBio sequencing technologies, we present the first chromosome-level genome sequence of the oil-tea tree species Camellia chekiangoleosa Hu. (CCH). The assembled genome consists of 15 pseudochromosomes with a genome size of 2.73 Gb and a scaffold N50 of 185.30 Mb. At least 2.16 Gb of the genome assembly consists of repetitive sequences, and the rest involves a high-confidence set of 64608 protein-coding gene models. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the CCH genome underwent a whole-genome duplication event shared across the Camellia genus at similar to 57.48 MYA and a gamma-WGT event shared across all core eudicot plants at similar to 120 MYA. Gene family clustering revealed that the genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis have undergone rapid expansion. Furthermore, we determined the expression patterns of oleic acid accumulation- and terpenoid biosynthesis-associated genes in six tissues. We found that these genes tend to be highly expressed in leaves, pericarp tissues, roots, and seeds. The first chromosome-level genome of oil-tea trees will provide valuable resources for determining Camellia evolution and utilizing the germplasm of this taxon.

AB  - Selecting pyrolysis parameters for recycling P-rich and hazardous biowastes, such as bones, into fertilizers is still a challenge. Our objective was to improve pyrolysis procedures of pig bones for the production of P fertilizers. Bone chars were produced by pyrolysis at 400, 550, or 800 degrees C with no gas addition; 550 and 800 degrees C under N2; 800 degrees C under steam flux, using calcination at 800 degrees C as control treatment. Synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy at the P and Ca K- and L-edges showed that these bone chars were largely composed of hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite crystallization was inhibited by pyrolysis conducted in the absence of oxygen at 400, 550, or 800 degrees C, either under no gas or under N2 flux. The clogging of pores by lack of organic compounds removal was hypothesized to cause low surface area of 400 degrees C bone char, resulting in a fertilizer with citric-acid soluble P as low as calcination, while 550 and 800 degrees C bone chars obtained in absence of oxygen showed greater porosity, surface area, and citric acid-soluble P than steamed or calcined samples at 800 degrees C. Although extractable phosphate in water and neutral-ammonium-citrate showed trends comparable to those from citric acid, it was negligible for all heated materials. Since it is possible to produce bone chars with different chemical, physical and crystallographic properties by managing pyrolysis conditions, bone chars can be designed to increase their suitability as P fertilizers for different purposes, such as high solubility or slow P release.

AB  - XX sex reversal, also called XX disorders of sex development (XX-DSD), is a condition affecting the development of the gonads or genitalia, and is relatively common in pigs. However, its genetic etiology and transcriptional regulation mechanism in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) remain mostly unknown. XX-DSD (SRY-negative) pigs and normal sows were selected by external genitalia observation. The hypothalamus, which is the integrated center of the HPGA was sampled for whole-transcriptome RNA-seq. The role of DEmiRNA was validated by its overexpression and knockdown in vitro. A total of 1,258 lncRNAs, 1,086 mRNAs, and 61 microRNAs differentially expressed in XX-DSD pigs compared with normal female pigs. Genes in the hormone biosynthesis and secretion pathway significantly up-regulated, and the up-regulation of GNRH1, KISS1 and AVP may associate with the abnormal secretion of GnRH. We also predicted the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression triplets and constructed three competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) potentially associated with XX-DSD. Functional enrichment studies suggested that TCONS_00340886, TCONS_00000204 and miR-181a related to GnRH secretion. Further, miR-181a inhibitor up-regulated GNRH1, PAK6, and CAMK4 in the GT1-7 cells. Conversely, transfection of miR-181a mimics obtained the opposite trends. The expression levels of FSHR, LHR, ESR1 and ESR2 were significantly higher in XX-DSD gondas than those in normal sows. Taken together, we proposed that the balance of endocrine had broken in XX-DSD pigs. The current study is the first to examine the transcriptomic profile in the hypothalamus of XX-DSD pigs. It provides new insight into coding and non-coding RNAs that may be associated with DSD in pigs.

AB  - The Ponte Galeria area within the city of Rome has yielded numerous fossiliferous localities that represent a reference point for the study of the European Middle Pleistocene ecosystems. Within Ponte Galeria a rich collection of fossil mammals has been unearthed from Cava di Breccia - Casal Selce 2 (MIS 15) thus the site represents an optimal laboratory to investigate the palaeoenvironments of a defined territory during the Middle Pleistocene. We investigate the feeding behaviours of the ungulate community of Cava di Breccia - Casal Selce 2 to reconstruct the MIS 15 habitats and also compare the data with those of the nearby site of Fontana Ranuccio (MIS 11) which shares similar faunal composition with Cava di Breccia - Casal Selce 2 to test if ungulates occupied the same niches during two different interglacials. Open habitats with scattered woodlands characterised the Ponte Galeria area during MIS 15, whereas woodlands were more widespread during MIS 11 at Fontana Ranuccio. Ungulates display similar diets in both localities, suggesting that cervids, large bovids and equids adopted the same niche partitioning strategies during both interglacials.

AB  - Simple Summary Pig farming plays a critical role in global animal husbandry, with pig weight and body dimensions serving as key indicators of growth and development. Manual measurement methods currently used face challenges like herding difficulties and stress in pigs. To address this, this study introduces a non-contact weight estimation and body measurement model using point cloud data from pig backs. By utilizing a depth camera and advanced algorithms, accurate weight predictions and body size measurements were achieved. The model showed promising results, with reduced errors compared to manual methods, demonstrating its potential for improving efficiency and animal welfare in pig farming practices.Abstract Pig farming is a crucial sector in global animal husbandry. The weight and body dimension data of pigs reflect their growth and development status, serving as vital metrics for assessing their progress. Presently, pig weight and body dimensions are predominantly measured manually, which poses challenges such as difficulties in herding, stress responses in pigs, and the control of zoonotic diseases. To address these issues, this study proposes a non-contact weight estimation and body measurement model based on point cloud data from pig backs. A depth camera was installed above a weighbridge to acquire 3D point cloud data from 258 Yorkshire-Landrace crossbred sows. We selected 200 Yorkshire-Landrace sows as the research subjects and applied point cloud filtering and denoising techniques to their three-dimensional point cloud data. Subsequently, a K-means clustering segmentation algorithm was employed to extract the point cloud corresponding to the pigs' backs. A convolutional neural network with a multi-head attention was established for pig weight prediction and added RGB information as an additional feature. During the data processing process, we also measured the back body size information of the pigs. During the model evaluation, 58 Yorkshire-Landrace sows were specifically selected for experimental assessment. Compared to manual measurements, the weight estimation exhibited an average absolute error of 11.552 kg, average relative error of 4.812%, and root mean square error of 11.181 kg. Specifically, for the MACNN, incorporating RGB information as an additional feature resulted in a decrease of 2.469 kg in the RMSE, a decrease of 0.8% in the MAPE, and a decrease of 1.032 kg in the MAE. Measurements of shoulder width, abdominal width, and hip width yielded corresponding average relative errors of 3.144%, 3.798%, and 3.820%. In conclusion, a convolutional neural network with a multi-head attention was established for pig weight prediction, and incorporating RGB information as an additional feature method demonstrated accuracy and reliability for weight estimation and body dimension measurement.

AB  - Brassicales plants defend themselves with glucosinolates that, upon herbivory, are hydrolyzed into toxic isothiocyanates (ITCs) and other derivatives. The side chain diversity of glucosinolates results in a range of structurally distinct products, but how this chemical variation affects herbivores and their detoxification responses remains incompletely understood. Here, we show the effects of ITC hydrolysis products with various side chains on Spodoptera littoralis larvae and their detoxification system. ITCs inhibit larval growth to varying degrees, depending on the chemical nature of their side chain. The larvae metabolize ITCs by conjugating them to glutathione in the mercapturic acid pathway and to lysine forming an amine conjugate. Over half of the 34 S. littoralis glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), tested as His-tagged derivatives, actively conjugate ITCs, with most catalyzing reactions with multiple substrates. Larval performance on various ITC-containing diets correlates positively with GST activity, highlighting this detoxification system's role in supporting growth on glucosinolate-containing plants. The propensity of multiple GSTs to react with an individual ITC and the wide expression of GST-encoding genes across larval organs likely promote the ability of this generalist herbivore to thrive on glucosinolate-defended Brassicales plants. These findings provide insight into herbivore adaptation and may inform future research on plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an important role in plant ecology and can be useful in pest management. This work characterises, for the first time, the VOC emissions of six industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) cultivars grown in New Zealand: CFX-2, CRS-1, Ferimon 12, Katani, Futura 75, and Finola. Volatiles emitted from flowers and foliage of eight-week-old plants were collected using a dynamic headspace sampling method and analysed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. We assessed the effect of cultivar, sex (monoecious, male, and female), and site (i.e., two sites differing in soil types, maintained under irrigation and rain-fed conditions) on VOC emissions. Thirty-five volatile compounds were tentatively identified from the headspace samples of hemp plants, but none of the cultivars emitted all 35 compounds. beta-Myrcene was the most abundant compound in most cultivars. Overall, there was a significant effect of sex, and the interaction of sex and cultivar on the volatile profiles, but no effect of site. Female plants typically emitted more volatiles than their male counterparts and monoecious cultivars. The main compounds driving the difference between cultivars and sexes were (Z)- and (E)-beta-ocimene. We hypothesize that differences in emission emerged as a defence strategy to protect costly female flowers from herbivores (since C. sativa is wind pollinated), but this hypothesis needs further testing. We recommend additional studies exploring how biotic and abiotic factors influence hemp VOC emissions, changes in VOCs throughout the crop cycle, the role of VOCs in plant-insect interactions and their use in pest management.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict threatens wildlife conservation, especially in areas where humans, livestock, and wildlife share landscapes. These conflicts intensify during droughts. Our study examined the socio-economic impacts of human-wildlife conflict (HWC) around Alemsaga Forest, Northwest Ethiopia.. Household survey data were collected from 264 respondents using structured and semi-structured questionnaires, focus group discussions, and direct observation. We set up experimental plots to estimate wildlife-caused crop damages. The data analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and the chi-square test. Most respondents identified crop damage (56%) and livestock depredation (34%) as the primary causes of human-wildlife conflict. The causes of human-wildlife conflict varied significantly among villages (P < 0.05) across the study area. Anubis baboon (Papio anubis) 31%, vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) 27%, wild pig (Sus scrofa) 21.2%, porcupine (Hystrix cristata) 11.4%, and rodents 9.5% were responsible for the crop damages. Common jackal (Canis aureus) 48.1%, spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) 32.2%, and leopard (Panthera pardus) 19.7% were reported as the major livestock predators. The field experiments showed that on average, wildlife caused the loss of 596.6 kg/ha/year of maize, valued at $234, and 476 kg/ha/year of barley, valued at $153. Guarding (58.3%), chasing (30.3%), physical barriers (7.5%), and smoking (3.8%) were the most common traditional management techniques against crop-raiding and livestock depredation. The study suggests growing non-palatable cash crops near forests, establishing communal guarding systems, providing alternative employment, and educating the community on wildlife values to reduce conflict. Additionally, compensating farmers and designating forests as wildlife reserves are essential for harmonious coexistence and conservation.

AB  - Nanoparticles (NPs) have a variety of applications in different fields. Green method of NP synthesis is an exciting field and recently has gained more attention. In many green methods, plant extracts are used, and in a few studies, animal milk has been used to synthesize metal NPs. Many studies have aimed to synthesize silver nanoparticles (Ag NP) for agricultural use, however, there are many other applications where green NPs can be used. In this work, we examined the electrochemical behavior of Ag NPs synthesized using cow and goat milk at two different temperatures. Synthesized NPs at temperatures of 25 and 37 degrees C were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infra-Red measurements, dynamic light scattering measurements, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using two buffer systems: the phosphate, and Tris-HCl, at pH = 7.4. The results showed that the average size of Ag NPs made using goat milk does not change significantly with temperature compared to Ag NPs made using cow milk. Here we demonstrate that Ag NPs synthesized display redox properties that have potential to use in applications relevant to other fields such as biosensing, electrocatalysis, and nanoelectronics.

AB  - Olfaction plays an important role in the survival and reproduction of various organisms. Aside from being a nutrient, in many fish species, amino acids also function as attractants to induce feeding behaviors. As the herbivorous fish, blunt snout bream ( Megalobrama amblycephala ) commonly consumes an aquatic plant, Hydrilla verticillata . Here, we studied the effect of food odors on the feeding behavior of blunt snout bream using a mixture of amino acids and H. verticillata extract. The behavioral and electro-olfactogram tests demonstrated that the mixture of amino acids and H. verticillata extract induced an attractive reaction and olfactory response in blunt snout bream, respectively. Through Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses, we confirmed that ciliated and microvillus neurons are distributed on the olfactory placode. The results of phospho-extracellular regulated protein kinases (pERK) showed that a large number of microvillus and ciliated neurons were activated under the stimulation of 10-5 mol/L amino acid mixture and 0.005x H. verticillata extract. The calcium signal imagery demonstrated that the nerve signals of the olfactory bulb were activated by the food odors. The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed significant changes in the expression of representative olfactory receptor genes in the olfactory bulb and brain of blunt snout bream upon stimulation with food odor. Collectively, these results provided evidence and preliminary explanations for the mediating role of olfaction in the feeding behavior of fish.

Post-thaw sperm motion and viability traits were evaluated. Pilot study involved six semen ejaculates (2 ejaculates/bull, from three bulls); second experiment was conducted using twenty seven semen ejaculates (9 ejaculates/bull, from 3 bulls) and in third experiment three semen ejaculates (one bull) were used. Eight concentrations of SDS (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.15, 0.125, 0.0625 and 0.0312%), twelve concentrations of NOG (33, 22, 11, 5.5, 2.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125 and 0.0156 mM), and, eleven concentrations of 4-MPG (220, 165, 110, 55, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56 and 0.78 mM) were supplemented in TEYG semen extender to evaluate the post-thaw sperm motility and viability traits. Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) was used to measure the kinetic and functional parameters for sperm motion traits, Hypo Osmotic Swelling Test (HOST) for sperm plasma membrane integrity, Eosin Nigrosin staining for viability and Rose Bengal staining for sperm abnormalities for all the experiments except for pilot study where only Total Motility (TM) and Rapid Progressive Motility (RP) were evaluated. Three freezing protocols; i) Normal P24 (freezing rate of -30 degrees C min(-1) from 4 degrees C to -15 degrees C; -40 degrees C min(-1) from -15 degrees C to -60 degrees C; and -50 degrees C min(-1) from -60 degrees C to -140 degrees C; and then plunged in liquid Nitrogen at -196 degrees C); ii) Moderate P25 (freezing rate of -30 degrees C min(-1) from 4 degrees C to -15 degrees C; -50 degrees C min(-1) from -15 degrees C to -60 degrees C; and -50 degrees C min(-1) from -60 degrees C to -140 degrees C; and then plunged in liquid Nitrogen at -196 degrees C); and iii) Rapid P26 (freezing rate of -30 degrees C min(-1) from 4 degrees C to -15 degrees C; -60 degrees C min(-1) from -15 degrees C to -60 degrees C; and -50 degrees C min(-1) from -60 degrees C to -140 degrees C; and then plunged in liquid Nitrogen at -196 degrees C) were evaluated using SDS 0.125% in TEYG semen extender. SDS <= 0.125%, NOG <= 0.0625 mM and 4-MPG <= 3.125 mM in TEYG buffalo semen extender improved significantly (p < .05) the kinetic and functional parameters as compared to the other Ice Recrystallization Inhibitors (IRIs) concentrations used for cryopreservation of buffalo bull semen in the pilot study. SDS 0.125% supplementation was the best IRI among all which resulted in improved kinetic and functional parameters of bull semen in second experiment. Conclusion was drawn that buffalo bull semen cryopreservation using sodium dodecyl sulphate, 0.125% as IRI in TEYG semen extender along with freezing protocol P 25 revealed optimum kinetic and functional parameters for post-thaw spermatozoa.

AB  - Simple Summary Transportation is generally believed to be a stressful event in the lives of poultry; however, studies have shown conflicting effects of transportation on stress hormone release. The hormonal stress response in animals is the organism's attempt to maintain physiological homeostasis for survival. The systems involved in maintaining physiological homeostasis for survival include the brain, the pituitary and adrenal glands, and is referred to as the HPA axis. In birds, the HPA axis is different than it is in mammals, and may involve two adrenal hormones, corticosterone and cortisol. The purpose of our study was to investigate how transportation affected the release of both of these hormones, as well as transportation effects on brain areas that initiate the HPA axis. Our results suggest that simply measuring the adrenal hormones may be insufficient to determine a bird's welfare status, and that stressors may have longer-term effects on the brain than previously believed. Thus, care must be taken on farms to prevent other stressors from occurring after transportation so as not to adversely affect the birds' health, welfare, and production. Commercial poultry undergo transportation during their life, and the effects of transportation can negatively impact poultry production and welfare. In order to maintain physiological homeostasis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) works to respond to stressors. Previous studies by others have shown contradictory effects of transportation on corticosterone release. However, recent studies from our lab and by others have shown that cortisol may also be an important hormone in the avian HPA. The purpose of our current study was to determine the effects of transportation stress on the stimulation of brain nuclei that regulate the HPA in birds, and on glucocorticoid (GC) secretion. To test this hypothesis, we collected blood and brain samples from developer drakes and hens (N = 10 per sex/time point): 24 h prior to transportation, immediately after transportation, 24 h after transportation, and 1 week after transportation. Serum GC levels and fos immunocytochemistry (ICC) within the nucleus of the hippocampal commissure (NHpC) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were measured. Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. Post hoc analysis was completed using a Fisher's PLSD with a p < 0.05 considered significant. We observed a sex difference (p < 0.05) in both corticosterone and cortisol secretion in Pekin ducks, although neither GC showed a significant increase in secretion associated with transportation. However, we did observe a significant (p < 0.05) increase in fos-like immunoreactivity for 24 h in the PVN, but not in the NHpC. Further studies are required to determine the specific role that GCs play in the avian stress response and the short-term stressors that could have long-term physiological effects on birds.

AB  - Many herbivorous insects exhibit enhanced performance and population dynamics on drought-stressed host plants due to induced changes in plant physiology. However, the underlying mechanisms of how drought regulates plant defense against herbivorous insects are still largely unknown. In this study, we found that the survival rate and fecundity of whiteflies, notorious global pests, were significantly higher on drought-stressed tobacco. Drought stress did not affect jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation, whereas it significantly decreased the salicylic acid (SA) content by suppressing its biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that drought-induced abscisic acid (ABA) inhibited the expression of isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1), a key enzyme in the synthesis of SA. The accumulation of ABA induced the expression of abscisic acid responsive NAC domain containing protein 19 (ANAC019), which directly bound to the promoter of NtICS1 and negatively regulated its expression. Finally, we revealed that drought and ABA could activate abscisic acid responsive elements-binding factor 2 (ABF2) transcription factor to up-regulate the expression of NtANAC019. Our study illustrates the significance of cross-talk between abiotic stress and plant-herbivore interactions and reveals the mechanisms leading to altered herbivore fitness on drought-stressed plants.

AB  - Terpenoids play important roles in flavour, pollinator attraction and defence of plants. In cucumber (Cucumis sativus) they are important components of the herbivore-induced plant volatile blend that attracts natural enemies of herbivores. We annotated the cucumber TERPENE SYNTHASE gene (CsTPS) family and characterized their involvement in the response towards herbivores with different feeding guilds using a combined molecular and biochemical approach. Transcripts of multiple CsTPS genes were upregulated in leaves upon herbivory and the products generated by the expressed proteins match the terpenoids recorded in the volatile blend released by herbivore-damaged leaves. Spatial and temporal analysis of the promoter activity of CsTPS genes showed that cell content-feeding spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) induced promoter activity of CsTPS9 and CsTPS19 within hours after initiation of infestation, while phloem-feeding aphids (Myzus persicae) induced CsTPS2 promoter activity. Our findings offer detailed insights into the involvement of the TPS gene family in the dynamics and fine-tuning of the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles in cucumber, and open a new avenue to understand molecular mechanisms that affect plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Understanding the shared genetic aetiology of psychiatric and medical comorbidity in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) could improve patient diagnosis, stratification and treatment options. Rare tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 2 (TANC2)-disrupting variants were disease causing in NDD patients. The post-synaptic scaffold protein TANC2 is essential for dendrite formation in synaptic plasticity and plays an unclarified but critical role in development. We here report a novel homozygous-viable Tanc2-disrupted function model in which mutant mice were hyperactive and had impaired sensorimotor gating consistent with NDD patient psychiatric endophenotypes. Yet, a multi-systemic analysis revealed the pleiotropic effects of Tanc2 outside the brain, such as growth failure and hepatocellular damage. This was associated with aberrant liver function including altered hepatocellular metabolism. Integrative analysis indicates that these disrupted Tanc2 systemic effects relate to interaction with Hippo developmental signalling pathway proteins and will increase the risk for comorbid somatic disease. This highlights how NDD gene pleiotropy can augment medical comorbidity susceptibility, underscoring the benefit of holistic NDD patient diagnosis and treatment for which large-scale preclinical functional genomics can provide complementary pleiotropic gene function information.

AB  - Simple Summary Previous research in New Zealand on working sheep dogs has found that 39% suffered from retinal eye disease. One of the causes of this eye disease is parasite migration to the eye. Since that research was published in 1987, farmers have been educated to regularly treat farm dogs with anti-parasitic tablets. However, there has been no follow-up studies to see if eye disease is still a problem in working farm dogs. Our study investigated whether eye disease is still present in working sheep dogs in South-West, Waikato, New Zealand. Our study of 184 working sheep dogs and 51 owners was undertaken in 2010, with owners sampled from New Zealand's South-West Waikato and Tux North Island Dog Trial Championship. Eye examinations were performed on all of the dogs that participated. This study identified that 24% (44/184) of the dogs in the study showed evidence of retinal eye disease. Male working sheep dogs are more susceptible to develop retinal eye disease than females for unidentified reasons. This study concluded that retinal eye disease is still present in working sheep dogs in New Zealand. A study in conducted 1987 by Hughes et al., found that 39% of working sheep dogs had multifocal retinitis. One of the identified causes was ocular larval migrans, which were a result of migrating ascarid larvae. Since that paper was published, anthelmintic use in farm dogs has been highly recommended. There has been no follow-up study to determine if fundic lesions are still present. The current study aimed to investigate the prevalence of chorioretinopathy in working sheep dogs in the South-West, Waikato, New Zealand. This was a cross-sectional study of 184 working sheep dogs and 51 owners, undertaken in 2010 with owners sampled from New Zealand's South-West Waikato and Tux North Island Dog Trial Championship. Two-way tables were used to explore the relationship between variables. Significance of association was assessed using a Chi-squared or Fisher exact test as appropriate, with a p-value of <0.05 considered significant. Overall prevalence of chorioretinopathy in the working sheep dogs was 44/184 (24%). A significantly higher prevalence of chorioretinopathy was shown in dogs with increasing age, from 2 years to >8 years (p = 0.0007) and in males (p < 0.0001). This study concluded that lesions of chorioretinopathy are still present in working sheep dogs in New Zealand.

Cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance tasks. Oxidative stress markers, including malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), were measured in the hippocampus using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and ferric reduction antioxidant power (FRAP). Nitric oxide (NO) level in the hippocampus was determined using an NO Assay Kit (Natrix, Arman Biotech, Iran).ResultsChronic ethanol administration impaired cognitive functions. However, RIT, HIIT, and their combination significantly improved these impairments. Furthermore, RIT increased ethanol-induced oxidative stress, whereas HIIT reduced it, even in the combination group.ConclusionChronic ethanol consumption caused learning and memory deficits and disrupted oxidant/antioxidant balance in the hippocampus of rats. HIIT potentially improved memory impairments by restoring this balance, whereas RIT ameliorated cognitive dysfunction through a mechanism that requires further investigation.

AB  - In recent years, as the scale of breeding farms has become increasingly larger, to improve animal welfare and increase farm output, an increasing number of farms have proposed the idea of precision feeding for individual animals. Therefore, how to accurately identify a single animal individually and provide a targeted breeding program for it has become the focus. We have designed and evaluated a lightweight pig face recognition model based on a deep convolutional neural network algorithm, which can achieve a high pig face recognition rate in complex environments. This is a two-stage convolutional neural network model. The first stage is responsible for pig face detection. Based on the EfficientDet-DO model, we show an improved average precision for pig face detection from 90.7% to 99.1% by employing a dataset sampling technique. The second stage is responsible for pig face classification, using six classification models, including ResNet-18, ResNet-34, DenseNet-121, Inception-v3, AlexNet, and VGGNet-19, as the backbone and proposes an improved method based on the triplet margin loss function. To strengthen the network performance, the multitask learning method enables the network to effectively cluster the features of the feature extractor layer. Then, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used to replace the fully connected layer with a large number of parameters to classify the features. These improved models have a maximum classification accuracy of 96.8% for 28 pigs. The parameters of these improved models are reduced to 4.32% of the original at most. Finally, the two-stage model including EfficientDet-d0 and DenseNet 121 has a mean average precision value of 91.35% for face recognition of 28 pigs. Compared with the EfficientDet-d0 network trained by the one-stage method, the mean average precision value is improved by 28%. In addition, we reorganized the original dataset and performed 10-fold cross-validation, and the mAP value was 94.04%.

AB  - Plant sterols constitute the sole source of sterol nutrition for insect herbivores, yet the sterol content of plants is complex and variable, and insect sterol nutrient regulation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated cholesterol regulation in Spodoptera frugiperda using a geometric framework for nutrition. In the choice experiment, we provided larvae with eight food pairings. The insects did not adjust their feeding on the pair of complementary diets to achieve a specific cholesterol intake target. In the no-choice experiment, seven foods with different cholesterol concentrations were administered to explore sterol regulation. The larvae did not show a tendency to reduce or increase their intake of non-cholesterol nutrients to reach a certain cholesterol intake. We then measured the relative expression of the NPC1b gene in the intestine and the cholesterol content of the feces. As the cholesterol content in the food increased, NPC1b gene expression gradually decreased and the larvae excreted more cholesterol in the feces. Meanwhile, the cholesterol content in the larvae remains largely consistent, indicating that the larvae has a strong control on the body sterol content. Altogether, our results suggest that the larvae regulate cholesterol homeostasis by balancing cholesterol uptake and excretion, and cholesterol level can be kept within a physiologically appropriate range.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm - FAW) is an important polyphagous agricultural pest feeding on nearly 350 host plants. FAW is undergoing incipient speciation with two well-characterized host-adapted strains, the "corn" (CS) and "rice" (RS) strains, which are morphologically identical but carry several genes under positive selection for host adaptation. We used non-targeted metabolomics based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify differences in metabolite profiles of the larval gut of CS and RS feeding on different host plants. Larvae were fed on artificial diet, maize, rice, or cotton leaves from eclosion to the sixth instar, when they had their midgut dissected for analysis. This study revealed that the midgut metabolome of FAW varied due to larval diet and differed between the FAW host-adapted strains. Additionally, we identified several candidate metabolites that may be involved in the adaptation of CS and RS to their host plants. Our findings provide clues toward the gut metabolic activities of the FAW strains.

AB  - Currently, non-contact and automatic measurement of livestock body size is the research orientation of computer-aided livestock breeding and intelligent farming industry. However, directly locating the body size measurement key points on the dense overall point clouds of livestock often results in positioning deviation and affects the measurement accuracy. Additionally, various postures of livestock and the interference of different parts of livestock body are also prone to key points positioning deviations. For more accurate measurement of pig body size, we propose in our paper an improved PointNet++ point cloud segmentation model to subdivide the overall pig point clouds into various parts, such as the pig's head, ears, trunk, limbs, and tail to localize the body measurement key points in the segmented local parts. A new body size measurement method based on segmentation results, which is integrated with the least squares, point cloud slicing, edge extraction, and polynomial fitting, is also presented in our study so that the pig body size parameters can be more accurately calculated. In our experiment, 25 live pigs and 207 groups of pig body point clouds were used for point cloud segmentation and body size measurements. Compared with manual measurements, the relative errors in our experimental results are listed as follows: body length: 2.57 %, body height (front): 2.18 %, body height (back): 2.28 %, body width (front): 4.56 %, body width (middle): 5.26 %, body width (back): 5.19 %, thoracic circumference: 2.50 %, abdominal circumference: 3.14 %, rump circumference: 2.85 %. To conclude, the new automatic measurement method based on the improved PointNet++ point cloud segmentation model with higher accuracy has a more promising application prospect thanks to its novel features, precise measurement results and stable robustness.

AB  - Implementing the European Green Deal requires a consistent food systems' policy that involves not only targeting the supply side but also conducting extensive changes in diets at the consumer level. Reducing meat consumption is an obvious strategy to put the European food system on track to meet the Green Deal's goals. This cannot be achieved by focusing solely on consumer choice and individual responsibility. Stronger governance is required to reduce the scale of meat consumption to sustainable levels. Such governance needs to be informed by a holistic definition of "sustainable meat consumption", designed to ensure that important sustainability priorities are not neglected, and to account for all emissions associated with EU consumption, regardless of where production takes place. This article presents a conceptual framework to define "sustainable meat consumption" based on the concept of consumption corridors (CCs). A CC is the space between a minimum (the floor) and maximum (the ceiling) consumption level, which allows everybody to satisfy their needs without compromising others' ability to meet their own. Embedded in a powerful set of principles (recognizing universal needs; tackling both over and under-consumption; framing food as a common good; promoting public participation; and addressing environmental justice and planetary sustainability), CCs are attuned to the Green Deal's ambition to "leave no one behind", in the EU and beyond. CCs provide a demand-side solution encompassing a more equitable alternative to discuss what is actually a "fair share" of the world's limited resources when it comes to meat consumption.

AB  - The agricultural sector is the largest source for air pollutants of ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Establishing a unified and homologous emission inventory of air pollutants and GHGs is essential for synergistic abatement pathway studies of air pollution and climate change. However, current agriculture emission inventories of air pollutants and GHGs are unclear due to the separated source classification and inconsistent calculating methodologies. This study adopted a synergistic approach to develop a unified emission inventory for NH3, N2O, and CH4 from the agricultural sector in China for 2021, based on crop and livestock types as the activity level data, and considered regional-specific species in emission factors. The results showed that China's agricultural emissions in 2021 amounted to 7566.17 Gg of NH3, 486.14 Gg of N2O, and 14,979.71 Gg of CH4. Rice, cattle, and pigs were the primary contributors of NH3, N2O, and CH4. Hotspots of NH3 and N2O emissions were concentrated in the North China Plain and Sichuan Basin, whereas CH4 emissions were predominantly located in southern China. This study provides a crop- and livestock-specific data foundation for making region-specific and priority-based integrated strategies to improve air quality, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable agricultural development in China.

AB  - Elephant deterrent fences have become a popular strategy to mitigate human-elephant conflict in agricultural areas. It is unknown whether the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices like intercropping could influence elephant behaviour and therefore the effectiveness of these fences. In this study in southern Kenya, the success of the Kasaine metal strip fence was compared between intercropped and monocropped fields. Results support previous research, as the Kasaine fence remained effective, suggesting the adoption of intercropping is unlikely to drastically change elephant crop foraging behaviour.

AB  - Type-IV glandular trichomes, which only occur in the juvenile developmental phase of the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), produce acylsugars that broadly protect against arthropod herbivory. Previously, we introgressed the capacity to retain type-IV trichomes in the adult phase from the wild tomato, Solanum galapagense, into the cultivated species cv. Micro-Tom (MT). The resulting MT-Galapagos enhanced trichome (MT-Get) introgression line contained 5 loci associated with enhancing the density of type-IV trichomes in adult plants. We genetically dissected MT-Get and obtained a subline containing only the locus on Chromosome 2 (MT-Get02). This genotype displayed about half the density of type-IV trichomes compared to the wild progenitor. However, when we stacked the gain-of-function allele of WOOLLY, which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper IV transcription factor, Get02/Wo exhibited double the number of type-IV trichomes compared to S. galapagense. This discovery corroborates previous reports positioning WOOLLY as a master regulator of trichome development. Acylsugar levels in Get02/Wo were comparable to the wild progenitor, although the composition of acylsugar types differed, especially regarding fewer types with medium-length acyl chains. Agronomical parameters of Get02/Wo, including yield, were comparable to MT. Pest resistance assays showed enhanced protection against silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), and the fungus Septoria lycopersici. However, resistance levels did not reach those of the wild progenitor, suggesting the specificity of acylsugar types in the pest resistance mechanism. Our findings in trichome-mediated resistance advance the development of robust, naturally resistant tomato varieties, harnessing the potential of natural genetic variation. Moreover, by manipulating only 2 loci, we achieved exceptional results for a highly complex, polygenic trait, such as herbivory resistance in tomato.
   Combining a natural genetic variation from a wild tomato (Get02) with the Woolly allele increases trichome density in adult tomato plants, conferring greater pest resistance against insects and fungi.

AB  - The functional role of the entorhinal-hippocampal system has been a long withstanding mystery. One key theory that has become most popular is that the entorhinal-hippocampal system represents space to facilitate navigation in one's surroundings. In this Perspective article, I introduce a novel idea that undermines the inherent uniqueness of spatial information in favor of time driving entorhinal-hippocampal activity. Specifically, by spatializing events that occur in succession (i.e., across time), the entorhinal-hippocampal system is critical for all types of cognitive representations. I back up this argument with empirical evidence that hints at a role for the entorhinal-hippocampal system in non-spatial representation, and computational models of the logarithmic compression of time in the brain.

AB  - This study examined how the vitrification of pig blastocysts using either the superfine open pulled straw (SOPS) or Cryotop method affects the expression profile of embryonic microRNA (miRNA) transcriptomes, as well as its relation to changes in the expression of target genes (TGs). Surgically collected pig blastocysts were vitrified using either the SOPS method (n = 60; 4 - 6 embryos/device) or the Cryotop system (n = 60; 20 embryos/device). Embryos were cultured in vitro for 24 h after warming. Fresh blastocysts (n = 60) cultured for 24 h served as controls. After in vitro culture, five pools of eight viable blastocysts from each group were prepared for miRNA expression analysis based on a microarray approach. Then, biological interpretation of miRNAs profiles and integrative analysis of miRNA and mRNA transcriptome data were performed. Survival after 24 h of in vitro culture was similar ( >96 %) for both the vitrification systems and the control group (100 %). Compared with the controls, the SOPS -vitrified blastocysts had 94 (one upregulated and 93 downregulated) differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs, and the Cryotop-vitrified blastocysts had 174 DE miRNAs (one upregulated and 173 downregulated). One DE miRNA (miR-503) in the SOPS group and three DE miRNAs (miR-7139 - 3p, miR-214 and miR-885 - 3p) in the Cryotop group were annotated for Sus scrofa . The integrative analysis showed that 27 and 61 DE TGs were regulated by the DE miRNAs in blastocysts vitrified with the SOPS and Cryotop systems, respectively. The TGs enriched one pathway (the TGF- beta signaling pathway) for the SOPS system and four pathways (HIF-1, Notch, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-ganglio series) for the Cryotop system. In summary, vitrification via the SOPS and Cryotop systems dysregulates miRNAs, with slight differences between methods. The altered miRNAs identified in this study were related mainly to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the response to cell stress. Further studies are needed to clarify the consequences of dysregulation of miRNAs involved in the TGF- beta (SOPS -vitrified blastocyst) and Notch (Cryotop-vitrified blastocyst) signaling pathways, particularly if they can affect embryonic development.

AB  - Nutrient recovery from anaerobic digestate through electrodialysis technology (ED) has been investigated and shown high promise, but the removal of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), which is a natural estrogen and widely found in manure digestate, is not clear. This study examined the mechanism of membrane adsorption and anodic oxidation of E2 during recovering nutrient from manure digestate, and further investigated the performance of Anode-ED in E2 removal. The results showed that the removal of E2 in conventional ED was primarily attributed to membrane adsorption, resulting in no detectable E2 in the product solution. The adsorption capacity of the anion exchange membrane for E2 was significantly higher compared to that of the cation exchange membrane. During Anode-ED operation, E2 was efficiently removed by electrochemical oxidation, in which the chlorination played a primary role. Moreover, the oxidation intermediates of E2 were further removed after 40 min. Even though the carbonate, volatile fatty acid (VFA), and humic acid in the real wastewater have a negative impact on E2 oxidation, the E2 was completely removed from digestate during nutrient recovery in the anode-ED. This study indicates that anode-ED is a promising technology for the removal of E2 during nutrient recovery from digestate.

AB  - The TG interaction factor 1 (TGIF1) is of the TALE homologue domain protein family and is considered as a transcriptional repressor of SMAD protein that interacts with DNA through a specific consensus-binding site for TG and recruits mSin3A and histone deacetylases to the SMAD complex. In this study, there is the first detailed description of TGIF1 on steroidogenesis in goat granulosa cells. When there is a relatively greater expression of the TGIF1 gene, there is a lesser abundance of CYP11A1, CYP19A1, and StAR mRNA transcript and protein and 3 beta-HSD mRNA transcript in granulosa cells of goats. Furthermore, there were lesser concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) and progesterone (P-4) in culture medium when there was greater TGIF1 gene expression and there were greater concentrations of these hormones in the culture medium when there was lesser TGIF1 gene expression. There may be functions of TGIF1, therefore, in suppression of SMAD-induced E-2 and P-4 production and in decreasing the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 in granulosa cells of goats and relative abundance of the SMAD2/3 protein transcription factor, SP1. With suppression of TGIF1 gene expression, there was a reversal of SP1-induced suppression of steroidogenesis-related genes. Results of the present study provide insights about the potential mechanism underlying the regulation of granulosa cell stemidogenesis of goats by TGIF1.

AB  - A diet with a high dietary fiber content is often recommended in today's nutrition due to several beneficial health effects related to its intake. Lignin as a part of dietary fiber is the second most abundant natural polymer and considered to be stable during digestion. However, some studies indicate a partial degradation during the intestinal metabolism. To further elucidate this hypothesis, the aim of this study was to investigate whether lignin is metabolized by the gut microbiota using the ex vivo pig cecum model. As potential lignin-derived metabolites might already naturally occur in the pig cecal matrix, an approach using isotopically labeled C-13 lignin was chosen for this study. Ten small phenolic lignin degradation products and their time-dependent metabolism were identified via an untargeted HPLC-HRMS approach, and the quantity of the metabolites was estimated. From the results, we conclude that is small metabolites.

AB  - Animals select oviposition sites to reduce predation risk for their offspring. Generally, predation risk increases with predator starvation. When predators become more dangerous to prey by starvation, prey should avoid oviposition on patches with starved predators compared with satiated predators. We tested this possibility using herbivorous mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), and two predatory mite species, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), focusing the role of predatory mite cues in the absence of predatory mite themselves. Adult female P. persimilis and N. californicus that had been starved for 1 or 3 days consumed more T. urticae eggs than satiated conspecifics, irrespective of the starvation duration. This suggests that both predators become more dangerous to T. urticae eggs after having been starved. Subsequently, we offered adult female T. urticae choice between a clean leaf patch or a leaf patch exposed to P. persimilis or N. californicus that had been satiated or starved for 1 or 3 days. Adult female T. urticae laid more eggs on the clean patches in the presence of satiated predator cues than starved predator cues, irrespective of the predator species and starvation duration. These results suggest that adult female T. urticae were less likely to decrease the predation risk to their offspring based on starvation levels of predators. This incomplete predator avoidance may facilitate the coexistence of predators and prey.

AB  - This study aimed to determine how the route of antimicrobial administration affected the growth performance of weaned piglets. Additionally, we aimed to investigate potential differences between antimicrobial resistance developed by antimicrobials administered orally through drinking water, and those administered through feed, in weaned piglets. The research was undertaken on a farm housing 500 sows and involved 150 weaned piglets at 21 days of age. These piglets were evenly distributed into three groups of equal size: water, feed, and control. Antimicrobials were administered through drinking water and feed in the water and feed groups, respectively, while the control group received no antimicrobial treatment. The observation of piglets continued until they reached 70 days of age. The feed conversion ratio in the water group (1.7 +/- 0.78) was significantly higher than in the control (2.4 +/- 1.77) and feed (2.7 +/- 1.68) groups. Additionally, the route of administration did not affect antimicrobial resistance rates. Based on these results, it can be inferred that administering antimicrobials through drinking water is advantageous for pig farming.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the most challenging setbacks for intensive swine industries to improve animal welfare and sustainability is skilled labor. Human observations are needed to accurately identify sick or injured pigs. Still, animal caretakers are limited in the amount of time they take and the frequency of observations they can complete in a day. Here, using a controlled immune challenge in nursery pigs, a visual-based precision livestock technology can identify pigs with greater specificity and sensitivity than trained human observers. This system can monitor pigs 24 h a day, seven days a week, in group housing. The potential impact of this research may improve the laborer's ability to treat animals at the individual level rather than the group level. The objectives were to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff values of a visual-based precision livestock technology (NUtrack), and determine the sensitivity and specificity of sickness score data collected with the live observation by trained human observers. At weaning, pigs (n = 192; gilts and barrows) were randomly assigned to one of twelve pens (16/pen) and treatments were randomly assigned to pens. Sham-pen pigs all received subcutaneous saline (3 mL). For LPS-pen pigs, all pigs received subcutaneous lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 300 mu g/kg BW; E. coli O111:B4; in 3 mL of saline). For the last treatment, eight pigs were randomly assigned to receive LPS, and the other eight were sham (same methods as above; half-and-half pens). Human data from the day of the challenge presented high true positive and low false positive rates (88.5% sensitivity; 85.4% specificity; 0.871 Area Under Curve, AUC), however, these values declined when half-and-half pigs were scored (75% sensitivity; 65.5% specificity; 0.703 AUC). Precision technology measures had excellent AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for the first 72 h after treatment and AUC values were >0.970, regardless of pen treatment. These results indicate that precision technology has a greater potential for identifying pigs during a natural infectious disease event than trained professionals using timepoint sampling.

AB  - Agriculture is facing a number of challenges included low harvest index, low nutrient use efficiency, water limitation, etc. affected by climate change. Nano-form of nutrients is a frontier technology to improve crop productivity under these conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of foliar application of nano form of silicon and calcium on the photosynthetic pigments, the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the amount of soluble sugars. This study was performed as a factorial experiment in based on completely randomized design with three replications in Iran in 2019 and 2020. Analysis of variance showed that the main effect of calcium was significant for all studied traits except chlorophyll a/b ratio. The experimental results showed that the interaction effect of nano-calcium and nano-silicon was significant for all studied traits except chlorophyll a/b ratio. Also, the results of mean comparison showed that the highest level of antioxidant enzyme activity was observed in the treatment of 0 mg L-1 nano-siliconx1 g L-1 nano-calcium consumption. The highest amount of total chlorophyll, glucose, galactose, rhamnosus and xylose sugars as well as proline were observed in the treatment of application of 2.5 mg L-1 nano-silicon x and 1 g L-1 nano-calcium. The results of correlation analysis showed that there was a negative relationship between malondialdehyde and antioxidant enzymes. Also, principal component analysis and cluster analysis were able to properly group the different treatments studied. Cluster analysis divided the studied treatments into four groups, so that the treatment of application of 1 g L-1 nano-calcium and consumption of 2.5 mg L-1 nano-silicon were independently grouped. The biplot obtained from the first and second components showed that the treatment of 4% calcium application and no silicon consumption had a very strong relationship with anthocyanin. Finally, this experiment showed that the treatment of consumption of 1 g L-1 nano-calcium and application of 2.5 mg L-1 nano-silicon have favorable biochemical and physiological effects related to photosynthetic processes and sugar production in camelina.

AB  - Simple Summary Numerous reports have suggested that lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are important probiotics, can protect animals against pathogen-induced injury and inflammation, regulate gut microflora, enhance digestive tract function, improve animal growth performance, and decrease the incidence of diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic (ETEC) that expresses K88. This research selected Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri P7, L. amylovorus P8, and L. johnsonii P15 with good inhibition against ETEC K88 and excellent probiotic properties screened from 295 LAB strains isolated from fecal samples from 55 healthy weaned piglets for a study on feeding of sows in late pregnancy and weaned piglets. Feed supplementation with these three strains improved reproductive performance of sows and growth performance of piglets, decreased the incidence of diarrhea in piglets, and increased the antioxidant capacity of serum in both sows and piglets. Therefore, L. reuteri P7, L. amylovorus P8, and L. johnsonii P15 might be considered as potential antibiotic alternatives for further study. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which expresses K88 is the principal microorganism responsible for bacterial diarrhea in pig husbandry, and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics has caused many problems; therefore, antibiotics need to be replaced in order to prevent diarrhea caused by ETEC K88. The objective of this study was to screen excellent lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains that inhibit ETEC K88 and explore their effects as probiotic supplementation on reproduction, growth performance, diarrheal incidence, and antioxidant capacity of serum in sows and weaned piglets. Three LAB strains, P7, P8, and P15, screened from 295 LAB strains and assigned to Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri, L. amylovorus, and L. johnsonii with high inhibitory activity against ETEC K88 were selected for a study on feeding of sows and weaned piglets. These strains were chosen for their good physiological and biochemical characteristics, excellent exopolysaccharide (EPS) production capacity, hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation ability, survival in gastrointestinal (GI) fluids, lack of hemolytic activity, and broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of microorganisms. The results indicate that LAB strains P7, P8, and P15 had significant effects on improving the reproductive performance of sows and the growth performance of weaned piglets, increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and immune indexes in both.

AB  - Automated data extraction from materials science literature at scale using artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques is critical to advance materials discovery. However, this process for large spans of text continues to be a challenge due to the specific nature and styles of scientific manuscripts. In this study, we present a framework to automatically extract polymer-property data from full-text journal articles using commercially available (GPT-3.5) and open-source (LlaMa 2) large language models (LLM), in tandem with the named entity recognition (NER)-based MaterialsBERT model. Leveraging a corpus of similar to 2.4 million full text articles, our method successfully identified and processed around 681,000 polymer-related articles, resulting in the extraction of over one million records corresponding to 24 properties of over 106,000 unique polymers. We additionally conducted an extensive evaluation of the performance and associated costs of the LLMs used for data extraction, compared to the NER model. We suggest methodologies to optimize costs, provide insights on effective inference via in-context few-shots learning, and illuminate gaps and opportunities for future studies utilizing LLMs for natural language processing in polymer science. The extracted polymer-property data has been made publicly available for the wider scientific community via the Polymer Scholar website.

AB  - BackgroundCamellia oleifera, an essential woody oil tree in China, propagates through grafting. However, in production, it has been found that the interaction between rootstocks and scions may affect fruit characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to predict fruit characteristics after grafting to identify suitable rootstock types. MethodsThis study used Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods to analyze the impact of 106 6-year-old grafting combinations on the characteristics of C.oleifera, including fruit and seed characteristics, and fatty acids. The prediction of characteristics changes after grafting was explored to provide technical support for the cultivation and screening of specialized rootstocks. After determining the unsaturated fat acids, palmitoleic acid C16:1, cis-11 eicosenoic acid C20:1, oleic acid C18:1, linoleic acid C18:2, linolenic acid C18:3, kernel oil content, fruit height, fruit diameter, fresh fruit weight, pericarp thickness, fresh seed weight, and the number of fresh seeds, the DNN method was used to calculate and analyze the model. The model was screened using the comprehensive evaluation index of Mean Absolute Error (MAPE), determinate correlation R-2 and and time consumption. ResultsWhen using 36 neurons in 3 hidden layers, the deep neural network model had a MAPE of less than or equal to 16.39% on the verification set and less than or equal to 13.40% on the test set. Compared with traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machines and random forests, the DNN method demonstrated more accurate predictions for fruit phenotypic characteristics, with MAPE improvement rates of 7.27 and 3.28 for the 12 characteristics on the test set and maximum R-2 improvement values of 0.19 and 0.33. In conclusion, the DNN method developed in this study can effectively predict the oil content and fruit phenotypic characteristics of C. oleifera, providing a valuable tool for predicting the impact of grafting combinations on the fruit of C. oleifera.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) is a daily drink in modern life throughout the world. Global warming increases the exposure of tea plants to elevated heat conditions during the summer picking period. Therefore, it is a fundamental function of the meteorological service to determine the critical temperature threshold that triggers heat damage (HD) to tea plants. In this study, MODIS daytime land surface temperature (LST) products obtained from the Aqua satellite (MYD11A1), annual land cover type products (MCD12Q1), and actual HD records were jointly used to determine the critical LST threshold resulting in HD to tea planting areas in China. An LST dataset of HD and HD-free samples was constructed based on actual HD records. The box-plot method was then used to delineate the range of LST outliers in HD to tea plants. The cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) method was adopted to determine the critical LST threshold by searching for the maximum slope of CFD within the range of LST outliers based on 2901 actual HD samples from 42 agrometeorological stations in 11 provinces in China. Results showed that the critical LST threshold triggering HD to tea plants was 30.1 degrees C. Two different HD data sources (i.e., 68 counties in eight provinces from the Meteorological Disaster Management System (MDMS) and 37 counties in six cities from a published book) were used as HD validation samples. Validation accuracy analysis revealed that a critical LST threshold of 30.1 degrees C was reasonable, with an average accuracy of between 60% and 90% for the published-book dataset, and 75.7% in the northern Yangtze River area and 86.3% in the southern Yangtze River area for the MDMS dataset. This study confirmed that using remotely sensed LST products is an effective method for identifying temperature-related agrometeorological disasters owing to the method's ability to intuitively capture the surface temperature distribution of the disaster-affected object. The findings will be helpful for identifying the timing and location of HD to tea plants, and thereby potentially preventing HD to tea plants.

AB  - The use of probiotics in animal feed is one of the most promising alternatives to the application of antibiotics. In order to establish the effectiveness of the use of a complex probiotic supplement ( Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Spirulinaceae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Actinomycetaceae, Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp.) in pig farming, two groups of pigs of the Poltava Meat breed were formed by the analog method. In the ration of the fattening pigs of the experimental group, 1.0% of the mass of compound feed was replaced with a complex probiotic supplement, which was fed during the 45 days of the experimental period at the age of 135 to 180 days. In experimental pigs, biochemical blood parameters were determined (the content of protein, lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, the content of creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, albumins and globulins) using test kits from the company "Filisit Diagnostics" (UA). As a result of the research, it was established that with the use of a complex probiotic feed supplement, the content of total protein in the blood serum of the pigs of the experimental group was higher by 18.4%, glucose by 21.4%, aspartate aminotransferase activity by 20.4%, alanine aminotransferase by 38.0% compared to control group. In both groups, regardless of the established difference, the named indicators were within the physiological norm. The concentration of cholesterol in the blood of pigs receiving the probiotic supplement decreased by 43.2%, but the concentration of calcium (by 26.2%) and phosphorus (by 17.9%) increased. In the experimental group, the blood indicators related to the immunity of pigs improved - the content of alpha 1 and alpha 2 globulins decreased by 4.1% and 7.4%, respectively. Also, in the experimental group, the concentration of albumins increased by 7.5%, which probably indicates an improvement in the functional state of the liver. As a result of feeding with a complex probiotic supplement in the experimental group the albumin-globulin ratio improved, which increased by 35.0%. Thus, the introduction of a complex probiotic feed additive into the ration of pigs changed the structure of the influence of exogenous and endogenous factors on metabolism, had a positive effect on the protein profile of the blood, and caused an increase of average daily gains in experimental animals by 5.8% compared to the control group.

AB  - Green light is generally used as the transmitter of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system, but the currently available light-emitting diode (LED)-based green light has a poor luminous flux density (i.e., low brightness) and a low wall-plug efficiency (WPE), known as the "green gap". In this work, it is proposed to produce the laser-driven green light by using blue laser diodes to pump the narrow-band green-emitting beta-Sialon phosphor-in-glass (PiG) film. The dominant wavelength of the laser-driven green light can be tuned in the range of approximate to 520-540 nm, required for UWOC, by controlling the phosphor content at approximate to 60-80% and the film thickness at approximate to 150-185 mu m. By introducing highly reflective TiO2 into the PiG film, the laser-driven green light exhibits a maximum luminous flux density of 1260 lm mm(-2) under blue laser excitation with a power density of 15.49 W mm(-2). For UWOC application, the green light is demonstrated to have a modulation bandwidth of 1.76 MHz, a high WPE of 8.7%, and a long transmission distance of approximate to 61.6 m.

AB  - Floral nectar and pollen commonly contain diverse secondary metabolites. While these compounds are classically thought to play a role in plant defense, recent research indicates that they may also reduce disease in pollinators. Given that parasites have been implicated in ongoing bee declines, this discovery has spurred interest in the potential for 'medicinal' floral products to aid in pollinator conservation efforts. We review the evidence for antiparasitic effects of floral products on bee diseases, emphasizing the importance of investigating the mech-anism underlying antiparasitic effects, including direct or host-mediated effects. We discuss the high specificity of antiparasitic effects of even very similar compounds, and highlight the need to consider how nonadditive effects of multiple compounds, and the post-ingestion transformation of metabolites, mediate the disease-reducing capacity of floral products. While the bulk of research on antiparasitic effects of floral products on bee parasites has been conducted in the lab, we review evidence for the impact of such effects in the field, and highlight areas for future research at the floral product-bee disease interface. Such research has great potential both to enhance our understanding of the role of parasites in shaping plant-bee interactions, and the role of plants in determining bee-parasite dynamics. This understanding may in turn reveal new avenues for pollinator conservation.

AB  - In Europe, commercial and scientific interest in black soldier fly larvae (BSFL, Hermetia illucens) as a new feed source has grown substantially, primarily because this species can be reared on waste-streams which are otherwise unsuitable. However, before BSFL may legally be reared on such materials, and subsequently fed to livestock animals, safety must be guaranteed. Many hazards could be relevant, depending on the origin of the waste stream. Small- and large-scale experiments were performed in which BSFL were reared on the organic wet fraction of municipal household waste (OWF), kitchen/fast food waste (FFW), mushroom feet stems (MF), pig manure liquid slurry mixed with roadside silage grass (PMLSG), pig manure solids (PMS), and secondary sludge from slaughter waste (SW). Larval yields were highest on the control (chicken feed + water) and the FFW. Substrates and larvae were analysed to determine the presence of heavy metals, acrylamide, pesticides, veterinary drugs, and pathogenic bacteria. Cadmium (Cd) bioaccumulated in larvae reared on all substrates, in line with previous research. Some pesticides and veterinary drugs were found in the substrates: concentrations in the larvae were low, but potential formation of metabolites could be studied further. Acrylamide was present in the FFW, but not in the larvae reared on it: more research is needed to determine the (metabolic) fate. Bacillus cereus and traces of Salmonella spp. were found on some larval samples, but appropriate processing is anticipated to minimize potential risks. Based on these results, we conclude that most tested substrates are suitable for rearing BSFL, and do not appear to present major safety concerns, aside from the need for monitoring Cd concentrations in the substrates, and control measures for pathogenic bacteria. Further verification to account for variance in contamination of substrates is needed for definitive conclusions on the safety.

AB  - Context Most tissues of Myrtaceae plants have oil glands. The anthers of many species have an oil-containing apical gland that is larger than those in other tissues of the plant.Aims Representative species in the family were examined for the diversity of gland form and their oil contents.Methods Representative anthers were sectioned for light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy study and anthers from selected species were analysed for oil content.Key results The most common gland form is globular and narrowly attached to the apex of the connective, but in members of certain tribes, the gland is completely enclosed in the connective. The greatest morphological diversity is in the Chamelaucieae. Anther glands vary from plesiomorphic globular forms to glands that are larger than the anther thecae and almost completely fill the connective.Conclusions There are three possible functions for the glands, including the following: (1) protecting the anthers from herbivores, (2) mixing with the pollen to aid adhesion to stylar hairs on many Chamelaucineae, and (3) rewarding pollinators that use the oil-pollen mixture as food.Implications It is generally considered that the oils in various tissues of the Myrtaceae deter herbivores. In Myrtaceae with abundant anthers, the glands could deter flower visitors from consuming the anthers. Gland oil of the Eucalyptus and Leptospermum species examined contained alpha pinene as did the leaves of all species examined. The gland oil composition in Chamelaucium uncinatum and Verticordia grandis that have pollen presenters was different from that in the leaves and also different from that in the anthers of the two Verticordia species where bees collect the pollen-oil mixture for food.
   Unlike most other groups, Myrtaceae flowers have oil glands in floral tissues. The apex of anthers of most species has an oil gland that can be obvious and globular or embedded within the apical tissues. Depending on the species, the oil may deter herbivores from eating the anthers, may mix with pollen to aid adhesion to pollinators or may be chemically modified to be a food source for pollinators.

AB  - This study was designed to assess the cryosurvival of beetal buck spermatozoa with the supplementation of Glutathione (GLU) and L-cysteine (CYS) in the extender. In the first experiment, semen samples from each of the five mature bucks were pooled and diluted in Tris-citric acid (TCA) extender containing Glutathione (0.5mM, 1mM), L-cysteine (5mM CYS, 10mM CYS), and control. In experiment 2, semen samples (n=5) were diluted in TCA extender containing differential doses of combined antioxidants (0.5 mM GLU+ 5mM CYS, 0.5mM + 10mM CYS, 1mM GLU + 5mM CYS, 1mM GLU + 10mM CYS and Control). At post-thawing, progressive motility, plasma membrane integrity (PMI), and livability of buck spermatozoa were higher (P< 0.05) with 1mM GLU and 10mM CYS as compared to control. In the second experiment, post-thaw progressive motility, PMI, and livability were higher (P< 0.05) with 1mM GLU + 10mM CYS and 1mM GLU + 5mM CYS compared to other doses of GLU+CYS and control. We concluded that optimized supplementation of Glutathione and L-cysteine in TCA extender ameliorated frozen-thawed quality of beetal buck spermatozoa.

AB  - Tick abundance is an essential demographic parameter to infer tick-borne pathogen transmission risks. Spatiotemporal patterns of tick abundance are heterogeneous, so its determinants at small spatial scales need to be understood to reduce their negative effects on hosts. Current knowledge of these determinants is scarce, especially in Mediterranean environ-ments, limiting the possibilities for designing efficient tick control strategies. With the goal of unravelling tick abun-dance determinants and informing new tick management strategies, we estimated tick burdens on 1965 wild ungulates in Donana National Park, Spain, annually between 2010 and 2020. Under the hypothesis of a predominant host influence on tick abundance, we modelled the burdens of Rhipicephalus annulatus, Hyalomma lusitanicum, and Ixodes ricinus with relevant predictors grouped into four factors: i) environment; ii) host population; iii) host individual; and iv) land-use. Generalized linear mixed models with a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution were built. Additionally, we analysed the differential contribution to abundance of each factor by deviance partitioning. We finally estimated the similarity in the environmental space of tick species by analysing their niche overlap with the environmental principal component analysis method. Our work hypothesis was confirmed for R. annulatus and H. lusitanicum, but we found that tick abundance at a fine spatial scale is jointly driven by multiple drivers, including all four factors considered in this study. This result points out that understanding the demography of ticks is a complex multifactorial issue, even at small spatial scales. We found no niche differences between the three tick species at the study spatial scale, thus showing similar host and environmental dependencies. Overall results identify that host aggregation areas displaying environ-mentally favourable traits for ticks are relevant tick and vector-borne pathogen transmission hotspots. Our findings will facilitate the design of new strategies to reduce the negative effects of tick parasitism.

AB  - Social hierarchy is a fundamental feature of social organization that can influence brain and emotional processing regarding social ranks. Several areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the hippocampus, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), are recognized to be involved in the regulation of emotional processing. However, its delicate structural correlates in brain regions are poorly understood. To address this issue, social hierarchy in home -caged sibling Wistar rats (three male rats/cage) was determined by employing a social confrontation tube test (postnatal weeks 9 -12). Then, locomotor activity and anxiety -like behaviors were evaluated using an open-field test (OFT) and elevated plus -maze (EPM) at 13 weeks of age. The rapid Golgi impregnation method was conducted to quantify the spine density of the first secondary branch of the primary dendrite in 20 mu m length. The results indicated that dominant rats had significantly higher anxiety -like behaviors compared to subordinates, as was evident by lower open -arm entries and time spent in the EPM and lower entries and time spent in the center of OFT. The spine density analysis revealed a significantly higher number of spines in subordinates compared to the dominant rats in dmPFC pyramidal neurons and the apical and basal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, the spine density of pyramidal -like neurons in the BLA was higher in dominant rats. Our findings suggest that dominant social rank is associated with higher anxiety and differential density of the dendritic spine in the prefrontal cortex and limbic regions of the brain in male rats.

AB  - Uropeltidae is a clade of small fossorial snakes (ca. 64 extant species) endemic to peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Uropeltid taxonomy has been confusing, and the status of some species has not been revised for over a century. Attempts to revise uropeltid systematics and undertake evolutionary studies have been hampered by incom-pletely sampled and incompletely resolved phylogenies. To address this issue, we take advantage of historical museum collections, including type specimens, and apply genome-wide shotgun (GWS) sequencing, along with recent field sampling (using Sanger sequencing) to establish a near-complete multilocus species-level phylogeny (ca. 87% complete at species level). This results in a phylogeny that supports the monophyly of all genera (if Brachyophidium is considered a junior synonym of Teretrurus), and provides a firm platform for future taxonomic revision. Sri Lankan uropeltids are probably monophyletic, indicating a single colonisation event of this island from Indian ancestors. However, the position of Rhinophis goweri (endemic to Eastern Ghats, southern India) is unclear and warrants further investigation, and evidence that it may nest within the Sri Lankan radiation in-dicates a possible recolonisation event. DNA sequence data and morphology suggest that currently recognised uropeltid species diversity is substantially underestimated. Our study highlights the benefits of integrating museum collections in molecular genetic analyses and their role in understanding the systematics and evolu-tionary history of understudied organismal groups.

AB  - Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the features, clinical characteristics, and species diversity among patients admitted to referral Hospitals for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and mucormycosis in Tehran, Iran, and the relationship between seasonal and species diversity was considered. Methods: Confirmed COVID-19 patients with a positive reverse-transcriptase real-time (rRT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV2 were primarily included based on clinically suspected mucormycosis infection and confirmed by histopathology and mycology examination of biopsy specimens. The PCR technique was performed by the amplification of the high-affinity iron permease 1 (FTR1) gene for identification and discrimination between Rhizopus arrhizus and non- Rhizopus arrhizus isolates. In contrast, species identification of non-Rhizopus arrhizus was performed by sequencing of ITS rDNA region. Results: Rhino-sino-orbital mucormycosis was identified in the majority of cases (n = 33), with 66 % and 34 % of the cases involving male and female patients, respectively. Rhizopus arrhizus was found to be the most prevalent (84.6 %), followed by Mucor circinelloides (7.6 %). Rhizopus arrhizus was the most prevalent species and present in all the seasons; however, Mucor circinelloides was only present in the autumn. The overall mortality of the total population was 24.6 % (16/ 65); the mortality rates occurring in patients diagnosed with rhino-sino-orbital infection and rhino-sinusal form were 21.4 % and 25 %, respectively. Conclusion: CAM can be a serious complication of severe COVID-19, especially in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. It is important to monitor the epidemiology of mucormycosis to raise awareness of the disease and improve diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, particularly in the setting of pandemic. (c) 2024 SFMM.

AB  - Background: In livestock breeding, oocyte cryopreservation is crucial for preserving and transferring superior genetic traits. This study was conducted to examine the additional effect of melatonin to maturation and vitrification media on the in vitro developmental capacity, mitochondrial distribution, and intensity of buffalo oocytes. The study involved obtaining ovaries from a slaughterhouse and conducting two phases. In the first phase, high-quality oocytes were incubated in a maturation medium with or without 10-9M melatonin for 22 h (at 38.5 degrees C in 5% CO2). Matured oocytes were fertilized in vitro and cultured in SOF media for seven days. In the second phase, vitrified in vitro matured oocytes were stored in vitrified media (basic media (BM) containing a combination of cryoprotectants (20% Ethyl Glycol and 20% Dimethyl sulfoxide), with or without melatonin, and then stored in liquid nitrogen. Normal vitrified/thawed oocytes were fertilized in vitro and cultured as described. Finally, the matured oocytes from the fresh and vitrified/thawed groups, both with and without melatonin, were stained using DAPI and Mitotracker red to detect their viability (nuclear maturation), mitochondrial intensity, and distribution using a confocal microscope. The study found that adding 10-9M melatonin to the maturation media significantly increased maturation (85.47%), fertilization rate (84.21%)cleavage (89.58%), and transferable embryo (48.83%) rates compared to the group without melatonin (69.85%,79.88%, 75.55%, and 37.25% respectively). Besides that, the addition of melatonin to the vitrification media improved the recovery rate of normal oocytes (83.75%), as well as the cleavage (61.80%) and transferable embryo (27.00%) rates when compared to the vitrified TCM group (67.46%, 51.40%, and 17.00%, respectively). The diffuse mitochondrial distribution was higher in fresh with melatonin (TCM + Mel) (80%) and vitrified with melatonin (VS2 + Mel groups) (76.70%), Furthermore, within the same group, while the mitochondrial intensity was higher in the TCM + Mel group (1698.60) than other group. In conclusion, Melatonin supplementation improves the developmental competence and mitochondrial distribution in buffalo oocytes in both cases(in vitro maturation and vitrification).

AB  - Euphorbia dentata (Euphorbiaceae), an invasive weed, is rarely eaten by herbivorous insects and could secrete a large amount of white latex, causing a serious threat to local natural vegetation, agricultural production and human health. In order to prevent this plant from causing more negative effects on humans, it is necessary to understand and utilize the chemical relationships between the latex of E. dentata and herbivorous insects. In this study, three new norsesquiterpenes (1-3), together with seven known analogues (4-10), were isolated and identified from the latex of E. dentata. All norsesquiterpenes (1-10) showed antifeedant and growth-inhibitory effects on H. armigera with varying levels, especially compounds 1 and 2. In addition, the action mechanisms of active compounds (1-3) were revealed by detoxifying enzyme (AchE, CarE, GST and MFO) activities and corresponding molecular docking analyses. Our findings provide a new idea for the development and utilization of the latex of E. dentata, as well as a potential application of norsesquiterpenes in botanical insecticides.

AB  - In recent years, the function of plant polyphenols to improve the intestinal barrier has been fully demonstrated. However, the exact mechanisms linking plant polyphenols with the intestinal barrier function have not yet been established. Apple polyphenols (APs) are safe and healthy nutrients, which are extracted from apples and their byproducts. Using pig and IPEC-J2 cell models, this study investigated the effects of dietary AP supplementation on intestinal antioxidant capacity and barrier function. Then, we further explored the role of the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway in maintaining intestinal antioxidant capacity and barrier function. Our study found that dietary AP supplementation improved the intestinal mechanical barrier by promoting the intestinal morphology and intestinal tight junction protein expression, improved the intestinal immune barrier by increasing intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A production, and improved the intestinal biological barrier by increasing probiotics and decreasing the Escherichia coli population. Further research found that dietary AP supplementation increased the intestinal antioxidant capacity and activated the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. Finally, after treatment with Nrf2-specific inhibitor ML-385, the upregulation effect of APs on antioxidant capacity and tight junction protein expression was reduced in IPEC-J2 cells. Our results suggested that APs promoted intestinal antioxidant capacity and barrier function via the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway.

AB  - We present a detailed study of male associations in the Asian elephant, using 6 years of data on identified, non-musth males. Adult males spent greater proportions of their time solitarily than in mixed-sex or in all-male groups. Old (over 30 years) males were sighted more frequently with their age-peers and less frequently with young (15-30 years) males than expected at random in all-male groups. Young males were not sighted more frequently with old males than with young males, and did not disproportionately initiate associations with old males. These results suggest that male associations, in the absence of females, may allow for old non-musth males to test strengths against age-peers. Social learning from older individuals did not seem to be important in male associations, unlike that observed in the African savannah elephant. We also found a constraint on the sizes of all-male groups, similar to that seen in female groups in our study population, and all-male groups were rarer and smaller than those in African savannah elephant. Although male associations were weak, most males had a significant top associate, with whom their association was the strongest, in female absence. In mixed-sex groups, male associations occurred at random, suggesting that males were tracking female groups independently. Differences in male social organization from that of the related African savannah elephant that occupies a similar niche possibly arise from differences in ecology.

AB  - An integrated taphonomic analysis was applied to a tank deposit from the Zabele Palaeontological Site (ZPS) in northeast Brazil. The unique sedimentological evidence documents the origin of the mammal assemblage via debris flow. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates put the ZPS in the later Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, which was a time when it was colder and there were fewer trees. The study revealed that the Zabele's periphery accumulation was the result of the short transport of specimens and their entrainment by debris flow. This hydraulic transport caused the preferential orientation of the bioclasts (north-southwest). Comparisons were made with other Pleistocene tank deposits, suggesting the occurrence of common megamammal taxa. Temporal mixing was evidenced by the long time interval recorded by OSL ages and the co-occurrence of distinct degrees of fragmentation, weathering, and fossil diagenesis. Permineralization and staining of Fe3+ and Mn colour patterns were identified as fossilization processes with preservation of the original bone hydroxyapatite without substitution. The comparison with other tank deposits revealed common signatures (disarticulated and fragmented with moderate abrasion) and signs of reworking. Finally, the savanna-adapted herbivore megamammals from ZPS, such as Eremotherium, Notiomastodon, Toxodon, and Glyptotherium, are congruent with the forest decline from MIS 3 to the Last Glacial Maximum.

AB  - Fault inclination and complex geological soil features significantly impact the seismic response of underground unlined tunnels. Modeling fault rupture mechanisms necessitates spanning the computational domain over several kilometers, thus making the approach computationally inefficient. In this study, an efficient modeling algorithm, named as multi-layer Modified Domain Reduction Method (MDRM), has been proposed to analyze the Soil-Fault-Tunnel (SFT) system in layered soil media. The study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the MDRM for modeling the SFT system in layered soil media, considering the seismic source, wave propagation path, and local site effects for realistic seismic response assessment of the tunnels. The MDRM algorithm is implemented in an open-source finite element package, MASTODON (Multi-hazard Analysis for STOchastic time-DOmaiN phenomena), based on the MOOSE numerical framework. Using the MDRM approach, parametric simulations for four different fault rupture mechanisms and three distinct tunnel cross-sections (all having the same opening area) are being performed to capture the overall seismic response of the tunnels. The results provide insights into the influence of fault inclination angle, surface wave generation, and local site effects on the response. The transfer function profiles for the considered soil layers are contrasted, and their influence on different tunnel cross-sections is investigated. The findings are useful in the efficient and reliable design of underground tunnels in multi-layered media subjected to different fault rupture mechanisms.

AB  - Understanding the transfer of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in farm animals is essential for ensuring food safety, but such information for suckler ewes (Ovis aries) has been lacking. This work quantifies the accumulation, tissue distribution, and depuration kinetics of PCDD/Fs in these animals. Six suckler ewes (EXP group) were exposed to PCDD/Fs through contaminated hay (2.3-12.7 ng toxic-equivalent kg(-1) dry matter) and then allowed to depurate by switching to noncontaminated hay from 29 days of lactation. Four control ewes were fed continuously with noncontaminated hay. At different time points covering depuration, weaning and slaughter, PCDD/F analysis of milk (three time points), blood and sternal adipose tissue (five time points), Longissimus thoracis muscle, liver, and empty body homogenate at slaughter (188 days of depuration) was performed. A relevant PCDD/F bioaccumulation was observed from oral intake in milk and adipose tissue (biotransfer factors of 1.24 and 1.06 day kg(-1) lipids for the sum toxic-equivalent, respectively) in the EXP ewes, especially for penta- and hexa-chlorinated congeners. The EXP ewes' adipose tissue started at 10-fold the EU maximum level (ML) and showed depuration below the ML after 130 days. Specific PCDD/F accumulation in the ewe liver was observed, especially for dibenzofurans. These toxicokinetic data can inform recommendations to ensure the chemical safety of sheep food products.

AB  - Edible insects are rich in protein and can serve as a significant source of vitamins and minerals. The house cricket ( Acheta domesticus) ) stands out as one of the most nutritious edible insects. In various parts of the world, crickets are consumed roasted, baked, fried, boiled and in the form of cricket flour, a powder of dried and ground crickets. In Europe, processed animal proteins derived from eight insect species (including A. domesticus) ) have received authorization for use in fish, pig and poultry feed. Therefore, the development of a method for detecting house crickets is essential to verify product compliance and provide accurate labelling information to the end user. In this study, we have established a real-time PCR assay for the specific detection of house crickets. This method is based on the amplification of a mitochondrial fragment that codes for cytochrome b. We assessed its specificity by testing it against 39 other insect species, 7 plant species and 31 other animal species. Furthermore, we successfully evaluated the amplification efficiency, sensitivity, robustness, applicability on commercial samples and transferability to a second laboratory.

AB  - YAP and TAZ are essential transcriptional co-activators and downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, regulating cell proliferation, organ growth, and tissue homeostasis. To ask how the Hippo pathway affects mineralized tissue homeostasis in a tissue that is highly reliant on a tight homeostatic control of mineralized deposition and resorption, we determined the effects of YAP/TAZ dysregulation on the periodontal tissues alveolar bone, root cementum, and periodontal ligament. Loss of YAP/TAZ was associated with a reduction of mineralized tissue density in cellular cementum and alveolar bone, a downregulation in collagen I, alkaline phosphatase, and RUNX2 gene expression, an increase in the resorption markers TRAP and cathepsin K, and elevated numbers of TRAP-stained osteoclasts. Cyclic strain applied to periodontal ligament cells resulted in YAP nuclear localization, an effect that was abolished after blocking YAP. The rescue of YAP signaling with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin resulted in a return of the nuclear YAP signal. Illustrating the key role of YAP on mineralization gene expression, the YAP inhibition-related downregulation of mineralization-associated genes was reversed by the extracellular matrix YAP activator agrin. Application of the unopposed mouse molar model to transform the periodontal ligament into an unloaded state and facilitate the distal drift of teeth resulted in an overall increase in mineralization-associated gene expression, an effect that was 10-20% diminished in Wnt1Cre/YAP/TAZ mutant mice. The unloaded state of the unopposed molar model in WntlCre/YAP/TAZ mutant mice also caused a significant three-fold increase in osteoclast numbers, a substantial increase in bone/cementum resorption, pronounced periodontal ligament hyalinization, and thickened periodontal fiber bundles. Together, these data demonstrated that YAP/TAZ signaling is essential for the microarchitectural integrity of the periodontium by regulating mineralization gene expression and preventing excessive resorption during bodily movement of the dentoalveolar complex.

AB  - Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) is one of the most widely produced herbivorous species worldwide. However, forage feeding is not well studied in this species. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding a diet based on Lolium multiflorum (ryegrass) on the growth performance and fatty acid composition in the meat of juvenile C. idella. For this purpose, juveniles were fed two different diets for 120 days: i) grains and their by-products (GD) and ii) Lolium multiflorum (PD). At 60 and 120 days of feeding, the weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion rate, protein efficiency, viscerosomatic index and condition factor were determined. The fatty acid profile and lipid nutritional indices of the meat were measured at 120 days. The GD group exhibited higher weight gain, specific growth rate and condition factor than the PD group. The GD group also had a higher conversion rate at the expense of greater fat content and elevated viscerosomatic index. The greater viscera development may explain the higher weight gain in the GD group. Healthy fatty acids, such as Alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids, were more elevated in the PD group while linoleic fatty acid (LA) was lower. Hence, LA induced a decrease in the n-6/n-3 ratio. In addition, hypercholesterolemic and atherogenetic saturated fatty acids were lower in the PD. This variation reduced the atherogenic, thrombogenicity and peroxidability indices. Therefore, better nutritional quality in the meat compensated for the lower growth of the fish on the PD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common and severe dementias, severely affecting the physical and mental health and quality of life of patients and imposing a heavy burden on society. Recently, transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has shown great potential for improving cognitive function in AD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) are the two main forms of tES. The present review mainly summarizes the neuromolecular mechanisms of tDCS and tACS for the improvement of AD. Both techniques show similarities in exerting neuroprotective effects, improving cerebral blood flow to alleviate cerebrovascular dysfunction, affecting the state and function of astrocytes, affecting the levels of amyloid (3-protein (A(3) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins, and affecting neuroplasticity. Specifically, tDCS improves neuronal status, inhibits neuronal apoptosis, improves cholinergic neurons and reduces oxidative stress, etc ., and further exerts neuroprotective effects, but tACS mainly maintains the normal function of cholinergic neurons to exert the effects. For the alleviation of cerebrovascular dysfunction, tDCS has particular advantages in optimizing the neural vascular unit and improving the blood-brain barrier. For astrocytes, tDCS attenuates inflammatory responses by inhibiting their activation. In contrast, the effect of tACS on the activation state of microglial cells is still controversial for enhancement in AD mice and inhibition in patients. For A (3 levels, the effects of tDCS in AD patients are also inconclusive, but in AD rodents, tDCS may regulate molecular pathways related to A (3 production and degradation, thereby removing A (3. In addition, tACS reduces p-tau levels in AD patients, but tDCS shows a trend toward reduction. In short, the effect of tES on A (3 and p-tau needs further investigation. Regarding neuroplasticity, tDCS improves cortical and synaptic plasticity, but tACS improves only synaptic plasticity. However, both techniques do not affect the molecular level associated with plasticity. On the other hand, this review has summarized some interesting findings of tES in non-AD rodents that may be relevant to the pathological mechanisms of AD. For neuroprotection, tDCS can promote neurogenesis, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, modulate neuroprotection-related signaling pathways, reduce oxidative stress, and protect hippocampal neurons. In addition, tDCS inhibits conversion of microglia to the M1 phenotype and promotes conversion to the M2 phenotype, thereby reducing neuroinflammation. Importantly, tDCS induces changes in molecular indices associated with synaptic plasticity. These findings in non-AD rodents provide a reference for understanding the potential effect and possible mechanism of tES in AD and for exploring new approaches to treat other diseases with similar pathological features. In addition, tES has shown some effects in AD rodents, such as tACS improving plasticity, that have not been studied in non-AD rodents. These effects suggest the particular complexity of the pathological mechanisms of AD, which should be considered when applying the results of tES studies in non-AD rodents to AD rodents. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the neuromolecular mechanisms of tES in AD research and highlights its promise as a non-invasive brain stimulation technique in the treatment of AD.
   Furthermore, tES will play an indispensable role in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and in the study of brain function.

AB  - Volatile solvents exposure can result in various behavioral impairments that have been partly associated to altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Despite recent evidence supporting this association, few studies have been devoted to examine the impact on olfactory functioning and olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis, although olfactory system is directly in contact with volatile molecules. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate in adult mice the potential modifications of the olfactory functioning after acute (1 day), subchronic (6 weeks) and chronic (12 weeks) exposure to thinner vapor at both behavioral and cellular levels. Firstly, behavioral evaluations showed that chronic thinner exposure impacts on odor detection ability of treated mice but does not affect mice ability to efficiently discriminate between two different odors. Moreover, chronic thinner exposure produces impairment in the olfactory-mediated associative memory. Secondly, analysis of the effects of thinner exposure in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and in the OB revealed that thinner treatments do not induce apoptosis nor glial activation. Thirdly, immunohistochemical quantification of different markers of adult olfactory neurogenesis showed that inhalant treatments do not change the number of proliferating progenitors in the SVZ and the rostral migratory stream (RMS), as well as the number of newborn cells reaching and integrating in the OB circuitry. Altogether, our data highlight that the impaired olfactory performances in chronically-exposed mice are not associated to an alteration of adult neurogenesis in the SVZ-OB system.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Australian sheep undergo several surgical procedures as per industry standard lamb marking, including surgical castration. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used successfully to assess pain in sheep previously. In this study, the EEG was measured over time to assess castration pain and analgesic efficacy in conscious lambs in combination with behaviour observations and eye temperature. A combination of lignocaine and meloxicam was used as the gold-standard approach to pain relief (CML), compared to castrated but untreated (C) and sham castrated (SC) lambs. Changes in EEG and behaviour were observed in all treatment groups. Lambs in CML and C groups showed more abnormal behaviours and immediate increases in eye temperature, indicative of pain. However, little differences between these groups suggest that analgesia was not successful in removing perceived pain of the procedure in this study. Changes in EEG for SC groups suggests the effect of handling and restraint, in addition to the pain of castration, impacted all results, not singularly the pain of castration.
   Castration has been demonstrated to cause pain in sheep. However, it is routinely performed for management purposes. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used successfully to measure pain in lambs in response to castration and other husbandry procedures in livestock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of EEG as a measure of pain and analgesia in conscious lambs undergoing castration on farm over a 24 h period. EEG responses were compared to behavioural observations and changes in ocular temperature via infrared thermography. Twenty-four merino ram lambs (18.63 +/- 2.06 kg) were used in this study. Lambs were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment groups: (1) castration with pre-surgical administration of meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg Metacam 20 mg/mL injected subcutaneously into the skin of the neck 15 min prior to recording) and lignocaine (applied via intra-testicular injection five minutes prior to castration, 2 mL lignocaine hydrochloride 20 mg/mL, Troy/Ilium) (CML, n = 8); (2) castration only (C, n = 8); (3) sham castration, handling only (SC, n = 8). EEG was recorded for 5 mins pre-procedure (prior to any intervention), and for 5 mins post-procedure at 0, 1, 4 and 24 h. Behavioural reactions to the procedure were scored, and behaviours were scan sampled at 5 min intervals at the above time points, by blinded observers. Eye temperature was measured for five-minute intervals at each time point. EEG decreased from baseline to 0 h for CML and C groups (p < 0.001), C group values returned similar to baseline at 24 h. Eye temperature increased post-castration at 0 h for C group, no initial change was seen for CML or SC groups. CML and C groups were more likely to have higher reaction scores and showed more abnormal behaviours (p = 0.017). CML and C groups had similar results, indicating minimal effect of analgesic intervention. Lambs in SC group showed significant EEG changes, suggesting that stress from handling also impacted EEG results.

AB  - Preterm infants are susceptible to neonatal sepsis, a syndrome of pro-inflammatory activity, organ damage, and altered metabolism following infection. Given the unique metabolic challenges and poor glucose regulatory capacity of preterm infants, their glucose intake during infection may have a high impact on the degree of metabolism dysregulation and organ damage. Using a preterm pig model of neonatal sepsis, we previously showed that a drastic restriction in glucose supply during infection protects against sepsis via suppression of glycolysis-induced inflammation, but results in severe hypoglycemia. Now we explored clinically relevant options for reducing glucose intake to decrease sepsis risk, without causing hypoglycemia and further explore the involvement of the liver in these protective effects. We found that a reduced glucose regime during infection increased survival via reduced pro-inflammatory response, while maintaining normoglycemia. Mechanistically, this intervention enhanced hepatic oxidative phosphorylation and possibly gluconeogenesis, and dampened both circulating and hepatic inflammation. However, switching from a high to a reduced glucose supply after the debut of clinical symptoms did not prevent sepsis, suggesting metabolic conditions at the start of infection are key in driving the outcome. Finally, an early therapy with purified human inter-alpha inhibitor protein, a liver-derived anti-inflammatory protein, partially reversed the effects of low parenteral glucose provision, likely by inhibiting neutrophil functions that mediate pathogen clearance. Our findings suggest a clinically relevant regime of reduced glucose supply for infected preterm infants could prevent or delay the development of sepsis in vulnerable neonates.

AB  - The spring and summer of 2019-2020 (Black Summer) saw the largest and most significant bushfire outbreak recorded in eastern Australia. In Victoria, the fires ran from mid-November through early autumn. In this paper, we use a high-spatial and temporal resolution 48-year fire weather re-analysis data set (VicClim5) to describe fire weather and vertical wind and stability profiles for five significant high Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) fire events and compare these with detailed fire reconstructions. A feature of several of these fires was very active overnight fire spread driven by topographically enhanced low-level jets and low fine fuel moisture content. The FFDI values on these nights were either the highest or near highest on record in the 48-year data set. We describe cases of lightning ignition, prefrontal fire spread and two cases of post-frontal fire spread - one into Mallacoota on the early morning of 31 December 2019 and the other a northward overnight run down the Buffalo Valley on 4-5 January 2020. On two of the days studied there were complex wind changes associated with the inland penetration of low-level south-easterly winds under the influence of locally generated pressure gradients. An elevated hot, dry mixed layer above these shallow layers also played an important role. On one occasion there is some evidence of possible mountain-wave modulation of surface wind flows. These events demonstrate a range of features of the fire weather and climate in eastern Victoria and the utility of VicClim5 in 3-dimensional climatological analyses.

AB  - The complications of obesity extend beyond the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS) and include an increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric co-morbidities like depressive illness. Preclinical studies support this concept, including studies that have examined the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on depressive-like behaviors. Although women are approximately two-fold more likely to develop depressive illness compared to men, most preclinical studies have focused on the effects of HFD in male rodents. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to examine depressive-like behaviors in male and female rats provided access to a HFD. In agreement with prior studies, male and female rats provided a HFD segregate into an obesity phenotype (i.e., diet-induced obesity; DIO) or a diet resistant (DR) phenotype. Upon confirmation of the DR and DIO phenotypes, behavioral assays were performed in control chow, DR, and DIO rats. In the sucrose preference test, male DIO rats exhibited significant decreases in sucrose consumption (i.e., anhedonia) compared to male DR and male control rats. In the forced swim test (FST), male DIO rats exhibited increases in immobility and decreases in climbing behaviors in the pre-test sessions. Interestingly, male DR rats exhibited these same changes in both the pre-test and test sessions of the FST, suggesting that consumption of a HFD, even in the absence of the development of an obesity phenotype, has behavioral consequences. Female rats did not exhibit differences in sucrose preference, but female DIO rats exhibited increases in immobility exclusively in the test session of the FST, behavioral changes that were not affected by the stage of the estrous cycle. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that access to a HFD elicits different behavioral outcomes in male and female rats.

AB  - To solve the problem of nitrogen loss and harmful gas emissions in the co-composting of cyanobacteria with other wastes and agricultural non-point source pollution in the Chaohu Lake Basin (CHLB), this study selected cyanobacteria as the main material, spent mushroom and rice hulls as excipients, and biochar (B) and Mg2+/PO43- salt as an additive. The nitrogen fixation rate, maturity, toxicity, and fertilizer efficiency indexes were analyzed to explore the best rate of biochar application. Additionally, three different fertilization treatments (CO: No fertilization, CF: Chemical fertilizer, OF: Organic fertilizer) were applied to agricultural field experiments in the CHLB. The results showed that the cyanobacteria composting experiment with 10% B as additives had the lowest cumulative NH3 emission (603.00 g) and the highest nitrogen fixation rate (61.54%). We used this compost product for maize cultivation in field experiments. The results show that OF treatment can reduce field nutrient loss, and the increase in the rate of soil TN fixation was as follows: OF (18.62%) > CF (10.34%) > C0 (-9.66%). Moreover, the TN and TK losses in runoff were 33.33% and 22.74% lower than CF in farmland runoff. The OF treatment increased the content of crude fat, crude protein, and crude starch by 4.40%, 8.34%, and 2.66% compared with the CF treatment, respectively. Overall, the N, P, and K source agronomic coefficients of cyanobacteria organic fertilizer were 1.424, 1.001, and 1.16, respectively. These results indicated that cyanobacterial organic fertilizer could replace chemical fertilizer to reduce agricultural non-point source pollution and improve maize quality. Meanwhile, the amendment of B and Mg/P salt additives could reduce air pollution and improve the quality of compost products. This study provides a theoretical basis and reference for nitrogen fixation and extension of multiple wastes co-composting field experiments.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) poses serious threats to the pig industry. The multigene family (MGF) proteins are extensively distributed in ASFVs and are generally classified into five families, including MGF-100, MGF-110, MGF-300, MGF-360 and MGF-505. Most MGF proteins, however, have not been well characterized and classified within each family. To bridge this gap, this study first classified MGF proteins into 31 groups based on protein sequence homology and network clustering. A web server for classifying MGF proteins was established and kept available for free at http://www.computationalbiology.cn/MGF/home.html. Results showed that MGF groups of the same family were most similar to each other and had conserved sequence motifs; the genetic diversity of MGF groups varied widely, mainly due to the occurrence of indels. In addition, the MGF proteins were predicted to have large structural and functional diversity, and MGF proteins of the same MGF family tended to have similar structure, location and function. Reconstruction of the ancestral states of MGF groups along the ASFV phylogeny showed that most MGF groups experienced either the copy number variations or the gain-or-loss changes, and most of these changes happened within strains of the same genotype. It is found that the copy number decrease and the loss of MGF groups were much larger than the copy number increase and the gain of MGF groups, respectively, suggesting the ASFV tended to lose MGF proteins in the evolution. Overall, the work provides a detailed classification for MGF proteins and would facilitate further research on MGF proteins.

AB  - Hair placode formation is an important stage of hair follicle morphogenesis and it is a complex process facilitated by non-coding RNAs. In this study, we conducted whole transcriptome sequencing analysis of skin, heart, liver, lung, and kidney tissues of day 41 (E41) normal and hairless pig embryos, and respectively detected 15, 8, and 515 skin-specific differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. Furthermore, 18 competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed. Following weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of stages E39, E41, E45, E52, and E60, between normal and hairless pig embryos, only two ceRNAs (lncRNA2162.1/miR-29a-5p/BMPR1b and lncRNA627.1/miR-29a-5p/EDAR) that showed period-specific differential expression in E41 skin were retained. Dual-luciferase reporter assays further indicated that EDAR was a direct, functioning target of miR-29a-5p and that no binding site was found in BMPR1b. Moreover, miR-29a-5p overexpression inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of EDAR while no significant differential expression of BMPR1b was detected. In addition, over-expressed lncRNA627.1 reduces the expression of miR-29a-5p and increase EDAR expression while inhibits lncRNA627.1 resulted in a opposite expression trend. Cell proliferation result demonstrated that lower expression of EDAR and lncRNA627.1 inhibited hair placode precursor cells (HPPCs) proliferation in a manner similar to that shown by over-expressed miR-29a-5p. This study identified that miR-29a-5p inhibited HPPCs proliferation via the suppression of EDAR expression in the EDA/EDAR signaling pathway, while lncRNA627.1 rescues EDAR expression. Our study provides a basis for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the ceRNA complex, miR29a-5p/EDAR/lncRNA627.1, that could regulate hair placode formation, which may help decipher diseases affecting human hair.

AB  - In the context of a contingency, the reuse of water in the tanning of hides is a viable alternative to reduce the generation of hazardous waste generated by this activity. With the aim of promoting the adoption of cleaner technologies and more sustainable practices, this study proposed applying an innovative tanning process to obtain sheep crust leather, consisting of the recovery of waste water from chrome plating to reincorporate it into the production cycle. To this end, before each tanning cycle, the chromium content in the water was quantified (T1: first bath, T2: second bath and T3: third bath), which allowed determining the wear of the chrome and evaluating the viability of its reuse. Finally, a physical-mechanical evaluation of the crust leather obtained after chroming was strength (T1: 51.6 N/mm, T2: 61.3 N/mm, T3: 57.3 N/mm, P > 0.05), and grain breaking strength wastewater could be reused up to three times without significantly compromising the leather properties, with the second cycle showing the best performance. Future research could explore the reuse of wastewater from other phases of the tanning process, as well as its impact on the leather finish.

AB  - Environmental exposure to pesticides at levels deemed safe by regulatory agencies has been linked to increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, the mechanisms linking exposure to these disorders remain unclear. Here, we show that maternal exposure to the pesticide deltamethrin (DM) at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) disrupts long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of adult male offspring three months after exposure, a phenotype absent in female offspring. Clonazepam, a GABAa receptor agonist, rescued this deficit, indicating impaired hippocampal GABAergic signaling. Recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons, complemented by MALDI mass spectrometry imaging, showed an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory tone. Using a combination of parvalbumin (PV)-Cre transgenic mice and hippocampal injection of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), we show that developmental DM exposure reduces hippocampal PV interneuron intrinsic firing. DREADD activation rescued both PV interneuron firing and LTP deficits. Complementary behavioral experiments revealed a deficit in social memory, a behavior relevant to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptomatology, which was restored by DREADD activation. Overall, these results establish a novel mechanistic link between maternal exposure to DM at the NOAEL and known cellular, circuital, and behavioral vulnerabilities, indicating it is a potential driver in the exposome of ASD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which disproportionately affects women. AD symptoms include progressive memory loss associated with amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and dismantled synaptic mechanisms. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are important components of the extracellular matrix with a critical role in synaptic stabilisation and have been shown to be influenced by microglia, which enter an activated state during AD. This study aimed to investigate whether sex differences affected the density of PNNs alongside the labelling of microglia and A beta plaques density.We performed neurochemistry experiments using acute brain slices from both sexes of the APP(NL-F/NL-F) mouse model of AD, aged-matched (2-5 and 12-16 months) to wild-type mice, combined with a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampal CA1, which are vulnerable during early AD pathology, were investigated and compared to the presubiculum (PRS), a region unscathed by AD pathology. The highest density of PNNs was found in the LEC and PRS regions of aged APP(NL-F/NL-F) mice with a region-specific sex differences. Analysis of the CA1 region using multiplex-fluorescent images from aged APP(NL-F/NL-F )mice showed regions of dense A beta plaques near clusters of CD68, indicative of activated microglia and PNNs. This was consistent with the results of WGCNA performed on normalised data on microglial cells isolated from age-matched, late-stage male and female wild-type and APP knock-in mice, which revealed one microglial module that showed differential expression associated with tissue, age, genotype, and sex, which showed enrichment for fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that sex-related differences contribute to a disrupted interaction between PNNs and microglia in specific brain regions associated with AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Key message This is first report on haploids in out-breeding tree, Cambod tea. It's a significant achievement towards generating homozygous lines, which is impossible using conventional methods. Haploids showed consistent metabolite production.
   This pioneering work reports successful androgenic plant development via embryogenesis from microspore calluses in anther cultures and estimation of bioactive metabolites in in vitro regenerants and parent plant (control) of Cambod tea, Camellia assamica ssp. lasiocalyx (Planch MS) cultivar TV19. Anthers bearing microspores at early-to-late uni-nucleate stage were selected to initiate androgenesis. A pre-treatment of 5 degrees C for 5 days in the dark was most effective to initiate profusely growing white callusing from microspores within 10 weeks of culture on MS medium (6% sucrose) supplemented with high cytokinin/auxin ratio maintained by 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 2,4-dichlorophenxoyacetic acid. Nodular structures on the callus surface differentiated into embryos. Further developement of the embryos occurred on embryogenesis medium but, with ten times reduced concentration of growth regulators and additives. Germination of embryos into complete plantlets was achieved when major salts in medium were reduced to half MS (1/2 MS) and augmented with BAP, GA(3) and IBA along with glutamine and serine. Cytological examination of the root-tip cells revealed that regenerated plantlets were haploids (2n = x = 15), which was further confirmed through flow cytometry. The hot-water extracts from in vitro haploid calluses, embryos and field-grown donor plant were utilized for quantification of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, caffeine and theophylline. Our findings revealed that the metabolite profile of in vitro regenerated haploid cultures is comparable to that of the mother plant, thereby presenting them as potential source for genome duplication and development of genetically stable homozygous pure breeding lines.

AB  - Heterologous organ transplantation is an effective way of replacing organ function but is limited by severe organ shortage. Although generating human organs in other large mammals through embryo complementa-tion would be a groundbreaking solution, it faces many challenges, especially the poor integration of human cells into the recipient tissues. To produce human cells with superior intra-niche competitiveness, we combined optimized pluripotent stem cell culture conditions with the inducible overexpression of two pro-survival genes (MYCN and BCL2). The resulting cells had substantially enhanced viability in the xeno-environment of interspecies chimeric blastocyst and successfully formed organized human-pig chimeric middle-stage kidney (mesonephros) structures up to embryonic day 28 inside nephric-defective pig embryos lacking SIX1 and SALL1. Our findings demonstrate proof of principle of the possibility of generating a human-ized primordial organ in organogenesis-disabled pigs, opening an exciting avenue for regenerative medicine and an artificial window for studying human kidney development.

AB  - Indirect impacts of Human Wildlife Conflict (HWC) are largely ignored, poorly understood, and scantly reported in the literature on HWC. Subsistence farmers in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan experience an increasing intensification of HWC impacts. Working across four districts representing different geographic regions of the country, we explored the perceived indirect impacts of HWC and how they affect the well-being and happiness of subsistence farmers using qualitative interviews (n = 48) and focus group discussions (n = 8). We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis. Based on respondent's explanations, we coded the data according to effect of indirect impacts on human, social, financial, physical, natural, and psychological capitals. Mental distress, constant worries about food insecurity, fears for physical safety, frustration of movement restriction due to fear of being attack by wildlife, feelings of economic insecurity and anger over loss of crop and livestock due to wild predators affect the psychological health and well-being of research participants. Vulnerabilities related to gender and wealth status further deepen the effect of indirect impacts. Policies designed to address HWC should incorporate an understanding of the effects of indirect impacts of HWC and should focus on female-headed and poor households to reduce the negative effects of wildlife impacts.

AB  - Storage temperature is a key factor in determining gas emissions from slurry storage. The reactive nitrogen related gas (NH3, N2O, and NO) emission characteristics and resulting mechanisms from digested pig slurry stored under different temperatures of 5 (A5), 15 (B15), 25 (C25), and 35 degrees C (D35) were investigated in this study. Results showed that the temperature increase from 15 to 25 degrees C was crucial for the changes in the total chemical characteristics of slurry, the increase of gas emissions, and the nitrifiers and denitrifiers accumulation in the slurry. Chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen (TN), and total ammonia nitrogen content of the slurry decreased while pH increased significantly during storage under C25 and D35, while no obvious changes can be found under A5 and B15. NH3, N2O, and NO emissions increased by 284%, 451%, and 454%, respectively, when the storage temperature increased from 15 to 25 degrees C. The highest emissions of NH3, N2O, and NO were observed in D35, with the emission factor being 42.3% +/- 9.0%, 2.26% +/- 0.96%, and 0.11% +/- 0.03% of initial TN, respectively; while the lowest emission factor was 4.2% +/- 0.2%, 0.04% +/- 0.01%, and 0.0003% +/- 0.0001% for NH3, N2O, and NO in A5, respectively. The high temperature caused the increased abundance of Nitrosomonas, leading to the high N2O emission in D35. Vulcanibacillus and Thauera were the dominant denitrifiers in the microbial communities, and their increased abundance was another possible explanation for increased N2O emission on C25 and D35. Therefore, regulating slurry temperature to lower than 15 degrees C can effectively limit the NH3 and N2O emissions, and thus contributed to the air pollution reduction and global warming control. Meanwhile, compared with the cool temperature conditions, extra mitigation options were suggested to be applied to control the gases emissions when slurry was stored under hot conditions such as in summer.

AB  - Tsetse fly vectors of African trypanosomosis preferentially feed on certain vertebrates largely determined by olfactory cues they emit. Previously, we established that three skin-derived ketones including 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, acetophenone and geranyl acetone accounted for avoidance of zebra by tsetse flies. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these three ketones serve as biomarkers for tsetse flies to distinguish between non-preferred- and preferred-vertebrate hosts. We used coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to analyze and compare the skin volatile emissions of two non-preferred- (waterbuck and zebra) and four preferred- (buffalo, donkey, horse, warthog) vertebrate hosts in two wildlife parks in Kenya. We detected a total of 96 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the skin emissions composed mainly of aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, phenols and alkanes, which varied with the vertebrate host. Using random forest analysis, we found a weak correlation between the three skin-odor repellent ketones and non-preferred and preferred vertebrate hosts. However, we found that the three repellent ketones plus skin background odors may be more sensitive chemical signals for tsetse flies to discriminate vertebrate hosts. These results contribute to understanding tsetse fly vertebrate host preferences in their natural habitat across geographic scales.

AB  - Social behavior deficits are a common, debilitating consequence of traumatic brain injury and stroke, particularly when sustained during childhood. Numerous factors influence the manifestation of social problems after acquired brain injuries, raising the question of whether environmental manipulations can minimize or prevent such deficits. Here, we examine both clinical and preclinical evidence addressing this question, with a particular focus on environmental enrichment paradigms and differing housing conditions. We aimed to understand whether environmental manipulations can ameliorate injury-induced social behavior deficits. In summary, promising data from experimental models supports a beneficial role of environmental enrichment on social behavior. However, limited studies have considered social outcomes in the chronic setting, and few studies have addressed the social context specifically as an important component of the post-injury environment. Clinically, limited high-caliber evidence supports the use of specific interventions for social deficits after acquired brain injuries. An improved understanding of how the post-injury environment interacts with the injured brain, particularly during development, is needed to validate the implementation of rehabilitative interventions that involve manipulating an individuals' environment.

AB  - In breast cancer, Targeted Axillary Dissection (TAD) allows for the selective excision of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) during primary tumor surgery. TAD consists of the resection of labelled SLNs prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have explored the use of carbon-based colloids for SLN tattooing prior to NACT. However, carbon vectors show varying degrees of inflammatory reactions and, in about one fifth of cases, carbon particles migrate via the lymphatic pathway to other nodes, causing the SLN to mismatch the tattooed node. To overcome these limitations, in this study, we explored the use of melanin as a staining endogenous pigment. We synthesized and characterized melanin-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (Mel-NPs) and used them to tattoo lymph nodes in pig animal models given the similarity in the size of the human and pig nodes. Mel-NPs tattooed lymph nodes showed high identification rates, reaching 83.3% positive identification 16 weeks after tattooing. We did not observe any reduction in the identification as time increased, implying that the colloid is stable in the lymph node tissue. In addition, we performed histological and ultrastructural studies to characterize the biological behavior of the tag. We observed foreign-body-like granulomatous inflammatory responses associated with Mel-NPs, characterized by the formation of multinucleated giant cells. In addition, electron microscopy studies showed that uptake is mainly performed by macrophages, and that macrophages undergo cellular damage associated with particle uptake.

   Pork is the most consumed meat source for humans, and the utilization of nutritional approaches to produce pork with an appropriate content of intramuscular fat (IMF) and a balanced ratio of different kinds of fatty acid is an important objective pursuit of swine production. We speculated that dietary supplementation of beta-hydroxy beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) may provide benefits in lipid metabolism of skeletal muscle. In this study, we try to investigate the effects of dietary HMB supplementation on muscular lipid metabolism in Bama Xiang mini-pigs. We found that HMB supplementation could decrease the IMF content and increase n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as regulate the related metabolites (N-Methyl-l-glutamate and nummularine A) in the serum of Bama Xiang mini-pigs, thus improving their meat quality.
   This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary beta-hydroxy beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) supplementation on muscular lipid metabolism in Bama Xiang mini-pigs. Thirty-two piglets (8.58 +/- 0.40 kg, barrow) were selected and fed a basal diet supplemented either with 0 (control), 0.13%, 0.64%, or 1.28% HMB for 60 days. Throughout the experiments, they had free access to clean drinking water and diets. Data of this study were analyzed by one-way ANOVA using the SAS 8.2 software package, followed by a Tukey's studentized range test to explore treatment effects. The results showed that compared to the control, 0.13% HMB decreased the intramuscular fat (IMF) content and increased polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in Longissimus thoracis muscle (LTM), and increased the n3 PUFAs in soleus muscles (SM, p < 0.05). Moreover, HMB supplementation led to alterations in the mRNA expression of genes related to lipid metabolism. Serum metabolome profiling showed that in both LTM and SM of Bama Xiang mini-pigs, N-Methyl-l-glutamate was positively correlated with SFA and nummularine A was negatively correlated with C18:3n3 PUFA (p < 0.05). Therefore, N-Methyl-l-glutamate and nummularine A might be potential biomarkers of the HMB-supplemented group. These results suggested that dietary HMB supplementation could decrease the IMF content and increase n3 PUFAs as well as regulate the related metabolites (N-Methyl-l-glutamate and nummularine A) in the serum of pigs.

AB  - Plants have evolved plastic defence strategies to deal with the uncertainty of when, by which species and in which order attack by herbivores will take place(1-3). However, the responses to current herbivore attack may come with a cost of compromising resistance to other, later arriving herbivores. Due to antagonistic cross-talk between physiological regulation of plant resistance to phloem-feeding and leaf-chewing herbivores(4-8), the feeding guild of the initial herbivore is considered to be the primary factor determining whether resistance to subsequent attack is compromised. We show that, by investigating 90 pairwise insect-herbivore interactions among ten different herbivore species, resistance of the annual plant Brassica nigra to a later arriving herbivore species is not explained by feeding guild of the initial attacker. Instead, the prevalence of herbivore species that arrive on induced plants as approximated by three years of season-long insect community assessments in the field explained cross-resistance. Plants maintained resistance to prevalent herbivores in common patterns of herbivore arrival and compromises in resistance especially occurred for rare patterns of herbivore attack. We conclude that plants tailor induced defence strategies to deal with common patterns of sequential herbivore attack and anticipate arrival of the most prevalent herbivores.
   Plants have developed defences against herbivores, but with multiple threats at different times, those defences may be compromised. This experiment finds that plants adapt over time to anticipate prevalent herbivores and common patterns of attack.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a major neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1 in 36 children in the United States. While neurons have been the focus of understanding ASD, an altered neuro-immune response in the brain may be closely associated with ASD, and a neuro-immune interaction could play a role in the disease progression. As the resident immune cells of the brain, microglia regulate brain development and homeostasis via core functions including phagocytosis of synapses. While ASD has been traditionally considered a polygenic disorder, recent large-scale human genetic studies have identified SCN2A deficiency as a leading monogenic cause of ASD and intellectual disability. We generated a Scn2a-deficient mouse model, which displays major behavioral and neuronal phenotypes. However, the role of microglia in this disease model is unknown. Here, we reported that Scn2a-deficient mice have impaired learning and memory, accompanied by reduced synaptic transmission and lower spine density in neurons of the hippocampus. Microglia in Scn2a-deficient mice are partially activated, exerting excessive phagocytic pruning of post-synapses related to the complement C3 cascades during selective developmental stages. The ablation of microglia using PLX3397 partially restores synaptic transmission and spine density. To extend our findings from rodents to human cells, we established a microglia-incorporated human cerebral organoid model carrying an SCN2A protein-truncating mutation identified in children with ASD. We found that human microglia display increased elimination of post-synapse in cerebral organoids carrying the SCN2A mutation. Our study establishes a key role of microglia in multi-species autism-associated models of SCN2A deficiency from mouse to human cells.

AB  - MEAM1 (Middle East-Asia Minor 1) and MED (Mediterranean), two cryptic species of the Bemisia tabaci species complex, are highly destructive herbivores worldwide. Attack by herbivorous insects often induces plant defense responses that deter herbivores, recruit natural enemies, or warn other plants of possible herbivore attack. However, recent studies found that herbivores can manipulate and suppress plant defenses for their own benefit. These responses, which differ depending on the herbivore and the plant species, may mediate the preference and performance of later-arriving con- and heterospecific herbivores that attack the same plant. Here, we found that MEAM1 whiteflies preferred to settle and oviposit on MED-infested pepper and avoided conspecific-infested pepper plants. In contrast, MED whiteflies preferred to settle and oviposit on non-infested rather than on MEAM1-infested pepper. MEAM1 infestation significantly increased the contents of JA in pepper plants, which coincided with the increased expression of the following genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway: FAD, LOX6, OPR3, and PDF1.2. MED infestation significantly increased the contents of ABA in pepper plants and reduced the expression of PR1 and NPR1 in the SA biosynthesis pathway. Although MEAM1 infestation increased the transcript levels of C4H, 4CL1, CHS, and CHI3 in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, total phenol levels did not increase. The reduction of the total phenols in pepper previously infested by MED, probably contributed to the settling and oviposition preference of the later-arriving heterospecific MEAM1. Overall, these results demonstrate that previous infestation by MEAM1 and MED whiteflies induces different responses in pepper plants that shape the host preference and performance of the later-arriving con- and heterospecific whiteflies.

AB  - Studies of animal physiology not only provide valuable knowledge for the species in question, but also offer insights into human physiology. This thought is best highlighted by the 'Krogh Principle', which states "for many problems there is an animal on which it can be most conveniently studied". This graphical review focuses on three distinct stages of the oxygen transport cascade in which human exercise physiology knowledge has been enhanced by studies carried out in animal models. We begin by exploring ventilation, and the detrimental effects of cold, dry air on the airways in two sets of elite athletes, the cross-country skier and the racing sled dog. We then discuss the transport of oxygen via hemoglobin in humans and deer mice with relatively shifted oxygen dissociation curves. Finally, we consider the technical difficulties of measuring respiratory muscle blood flow in exercising humans and how an equine model can provide an understanding of the distribution of blood flow during exercise. These cases illustrate the complementary nature of physiological studies across species.

AB  - Background Low maximum and action levels set by the European Union for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in pig meat (pork) have led to a demand for reliable and cost-effective bioanalytical screening methods implemented upstream of gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry confirmatory technology, that can detect low levels of contamination in EU-regulated foods with quick turn-around times. Results Based on the Chemically Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) bioassay, extraction and clean-up steps were optimized for recovery and reproducibility within working ranges significantly lower than in current bioassays. A highly sensitive "3rd generation" recombinant rat hepatoma cell line (H4L7.5c2) containing 20 dioxin responsive elements was exposed to pork sample extracts, and their PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs levels were evaluated by measuring luciferase activity. The method was validated according to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/644 of 5 April 2017 with spiking experiments performed selectively for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs and individual calibration for PCDD/Fs, DL-PCBs and the calculated sum of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs. The resulting performance parameters met all legal specifications as confirmed by re-calibration using authentic samples. Cut-off concentrations for assessing compliance with low maximum levels and action levels set for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs within a range of 0.50-1.25 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat were derived, ensuring low rates of false-compliant results (ss-error < 1%) and keeping the rate of false-noncompliant results well under control (alpha-error < 12%). Conclusions We present a fast and efficient bioanalytical routine method validated according to the European Union's legal requirements on the basis of authentic samples, allowing the analyst to reliably identify pork samples and any other EU-regulated foods of animal origin suspected to be noncompliant with a high level of performance and turn-around times of 52 h. This was facilitated in particular by a quick and efficient extraction step followed by selective clean-up, use of a highly sensitive "3rd generation" H4L7.5c2 recombinant rat hepatoma cell CALUX bioassay, and optimized assay performance with improved calibrator precision and reduced lack-of-fit errors. New restrictions are proposed for the calibrator bias and the unspecific background contribution to reportable results. The procedure can utilize comparably small sample amounts and allows an annual throughput of 840-1000 samples per lab technician. The described bioanalytical method contributes to the European Commission's objective of generating accurate and reproducible analytical results according to Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/644 across the European Union.

AB  - Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are one of the superfamilies of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs) in mice and humans. Approximately 8% of the pig genome is composed of sequences derived from LTRs. While the majority of ERVs in pigs have decayed, a small number of full-length copies can still mobilize within the genome. This study investigated the unexplored retroviral insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) generated by the mobilization of full-length ERVs (Fl-ERVs), and evaluated their impact on phenotypic variation to gain insights into the biological role of Fl-ERVs in pigs. Overall, 39 RIPs (insertions or deletions relative to the pig reference genome) generated by Fl-ERVs were predicted by comparative genomic analysis, and 18 of them were confirmed by PCR detection. Four RIP sites (D5, D14, D15, and D18) were further evaluated by population analysis, and all of them displayed polymorphisms in multiple breeds. The RIP site of ERV-D14, which is a Fl-ERV inserted in the STAB2-like gene, was further confirmed by sequencing. Population analysis of the polymorphic site of ERV-D14 reveals that it presents moderate polymorphism information in the Large White pig breed, and the association analysis reveals that the RIP of ERV-D14 is associated with age variations at 30 kg body weight (p < 0.05) and 100 kg body weight (p < 0.01) in the population of Large White pigs (N = 480). Furthermore, the ERV-D14 RIP is associated with changes in the expression of the target gene STAB2-like in the liver, backfat, and leaf fat in Sushan pigs. These data suggest that some Fl-ERVs are still mobilizing in the pig's genome, and contribute to genomic and phenotypic variations.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of initial particle size (IPS) on the environmental parameters and heavy metal speciation during sludge composting. Three piles were conducted: fine material (FM, screen underflow), coarse material (CM, oversize product), and mixed material (MM, mix FM and CM in 1:1). Results showed that the temperature trends of the three piles in different layers were highly repeatable during the thermophilic period. With the decrease of IPS, the heating rate and the highest temperature of the pile increased, the thermophilic period was prolonged, and the highest temperature area in the pile shifted to a lower layer. It also promoted the organic matter degradation, compost maturation, and nitrogen fixation effect. Composting had a good effect on the passivation of heavy metals, especially Cd, Cu, and Pb. The passivation effect on Cd and Cu was FM > CM > MM, and on Pb was CM > FM > MM. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, excitation-emission matrix, and thermogravimetric thermal analysis indicated that FM had the highest content of aromatic structure and humic-like substance on D40. The redundancy analysis revealed that MM was beneficial to improve the internal uniformity during composting.

AB  - Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a notifiable viral disease caused by Lumpy Skin Disease virus (LSDV). It is usually associated with high economic losses, including a loss of productivity, infertility, and death. LSDV shares genetic and antigenic similarities with Sheep pox virus (SPV) and Goat pox (GPV) virus. Hence, the LSDV traditional diagnostic tools faced many limitations regarding sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity. Herein, we fabricated a paper-based turn-on fluorescent Molecularly Imprinted Polymer (MIP) sensor for the rapid detection of LSDV. The LSDV-MIPs sensor showed strong fluorescent intensity signal enhancement in response to the presence of the virus within minutes. Our sensor showed a limit of detection of 101 log10 TCID50/mL. Moreover, it showed significantly higher specificity to LSDV relative to other viruses, especially SPV. To our knowledge, this is the first record of a paper-based rapid detection test for LSDV depending on fluorescent turn-on behavior.

AB  - Klotho gene was originally recognized as a putative aging-suppressor and its prominent age-regulating effects are mostly attributed to the modulation of mineral homeostasis in the kidney. However, recent studies link alterations in hippocampal Klotho expression with cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that hippocampal neurons require Klotho for health and proper functionality. Klotho protects against neuronal dysfunction and regulates several intracellular signaling pathways including oxidative stress response, inflammation, DNA damage, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and multiple types of cell death. Specifically, this chapter covers the current knowledge as to how Klotho protein affects the hippocampal neuronal cells, with special attention paid to underlying molecular mechanisms, and thus influences hippocampal development, hippocampal-dependent cognition, behavior, and motor skills as well as mediates neurodegenerative processes.

AB  - This preliminary report concerns the micromammalian remains recovered from the Pleistocene strata in Excavation 1 at Wonderwerk Cave by Peter B. Beaumont during the 1980s and early 1990s. Because of the large size of the samples (170 656 specimens representing a minimum of 71 304 individuals), identification has so far only been taken to the generic level. Remains belonging to 34, and possibly 36, genera in five Orders have been identified, and there could be as many as 48 species represented. The uneven horizontal distribution of material throughout the excavation indicates probable roost or nest sites of Barn owls (Tyto alba), which is the most likely predator responsible for their accumulation. There is also considerable vertical variation in the amount of material in the different levels, which indicates that the predators were not consistently present in the area throughout the period represented by the deposits. In the majority of the samples, Gerbillinae (Gerbilliscus, gerbils) are best represented when supra-generic groupings are used. This suggests that conditions were reasonably arid during the periods represented by the samples but not necessarily throughout the entire period spanned by the deposits. When original groupings (genus and above) are considered, Otomyinae (Otomys spp., vlei rats) predominate in nearly half the samples. Secondarily important prey taxa are shrews (Soricidae), rats and mice (Murinae) and elephant shrews (Macroscelididae). This implies some variation in environmental conditions over time but more detailed interpretations must await further analysis. In particular it is imperative to identify the species of Gerbilliscus and Otomys before progress can be made. A range of techniques is now available to assist with interpreting the samples to their full potential once this has been done.

AB  - Studies in ovariectomized (OVX) female rodents suggest that G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is a key regulator of memory, yet little is known about its importance to memory in males or the cellular mechanisms underlying its mnemonic effects in either sex. In OVX mice, bilateral infusion of the GPER agonist G-1 into the dorsal hippocampus (DH) enhances object recognition and spatial memory consolidation in a manner dependent on rapid activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, cofilin phosphorylation, and actin polymerization in the DH. However, the effects of GPER on memory consolidation and DH cell signaling in males are unknown. Thus, the present study first assessed effects of DH infusion of G-1 or the GPER antagonist G-15 on object recognition and spatial memory consolidation in gonadectomized (GDX) male mice. As in OVX mice, immediate post-training bilateral DH infusion of G-1 enhanced, whereas G-15 impaired, memory consolidation in the object recognition and object placement tasks. However, G-1 did not increase levels of phosphorylated JNK (p46, p54) or cofilin in the DH 5, 15, or 30 min after infusion, nor did it affect phosphorylation of ERK (p42, p44), PI3K, or Akt. Levels of phospho-cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) were elevated in the DH 30 min following G-1 infusion, indicating that GPER in males activates a yet unknown signaling mechanism that triggers CREB-mediated gene transcription. Our findings show for the first time that GPER in the DH regulates memory consolidation in males and suggests sex differences in underlying signaling mechanisms.

AB  - Plants have evolved inducible defenses that allow them to minimize costs associated with the production of constitutive defenses when herbivores are not present. However, as a consequence, some plants might experience a period of vulnerability between damage and the onset of defense and/or between the cessation of damage and relaxation of defense. Few studies have examined the time course in the inducible protective mutualism between ants and extrafloral nectary (EFN)-bearing plants. None has compared the inducibility of EFNs on vegetative versus reproductive parts or in response to different levels of herbivore damage. Here, we disentangle the inducibility process by evaluating extrafloral nectar production and ant attendance over time, the time course of inducibility on different plant parts, and the time course of inducibility in response to different levels of foliar damage in a Brazilian tree, Qualea multiflora (Vochysiaceae). Using simulated herbivory on leaves and flowers, we found that (a) the production of extrafloral nectar from foliar and floral EFNs, as well as ant attendance, exhibited a lag between the moment of damage and the peak of response, followed by a response peak (usually 24 h after damage) at which the defense remains at its maximum level, then declines to prestimulus levels; (b) the time course of inducibility and the peak activity did not differ between EFNs located in vegetative versus reproductive parts, except for sugar concentration, which was higher in EFNs on vegetative parts; and (c) the time course of inducibility of foliar EFNs depended on damage level. Although considered a cost-saving strategy, inducible defenses can be disadvantageous since they can leave plants vulnerable to attack for extended periods. Our results illuminate the dynamics of the induced response and the underlying mechanisms that might mediate it, ultimately providing new insights into defense strategies employed by plants.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study was conducted to investigate the health benefits of incorporating brown macroalgae into the diets of young piglets. Different amounts of macroalgae were added to piglet feed, and the effects on their digestion and health were observed. It was found that the inclusion of macroalgae enhanced the piglets' ability to digest fat and had a positive impact on their blood cholesterol levels. Additionally, an increase in the body's defense against oxidative stress, a condition that can cause cellular damage, was noted. This study suggests that macroalgae, a natural seaweed supplement, could be beneficial in piglet diets, aiding in digestion and health improvement. This research is significant as it explores natural methods to enhance animal health and nutrition. This study explores the effects of dietary brown macroalgae (Ascophyllum nodosum) inclusion on digestibility and blood biochemical indices and redox markers in piglets fed diets with varying levels (0%, 0.6% and 1%) of macroalgae from 18 to 64 days of age. Macroalgae significantly influenced lipid profiles, reducing total cholesterol levels (quadratic contrast p = 0.001) and demonstrating an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, particularly with 1% macroalgae inclusion (linear contrast p < 0.001), with a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both macroalgae-supplemented groups (linear contrast p = 0.001). Additionally, macroalgae had a positive impact on the activities of antioxidative enzymes (ferric-reducing ability of plasma, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione) and reduced lipid peroxidation products (lipid hydroperoxide, malondialdehyde) in the blood, liver tissue, and intestinal epithelium of the ileum, suggesting enhanced antioxidative defense mechanisms. These changes were dose-dependent; in blood plasma, they exhibited both a linear and quadratic response, while in the tissues, the response was primarily linear. Additionally, an increase in the digestibility of crude fat in macroalgae-supplemented groups was observed (linear contrast p < 0.001), highlighting their potential role in improving nutrient absorption and digestion. The study findings emphasize the health benefits of natural, seaweed-based additives in diets, particularly in managing oxidative stress and improving lipid profiles, and highlight the potential of macroalgae as a natural dietary supplement to improve antioxidant systems and lipid metabolism in piglets.

AB  - Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a peptide suggested to play a role in gastrointestinal tract tissue reaction to pathology. Gastric ulceration is a common disorder affecting huge number of people, and additionally, it contributes to the loss of pig livestock production. Importantly, ulceration as a focal disruption affecting deeper layers of the stomach wall differs from other gastrointestinal pathologies and should be studied individually. The pig's gastrointestinal tract, due to its many similarities to the human counterpart, provides a valuable experimental model for studying digestive system pathologies. To date, the role of CART in gastric ulceration and the expression of the gene encoding CART in porcine gastrointestinal tube are completely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to verify the changes in the CART expression by Q-PCR (gene encoding CART in the tissue) and double immunofluorescence staining combined with confocal microscopy (CART immunofluorescence in enteric nervous system) in the porcine stomach tissues adjacent to gastric ulcerations. Surprisingly, we found that gastric ulcer caused a significant decrease in the expression of CART-encoding gene and huge reduction in the percentage of CART-immunofluorescent myenteric perikarya and neuronal fibers located within the circular muscle layer. Our results indicate a unique CART-dependent gastric response to ulcer disease.

AB  - Simple Summary RNA-Seq data provide a new chance to find transcriptome variants. We used RNA-Seq data to detect the variants involved in the three different stages (before peak = BP, peak = P, and after peak = AP) of the lactation process in two sheep and two cow breeds. Furthermore, several KEGG pathways and enriched gene ontologies associated with immune system activation and the metabolic process were demonstrated by analyzing the functional enrichment of the genes that were affected. Findings of the present study also suggest that milk yield and milk composition in sheep and cow breeds at different stages of lactation can be related to known and novel variants of specific genes related to milk fat and protein synthesis. The results pave the way for further studies on determining the genetic basis of milk production. The novel variants discovered here using RNA-seq data may be central and crucial when it comes time to design new SNP chips used as guides for selective breeding programs. The RNA-Seq data provides new opportunities for the detection of transcriptome variants' single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various species and tissues. Herein, milk samples from two sheep breeds and two cow breeds were utilized to characterize the genetic variation in the coding regions in three stages (before-peak (BP), peak (P), and after-peak (AP)) of the lactation process. In sheep breeds Assaf and Churra, 100,462 and 97,768, 65,996 and 62,161, and 78,656 and 39,245 variants were observed for BP, P, and AP lactation stages, respectively. The number of specific variants was 59,798 and 76,419, 11,483 and 49,210, and 104,033 and 320,817 in cow breeds Jersy and Kashmiri, respectively, for BP, P, and AP stages. Via the transcriptome analysis of variation in regions containing QTL for fat, protein percentages, and milk yield, we detected a number of pathways and genes harboring mutations that could influence milk production attributes. Many SNPs detected here can be regarded as appropriate markers for custom SNP arrays or genotyping platforms to conduct association analyses among commercial populations. The results of this study offer new insights into milk production genetic mechanisms in cow and sheep breeds, which can contribute to designing suitable breeding systems for optimal milk production.

AB  - Simple Summary Research on real-time instance segmentation technology in the field of pigs is of great significance, as it can provide accurate pig behavior monitoring and management for the animal husbandry industry, and improve breeding efficiency and animal welfare. In this study, we developed a novel pixel self-attention (PSA) module by combining channel attention and spatial attention, which can integrate into the feature pyramid module of the YOLACT model. In addition, we visually analyzed prototype vectors within the YOLACT model, the attention maps obtained using the PSA attention module, and the model's robustness across different shooting angles and times. The experimental results indicated that the proposed attention module can improve model performance and transferability. Our model provides a new research perspective for the pig instance segmentation task, can initially provide information on individual parts of pigs, and can provide a useful reference for subsequent pig tracking management.Abstract Instance segmentation is crucial to modern agriculture and the management of pig farms. In practical farming environments, challenges arise due to the mutual adhesion, occlusion, and dynamic changes in body posture among pigs, making accurate segmentation of multiple target pigs complex. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments using video data captured from varying angles and non-fixed lenses. We selected 45 pigs aged between 20 and 105 days from eight pens as research subjects. Among these, 1917 images were meticulously labeled, with 959 images designated for the training set, 192 for validation, and 766 for testing. To enhance feature utilization and address limitations in the fusion process between bottom-up and top-down feature maps within the feature pyramid network (FPN) module of the YOLACT model, we propose a pixel self-attention (PSA) module, incorporating joint channel and spatial attention. The PSA module seamlessly integrates into multiple stages of the FPN feature extraction within the YOLACT model. We utilized ResNet50 and ResNet101 as backbone networks and compared performance metrics, including AP0.5, AP0.75, AP0.5-0.95, and AR0.5-0.95, between the YOLACT model with the PSA module and YOLACT models equipped with BAM, CBAM, and SCSE attention modules. Experimental results indicated that the PSA attention module outperforms BAM, CBAM, and SCSE, regardless of the selected backbone network. In particular, when employing ResNet101 as the backbone network, integrating the PSA module yields a 2.7% improvement over no attention, 2.3% over BAM, 2.4% over CBAM, and 2.1% over SCSE across the AP0.5-0.95 metric. We visualized prototype masks within YOLACT to elucidate the model's mechanism. Furthermore, we visualized the PSA attention to confirm its ability to capture valuable pig-related information. Additionally, we validated the transfer performance of our model on a top-down view dataset, affirming the robustness of the YOLACT model with the PSA module.

AB  - Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in women. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) secretes cytokines to modulate coronary artery function, and the release of fatty acids from EAT serves as a readily available energy source for cardiomyocytes. However, despite having beneficial functions, excessive amounts of EAT can cause the secretion of proinflammatory molecules that increase the instability of atherosclerotic plaques and contribute to CAD progression. Although exercise mitigates CAD, the mechanisms by which exercise impacts EAT are unknown. The Yucatan pig is an excellent translational model for the effects of exercise on cardiac function. Therefore, we sought to determine if chronic aerobic exercise promotes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in EAT from female Yucatan pigs.Methods Sexually mature, female Yucatan pigs (n = 7 total) were assigned to sedentary (Sed, n = 3) or exercise (Ex, n = 4) treatments, and coronary arteries were occluded (O) with an ameroid to mimic CAD or remained non-occluded (N). EAT was collected for bulk (n = 7 total) and single nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (n = 2 total, 1 per exercise treatment).Results Based on the bulk transcriptomic analysis, exercise upregulated S100 family, G-protein coupled receptor, and CREB signaling in neurons canonical pathways in EAT. The top networks in EAT affected by exercise as measured by bulk RNA sequencing were SRC kinase family, fibroblast growth factor receptor, Jak-Stat, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Single nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that exercise increased the interaction between immune, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells in the insulin-like growth factor pathway and between endothelial and other cell types in the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 pathway. Sub-clustering revealed nine cell types in EAT, with fibroblast and macrophage populations predominant in O-Ex EAT and T cell populations predominant in N-Ex EAT. Unlike the findings for exercise alone as a treatment, there were not increased interactions between endothelial and mesenchymal cells in O-Ex EAT. Coronary artery occlusion impacted the most genes in T cells and endothelial cells. Genes related to fatty acid metabolism were the most highly upregulated in non-immune cells from O-Ex EAT. Sub-clustering of endothelial cells revealed that N-Ex EAT separated from other treatments.Conclusions According to bulk transcriptomics, exercise upregulated pathways and networks related to growth factors and immune cell communication. Based on single nucleus transcriptomics, aerobic exercise increased cell-to-cell interaction amongst immune, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells in female EAT. Yet, exercise was minimally effective at reversing alterations in gene expression in endothelial and mesenchymal cells in EAT surrounding occluded arteries. These findings lay the foundation for future work focused on the impact of exercise on cell types in EAT.

AB  - Plant nutrition is connected to defense against insect herbivores, but the exact mechanism underlying the effect of the nitrogen (N) supply on the anti-herbivore capacity of eggplants (Solanum melongena) has not been studied in detail. Therefore, we examined the impact of low (LN, 0.5 mM) and high (HN, 5 mM) nitrate levels on eggplant resistance against the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (WFT), a major destructive eggplant pest. Our results showed that LN plants displayed enhanced defense responses to WFT compared to HN plants. This included increased transcript levels of key genes in the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway, the accumulation of JA-amido conjugates (jasmonoyl-isoleucine, jasmonoyl-phenylalanine, and jasmonoyl-valine), JA precursor (12-oxophytodienoic acid), and methyl jasmonate, higher transcript levels of defense marker genes (MPK3, MPK7, and WRKY53), and increased activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase upon a WFT attack. Our findings suggest that N deficiency can prime JA-mediated defense responses in eggplants, resulting in increased anti-herbivore resistance.

AB  - Plants belonging to the genera Astragalus, Oxytropis, Ipomoea, Sida, and Swainsona often contain the toxin swainsonine (SW), which causes a neurological disorder in livestock. It has been demonstrated that SW is produced by a symbiont fungus associated with these plants. In I. carnea, the fungus belongs to the ascomycetes of the order Chaetothyriales and grows ectopically on the adaxial surface of leaves. In this study, the presence of the symbiont fungus in different organs of I. carnea was investigated using imaging techniques to understand the process of endophyte transmission. In I. carnea plants with whitish mycelia on the leaf surface, SW could be detected in seeds. Inside the seeds, the mycelium was located on the surface of the cotyledons and on the inner side of the seed coat. We corroborated that the presence of this fungus is a prerequisite for the presence of SW in I. carnea. The demonstration of the localization of the fungus within the seed strongly suggested that this endophyte is vertically transmitted. Our observations verified that the SW-producing fungus in I. carnea is an endosymbiont with epibiotic behavior.

AB  - Cell size is an important component of cell morphological characteristics. It reflects the characteristics of the cell type, nutritional status, growth stage and physiological function. The cell size of cells of the same type tends to be homogeneous and stable. However, in tumour cells, mutations in cell cycle genes and cytoskeletal genes and overexpression of the corresponding signalling pathways often lead to large variations in tumour cell size. Tumour cells regulate cell size and growth and proliferation through multiple signalling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Myc and Hippo pathways, which work together to regulate cell size and proliferation. This allows tumour cells to adapt to different survival environments. Alterations in cell size also cause tumours to perform different functions, leading to alterations in tumour stemness, invasive migration and anti-tumour immunity by affecting immune cells in the tumour immune microenvironment. In this review, we describe the endogenous and exogenous factors affecting tumour cell size, analyse the mechanisms by which tumour cells regulate cell size and the effects of cell size on tumour malignancy and tumour immunity, summarise the potential therapeutic targets for cell size, and look forward to possible future research directions and clinical applications.

AB  - Phosphor-in-glass (PiG) films are thought to be the best color converters for lighting of laser diodes (LDs) because of their better efficiency and outstanding thermal conductivity. Since laser-driven illumination can overcome the limitations of power density at higher incident optical power densities, in this paper, Cr3+-activated oxides were prepared as near-infrared emitters with thermally stable photoluminescence using a practical blade-coating approach. When pumped using a blue laser, the CaZrTaGa0.2Ge0.4Zn0.4O7:0.01Cr(3+) PiG film presents a near infrared (NIR) emission band, with a peak at 812 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 248.37 nm. Its internal quantum efficiency reaches 90.20% and the emission intensity at 423 K remains at 92.32% of that at room temperature (RT). In addition, when coupled with a blue laser diode (LD), the optical output power of the NIR LD reaches up to 2.07 W mm(-2) at an input power of 9 W mm(-2), which is significantly higher than the output power of the NIR phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (pc-LEDs). Thus, this study advances the development of Cr3+ activated oxide-based PiG films with thermally stabilized luminescence properties and confirms their promising applications in laser-pumped dental monitoring and near-infrared high-power illumination.

AB  - The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta is a destructive invasive pest of cultivated tomato and other Solanaceae plants, with yield losses of 80-100%. Mirid predators are key natural enemies of T. absoluta, but they also feed on host plants in the absence of their prey. Management of T. absoluta is a challenge due to its high biotic potential, resistance to many insecticides and the absence of sufficiently adapted auxiliary fauna in its new dispersion zones. Olfaction plays an important role in the tritrophic interaction between tomato, its herbivore pest T. absoluta and its mirid predators, which can be influenced by non-host plant odors. However, how non-host odours shape this interaction is poorly understood. Previously, we had demonstrated belowground crop protection properties of certain Asteraceae plants against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, pest of tomato and other Solanaceae plants. Additionally, Asteraceae plants impact negatively on feeding behavior of above-ground pests of Solanaceae plants, including the greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Here, we tested the hypothesis that foliar volatiles from some of these non-host Asteraceae plants can influence the tomato-T. absoluta-mirid predator tritrophic interaction. In olfactometer assays, T. absoluta females were attracted to volatiles of the Solanaceae host plants tomato and giant nightshade but avoided volatiles of the Asteraceae plants, blackjack and marigold, and the positive control, wild tomato, when tested alone or in combination with the host plants. Coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that host and non-host plants varied in their emission of volatiles, mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Random forest analysis combined with behavioral assays identified monoterpenes as the host plant attractive blend to T. absoluta and its mirid predator, with sesquiterpenes identified as the non-host plant repellent blend against T. absoluta. Contrastingly, the mirid predator was indifferent to the non-host plant repellent sesquiterpenes. Our findings indicate that terpenes influence the tomato-T. absoluta-mirid predator tritrophic interaction. Further, our results emphasize the importance of studying crop protection from a holistic approach to identify companion crops that serve multi-functional roles.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a common environmental toxin that is secreted by fusarium fungi that frequently contaminates feedstuff and food. While the detrimental effects of DON on human and animal reproductive systems have been well recognized, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Ovarian granulosa cells (GCs), which surround oocytes, are crucial for regulating oocyte development, mainly through the secretion of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. Using an in vitro model of murine GCs, we characterized the cytotoxic effects of DON and profiled genome-wide chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic alterations after DON exposure. Our results suggest that DON can induce decreased viability and growth, increased apoptosis rate, and disrupted hormone secretion. In total, 2533 differentially accessible loci and 2675 differentially expressed genes were identified that were associated with Hippo, Wnt, steroid biosynthesis, sulfur metabolism, and inflammation-related pathways. DON-induced genes usually have a concurrently increased occupancy of active histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in their promoters. Integrative analyses identified 35 putative directly affected genes including Adrb2 and Fshr, which are key regulators of follicular growth, and revealed that regions with increased chromatin accessibility are enriched with the binding motifs for NR5A1 and NR5A2, which are important for GCs. Moreover, DON-induced inflammatory response is due to the activation of the NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the regulatory elements, genes, and key pathways underlying the response of ovarian GCs to DON cytotoxicity.

TI  - Antifertility effects of 60-day oral gavage of ethanol extract of Spondias mombin leaves in guinea pigs: A biochemical, reproductive and histological study
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: To investigate the impact of ethanol extract of Spondias (S.) mombin leaves on the biochemical parameters of testicular function, hormonal profile, sperm profile and reproductive outcomes of guinea pigs.
   Methods: Sexually matured male [(1000.40 +/- 8.12) g] and female [(810.00 +/- 7.09) g] guinea pigs were used. In testicular function study, a total of 24 male guinea pigs were randomised into 4 groups of 6 guinea pigs each. Group A (control) were orally administered 1 mL of physiological saline, once daily for 60 days while groups B, C and D were treated like the control group except that they were orally administered 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight of ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves. For the fertility study, the same animal groupings and treatments in the testicular function study were adopted. The male guinea pigs were paired with the females (1:1) and afterwards examined for pregnancy outcomes.
   Results: The ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves contained saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, phenolics, phlobatannins, cardiac glycosides, cardenolides and dienolides with saponins (4.80 mg/mL) occurring the most whilst cardenolides and dienolides (0.08 mg/mL) were the least. The ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves significantly and dose dependently reduced the activities of alkaline phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, malic enzyme, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, catalase and superoxide dismutase as well as levels of testosterone, glycogen, total protein and ascorbic acid in the testes when compared with the control group (P<0.05). All the doses of ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves also reduced the levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase, 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and sialic acid whereas the levels of testicular acid phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase and cholesterol increased dose dependently (P<0.05). The serum luteinising hormone, testosterone and estradiol were reduced after the administration of ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves whereas levels of serum follicle stimulating hormone increased significantly. The 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight of ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves increased the testosterone/estradiol ratios whilst the 500 mg/kg body weight of ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves decreased it. The sperm motility, sperm count, normal sperm morphology, sperm density, sperm viability and semen viscosity were significantly reduced in the ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves-treated guinea pigs (P<0.05) whereas the head-, tail- and neck-defects increased significantly when compared with the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, the semen volume and pH were not significantly altered by the ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves (P>0.05). The ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves at both 100 and 250 mg/kg body weight significantly reduced the total number, circumference, weight and length of the pups whereas the 500 mg/kg body weight of ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves-treated rats did not produce any pup. The 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight of ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves induced degenerative and necrotic changes in the seminiferous tubules with vacuoles in the germinal epithelium and a few to complete absence of spermatozoa. In all of these, the 500 mg/kg body weight of ethanol extract of S. mombin leaves produced the most pronounced alteration on the parameters.
   Conclusions: S. mombin leaves have induced infertility in the male guinea pigs via endocrine dysregulation, anti-spermatogenic activity, testicular dysfunction and oxidative stress and made possible by the presence of saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, phenolics, and cardiac glycosides.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) is commonly associated with decreased attention, reduced responsiveness to external stimuli, and impaired locomotor and cognitive performances. Strong evidence indicates that SD disrupts neuro-immuno-endocrine system which is also linked to cognitive function. Recently Zebrafish have emerged as a powerful model sharing organizational and functional characteristics with other vertebrates, providing great translational relevance with rapid and reliable screening results. In the current study, we examined the effects of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) on cognitive and locomotor activity in sleep deprived Zebrafish model. Learning and memory were assessed by T-maze and locomotor activity was assessed by partition preference and swimming time in spinning tasks. Furthermore, brain bioavailability of aspirin was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Following drug exposure and tasks, histopathology of the brain was performed. It was observed that three-day SD significantly reduces learning and memory and locomotion in the Zebrafish. Aspirin was found to restore SD induced cognitive decline and improve the locomotor functions. Neuro-inflammation and impaired functional network connectivity is linked to cognitive defects, which implicate the possible benefits of immunotherapeutics. In the present study, aspirin decreased neutrophil infiltration, and increased spine density in dentate gyrus granular and shrinkage and basophil in the CA1 neurons of hippocampus. This hints the benefit of aspirin on neuroimmune functions in sleep deprived fish and warrants more studies to establish the clear molecular mechanism behind this protective effect.

AB  - It is well known that solid diet supplementation in early life can significantly promote rumen development and metabolic function in young ruminants. However, the changes in the expressed proteome and related metabolism in rumen epithelium in response to a supplemented solid diet remain unclear. In this study, rumen epithelial tissue from goats in three diet regimes including milk replacer only (MRO), milk replacer supplemented concentrate (MRC), and milk replacer supplemented concentrate plus alfalfa pellets (MCA) were collected for measurement of the expression of epithelial proteins using proteomic technology (six per group). The results showed that solid diet significantly improved the growth performance of goats, enhanced the ability of rumen fermentation, and promoted the development of epithelial papilla (p < 0.05). Proteome analysis revealed the distinct difference in the expressed protein in the MRC and MCA group compared with the MRO group (42 upregulated proteins and 79 downregulated proteins in MRC; 38 upregulated proteins and 73 downregulated proteins in MCA). Functional analysis showed that solid diet supplementation activated a variety of molecular functions in the epithelium, including protein binding, ATP binding, structural constituent of muscle, etc., in the MRC and MCA groups. Meanwhile, the expression of proteins related to fatty acid metabolism, the PPAR signaling pathway, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, and butanoate metabolism were upregulated, being stimulated by solid feed. In contrast, the proteins associated with carbohydrate digestion and absorption and glycosaminoglycan degradation were downregulated. In addition, the protein expression of enzymes involved in ketone body synthesis in the rumen was generally activated, which was caused by solid feed. In summary, solid feed promoted the development of rumen epithelium by changing the expression of proteins related to fatty acid metabolism, energy synthesis, and signal transduction. The ketone body synthesis pathway might be the most important activated pathway, and provides energy for rumen development.

AB  - The present study estimates length-weight relationships (LWRs) of fish species from the mainstream of the Yellow River, which is the largest sediment-laden river in the world. A total of 1168 specimens belonging to 4 families and 18 species were analysed. The following fish species were covered: Leuciscus chuanchicus (Kessler, 1876); Ctenopharyngodon idella (Valenciennes, 1844); Squaliobarbus curriculus (Richardson, 1846); Parabramis pekinensis (Basilewsky, 1855); Hemiculter leucisculus (Basilewsky, 1855); Culter alburnus (Basilewsky, 1855); Rhinogobio nasutus (Kessler, 1876); Hemibarbus maculatus (Bleeker, 1871); Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758); Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758); Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844); Hypophthalmichthys nobil (Richardson, 1845); Gymnocypris eckloni (Herzenstein, 1891); Schizopygopsis pylzovi (Kessler, 1876); Triplophysa siluroides (Herzenstein, 1888); Silurus lanzhouensis (Chen, 1977); Silurus asotus (Linnaeus, 1758); Channa argus (Cantor, 1842). The b values of the LWRs ranged from 2.598 for Ctenopharyngodon idella to 3.271 for Parabramis pekinensis. This study represents the first report on LRWs of commercial fish species in the whole mainstream of the Yellow River.The LRWs of five species have not been previously record. These data can serve as important baseline for conservation and management in the Yellow River fishery resources, which is very useful for evaluation of the status of the river ecological health.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are some of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders; however, the mechanisms underlying ASDs are still poorly understood. Serotonin (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are known as key players in brain and behavioral plasticity and interact with each other. 5-HT1A receptor is a principal regulator of the brain 5-HT system, which modulates normal and pathological behavior. Here we investigated effects of adeno-associated-virus-based 5-HT1A receptor overexpression in the hippocam-pus of BTBR mice (which are a model of autism) on various types of behavior and on the expression of 5-HT7 receptor, proBDNF, mature BDNF, and BDNF receptors (TrkB and p75NTR). The 5-HT1A receptor overexpression in BTBR mice reduced stereotyped behavior in the marble-burying test and extended the time spent in the center in the open field test. Meanwhile, this overexpression failed to affect social behavior in the three-chambered test, immobility time in the tail suspension test, locomotor activity in the open field test, and associative learning within the "operant wall" paradigm. The 5-HT1A receptor overexpression in the hippocampus raised hippo-campal 5-HT7 receptor mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, the 5-HT1A receptor overexpression lowered both mRNA and protein levels of TrkB receptor but failed to affect proBDNF, mature BDNF, and p75NTR receptor expression in the hippocampus of BTBR mice. Thus, obtained results suggest the involvement of the 5-HT and BDNF systems' interaction mediated by 5-HT1A and TrkB receptors in the mechanisms underlying autistic-like behavior in BTBR mice.

AB  - Within the genus Trichinella, Trichinella pseudospiralis is the only recognized non-encapsulated species known to infect mammals and birds. In October 2020, larvae recovered from muscle tissues of a wolf (Canis lupus italicus) originating from Molise Region, Central Italy, were molecularly confirmed as those of Trichinella britovi and T. pseudospiralis. This is the first detection of T. pseudospiralis from a wolf. In Italy, this zoonotic nematode was detected in a red fox (Vulpes vulpes), three birds (Stria aluco, Athene noctua, Milvus milvus) and five wild boars (Sus scrofa), and was also identified as the etiological agent of a human outbreak of trichinellosis in 2015. Since T. pseudospiralis is rarely reported from carnivore mammals in comparison to the encapsulated species frequently detected in these hosts, this finding opens the question of the role of carnivores as reservoirs for this parasite.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to social criticism of livestock farming, the "Initiative Animal Welfare" was founded in Germany to improve the conditions in which pigs are kept. At the same time, farmers were obliged to monitor animal welfare parameters which could be recorded directly on the animal, e.g., in the form of tail and ear lesions. Furthermore, there are resource-related animal welfare parameters, e.g., the water flow rate of the drinking troughs, which are to be measured. The aim of this study was to apply animal welfare parameters on farms and compare farms participating in the "Initiative Animal Welfare" with those not participating. The collected data was used to calculate the risk indicated by an animal welfare parameter deviating from the optimum. In addition, an overall score for the farms was calculated from the different animal welfare parameters recorded. It was found that the animal welfare farms did not perform better in terms of both the overall score and the risk of not finding a parameter in the optimum range. One reason for this may be that the farms worked at a very high level in both types of husbandry and thus the improvement in husbandry conditions in the farms with better animal welfare conditions was not measurable. In the course of social criticism of fattening pig farming, an animal welfare programme called "Initiative Animal Welfare" (ITW) was founded to increase animal welfare in pig farming in Germany. Furthermore, there is a legal obligation to record animal welfare parameters as a self-monitoring measure. The "German Association for Technology and Structures in Agriculture" published a guideline on the applicable animal welfare criteria. This guide formed the basis of this study's data collection. The aim was to apply the animal welfare parameters on farms by comparing the results between farms participating in ITW with those not participating. A cumulative score was calculated by evaluating the collected data. In addition, the relative risk was calculated in order to estimate the risk of finding a negative expression of a parameter. Our data show that ITW farms did not perform significantly better than the farms without ITW in terms of both the cumulative score and the relative risk. Overall, it must be considered that in both farm variants the occurrence of negative evaluations was very rare and the visited farms thus certainly can be considered to be well-managed farms. Climate parameters were recorded in each compartment and showed no significant differences in most cases.

AB  - Age-related changes in spatial and temporal processing have been documented across a range of species. Rodent studies typically investigate differences in performance between adult and senescent animals; however, pro-gressive loss of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex has been observed to occur as early as after adolescence. Therefore, the current study evaluated the effects of age in three-and ten-month-old female rats on the orga-nization of movement in open field and food protection behaviors, two tasks that have previously dissociated hippocampal and cortical pathology. Age-related differences were observed in general measures of locomotion, spatial orientation, and attentional processing. The results of the current study are consistent with age-related changes in the processing of spatial information and motivation that occur earlier in life than previously anticipated. These observations establish a foundation for future studies evaluating interventions that influence these age-related differences in performance.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans in late 2019 and spread rapidly, becoming a global pandemic. A zoonotic spillover event from animal to human was identified as the presumed origin. Subsequently, reports began emerging regarding spillback events resulting in SARS-CoV-2 infections in multiple animal species. These events highlighted critical links between animal and human health while also raising concerns about the development of new reservoir hosts and potential viral mutations that could alter the virulence and transmission or evade immune responses. Characterizing susceptibility, prevalence, and transmission between animal species became a priority to help protect animal and human health. In this study, we coalesced a large team of investigators and community partners to surveil for SARS-CoV-2 in domestic and free-ranging animals around Ohio between May 2020 and August 2021. We focused on species with known or predicted susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, highly congregated or medically compromised animals (e.g., shelters, barns, veterinary hospitals), and animals that had frequent contact with humans (e.g., pets, agricultural animals, zoo animals, or animals in wildlife hospitals). This included free-ranging deer (n = 76 individuals), free-ranging mink (n = 57), multiple species of bats (n = 59), and other wildlife in addition to domestic cats (n = 275) and pigs (n = 184). In total, we tested 792 individual animals (34 species) via rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was not detected in any of the tested animals despite a major peak in human SARS-CoV-2 cases that occurred in Ohio subsequent to the peak of animal samplings. Importantly, we did not test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this study, which limited our ability to assess exposure. While the results of this study were negative, the surveillance effort was critical and remains key to understanding, predicting, and preventing the re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans or animals.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the sprouting time of tea plants, 'Yuchunzao', which was an early sprouting tea cultivar, was studied. 'Echa 1', sprout one week later than 'Yuchunzao' in spring, was used as the control. Results A total of 26 hormonal compounds and its derivatives in tea plants were qualified by using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The result showed that GA(20), GA(3) and ICA were significantly different in 'Yuchunzao' than in 'Echa 1', with GA(20) and GA(3 )up-regulated and ICA down-regulated. Based on the Illumina platform, transcriptome analysis revealed a total of 5,395 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A diterpenoid biosynthesis related gene, gibberellin 2-oxidase 1 (CsGA2ox1), was downregulated in 'Yuchunzao' compared to 'Echa 1'. CsGA2ox1 regulate the transformation of GA different forms in plants. The relative expression of CsGA2ox1 showed an adverse trend with the content of GA(20) and GA(3). Our results suggest that down regulation of CsGA2ox1 resulted in the accumulation of GA(3) and GA(20), and then promoted sprout of 'Yuchunzao'. Conclusion This study provides theoretical basis of tea plants sprout and guides the tea breeding in practice.

AB  - Interferon-tau (IFNT), a pregnancy recognition signal in ruminants, promotes the establishment of endometrial receptivity by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STATs) signaling pathway. However, the precise mechanisms remain largely unknown. Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) acts specifically on the ISGylation modification system to exert deubiquitination and participates in the regulation of the type I IFN signaling pathway. The purpose of this study was to determine the role and mechanism of USP18 on endometrial receptivity in goat. USP18 was mainly localized in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelium, and its expression levels were significantly increased from days 5-18 of early pregnancy. Progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2), and IFNT significantly stimulated USP18 expression in goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs) cultured in vitro. Meanwhile, the markers of endometrial receptivity HOXA11, ITGB1, ITGB3, and ITGB5 were significantly upregulated after USP18 overexpression in gEECs. However, USP18 interference significantly inhibited the expression of HOXA10, ITGB1, ITGB3, and ITGB5 in gEECs. In addition, both the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 and the expression of ISGylation-modified proteins were significantly increased after USP18 silencing in gEECs. Furthermore, pretreat-ment with the STAT1 inhibitor Fludara markedly restored the effect of USP18 interference in gEECs. In summary, USP18 may play an important role in promoting goat endometrial receptivity by regulating the JAK/STAT1 pathway and ISGylation.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Painful invasive procedures are often performed on newborns admitted to intensive care units (ICU). The acute and long-term effects caused by these stimuli can be investigated in animal models, such as newborn rats. Previous studies have shown that animals subjected to nociceptive stimuli in the neonatal period show sex-specific behavioral changes such as signs of anxiety or depression. Under the same conditions, neonatal stimuli also provoke an increase in the rate of neurogenesis and cell activation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. So, this study aims to identify the possible roles of central monoamines, receptor expression (5-HT1A), and signaling factors (p-CREB) underlying the long-term effects of neonatal nociceptive stimulation. For this, noxious stimulation was induced by intra-plantar injection of Complete Freund<acute accent>s adjuvant (CFA) on the postnatal day 1 (P1) or 8 (P8). Control animals were not stimulated. On P75 the behavioral tests were conducted (hotplate and elevated plus maze), followed by sacrifice and molecular studies. Our results showed that neonatal nociceptive stimulation alters pain sensitization specially in females, while stimulation on P1 increases pain threshold, P8-stimulated animals respond with reduced pain threshold (P < 0.001). Hippocampal expression of 5-HT1A receptor and p-CREB were reduced in P8 F group (P < 0.001) in opposition to the increased utilization rate of dopamine and serotonin in this group (P < 0.05). This study shows sex- and age-specific responses of signaling pathways within the hippocampus accompanied by altered behavioral repertoire, at long-term after neonatal painful stimulation.

AB  - The present study aimed to observe the changes in the cochlea ribbon synapses after repeated exposure to moderate-to-high intensity noise. Guinea pigs received 95 dB SPL white noise exposure 4 h a day for consecutive 7 days (we regarded it a medium-term and moderate-intensity noise, or MTMI noise). Animals were divided into four groups: Control, 1DPN (1-day post noise), 1WPN (1-week post noise), and 1MPN (1-month post noise). Auditory function analysis by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and compound action potential (CAP) recordings, as well as ribbon synapse morphological analyses by immunohistochemistry (Ctbp2 and PSD95 staining) were performed 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after noise exposure. After MTMI noise exposure, the amplitudes of ABR I and III waves were suppressed. The CAP threshold was elevated, and CAP amplitude was reduced in the 1DPN group. No apparent changes in hair cell shape, arrangement, or number were observed, but the number of ribbon synapse was reduced. The 1WPN and 1MPN groups showed that part of ABR and CAP changes recovered, as well as the synapse number. The defects in cochlea auditory function and synapse changes were observed mainly in the high-frequency region. Together, repeated exposure in MTMI noise can cause hidden hearing loss (HHL), which is partially reversible after leaving the noise environment; and MTMI noise-induced HHL is associated with inner hair cell ribbon synapses.
   Hair cell loss and damage are important reasons for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), which may affect the auditory function after noise exposure [1]. High-intensity noise exposure can cause temporary threshold shift (TTS); it also destroys the ribbon synapses between the inner hair cells (IHC) and type I afferent nerve fibers. Cochlear coding deficits can occur after transient noise exposure with

AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to study the effects of oregano essential oil (OEO) on the performance, intestinal morphology and intestinal flora of fattening Sewa sheep. Sixty 20-month-old Sewa sheep with similar body weights (BWs) and in good health were randomly divided into four groups. The groups were fed a diet containing 0 mg/kg OEO (group A), 150 mg/kg (group B), 300 mg/kg (group C) or 450 mg/kg (group D). Daily gain, slaughter rate and other production performance parameters were analysed in the test sheep (mean +/- standard error). Intestinal morphology was analysed by tissue sectioning, and intestinal flora was analysed by 16S rRNA genome sequencing. The indexes, including average daily gain (ADG), slaughter rate, villus length of the small intestine and number of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal flora, in group C were significantly higher than those in the other groups. Supplementation with 300 mg/kg OEO concentrate in the diets can improve the growth performance of Sewa sheep by changing their intestinal morphology and modifying their intestinal flora structure. Conclusively, these encourage to further verifying in practice positive evidence in improving growth performance of OEO supplementation in the diets for Sewa sheep.

AB  - Dioecious plant species presented sexual differences in metal accumulation and allocation between male and fe-male conspecifics that grown on metal contaminated soil. As the Elemental defense hypothesis postulates that metals accumulated in plant tissues could protect plants from herbivory, whether such sexual dimorphism in re-sponse to metal stress of a dioecious plant will lead to differences in herbivore resistance between male and fe-male conspecifics is still unknown. In this study, we used female and male siblings of Populus deltoides to investigate the effect of plant sex on the growth and feeding preferences of four leaf herbivores and a root herbi-vore under soil cadmium (Cd) stress. The results showed that the male plants accumulated significantly higher Cd in the leaves while the females allocated more Cd in the roots. Leaf herbivores fed on male leaves grew worse than those fed on female leaves under Cd exposure, while the root herbivore showed the opposite results. In addition, all leaf herbivores strongly preferred the leaves from Cd-stressed female plants than male ones. The quantification of gene expression further showed that Cd stress could significantly upregulate more genes in-volved in Cd uptake, transport and detoxification pathways in male leaves and female roots. In combination with the correlation tests, we postulated that such sexual differences in herbivore resistance between the two plant sexes was most likely due to the different Cd allocation patterns in plant leaves and roots.

AB  - To deal with the problems of increasing the heavy metal (HM) bioavailability and declining the soil biological properties resulting from a direct application of solid digestate (SD). A low-temperature fruit biochar and pig-SD (BSD-0, BSD-1, BSD-2, BSD-4, BSD-8) co-application experiment was performed to evaluate enzyme activities and HM bioavailability in Cd-polluted greenhouse soil. The advantage of BSD co-applications compared to SD application was maintained the stable of pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in soil and was more effective to improve soil organic matter (OM). BSD-8 treatment significantly promoted the uptake of available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium by plants. The immobilization effect of BSD co-applications on Cu, Zn, and Cd was better than SD application. BSD-8 treatment has the best immobilization effect on Cd and the contents of bioavailable Cd was 0.167 mg kg(-1). The optimal enzyme activities of invertase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase were shown in BSD-8 treatment, which were 0.027 mg glucose g(-1) soil h(-1), 88.654 mg NH3-N g(-1) soil h(-1), and 15.766 mu mol PNP g(-1) soil h(-1), respectively. The activities of enzymes also were influenced by soil physicochemical properties and HM bioavailability. BSD-8 treatment was suggested as an appropriate mixing proportion to alleviate soil acidification and salinization, decreasing HM bioavailability and stimulating enzyme activities in Cd-polluted soil.

AB  - Studying the interspecific relationships of exotic species can provide an important theoretical basis for revealing the invasion processes of exotic species, predicting the scope and harm of proliferation, and, subsequently, suggesting reasonable prevention and control measures. Buffalobur (Solanum rostratum Dunal.) is a typical alien invasive plant that causes significant harm in the oasis of the arid region of Xinjiang, being primarily distributed on both sides of the Toutun River and irrigated farmland. Parasitic dodders (Cuscuta australis R. Br.), in addition to phytophagous insects, such as potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)), and cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner)), that fed on the buffalobur plant were observed to be distributed in the field. In order to explore the impact of dodder parasitism and insect feeding on buffalobur invasion, buffalobur was selected as the main research material in this study. The effects of different degrees of parasitism (non-parasitism, mild parasitism, and severe parasitism), different stages of parasitism (non-parasitism, seedling parasitism, flowering parasitism, and fruit parasitism), and different levels of simulated insect feeding (non-parasitism, mild feeding, moderate feeding, and severe feeding) on the growth, development, and competitiveness of buffalobur were studied. The results showed that parasitism from dodders and feeding by phytophagous insects significantly reduced the biomass of buffalobur (p < 0.05), thus inhibiting its growth and development. In addition, the root-shoot ratio of the buffalobur was increased, which influenced its growth-defense strategy. At different degrees of parasitism from dodders and different degrees of feeding by phytophagous insects, the biomass of the buffalobur was decreased. However, parasitism from dodders at different stages reduced the biomass and competitive ability of buffalobur (p < 0.05). Considering that the dodders and phytophagous insects could parasitize and feed not only on buffalobur but also on other crops, they cannot be used for the control of buffalobur.

AB  - Background: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are strongly linked with oxidative stress (OS) generated during the process of sperm cryopreservation. Indeed, cellular damage from ROS has been implicated during sperm cryopreservation which causes deterioration in sperm quality and antioxidant nanoparticles (NPs) have been successful in preventing such damage. The interaction of NPs with sperm cells has been less frequently explored in farm animals.Objective: The present study explored the effect of NP supplementation on sperm ultrastructure, potential interaction with sperm membrane (plasma and acrosome membrane), heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression levels and sperm quality in cryopreserved buck semen.Materials and methods: Thirty-two (32) ejaculates were collected from four (4) adult male bucks and then diluted in Tris-citric acid- fructose-egg yolk (TCFY) extender containing the Zinc-oxide (ZnO) and Selenium (Se) NP treatments (T0: Control; TZn: 0.1 mg/mL ZnO NPs and TSe: 1 mu g/mL Se NPs) after initial evaluation. Diluted semen was packed in 0.25 mL French mini straws and then stored in liquid nitrogen (LN2). Sperm parameters, lipid peroxidation (LPO) profile, sperm head morphology ultrastructural classification under transmission electron microscope (TEM), potential interaction of NPs with sperm membrane and expression of HSP genes were evaluated in the different treatment groups.Results: We found a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of spermatozoa with intact plasma membrane, and intact acrosome in the ZnO (0.1 mg/mL) and Se (1 mu g/mL) NP supplemented groups in comparison to the frozen control group. TEM assessment revealed no internalization of both ZnO and Se NPs into the sperm structure. Few occasional contacts of ZnO NPs with the sperm membrane and a few agglomerates of Se NPs around the area of damaged membranes were visualized. HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA levels were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in the NP supplemented groups in comparison to the control. HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA levels had a strong positive association with sperm motility and a weak to moderate association with other sperm parameters.Conclusions: Current findings indicated that ZnO NPs are more potent than Se NPs in ameliorating peroxidative damages during sperm cryopreservation, increases semen quality parameters possibly by increasing the expression levels of HSP genes in buck semen. Furthermore, NP supplementation may have a potential role in preserving sperm head ultrastructure by acting as an antioxidant and reducing OS during various degrees of cellular insults, which needs to be further explored.

AB  - Kacang goats are small ruminants produced by low-income households in smallholder and farm to reduce poverty and prevent undernutrition. Studies to find a cryopreservation protocol for Kacang goat semen are expected to multiplication of genetically superior animals selected by the paternal lineage. This study evaluated the effect of thawing temperature and supplementation of the green tea extract nanoparticle in skim milk-egg yolk (SM-EY) extender on post-thaw sperm quality of Kacang goat semen. Six ejaculates of Kacang goat were diluted in SM-EY supplemented or not (control group) with 0.001 mg/mL NPs GTE. The diluted semen was packaged with 0.25 mL straws (insemination dose: 60x106 sptz/mL) and cryopreserved. Then, six samples of the control group and NPs GTE groups were thawed at 37 degrees C or 39 degrees C sterile water for 30 s and submitted to sperm quality evaluations. The sperm viability, motility, and intact of the plasma membrane (IPM) were higher (p<0.05) in NPs GTE group than control group. In contrast, the NPs GTE group presented lower (p<0.05) malondialdehyde levels and sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) compared with the control group. The catalase levels were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the control and NPs GTE groups. Thawing at 39 degrees C resulted in higher (p<0.05) sperm viability, motility, and IPM than thawing at 37 degrees C. However, thawing at 39 degrees C group presented lower (p<0.05) malondialdehyde levels compared with thawing at 37 degrees C. SDF and catalase levels were similar (p>0.05) between thawing at 37 degrees C and thawing at 37 degrees C. In conclusion, supplementation of 0.001 mg/mL of NPs GTE in SM-EY extender and thawing temperature of 39 degrees C resulted in a better quality of frozen-thawed Kacang goat semen.

AB  - Social network analysis has developed as a valid technique in animal behaviour; despite an increase in the number of social network research in this field, comparatively few studies have focused on commercial animals. This study investigated a dry breeding sow herd (average = 69) as a model species for identifying socially prominent sows, individuals engaging in significantly higher levels of direct interactions than their conspecifics and socially influential sows, individuals with significantly higher levels of indirect interactions than their conspecifics. Animals were frequently added and removed from the herd during the study, creating a dynamic unstable social environment. In total, 63 h of video observations were obtained over three production cycles. Each production cycle covered 21 days, and behavioural observations occurred on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 20, 21. The social network metrics of degree centrality (number of interactions), betweenness centrality (number of times an individual falls along the shortest path between two individuals) and centralisation (the extent to which a single individual dominates a network) were analysed to assess the stability of aggressive behaviour and preferential associations between production cycles. Preferential associations refer to lying behaviour <1 m from selected partners. Agonistic interactions included biting, thrusting, chasing and displacement behaviour. The results identified subgroup formations within the herd, based upon connectedness. Socially prominent and influential sows were identified within the subgroups, a result unaffected by low centralisation in the preferential association networks and substantial centralisation variance between the aggression networks. Sows quantified as socially prominent in the preferential association and aggression networks did not generally hold this position between production cycles, showing significant changes in degree centrality. Sows also demonstrated inconsistency in social influence in the preferential association networks, again with significant differences in betweenness centrality between production cycles. However, in the aggression networks, betweenness centrality was found to be a stable individual social network metric, with no significant changes in behaviour. Knowledge of the stability of social influence in the aggression networks could improve levels of agonistic interactions as it becomes possible to make predictions of future response to aid and inform intervention or management strategies. These findings highlight betweenness centrality as a powerful alternative tool that extends beyond the traditional methods of analysing dyadic interactions to identify critical animals.

AB  - Hyalomma marginatum Koch is one of the main tick vectors of human and animal tick-borne diseases. The objective of this study was to establish standard procedures for rearing H. marginatum under laboratory conditions. Such laboratory tick populations are required to study acaricide resistance of Hyalomma ticks. In our rearing program, larvae and nymphs were fed on New Zealand white rabbits, whereas adults were fed on sheep. Non-parasitic stages were held at 18 and 28 degrees C to study the effect of temperature on development and survival. In our experiments, H. marginatum ticks have maintained the characteristics of a two-host life cycle. The engorged larvae did not detach and moulted on the rabbit, after which the emerged nymphs continued to feed on the same animal. The life cycle duration of H. marginatum was influenced by temperature, with each non-parasitic stage-i.e., larva and nymph molting-developing faster at 28 than at 18 degrees C; preoviposition and oviposition periods were shorter at 28 than at 18 degrees C. At 18 degrees C, no eggs hatched. The whole cycle from the collection of an engorged field tick until the emergence of second-generation larvae took 189 days. One such tick on average results in 3500 eggs which over time, taking into account the losses at each developmental stage, develop into 1200 adult ticks. Rearing these ticks a second generation therefore could result in millions of larval ticks.

AB  - Endophytic and rhizosphere-competent entomopathogenic fungi (EF) are important plant bodyguards, although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the roles of antibiosis (lethal and sublethal effects), and potential growth compensation (in response to leaf injury) in melon plants exposed to cotton leafworm. Plants were inoculated with one of three EF strains (EAMa 0158-Su Metarhizium brunneum strain or EABb 04/01-Tip and EABb 01/33-Su Beauveria bassiana strains) by either foliar spray, seed dressing or soil drenching and then challenged with either multiple short-term, or single long-term Spodoptera littoralis larval infestation. Endophytic colonization and relative expression of plant defense genes were tracked using molecular techniques alongside evaluation of antibiosis effects on S. littoralis and plant tolerance to larval-induced leaf injuries. Inoculated plants exhibited antibiosis and potential growth compensation in responses to various S. littoralis challenges, which resulted in increased fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll content, number of secondary branches and stem diameter. Furthermore, up-regulation in the relative expression of ethylene (ACO1, ACO3, EIN2, EIN3) and jasmonic acid (LOX2)-related genes were observed, with the endophytic B. bassiana- induction of ethylene and jasmonic acid production being higher in S. littoralis infested plants. Our findings strongly confirm the EF multifunctionality and the involvement of the Endophytic EF triggered melon defensive system induction in the antibiosis and compensatory growth to protect melon plants from pest damage.

AB  - Studies have shown that exogenous thiamine (THI) supplementation can alleviate inflammation and promote rumen epithelial development in goats and cows. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of THI supplementation on LPS-induced inflammation and energy metabolic dysregulation in RECs of goats. Cells were stimulated with either 5 mu g/mL THI for 18 h (THI group) or with 5 mu g/mL LPS for 6 h (LPS group). The CON group was stimulated with DMEM/F-12 medium without THI for 18 h. The LPTH group was pretreated with THI for 18 h, followed by LPS stimulation for 6 h. THI supplementation decreased the ROS content (p < 0.05), as well as the ratios of phosphorylated (p)-p65 to p65 (p < 0.05) and p-AMPK alpha to AMPK alpha (p < 0.05). Interestingly, when the p38 gene was overexpressed in the LPTH group, the ratio of p-p65 to p65 and p-AMPK alpha to AMPK alpha proteins significantly increased, and ATP content decreased (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that THI possesses anti-inflammatory and metabolic-modulatory effects in RECs. The mechanism is largely related to the suppression of the NF-kappa B/p38 MAPK/AMPK signaling pathway. Additionally, we also revealed that THI supplementation can inhibit LPS-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis to protect mitochondrial function in RECs.

AB  - Mitragynine, an indole alkaloid from the plant Mitragyna speciosa (Kratom), has been reported to modify hip-pocampal synaptic transmission. However, the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission modulating synaptic plasticity in mitragynine-induced synaptic changes is still unknown. Here, we determined the role of AMPA-and NMDA glutamate receptors in mitragynine-induced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Male Sprague Dawley rats received either vehicle or mitragynine (10 mg/kg), with or without the AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX (3 mg/kg), or the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg). Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) during baseline, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and long-term potentiation (LTP) were recorded in-vivo in the hippocampal CA1 area of anaesthetised rats. Basal synaptic transmission and LTP were significantly impaired after mitragynine, NBQX, and MK-801 alone, without an effect on PPF. Combined effects suggest a weak functional AMPA-as well as NMDA receptor antagonist action of mitragynine.

AB  - The causes of the neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not completely known. Recent studies have shown that white matter (WM) damage could be more severe and widespread than whole-brain cortical atrophy and that such damage may appear even before the damage to the gray matter (GM). In AD, Amyloid-beta (A beta(42)) and tau proteins could directly affect WM, spreading across brain networks. Since hippocampal atrophy is common in the early phase of disease, it is reasonable to expect that hippocampal volume (HV) might be also related to WM integrity. Our study aimed to evaluate the integrity of the whole-brain WM, through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters, in mild AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) due to AD (with A beta(42) alteration in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) in relation to controls; and possible correlations between those measures and the CSF levels of A beta(42), phosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau) and total tau (t-Tau). We found a widespread WM alteration in the groups, and we also observed correlations between p-Tau and t-Tau with tracts directly linked to mesial temporal lobe (MTL) structures (fornix and hippocampal cingulum). However, linear regressions showed that the HV better explained the variation found in the DTI measures (with weak to moderate effect sizes, explaining from 9% to 31%) than did CSF proteins. In conclusion, we found widespread alterations in WM integrity, particularly in regions commonly affected by the disease in our group of early-stage disease and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, in the statistical models, the HV better predicted the integrity of the MTL tracts than the biomarkers in CSF.

AB  - Zooplankton displays different inducible defenses against invertebrate and vertebrate predators. The response pattern to gape-limited invertebrate predators involves increased somatic growth and offspring body size but delayed maturity and reduced offspring numbers. In contrast to this general pattern, the freshwater model organism Daphnia magna has been reported to exhibit a different response when encountering the gape-limited tadpole shrimp Triops cancriformis. Under laboratory conditions, D. magna showed increased somatic growth, earlier maturation, and an increase in both offspring number and size. We propose here that the discrepancy between the previously observed and the theory-based response patterns against invertebrate predators is due to differences in food availability in the applied laboratory settings and assessed whether the defensive response of D. magna against T. cancriformis is modulated differently by food quantity and quality. We found a strong impact of food quantity and quality on the defense response of D. magna to T. cancriformis kairomones. The prey seem to be able to overcome trade-offs between morphological defense traits and reproductive traits, but distinctly between high food quantity and high food quality. Thereby, reproductive traits were preferred over morphological defenses. Furthermore, the removal of particles from the T. cancriformis-conditioned water caused a defense pattern in D. magna that was consistent with the general response pattern known from other invertebrate predators, thus explaining the described discrepancy to previous studies with T. cancriformis. Our study highlights the importance of assessing food-related effects on predator-prey interactions to understand trophic relationships and food web processes.

AB  - A simple model on volatile organic compound (VOC)-mediated plant-insect interactions is proposed and examined here, when two different classes of herbivorous insects competing for a common resource (plant) in the presence of a specialist carnivorous enemy, which only predates one of the herbivore species. We, particularly, emphasize the impact of VOCs on plant's growth fitness. The system experiences several local and global bifurcations with emergent alternative states for variations in recruitment factors and predation rate. Basin transitions and basin of attractions have provided detail descriptions on the selectivity of the alternative states, when only one of the herbivore species can survive depending on the choice of initial population densities of the interacting species and how it provides a steady growth in plant. Additionally, our results support the concept of competitive exclusion principle in an indirect interspecific competition between the two herbivore types for the common resource, plant.

AB  - This study explores whether molecular hydrogen (H2) administration can alleviate cognitive and immunological disturbances in a mouse model of vascular dementia (VaD). Adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent bilateral common carotid artery stenosis to induce VaD and were subsequently assigned to three groups: VaD, VaD with hydrogen-rich water treatment (VaD + H2), and Sham controls. Behavioral assessments using open field and novel object recognition tests revealed that VaD mice exhibited anxiety-deficient behavior and memory impairment, both of which were reversed by H2 treatment. Histological examinations showed pyknotic neuronal morphologies and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the VaD hippocampus, whereas H2 administration mitigated these alterations. Furthermore, VaD-induced downregulation of BCL2 was reversed in the VaD + H2 group, in parallel with increased IL-4 expression. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that VaD disrupted T regulatory cell homeostasis by significantly increasing their proportion, an effect reversed by H2 treatment, thereby restoring immunological balance. Transcriptomic evaluations confirmed that VaD suppressed key neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory genes, while H2 treatment restored or enhanced their expression. Collectively, these findings highlight the neuroprotective and immuno-modulatory potential of molecular hydrogen, suggesting that H2 supplementation may promote neuronal resilience, modulate T cell differentiation, and support cognitive recovery in vascular dementia.

AB  - The effect of simulated physiological oocyte maturation on the developmental competence, reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis rate of in vitro produced goat embryos were studied in the present experiment. Oocytes and spermatozoa were recovered from ovaries and epididymis, respectively, procured from a local small animal abattoir. The oocytes aspirated from the ovaries were allocated into two groups, control (subjected to routine in vitro maturation, fertilization and culture) and simulated physiological oocyte maturation (SPOM) group (subjected to prematuration, followed by routine in vitro maturation, fertilization and culture). The SPOM group showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher maturation and blastocyst rates (90.60 +/- 0.46% and 29.09 +/- 2.59%, respectively) as compared to the control group (85.29 +/- 0.98% and 24.09 +/- 1.08%). The intensity of reactive oxygen species of the embryos in the control group (14.98 +/- 0.83 pixels/embryo) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the SPOM group (9.60 +/- 0.76 pixels/embryo). The apoptosis rate was also significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the embryos of the control group (9.18 +/- 1.07%) as compared to the SPOM group (5.71 +/- 0.90%). In conclusion, the simulated physiological oocyte maturation system significantly increases the developmental competence of the oocytes and decreases the intensity of reactive oxygen species and embryonic apoptosis in abattoir derived goat embryos.

AB  - High-power, high-brightness laser lighting technology put forward new requirements for the service stability of color conversion materials. Phosphor-in-glass materials (PiGs) have emerged with their unique advantages of withstanding high power excitation density. High luminous efficiency (LE) and high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) LuAG:Ce PiG is still an urgent demand for high power laser lighting conversion materials. In this paper, LuAG:Ce PiGs was successfully prepared by careful design of glass matrix composition. The maximum internal quantum efficiency of LuAG:Ce PiG is 93.8%. The conversion efficiency (CE) of LuAG:Ce PiG from blue to green light is increased to 56.3%. The luminous efficiency (LE) even reaches 225 lm W-1 , which is the best performance of LuAG:Ce in LD lighting so far.

AB  - Estrogens affect dopamine-dependent diseases/behavior and have rapid effects on dopamine release and receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Low levels of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and ER beta are seen in the NAc, which cannot account for the rapid effects of estrogens in this region. G-protein coupled ER 1 (GPER1) is observed at low levels in the NAc shell, which also likely does not account for the array of estrogens' effects in this region. Prior studies demonstrated membrane-associated ERs in the dorsal striatum; these experiments extend those findings to the NAc core and shell. Single- and dual-immunolabeling electron microscopy determined whether ER alpha, ER beta, and GPER1 are at extranuclear sites in the NAc core and shell and whether ER alpha and GPER1 were localized to catecholaminergic or gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons. All three ERs are observed, almost exclusively, at extranuclear sites in the NAc, and similarly distributed in the core and shell. ER alpha, ER beta, and GPER1 are primarily in axons and axon terminals suggesting that estrogens affect transmission in the NAc via presynaptic mechanisms. About 10% of these receptors are found on glia. A small proportion of ER alpha and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic terminals, suggesting that binding at these ERs alters release of catecholamines, including dopamine. A larger proportion of ER alpha and GPER1 are localized to GABAergic dendrites and terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter GABAergic transmission to indirectly affect dopamine transmission in the NAc. Thus, the localization of ERs could account for the rapid effects of estrogen in the NAc.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites are crucial in affecting the interactions between insect herbivores and entomoviruses. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the impact of such metabolites on the susceptibility of insect herbivores to entomoviruses. In this study, we adopted the allicin, caterpillars (Spodoptera exigua) and nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) as a system, and found that allicin significantly increased the mortality of S. exigua larvae infected with SeMNPV by 36.03-59.45% when infected with the virus at a concentration of 2.12 x 10(3) OB<middle dot>mL(-1). Furthermore, NPV-infected larvae together treated with allicin inhibited the growth and development of larvae, comparing to individual NPV-infected larvae. Notably, we observed a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes involved in the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism pathway between the NPV-infected and allicin combined with NPV-treated groups. The silencing of CYP340AA1 through RNA interference significantly increased the mortality of larvae infected with SeMNPV. This investigation indicates that allicin might be a potential candidate for improving the performance of the NPV against insect herbivores and identifies that CYP340AA1 gene is important in this process.

AB  - The outcome of cardiac arrest is worse when there is fever after spontaneous circulation is restored (ROSC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of post-ROSC cardiac dysfunction after hyperthermia treatment and the effects of temperature control. Twenty-four male Bama minipigs were randomized into 3 groups (8 per group): CPR + controlled normothermia (CN), CPR + hyperthermia (HT), and CPR + therapeutic mild hypothermia (TMH). Defibrillation was given to pigs with ventricular fibrillation after 8 min of untreated fibrillation. Subsequently, these animals received the post-ROSC treatments of hyperthermia (38 degrees C), controlled normothermia (37 degrees C) or hypothermia (33 degrees C) according to the groups. Hemodynamic parameters, left ventricular ejection fraction, blood samples and myocardial tissues were assessed. At 24 h after the post-ROSC treatments, the pigs treated with hyperthermia showed increments in heart rate and plasma cardiac troponin I, and decreases in mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, and left ventricular ejection fraction, compared to those with the controlled normothermia pigs. However, the deterioration of the above parameters can be attenuated by TMH. The pigs in the TMH group also had a reduced percentage of apoptotic cardiomyocytes, an increased antiapoptotic Bcl-2/Bax ratio and a decreased caspase-3 activity in myocardium, as compared with both controlled normothermia and hyperthermia pigs. In conclusion, hyperthermia is associated with a worse myocardial dysfunction. TMH improves hyperthermia-induced myocardial dysfunction by attenuating apoptosis in a porcine model of cardiac arrest.

AB  - The molecular diversity of glia in the human hippocampus and their temporal dynamics over the lifespan remain largely unknown. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to generate a transcriptome atlas of the human hippocampus across the postnatal lifespan. Detailed analyses of astrocytes, oligodendro-cyte lineages, and microglia identified subpopulations with distinct molecular signatures and revealed their association with specific physiological functions, age-dependent changes in abundance, and disease rele-vance. We further characterized spatiotemporal heterogeneity of GFAP-enriched astrocyte subpopulations in the hippocampal formation using immunohistology. Leveraging glial subpopulation classifications as a reference map, we revealed the diversity of glia differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells and identi-fied dysregulated genes and pathological processes in specific glial subpopulations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Together, our study significantly extends our understanding of human glial diversity, population dy-namics across the postnatal lifespan, and dysregulation in AD and provides a reference atlas for stem -cell-based glial differentiation.

AB  - Foot ulceration annually affects millions of patients and accounts for billions of dollars in medical expenses in the US alone. Many previous studies have investigated co-morbidities associated with impaired healing, such as microbial infection, compromised circulation, and diabetes. By comparison, little is known about how wound healing proceeds in plantar skin, despite its many unique specializations related to its load-bearing function. One of the main challenges in modeling plantar wounds is the difficulty in maintaining wound dressings, as animals generally have a low tolerance to wearing bandages on their feet. With assistance from the MGH Center for Comparative Medicine, we developed a positive reinforcement-based behavioral training regimen that successfully induced tolerance for plantar dressings in swine, which is a critical first step towards enabling in vivo study of the wound healing process in this highly specialized skin area. This training program will be described in detail in this manuscript.

AB  - Altitudinal distributions, population structures and seasonal dynamics of tick fauna at three localities in Continental Croatia (Medvednica and Papuk) and an alpine biogeographic region (Gorski Kotar) were studied. Sampling of questing ticks was performed twice a year (spring and autumn, from 2019 to 2021) at different altitudes (200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 m above sea level) using the flagging method. In total, 2942 ticks (53.9% larvae, 40.1% nymphs, 6.0% adults) were sampled and 2937 (99.83%) were determined as Ixodes ricinus, 4 (0.14%) as Haemaphysalis concinna and 1 (0.03%) as Ixodes frontalis. Ixodes ricinus was the only species found at all altitudes and sampling sites. The highest tick abundance was recorded at higher altitudes (800-1000 m asl.) on Medvednica and in Gorski Kotar within mixed forests of European beech and European silver fir, while on Papuk most of the ticks were sampled at lower altitudes (200 m asl.) in Sessile oak forest. From 27 pools containing 305 ticks, 1 (3.7%) was positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infection. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. was detected in 20% (1/5) of the pools containing nymphs and adults collected in Gorski Kotar (600 and 800 m asl.). Sequencing of the ospA gene and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto genotype.

AB  - Captive conditions can affect the symbiotic microbiome of animals. In this study, we compared the structural and functional differences of the gastrointestinal microbiomes of wild Bactrian camels (Camelus ferus) between wild and captive populations, as well as their different host energy utilization performances through metagenomics. The results showed that wild-living camels harbored more microbial taxa related to the production of volatile fatty acids, fewer methanogens, and fewer genes encoding enzymes involved in methanogenesis, leading to higher energy utilization efficiency compared to that of captive-living camels. These findings suggest that the wild-living camel fecal microbiome demonstrates a series of adaptive characteristics that enable the host to adjust to a relatively barren field environment. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of wildlife adaptations to habitats from the perspective of the microbiome.

AB  - Characterization of ancient food remains could reflect how people exploited biological resources and interacted with different cultures in antiquity. In this study, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), starch grain, phytolith, stable isotope analysis and proteomics were adopted to characterize the composition of the food remains including three cereal foodstuffs, some meat strips and a kebab discovered at the Changle Cemetery (202 BCE-220 CE), Ningxia, northwest China, a key area on the Silk Road. The results show that the cereal foods were baked cakes, primarily made from foxtail millet (Setaria italica). One cake was simply made of millet grains, the others were more elaborately comprised of millet flour with the addition of barley flour and meat from cattle (Bos taurus) and chicken (Gallus gallus). These findings indicate that grinding and baking technologies, which were considered as the culinary tradition in western Eurasia, had been adopted at the latest by the inhabitants in Ningxia region at that time. The large-scale migration from central China to Ningxia and the opening up of the Silk Road during the Han Dynasty gave rise to the diet communication and assimilation in this border area. Moreover, the meat strips were identified as dried beef, and the kebab was likely to be made from sheep/goat meat, wherein the latter is the earliest scientific evidence of mutton kebab in ancient China up to our knowledge. The analytical strategy could be widely applied in characterizing ancient visible food remains in order to better understand their preparation methods.

AB  - The prenatal environment critically influences sow and offspring health, with the liver being highly susceptible to heat stress (HS) and vital for antioxidant defense. However, mechanisms underlying HS impacts on early pregnancy and hepatic adaptation remain unclear. This study applied multi-omics to analyze chronic HS responses in early-pregnancy sows. Results demonstrated that HS reduced blood oxygen (PO2) and basophils while elevating red blood cell parameters (RBC, HGB, and HCT). Endocrine disruptions included upregulated adrenal hormones (ACTH and cortisol) and suppressed thyroid (T3 and TSH) and reproductive hormones (LH1 and FSH). Liver dysfunction was evident through elevated biomarkers (AST, ALT, and TBIL) and pro-inflammatory IL-6, coupled with reduced anti-inflammatory IL-10. HS induced oxidative stress, marked by increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) but decreased SOD and MDA levels. Liver tissue exhibited apoptosis (Bax/CD8 upregulated and Bcl-2 downregulated) and upregulated heat shock proteins (HSP70/90). Multi-omics analysis demonstrated that under heat stress conditions, the pyrimidine metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and tryptophan metabolism pathways were significantly upregulated in the liver. This upregulation may be mediated by key metabolites, including AMP, NAD, and UMP. These metabolites likely contribute to the body's adaptation to heat stress. Chronic HS impaired liver function and anti-inflammatory responses but triggered compensatory antioxidant and metabolic reprogramming. These findings underscore the liver's dual characteristics of vulnerability and resilience under high-temperature stress, offering valuable mechanistic insights that can inform strategies to enhance heat tolerance in pregnant sows.

AB  - Maize is an important cereal crop worldwide. In Mexico, both hybrid and native genotypes are grown. Insect herbivory, mainly by the larvae of Spodoptera frugierda L, impose significant yield losses. Developing pest control strategies using natural enemies in an agroecological approach offers an environmentally sound alternative to minimise the input of pesticides in maize agroecosystems. Campoletis sonorensis is a native parasitoid that has shown significant control efficiency on S. frugiperda in the field, but many aspects of its ecology are largely unknown. In a controlled greenhouse experiment, we investigated the biocontrol efficacy of C. sonorensis in S. frugiperda feeding on four maize genotypes (two landraces and two hybrids). Our main results showed that maize genotype significantly affected C. sonorensis parasitism of S. frugiperda and consequently damage from herbivory. C. sonorensis diminished herbivore damage in all studied maize genotypes, and this effect was strongest in the maize hybrid PUMA. Our results show that the biocontrol efficacy of C. sonorensis against S. frugiperda is affected by the maize genotype, which should be further examined under field conditions.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) in many places have a significant impact on wildlife management and road safety. The COVID-19 lockdown enabled the study of the specific impact that traffic has on these events. WVC variation in the Asturias and Cantabria regions (NW of Spain) because of the COVID-19 lockdown reached a maximum reduction of -64.77% during strict confinement but it was minimal or nonexistent during "soft" confinement. The global average value was -30.22% compared with the WVCs registered in the same period in 2019, but only -4.69% considering the average throughout the period 2010-2019. There are huge differences between conventional roads, where the traffic reduction was greater, and highways, where the traffic reduction was lesser during the COVID-19 lockdown. The results depend on the season, the day of the week and the time of day, but mainly on the traffic reduction occurring. The results obtained highlight the need to include the traffic factor in WVC reduction strategies.

AB  - Eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes Kollar (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), colonies forage from multiple wood and soil sources in a temperate climate. Thus, access to all nutrients may not be consistent throughout the year due to seasonal temperature changes. This study examined the changes in levels of protein, lipids, carbohydrates (simple sugars and glycogen), and amino acids in workers and soldiers during four different time intervals of the year (spring, early summer, late summer, and fall) when termites would be actively foraging. Workers and soldiers did show differences in nutrient levels and in both castes, levels of all nutrients did change seasonally. Based on the results of this study, both castes increase levels of protein, carbohydrates, and lipids as winter approaches. These findings suggest that termite soldiers may act as repletes for the colony.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe southwestern United States is home to a variety of arthropods including Turkestan cockroaches, Blatta lateralis (Walker); hematophagous kissing bugs, Tritoma rubida (Uhler); and Arizona bark scorpions, Centruroides sculpturatus Ewing. These arthropods cause medical concern when they become established around homes and/or invade indoors. Traditionally, the management of these pests has relied primarily on the use of chemical insecticides; however, they offer poor prospects for control owing to their lack of efficacy as well as the effects of insecticides on humans and the environment. Botanical repellents are an option that has not been fully investigated for the management of these pests. Here, we investigated the behavioral responses of common urban pests of the southwestern USA to recently discovered coconut fatty acids (CFAs), to establish the potential use of these compounds as repellents. RESULTSFresh residues of CFA mixture (CFAm) and their constituents caprylic acid, capric acid, capric acid methyl ester, lauric acid, and lauric acid methyl ester, tested at a concentration of 1 mg cm(-2), strongly repelled all arthropods. The repellent activity of CFAm lasted for at least 7 days, and the addition of lavender oil, used as an odor-masking agent, did not decrease this effect. Concentrations of CFAm ten times lower (0.1 mg cm(-2)) still repelled Turkestan cockroaches, and concentrations 100 times lower (0.01 mg cm(-2)) repelled T. rubida and scorpions. CONCLUSIONSCFAm and some of their constituents are efficacious, economical, and logistically feasible for inclusion in integrated pest management programs for these important urban pests of the southwestern USA.

AB  - The treatment of pregnant ewes with persistent macrocyclic lactone (ML) anthelmintic products is common in some countries, with the intent of alleviating the potential negative impacts of gastrointestinal nematode parasites on production, health and welfare. However, some MLs such as moxidectin, are lipophilic compounds that can cross the placenta, and many are secreted into colostrum and milk, yet the effect of MLs on neonatal lamb behaviour remains unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prenatal administration of persistent ML anthelmintics on the behaviour of ewes and their new-born lambs. Sixty mixed-age pregnant twin-bearing ewes were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 20/group): 1) administered a subcutaneous injection containing moxidectin 2-3 weeks prior to lambing (MOX), 2) administered one controlled-release capsule containing abamectin and albendazole 2-3 weeks prior to lambing (CRC), and 3) a control group that was not treated or handled other than routine care (CON). The ewes were housed indoors 4 weeks before parturition was expected to commence and remained in the same pens (n = 2 ewes / treatment) until 1 week after lambing. Behaviour of the ewes and lambs was monitored continuously using security cameras positioned above each pen. Ewe and lamb behaviour was evaluated for 3 h after parturition. Ewe grooming of the lamb, and lamb head shaking, standing, udder seeking and suckling behaviour was assessed using Cox Proportional hazard models. There was no evidence that abamectin (and albendazole) affected ewe or lamb behaviour (P > 0.10). Neonatal lambs from ewes administered moxidectin tended to be slower to shake their heads after parturition (hazard ratio: 0.65; P = 0.08), and were slower to attempt to stand (hazard ratio: 0.61; P = 0.05) compared with lambs from control ewes. These are the first known data to indicate changes in neonatal lamb behaviour associated with anthelmintic treatment of their dam. Further research is required to validate these findings and understand whether the delayed neonatal lamb behavioural development associated with moxidectin has implications for lamb vigour or survivability.

AB  - The potential of N and P recovering from digestate by means of its precipitation in the form of struvite is evident. However, it is necessary to optimise the process at a larger scale, to achieve results that can be extrapolated to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of the process at an industrial scale. In this work, batch and pilot plant tests were carried out in order to consolidate, at a sufficiently relevant scale, the results obtained at lab scale. For this purpose, the parameters that have the greatest effect on the reaction yield in a fludised bed reactor were selected (Mg and P concentration, flow rate of the fluidising agent (air) and reaction time). Digestate produced in anaerobic digestion plant from pig manure was used as raw material. According to the results obtained, for the struvite crystallisation reaction, the great operational levels for the Mg/P, N/P, air flow rate and reaction time are 1.5, 4.0, 6.0 NL.min(-1) and 0.5 h, respectively. Finally, a study was carried out to establish the agronomic potential of the salt (struvite) as a biofertiliser in the turf crop, obtaining a similar behaviour of the struvite used in this work to that of commercial struvite.

AB  - Exposure to severe, uncontrollable and long-lasting stress is a strong risk factor for the development of numerous mental and somatic disorders. Animal studies document that chronic stress can alter neuronal morphology and functioning in limbic brain structures such as the prefrontal cortex. Mitochondria are intracellular powerhouses generating chemical energy for biochemical reactions of the cell. Recent findings document that chronic stress can lead to changes in mitochondrial function and metabolism. Here, we studied putative mitochondrial damage in response to chronic stress in neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex. We performed a systematic quantitative ultrastructural analysis to examine the consequences of 9-weeks of chronic mild stress on mitochondria number and morphology in the infralimbic cortex of adult male rats. In this preliminary study, we analyzed 4,250 electron microscopic images and 67000 mitochondria were counted and examined in the brains of 4 control and 4 stressed rats. We found significantly reduced number of mitochondria in the infralimbic cortex of the stressed animals, but we could not detect any significant alteration in mitochondrial morphology. These data support the concept that prolonged stress can lead to mitochondrial loss. This in turn may result in impaired energy production. Reduced cellular energy may sensitize the neurons to additional injuries and may eventually trigger the development of psychopathologies.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of adding alpha lipoic acid (ALA) to the vitrification solution of sheep ovarian tissue on 7 days of in vitro culture or 15 days of xenotransplantion. ALA was used at two different concentrations (100 mu M: ALA100 and 150 mu M: ALA150). Ovarian tissue was evaluated by classical histology (follicular morphology, development, and stromal cell density); immunohistochemistry for forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a); Ki67 (cell proliferation); cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31); and alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in ovarian tissue, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite levels in the culture medium, were assessed. Similar percentage of morphologically normal follicles was found in the vitrified ovarian tissue in the presence of ALA100 or ALA150 after in vitro culture or xenotransplantation. Follicular development from all treatments was higher (P < 0.05) than the control group. Moreover, an activation of primordial follicles was observed by FOXO3a. Stromal cell density and immunostaining for Ki67 and CD31 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in ALA150 vitrified tissue. No difference (P > 0.05) was found in alpha-SMA between ALA concentrations after in vitro culture or xenograft. ROS levels in the ovarian tissue were similar (P > 0.05) in all treatments, as well as MDA and nitrite levels after 7 days of culture. We concluded that the addition of ALA 150 is able to better preserve the stromal cell density favoring granulosa cell proliferation and neovascularization.

AB  - A 10-month-old pygmy goat was examined at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies at the University of Edinburgh in January 2022, having been referred with a suspected diagnosis of a disorder of sexual development (DSD). The animal displayed a predominantly female phenotype (vulva with enlarged clitoris and vagina) but some male external characteristics such as a beard, larger body size, and larger horns. It also typically exhibits male behaviours such as mounting, aggression, and flehmen response. Computed tomography (CT) detected a bicornuated tubular fluid-filled structure connected to bulbous soft tissue masses. Subsequent exploratory laparotomy and reproductive tract removal identified underdeveloped uterine horns connected to ductus deferens and gonads, which were confirmed as testicles by histological examination. No spermatogenesis was detected, and no ovarian tissue was apparent. Blood levels of testosterone showed a marked decrease post-surgery (2.10 nmol/L to <0.03 nmol/L). Whole genome sequencing suggested that the patient may have an XY male karyotype, although cytological analysis was not possible to confirm the XY karyotype.

AB  - In the present study, findings regarding parasites discovered in a white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus peruvianus, captured in the dry forest of the Paccha district, Chota province, Cajamarca department, are reported. The Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre recovered parasites from an adult male specimen and forwarded them to the Tropical Medicine Research Center at the Universidad Nacional de Cajamarca for taxonomic identification of helminths and arthropods, as well as coproparasitological analysis. Two metacestodes corresponding to Cysticercus tenuicollis were identified. Qualitative coproparasitological analyses revealed Nematodirus spp. eggs at a concentration of 10 eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and 40 EPG of Strongylid type that could not be differentiated due to low counts in the coproculture. No trematode eggs were detected in the sedimentation. Among ectoparasites, eight hard ticks Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and five sucking lice Solenopotes binipilosus were identified. Several specimens were deposited in the Museo de Historia Natural de la Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima. These findings represent the first formal report of the common cattle tick in this subspecies of cervid. Additionally, the presence of the Solenopotes binipilosus louse in Peruvian territory is reported for the first time.

AB  - Superovulation is a common approach to maximize the number of eggs available for either clinical assisted reproductive technologies or experimental animal studies. This procedure provides supraphysiological amounts of gonadotropins to promote continued growth and maturation of ovarian follicles that otherwise would undergo atresia. There is evidence in mice, cows, sheep, and humans that superovulation has a detrimental impact on the quality of the resulting ovulated eggs or embryos. Here we tested the hypothesis that eggs derived from superovulation have a reduced capacity to support calcium oscillations, which are a critical factor in the success of embryo development. Eggs were obtained from mice that were either naturally cycling or underwent a standard superovulation protocol. The eggs were either parthenogenetically activated using strontium or fertilized in vitro while undergoing monitoring of calcium oscillatory patterns. Following parthenogenetic activation, superovulated eggs had a slightly delayed onset and longer duration of the first calcium transient, but no differences in oscillation persistence, frequency, or total calcium signal. However, in vitro fertilized superovulated eggs had no differences in any of these measures of calcium oscillatory behavior relative to spontaneously ovulated eggs. These findings indicate that although subtle differences in calcium signaling can be detected following parthenogenetic activation, superovulation does not disrupt physiological calcium signaling at fertilization, supporting the use of this method for both clinical and experimental purposes.

AB  - Empoasca onukii is a major pest that attacks tea plants. To seek effective and sustainable methods to control the pest, it is necessary to assess its host preference among different species of tea and understand the critical factors behind this behavior. In this study, the behavioral preference of E. onukii for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of three potted tea species was evaluated. The VOCs released by the three tea species were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the major components were used to test the pest's preference. Transcriptome analysis was used to infer the key genes that affect the biosyntheses of the VOCs. The results showed that the tendency of E. onukii toward the VOCs of the three tea species was the strongest in green tea, followed by white tea, and the weakest in red tea. This behavioral preference was significantly and positively correlated with the relative levels of hexanol, linalool, and geraniol in tea volatiles. Relative hexanol was significantly and positively correlated with the expression of genes TEA009423 (LOX2.1), TEA009596 (LOX1.5), TEA008699 (HPL), TEA018669 (CYPADH), and TEA015686 (ADHIII). Relative linalool was significantly and positively correlated with the expression of genes TEA001435 (CAD) and Camellia_sinensis_newGene_22126 (TPS). Relative geraniol was significantly and positively correlated with the expression of genes TEA001435 (CAD), TEA002658 (CYP76B6), TEA025455 (CYP76T24), and Camellia_sinensis_newGene_22126 (TPS). The above findings suggested that three volatiles (hexanol, linalool, and geraniol) determined the behavioral preference of E. onukii toward tea plants, and their biosynthesis was mainly affected by nine genes (TEA009423, TEA009596, TEA008699, TEA018669, TEA015686, TEA001435, TEA002658, TEA025455, and Camellia_sinensis_newGene_22126).

AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) serves as a membrane anchor of numerous cell surface proteins. It is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum from phosphatidylinositol (PI) by stepwise reactions and transferred to the C terminus of the protein. Defects in genes involved in GPI biosynthesis affect the expression of GPI-anchored proteins or their structure, causing the neurological disorder, inherited GPI deficiency. Individuals with ARV1 deficiency have symptoms resembling inherited GPI deficiency, but how ARV1 regulates GPI biosynthesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that ARV1 acts as a component of the enzyme initiating GPI biosynthesis, GPI N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, which forms a ring structure as predicted by AlphaFold3. ARV1 associates with PIGQ, a GPI-GnT component, and ARV1 mutants defective in this association lose their ability to enhance GPI-GnT activity, showing that association with PIGQ is critical for ARV1's function. ARV1-containing GPI-GnT used PI more efficiently than ARV1-less GPI-GnT in an in vitro enzyme assay. Collectively, our results suggest that ARV1 facilitates efficient recruitment of PI to GPI-GnT, thereby playing a critical role in the regulation of GPI-anchored protein expression.

AB  - Termite feeding on the trunk cross-sections of Araucaria cunninghamii in Taipei, Taiwan, was examined using 2D stress wave imaging (FAKOPP system). Six inspections were conducted at 2-month intervals to monitor six trees. 2D cross-sectional stress wave velocity images were created at different heights (30-180 cm) to assess termite feeding damage. Termite damage, quantified as damage ratio (DR, %), ranged from 0% to 55% across different trees and heights, with maximum increases of up to 21% in DR observed over a 2-month period. In the investigated cases, termites primarily fed on the interior of tree trunks. The feeding pattern typically extended longitudinally, then proceeded in a tangential (circular) direction, and finally moved radially. This study identified Coptotermes formosanus as a key termite species involved. Typically, termites prioritized feeding on the earlywood over the latewood. The periods with the highest damage to trunk cross-sections due to termite feeding occurred during seasons with higher temperatures and relative humidity. Damage initially appeared near the heartwood or the boundary between the heartwood and sapwood, gradually expanding into the heartwood. Of the six trees monitored for the full study duration (after one tree was felled for validation), subterranean termite tunneling was observed as the primary pattern in three trees, while aerial swarm invasion patterns were inferred for two trees based on initial damage locations.

AB  - Antioxidants help safeguard sperm cells from damage during the freeze-thaw process. Melatonin and its metabolites have an antioxidative effect. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of melatonin supplementation in tris-based extenders at various concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2 mM) on the freezability of Jamnapari goat spermatozoa. A total of 48 ejaculates were collected twice a week from four Jamnapari bucks (n = 12 x 4) using an artificial vagina during the period of October to November 2023. Selected ejaculates diluted with tris-citric acid egg yolk extender were divided into four equal aliquots, and melatonin (dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added later at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mM to the control group (C) (extender and 0.1% DMSO) and treatment groups T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Various seminal attributes such as progressive motility, livability, acrosomal integrity, sperm abnormalities, sperm plasma membrane integrity, sperm penetration distance by vanguard spermatozoa in polyacrylamide gel and seminal plasma enzyme leakage (AST, ALT, ACP and AKP) were evaluated at post-dilution and post-thawed stages. Our findings revealed that all semen quality parameters were superior in melatonin-treated groups than the C, and the differences were noticeably higher in the T2 group (1.0 mM) than the other groups. Adding 1.0 mM melatonin proved to be the most effective to safeguard sperm cells from cryopreservation induced cryodamage of Jamnapari buck.

AB  - Breast cancer is an unusual mass of the breast texture. It begins with an abnormal change in cell structure. This disease may increase uncontrollably and affects neighboring textures. Early diagnosis of this cancer (abnormal cell changes) can help definitively treat it. Also, prevention of this cancer can help to decrease the high cost of medical caring for breast cancer patients. In recent years, the computer-aided technique is an important active field for automatic cancer detection. In this study, an automatic breast tumor diagnosis system is introduced. An improved Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (DHOA) is used as the optimization algorithm. The presented method utilized a hybrid feature-based technique and a new optimized convolutional neural network (CNN). Simulations are applied to the DCE-MRI dataset based on some performance indexes. The novel contribution of this paper is to apply the preprocessing stage to simplifying the classification. Besides, we used a new metaheuristic algorithm. Also, the feature extraction by Haralick texture and local binary pattern (LBP) is recommended. Due to the obtained results, the accuracy of this method is 98.89%, which represents the high potential and efficiency of this method.

AB  - Antioxidant activity (AOA) is an important indicator of the evaluation of plant raw materials (RM), which are widely used in medicine to obtain various medicines. The use of RM at the present stage of the pharmaceutical industry development allows avoiding large-scale production of synthetic medicines, accompanied by a negative impact on the environment. For an objective assessment of AOA, it is necessary to apply methods that allow determining not only the content of the active substance, but also generally characterizing the functional activity of RM. The article presents data on the AOA of aqueous extracts from the leaves and fruits of Hippophae rhamnoides L., Aronia melanocarpa L. The determination of antioxidant activity was performed by biochemiluminiscence (B & Scy;HL) using serum from white mongrel rats as a model environment (M & IEcy;). The evaluation criteria were the maximum intensity (I-max) and the light sum of the glow (S). The results obtained were compared with the data of the analysis of BCHL without ME, as well as with the data of alternative methods for quantifying the antioxidant potential of RM (coulometric titration, direct titration, spectrophotometry). According to the criteria for assessing the intensity of free radical oxidation (I-max) using the BCHL method without ME, it was found that aqueous extracts from the leaves and fruits ofA. A. melanocarpa, , as well as H. rhamnoides leaves, have a high antioxidant potential (343, 274 and 268 mV, respectively), and from H. rhamnoides fruits - more short. BCHL results showed that the amount of radicals in blood serum decreased upon contact with extracts from vegetable raw materials. Among the studied samples, extracts from the fruits of A. melanocarpa were characterized by the highest AOA (S=2006 +/- 137 mV<middle dot>s). At the same time, according to alternative methods, they occupy an intermediate position in terms of the quantitative content of biologically active substances (BAS) with antioxidant properties. Based on the weak correlation between the data of the B & Scy;HL method and alternative methods for determining AOA, it is concluded that it is necessary to take into account the possibility of an indirect relationship between the content of BAS in RM and the effect manifested in conditions as close as possible to biological systems. The measurement of AOA by the B & Scy;HL method is actually an assessment of the function, as well as the effectiveness of BAS, and complements quantitative methods for assessing the antioxidant activity of ME.

AB  - Endometritis is a common and important reproductive disease of domestic animals. The principal factors responsible for the disease are infection with Gram-negative bacteria, the release of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and activation of the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. However, we do not fully understand the interaction between endometrial immunity and bacterial infection in the disease etiology. The ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 can regulate the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway via the ISGylation modification system, modulating the inflammatory response. In the present study, we found that ISG15 protein was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm of goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs) and that the expression of key genes and proteins of ISGylation increased in LPS-induced gEECs. Overexpression and silencing of the ISG15 gene demonstrated that ISGylation inhibited an LPS-induced inflammatory response via the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in gEECs. Here, we provide the experimental basis for further exploration of the role of the ISGylation modification system in the inflammatory response of endometrium and a potential method for the treatment of endometritis.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is the primary cause of joint impairment, particularly in the knee. The prevalence of OA has significantly increased, with knee OA being a major contributor whose pathogenesis remains unknown. Articular cartilage and the synovium play critical roles in OA, but extracting high-quality RNA from these tissues is challenging because of the high extracellular matrix content and low cellularity. This study aimed to identify the most suitable RNA isolation method for obtaining high-quality RNA from microquantities of guinea pig cartilage and synovial tissues, a relevant model for idiopathic OA. We compared the traditional TRIzol (R) method with modifications to spin column-based methods (TRIspinisolation protocol was developed to increase RNA yield and purity. The procedure involved meticulous sample collection, specialized tissue processing, and measures to minimize RNA degradation. RNA quality was assessed via spectrophotometry and RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that among the tested methods, the Quick-RNATM Miniprep Plus kit with proteinase K treatment yielded the highest RNA purity, with A260:280 ratios ranging from 1.9 to 2.0 and A260:230 ratios between 1.6 and 2.0, indicating minimal to no salt contamination and RNA concentrations up to 240 ng/mu L from -20 mg of tissue. The preparation, storage, homogenization process, and choice of RNA isolation method are all critical factors in obtaining high-purity RNA from guinea pig cartilage and synovial tissues. Our developed protocol significantly enhances RNA quality and purity from micro-quantities of tissue, making it particularly effective for RT-qPCR in resource-limited settings. Further refinements can potentially increase RNA yield and purity, but this protocol facilitates accurate gene expression analyses, contributing to a better understanding of OA pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Pyrolysis converts nutrient-rich residues (e.g., sewage sludge and manures) into biochar with low levels of organic contaminants and high nutrient contents. However, the availability of phosphorus (P) as one of the key nutrients in such biochar tends to be low and new approaches are needed to enhance P-availability. In this work we tested and optimised one such method, doping biomass prior to pyrolysis with potassium (K) as potassium acetate. The treatment worked effectively in both pyrolysis units tested (microscale and lab-scale, continuous unit) and all three feedstocks (two types of sewage sludges and swine manure). The most dramatic effect was observed in the microscale pyrolysis unit at 400 ? where 5% K doping increased the water-extractable P content 700-fold to 43% of total P. Of the added K, on average 90% was retained in biochar after pyrolysis of which-50% was water-extractable. The proposed method enables conversion of low-value residues into valuable resources with agronomically relevant total and available P and K levels. This approach does not require specialised equipment or process modifications and is therefore easy to implement and relatively cheap (-US$ 60-80 t(-1) treated feedstock). It can present an urgently required solution to fulfil regulatory requirements for P-recovery.

AB  - Prenatal hyperhomocysteinemia (HCY) is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits, yet its long-term impact on hippocampal synaptic function remains poorly understood. This study examines the effects of moderate maternal HCY on excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus in rat offspring at juvenile (P21) and adult (P90) stages. Using field postsynaptic potential (fPSP) recordings, electron microscopy, and Western blot analysis, we observed a significant age-dependent decline in the efficiency of excitatory synaptic transmission in HCY-exposed rats. Electron microscopy revealed structural alterations, including synaptic vesicle agglutination in the stratum radiatum, suggesting impaired neurotransmitter release. Additionally, a significant reduction in pyramidal neuron density was observed in the CA1 region, although seizure susceptibility remained unchanged. Western blot analysis showed altered expression of Synapsin I, indicating presynaptic dysfunction. These findings suggest that moderate prenatal HCY leads to persistent deficits in synaptic transmission and structural integrity, potentially contributing to cognitive impairments in adulthood. Our results highlight the importance of maternal homocysteine levels in shaping hippocampal function and could offer insights into neurodevelopmental disorders associated with metabolic disturbances.

AB  - To solve the technical problem that wheeled vehicles are prone to skidding on complex ground, due to poor adhesion performance, a tire-tread-structure design method based on the bionic principle is proposed in this paper. The 3D model of a goat's foot was obtained using reverse engineering technology, and the curve equation was fitted by extracting the contour data of its outer-hoof flap edge, which was applied to the tire-tread-structure design. The bionic and herringbone-pattern rubber samples were manufactured, and a soil-tank test was carried out using an electronic universal tensile-testing machine, in order to verify the simulation results. The results showed that the overall adhesion of the bionic tread-pattern was greater than that of the normal tread-pattern with the same load applied and the same height and angle of the tread-pattern structure, and the maximum adhesion was increased by 14.23%. This research will provide a reference for optimizing the pattern structure and thus improving the passing performance of wheeled vehicles.

AB  - Plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) is recognised for its ability to improve summer feed productivity as well as mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from grazed pastoral soils. This study aims to determine the proportion of plantain required in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.), or RWC, mixed swards to maintain yield stability and to quantify N2O emission reductions. The botanical composition was monitored when plantain was sown at different rates of 0%, 30%, 50% and 70% in RWC pastures under grazing by dairy cows over 2 grazing years. Urine from cows grazing RWC (6.15 g N L-1), 30% (5.40 g N L-1) and 50% (4.40 g N L-1) plantain mixed pastures was used to measure N2O emissions (n = 5) from the pastures of their origin and to assess the impact of the plantain rhizosphere on N2O emissions by applying the RWC urine to the 50% plantain mixed pasture, and vice versa, in late summer-autumn using the static chambers technique. After declining in spring, the plantain content recovered in early autumn and reached a peak of 40% in the 30% plantain mixed pasture and around 50% in the 50% and 70% plantain mixed pastures in winter. A lower N content in urine, and therefore a lower urine N-loading rate from cows grazing in the 50% plantain mixed pasture, resulted in 39% lower total N2O emissions compared to RWC urine treatment. In conclusion, 30% to 50% plantain in mixed pastures was stable throughout the 2 years, and it not only reduced the urinary N concentration in grazing cattle but also contributed to reduced N2O EFs.

AB  - Trichinellosis is a zoonosis with worldwide distribution. Several hosts have been recognized around the world; however, there is a lack of knowledge of the role of feral mammals in Chile in its transmission. Herein, we tested muscle samples from 555 individuals among American minks (Neovison vison Schreber, 1777. n = 100) and several myomorph rodent species (Muridae and Cricetidae. n = 455) from southern Chile by artificial digestion to detect Trichinella larvae and identified the larvae at the species level through molecular analyses. Rodents were captured in agricultural and wild protected areas of several administrative regions (hereafter: region), while minks were captured in agricultural areas of the Los Rios region. Trichinella spiralis larvae were detected in a synanthropic black rat (0.24%) of the Nuble region and in seven minks (7%) trapped in agricultural areas of the Los Rios region. The present results suggest that T. spiralis circulation is restricted to synanthropic rodents and minks living in agricultural areas where the parasite circulates among domesticated pigs. This study represents the first record of T. spiralis in a mustelid mammal in South America, increasing the number of feral species that could participate in the reservoir.

AB  - High concentrations of pesticides and toxic metal pollutants in the environment, often present in surface waters in nature, can accumulate in wild animals and are a significant public health concern. Serbia is a moderately developed, south European country in transition, with a long tradition in agriculture, particularly in the northern part, Vojvodina. Our study aimed to assess the presence of pesticides and to measure concentrations of toxic metals in the district of Backi Petrovac, Vojvodina. Water samples were analyzed from canals, ditches, fish from the canals and wild animals caught in the Backi Petrovac district. We identified nine pesticides in water samples. Of all detected pesticides, one was a hormonal disruptor. There were no pesticides in animals, fish and organs in a concentration above the limit of detection (LOD) in observed periods. The concentrations of toxic metals detected in superficial water (Cd, Pb, Hg, As, Mn, Cu) were below the permitted limits, as well as the concentrations of Cd, Pb, Hg, As and Mn in the whole bodies of fish. Concentrations in kidneys and livers of wild animals (rabbit and roe deer) were below the permitted limits, with the exception of cadmium, whose concentrations in some animal samples were above the permitted limit. Based on the obtained results, we concluded that in the developed agricultural region unencumbered by heavy industry, pollution by pesticides and heavy metals can be controlled.

AB  - The aim of this experiment is to evaluate the effects of adding porous zinc oxide, plant polyphenols, and their combination to diets without antibiotics and high-dose zinc oxide on the growth performance, diarrhea incidence, intestinal morphology, and microbial diversity of weaned piglets. A total of 150 Duroc x Landrace x Large White weaned piglets were allocated to one of five diets in a randomized complete block design with six replicates and five piglets per replicate. The experimental period was 42 d, divided into two feeding stages: pre-starter (0-14 d) and starter (14-42 d). In the pre-starter stage, the negative control group (NC) was fed a basal diet, the positive control group (PC) was fed a basal diet with 2000 mg/kg of zinc oxide, the porous zinc oxide group (PZ) was fed a basal diet with 500 mg/kg of porous zinc oxide, the plant polyphenol group (PP) was fed a basal diet with 1500 mg/kg of plant polyphenols, and the combination group (PZ + PP) was fed a basal diet with 500 mg/kg of porous zinc oxide and 1500 mg/kg of plant polyphenols. In the starter stage, the NC, PC, and PZ groups were fed a basal diet, while the PP and PZ + PP groups were fed a basal diet with 1000 mg/kg of plant polyphenols. The results showed that, (1) compared with the PZ group, adding plant polyphenols to the diet showed a trend of increasing the ADFI of weaned piglets from 14 to 28 d (p = 0.099). From days 28 to 42 and days 0 to 42, porous zinc oxide and the combination of porous zinc oxide and plant polyphenols added to the control diet improved the FCR to the level observed in pigs fed the PC diet. (2) Dietary PZ + PP tended to increase the jejunal villus height (VH) of weaned piglets (p = 0.055), and significantly increased the villus-height-to-crypt-depth ratio compared to the NC group (p < 0.05). (3) Compared with the NC group, PZ supplementation decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, and the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the PZ and PZ + PP groups were both increased. In conclusion, porous zinc oxide and plant polyphenols may have synergistic effects in modulating intestinal health in weaned piglets and be a potential alternative to high-dose zinc oxide.

AB  - Temperature is the main environmental determinant of seed oil fatty acid Q9 composition. There are no models describing common responses of main seed oil fatty acids to temperature in plants. The aim of thus work was to investigate common responses of seed oil fatty acids to minimum temperature during grain filling across species and genotypes. A database consisted of 164 genotypes of 9 species, sunflower, rapeseed, soybean, maize, flax, chia, safflower, olive and camelia, grown under a wide range of environmental conditions, was created and analyzed applying meta phenomics tools. Four widely sown species of the database was used to develop several common seed fatty acid responses and validate some models, and the other species were used to validate the General Model. The minimum temperature during grain filling responses of fatty acids in the General Model were close to responses found in genotypes of five independent species used to validate the model. Dissections of the general model by selecting the appropriate data allowed unraveling previously unknown features of the response of fatty acid to the minimum temperature during grain filling. The response of fatty acids to temperature for any species was unaffected by experimental conditions (field or controlled conditions) during the oil synthesis stage. The oleic acid trait did not affect the response to temperature of fatty acids synthesized downstream and upstream of it. Traits such as high stearic or high linoleic did not affect the response of fatty acids synthesized upstream or downstream of the trait. The established models and new knowledge could be applied to design cost effective and timely experiments to assess the potential responses of seed oil fatty acids to temperature of previously untested genotypes.

AB  - The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) still requires strategies through which to maximize individual fertility chances. In vitro folliculogenesis (ivF) may represent a valid option to convey the large source of immature oocytes in ART. Several efforts have been made to set up ivF cultural protocols in medium-sized mammals, starting with the identification of the most suitable gonadotropic stimulus. In this study, Equine Chorionic Gonadotropin (eCG) is proposed as an alternative to Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) based on its long superovulation use, trans-species validation, long half-life, and low costs. The use of 3D ivF on single-ovine preantral (PA) follicles allowed us to compare the hormonal effects and to validate their influence under two different cultural conditions. The use of eCG helped to stimulate the in vitro growth of ovine PA follicles by maximizing its influence under FBS-free medium. Higher performance of follicular growth, antrum formation, steroidogenic activity and gap junction marker expression were recorded. In addition, eCG, promoted a positive effect on the germinal compartment, leading to a higher incidence of meiotic competent oocytes. These findings should help to widen the use of eCG to ivF as a valid and largely available hormonal support enabling a synchronized in vitro follicle and oocyte development.

AB  - Studies using large animal models are essential for better understanding the molecular processes underlying neurological diseases, including ischemic stroke, and serve as a robust foundation for evaluating potential therapies. To better understand the complex role of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) after ischemia, we aimed to determine their expression in the porcine brain affected by ischemic stroke at four time points: 6 h, 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post-stroke. Within the first 24 h after the stroke, we observed the increased expression of several key factors, including calcium-binding proteins, peroxiredoxins, heat shock proteins and interleukins (1 alpha and 1 beta, IL10, IL17 alpha). Moreover, by day 7, multiple DAMPs were up-regulated, coinciding with an enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in the affected hemisphere. The effects of ischemic stroke were also evident systemically, as indicated by the altered serum levels of both pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins, reflecting dynamic inflammatory response. To conclude, our findings provide new insights about the time-dependent DAMP activity in a large animal model of ischemic stroke, highlighting the simultaneous occurrence of an ongoing inflammatory response and the possible initiation of vascular remodeling as early as one week after stroke onset.

AB  - Simple Summary Saccharin sodium (SS) is one of the commonly used artificial sweeteners (AS) in the food industry, but the mechanisms mediating the physiological effects of sweeteners in the gut-brain axis is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the regulatory effect of SS on the microbiota-gut-hypothalamus axis on guinea pigs. We found that SS treatment may alter the growth and glucose metabolism of guinea pigs by activating sweet receptor signaling in the gut and growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) hormone secretion. Besides, SS treatment increased the abundance of Firmicutes and Lactobacillasceae-Lactobacillus in the ileum, and subsequently increased levels of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Adding 1.5 mM SS to drinking water alters the growth of guinea pigs by regulating the microbiota-hypothalamus-gut axis. This conclusion has theoretical implications for the comprehensive assessment of the biological effects of appropriate SS in the food industry. The effects of saccharin, as a type of sweetener additive, on the metabolism and development of mammals are still controversial. Our previous research revealed that saccharin sodium (SS) promoted the feed intake and growth of guinea pigs. In this experiment, we used the guinea pig model to study the physiological effect of SS in the microbiota-gut-hypothalamus axis. Adding 1.5 mM SS to drinking water increased the serum level of glucose, followed by the improvement in the morphology and barrier function of the ileal villus, such as SS supplementation which increased the villus height and villus height/crypt depth ratio. Saccharin sodium (SS) treatment activated the sweet receptor signaling in the ileum and altered GHRP hormone secretion. In the hypothalamus of SS and control (CN) group, RNA-seq identified 1370 differently expressed genes (796 upregulated, 574 downregulated), enriching into the taste signaling transduction, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. LEfSe analysis suggested that Lactobacillaceae-Lactobacillus was the microbe with significantly increased abundance of ileum microorganisms in the SS-treated group, while Brevinema-Andersonii and Erysipelotrichaceae-Ilebacterium were the microbes with significantly increased abundance of the control. Furthermore, SS treatment significantly enhanced the functions of chemoheterotrophy and fermentation of ileal microflora compared to the CN group. Accordingly, SS treatment increased levels of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid and N-valeric acid) in the ileal digesta. In summary, drinking water with 1.5 mM SS activated sweet receptor signaling in the gut and altered GHRP hormone secretion, followed by the taste signaling transduction in the hypothalamus.

AB  - The first detailed description of Ancylotherium pentelicum (Gaudry and Lartet, 1856) from the late Miocene (Turolian) of Kerassia (Greece) is provided based on three metapodial elements. Potential intraspecific variability of this species in the Eastern Mediterranean has been previously discussed, but no decisive conclusions could be drawn. The present comparison of metapodial elements of A. pentelicum from Kerassia, Pikermi, Samos (Greece), Pinaryaka, Salihpasalar (Turkey), Kiro Kuchuk (North Macedonia), and Hadjidimovo (Bulgaria) provides evidence for the existence of notable intraspecific variation in both the morphology and especially the size of the species. The morphological differences in the shape and occurrence of some metapodial articular facets are probably associated with the anticipated individual variability and not with sexual dimorphism. On the other hand, the notable metrical variability observed among metapodials of A. pentelicum may be indicative of sexual dimorphism, as has been previously documented in other chalicotherfids.

AB  - Quantifying the variation of pathogens' life history traits in multiple host systems is crucial to understand their transmission dynamics. It is particularly important for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), which are prone to infecting several species of vertebrate hosts. Here, we focus on how host-pathogen interactions determine the ability of host species to transmit a virus to susceptible vectors upon a potentially infectious contact. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral, vector-borne, zoonotic disease, chosen as a case study. The relative contributions of livestock species to RVFV transmission has not been previously quantified. To estimate their potential to transmit the virus over the course of their infection, we 1) fitted a within-host model to viral RNA and infectious virus measures, obtained daily from infected lambs, calves, and young goats, 2) estimated the relationship between vertebrate host infectious titers and probability to infect mosquitoes, and 3) estimated the net infectiousness of each host species over the duration of their infectious periods, taking into account different survival outcomes for lambs. Our results indicate that the efficiency of viral replication, along with the lifespan of infectious particles, could be sources of heterogeneity between hosts. Given available data on RVFV competent vectors, we found that, for similar infectious titers, infection rates in the Aedes genus were on average higher than in the Culex genus. Consequently, for Aedes-mediated infections, we estimated the net infectiousness of lambs to be 2.93 (median) and 3.65 times higher than that of calves and goats, respectively. In lambs, we estimated the overall infectiousness to be 1.93 times higher in individuals which eventually died from the infection than in those recovering. Beyond infectiousness, the relative contributions of host species to transmission depend on local ecological factors, including relative abundances and vector host-feeding preferences. Quantifying these contributions will ultimately help design efficient, targeted, surveillance and vaccination strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary The profit production of the pig industry is fundamentally influenced by the functioning of fatteners' digestive systems. Diseases that damage any section of the intestine reduce the intensity of nutrient absorption and worsen the economy of production. Ileitis is one of the most important and widely spread enteric diseases. Economic losses due to ileitis have been estimated at USD 4.65 per fattening pig, with American pig farmers losing USD 56.1 million annually. Currently, as there is no monitoring tool at the slaughterhouse to evaluate these losses, it has become necessary to develop an ileitis monitoring tool that is inexpensive, simple, fast, sensitive and provides immediate results. The method developed is similar to lung lesion scoring tools and can be performed at slaughterhouses. The results of the procedure are correlated with the results of other laboratory diagnostic tests for ileitis. The results can provide an immediate interpretation of the status of ileitis. Background: Ileitis is a wasting disease of pigs. Clinical symptoms are diarrhea in growing pigs, wasting and reduced performance. Ileitis is ubiquitous in pig producing countries all around the world. It is estimated that the economic losses caused by the disease are USD 4.65 per fattening pig, and American pig farmers lose USD 56.1 million annually. It has become necessary to develop a slaughterhouse ileitis monitoring method that is simple, feasible to perform at modern slaughter lines, leads to immediate results and is cost effective. The practical experiences of applying the method are presented below. Methods: Our studies were performed on pig herds and slaughterhouses in Central European countries (Hungary, Romania, Poland, Croatia, and Slovakia). Experiences were evaluated based on visual and palpation. The results of our investigations were evaluated by a scoring method. Authors made histological and immunohistochemical examinations of investigated ileums. The hypothetic economic losses due to the disease in each farm were determined by estimating the loss of profit according to Holtkamp's presentation in 2019. Results: The essentials of the method we have developed are: it can be performed during slaughterhouse processing, it does not interfere with or make it impossible to carry out normal technological processes, and the results of the procedure are correlated with the results of other laboratory diagnostic tests for ileitis (histology, immunohistochemistry, herd serology, fecal PCR). It is noteworthy that the results of the method can be used to immediately estimate the impact of Lawsonia intracellularis infection on the performance of the herd from which the slaughter animals come. Conclusion: Using the results of the slaughtered pigs' visual and tactile examination at the slaughterhouse, the magnitude of the loss caused by Lawsonia intracellularis infection can be estimated quickly and accurately, and the return on investment of the strategy to be applied can be accurately planned.

AB  - Sardinia, located in Italy, is a significant producer of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) sheep cheeses. In response to the growing demand for high-quality, safe, and traceable food products, the elemental fingerprints of Pecorino Romano PDO and Pecorino Sardo PDO were determined on 200 samples of cheese using validated, inductively coupled plasma methods. The aim of this study was to collect data for food authentication studies, evaluate nutritional and safety aspects, and verify the influence of cheesemaking technology and seasonality on elemental fingerprints. According to European regulations, one 100 g serving of both cheeses provides over 30% of the recommended dietary allowance for calcium, sodium, zinc, selenium, and phosphorus, and over 15% of the recommended dietary intake for copper and magnesium. Toxic elements, such as Cd, As, Hg, and Pb, were frequently not quantified or measured at concentrations of toxicological interest. Linear discriminant analysis was used to discriminate between the two types of pecorino cheese with an accuracy of over 95%. The cheese-making process affects the elemental fingerprint, which can be used for authentication purposes. Seasonal variations in several elements have been observed and discussed.

AB  - The present study was designed to establish a suitable alternative approach to mitigate the adverse effect of high culture temperature on in vitro embryo development and the related molecular response in buffalo. Pre-cultured granulosa cells (GCs) were used as a monolayer during in vitro embryo culture until day 8 (day of fertilization = D0). Post fertilization, presumptive embryos were randomly assigned into two culture conditions: embryos cultured in the presence of GCs monolayer under normal culture temperature (N: 38.5 degrees C; GEN group) or heat shock (H: 40.5 degrees C; GEH group) and their counterpart groups of embryos cultured without GCs (EN and EH groups). Additionally, two groups of GCs monolayer were cultured without embryos up to day 8 under 38.5 degrees C (GN) or 40.5 degrees C (GH) for further spent culture media enzymatic analyses. Heat shock was administered for the first 2 h of culture then continued at 38.5 degrees C until day 8. The results indicated that under heat treatment, GCs enhanced (P <= 0.05) embryo cleavage and development (day 8) rates, which were comparable to the embryos cultured at 38.5 degrees C. On the molecular level, blastocysts of the GEH group showed similar expressions of metabolism-regulating genes (CPT2 and SlC2A1/GLUT1) and an antioxidant gene (SOD2) when compared to the blastocysts of the EN group. The relative expression of HSP90 was significantly up-regulated under heat shock and/or co-culture conditions. However, HSF1 expression was increased (P <= 0.05) in the GEH group. No statistical differences were observed among the study groups for the pluripotency gene NANOG, and stress resistance transcript NFE2L2. Regarding the enzymatic profile, the concentrations of SOD, total protein, and MDA were decreased (P <= 0.05) in the GEH group compared to the cultured GCs without embryos (GH group). In conclusion, GCs as a monolayer have a beneficial impact on alleviating heat stress at the zygote stage through the regulatory mechanisms of metabolic activity, defense system, and heat shock response genes.

AB  - Gene-edited pigs for agricultural and biomedical applications are typically generated using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, SCNT requires the use of monoclonal cells as donors, and the time-consuming and laborious monoclonal selection process limits the production of large populations of gene-edited animals. Here, we developed a rapid and efficient method named RE-DSRNP (reporter RNA enriched dual-sgRNA/CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins) for generating gene-edited donor cells. RE-DSRNP takes advantage of the precise and efficient editing features of dual-sgRNA and the high editing efficiency, low off-target effects, transgene-free nature, and low cytotoxic characteristics of reporter RNA enriched RNPs (CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins), thus eliminating the need for the selection of monoclonal cells and thereby greatly reducing the generation time of donor cells from 3-4 weeks to 1 week, while also reducing the extent of apoptosis and chromosomal aneuploidy of donor cells. We applied RE-DSRNP to produce cloned pigs bearing a deletion edit of the wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) gene: among 32 weaned cloned pigs, 31 (97%) carried WIP1 edits, and 15 (47%) were homozygous for the designed fragment deletion, and no off-target event was detected. The WIP1 knockout (KO) pigs exhibited male reproductive disorders, illustrating the utility of RE-DSRNP for rapidly generating precisely edited animals for functional genomics and disease research. RE-DSRNP's strong editing performance in a large animal and its marked reduction in the required time for producing SCNT donor cells support its application prospects for rapidly generating populations of transgene-free cloned animals.

AB  - The goal of this study is to describe the cyanolichen Peltigera praetex-tata ontogenesis stages and reveal some of their morphological, anatomical, and phys-iological features.This paper analyzes 300 P. praetextata thalli taken in 2019 from aspen trunks in the aspen-spruce communities of the middle taiga territory in Kivach Nature Reserve (62 degrees 15'15.9''N, 33 degrees 58'746.1''E) from permanent sample plots. The authors determined the ontogenetic state of each thallus based on morphology and anatomy data using the concept of a discrete approach to the description of ontogenesis (Suetina, 2001). They registered the following thalli parameters: length, width, presence and length of rhizines, presence and width of veins, presence of phyllidia and apothecia, number of notches and lobes, shape, edge curl, and surface tomentum. They studied the anatomi-cal parameters (thallus total thickness, tomentum thickness, cortical layer, algal layer and medulla thickness, algae cell size) using sections of thalli samples in all ontoge-netic states from the apical, medial, and basal parts in triplicate. They measured the content of photosynthetic pigments spectrophotometrically with preparation of alco-holic extracts. To assess the parameters of the water regime of thalli having different ontogenetic states, the authors calculated a specific thallus mass (STM) and water holding capacity (WHC). They made a statistical data measurement using one-way ANOVA and regression analysis. They also calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) to assess the variability of the features under study.The study identified four periods and 12 ontogenetic states of P. praetextata: latent (sp), pre-generative (pr, prt, j, im1, im2, im3, v1, v2), generative (g), and post-generative (ss, s). The values of the morphological and anatomical parameters of the thalli increase during their development. The early ontogenesis stages demonstrate the highest variabil-ity of the parameters. The highest variability of the thallus structures under study within the ontogenetic states is registered for the rhizine length, vein width, and medulla thick-ness, while the highest constancy is typical of the share of the algal layer in the thallus that varies within a very limited range (22-32%) and reaches the minimum values in the post-generative period. The mycobiont increases in volume through a medulla growth. The physiological characteristics of the P. praetextata thalli differ in various ontogenetic states, while the generative thalli characterized by a normal ratio of photosynthetic pig-ments, maximum water saturation, and maximum water holding capacity have the max-imum values. Thus, at early development stages, the thalli demonstrate a lower ability to retain moisture and may represent a critical stage in a lichen life cycle. On the one hand, the revealed wide variability of the morphological and anatomical parameters of young thalli testifies to their high adaptability, but the physiological parameters of water satura-tion indicate the vulnerability of these stages. These parameters confirm the validity of the ontogenetic stages identified.

AB  - Ichthyoplankton samples were collected monthly at 2 stations in Massachusetts Bay from 2008 to 2012 and from 2015 to 2022 to characterize the larval fish assemblage for this area. The fauna was composed of 2 major assemblages that were 87% dissimilar from each other and associated with season and water temperature. A cold- water assemblage of low density (43.26 larvae/1000 m3) occurred from November through May at mean water column temperatures between 4.1 degrees C and 10.3 degrees C, with sand lances (Ammodytes spp.) the dominant taxon as a group. A warm- water assemblage of higher density (432.58 larvae/1000 m3) occurred from June through October at mean water column temperatures between 12.3 degrees C and 16.1 degrees C, with the silver hake (Mer- luccius bilinearis) the dominant taxon. Within the cold- water assemblage, statistically distinct groups occurred in November, December-March, and April-May. The Atlantic herring (Clu- pea harengus), sand lances, and the American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) were the dominant taxa in those periods, respectively. Within the warmwater assemblage, statistically distinct groups occurred in June- August and September-October, with the cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) and true hakes as a group (Urophycis spp.) the dominant taxa in those periods, respectively. Water temperature explained 28% of the annual variation in the cold- water assemblage, and there was no significant relationship between temperature and annual variation in the warmwater assemblage. This larval fish characterization provides a baseline against which potential changes in the assemblages in this area can be measured.

AB  - Numerous factors influence insect colonization and development on decomposing remains and can influence postmortem interval (PMI) estimations when insects are used in investigations of suspicious deaths. This study aimed to determine whether insect repellent influences insect colonization of decomposing remains. Pig feet were divided into 4 groups: a control not sprayed with repellent, 40% DEET repellent, 98% DEET repellent, and lemon eucalyptus repellent. The feet were placed in containers, and insect visitation was observed over the course of 3 days, then insects were collected at the end of the third day. This was repeated twice a month from April through November 2022. The analysis focused on the order Diptera. Pairwise comparison determined that there was a significant delay in visitation time for remains with 98% DEET compared to remains with no repellent and 40% DEET. There were significantly fewer adult Diptera collected and more remains with no larvae or eggs present among remains treated with 98% DEET. It was concluded that low concentrations of DEET and lemon eucalyptus repellent did not delay colonization, but that high concentrations of DEET delayed visitation, reduced the number of adult flies collected from the remains, and reduced the likelihood of collecting eggs or larvae from the remains. This contributes to the understanding of factors that can influence insect colonization and development that allow for more accurate PMI estimations by suggesting that insect repellent does not need to be accounted for in PMI estimation, but a high concentration of DEET can deter insects in the short term.

AB  - Prediction of future ice-sheet behavior in Antarctica and its contribution to sea-level rise depends on accurate understanding of ice-sheet response to a warm climate. Examination of how the ice sheet reacted to past warm episodes affords a means of assessing its tolerances to climate change. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), in particular, is thought to be highly susceptible to variations in ocean temperature at its grounding lines. Yet, detailed records of past ocean temperatures close to the conti-nent are rare. Here, we present a record of past relative ocean-temperature and sea-ice change derived from the presence and then eventual abandonment of southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) occupation sites along the Victoria Land Coast (VLC) of the western Ross Embayment. Our results suggest greatly reduced landfast and likely pack ice, as well as potentially the incursion of relatively warm modified Circum-Polar Deep Water from-7100 to 500 yr BP, with the greatest reduction in ice/warmest water temperatures at-5200 and-2300-1800 yr BP. These changes in ocean conditions would have had a strong influence on VLC marine-terminating glaciers through variations in buttressing sea ice and melt rates on the underside of floating ice. Independent data suggest that these glaciers had restricted extent in the mid-Holocene, consistent with our inference of warm ocean temperatures and low sea ice. The glaciers subsequently expanded within the last millennium, coincident with the disappearance of southern elephant seals from the coast and the inferred return to icy conditions. Our relative sea-ice and ocean-temperature reconstruction also is consistent with the hypothesized retreat of the WAIS inland of its present position in the mid to late Holocene, although the distance between our sites and the current WAIS grounding lines is large (600-1000 km), and thus any linkage is speculative at present. Finally, limited pre-Holocene southern elephant seal data support the existence of warm ocean temperatures immediately prior to and perhaps even during build-up to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ice position. If this could be confirmed, it would suggest that factors other than ocean temperatures, such as lowered sea level, might have been critical in causing ice-sheet advance in the Ross Embayment at the LGM.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary The microbiota present in cheese is of special interest as it contributes to the synthesis of different compounds related to cheese quality and safety. However, to date, no studies have been carried out in cheese to elucidate the relationship between bacterial communities, characterized by high-throughput sequencing (HTS), and the dynamics of gross composition, free fatty acids (FFAs) and biogenic amines (BAs) during ripening. In this sense, this work focused on Idiazabal PDO cheese, a semi-hard or hard cheese produced from raw ewe milk. Results revealed that the non-starter lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus were positively associated with the changes in gross composition and the release of FFAs, while only Lactobacillus was positively associated with the production of BAs. Several genera of environmental or undesirable bacteria presented negative correlations, which could indicate a negative impact of gross composition on their growth, the antimicrobial effect of FFAs and/or the importance of such FFAs as metabolic substrates for these bacteria, and their capability to degrade BAs. This study reports for the first time the relationship between bacterial succession, characterized by high-throughput sequencing (sequencing of V3-V4 16S rRNA regions), and the evolution of gross composition, free fatty acids (FFAs) and biogenic amines (BAs) during cheese ripening. Specifically, Idiazabal PDO cheese, a raw ewe milk-derived semi-hard o hard cheese, was analysed. Altogether, 8 gross parameters were monitored (pH, dry matter, protein, fat, Ca, Mg, P and NaCl) and 21 FFAs and 8 BAs were detected. The ripening time influenced the concentration of most physico-chemical parameters, whereas the producer mainly affected the gross composition and FFAs. Through an O2PLS approach, the non-starter lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus were reported as positively related to the evolution of gross composition and FFAs release, while only Lactobacillus was positively related to BAs production. Several environmental or non-desirable bacteria showed negative correlations, which could indicate the negative impact of gross composition on their growth, the antimicrobial effect of FFAs and/or the metabolic use of FFAs by these genera, and their ability to degrade BAs. Nonetheless, Obesumbacterium and Chromohalobacter were positively associated with the synthesis of FFAs and BAs, respectively. This research work provides novel information that may contribute to the understanding of possible functional relationships between bacterial communities and the evolution of several cheese quality and safety parameters.

AB  - It remained unknown whether HDAC6 affected the histone deacetylation of in vitro maturation oocytes and the reprogramming of nuclear transplantation in pig. Our results indicated that HDAC6 specific inhibition did not affect overall HDAC activity and meiosis process, which increased histone H3K9/K14 and H4K8 acetylation of porcine in vitro maturation oocytes and pseudo-pronucleus embryos. HDAC6 inhibition also significantly enhanced the cleavage and blastocyst of nuclear transfer embryos (0.81 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.12 and 0.46 +/- 0.19; 0.73 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.18 and 0.40 +/- 0.16, P<0.05). The inhibition of HDAC6 significantly enhanced histone H3K9/K14 and H4K8 acetylation, and upregulated the OCT4 and CDX2 expressions (1.83 +/- 0.16 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.00 %; 2.07 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.00; P<0.05) in porcine SCNT blastocysts. Interestingly, HDAC6 inhibition significantly increased the pseudo-pronucleus volume during somatic cell reprogramming. Thus, HDAC6 was required for porcine histone deacetylation during the in vitro maturation and pseudo-pronucleus stages. HDAC6 inhibition improved the in vitro development of nuclear transfer embryos. HDAC6 may restrict the reprogramming of somatic nuclear transfer by regulating pseudo-pronucleus expansion. We need further research to confirm this in the future.

AB  - Simple Summary The in vitro culture of mammalian embryos lacks different embryotrophic factors that are present in the female reproductive tract and are essential for correcting embryonic development. It has been reported that supplementation with oviductal fluid (OF) and uterine fluid (UF) during the in vitro culture of mammalian embryos produced by IVF has a positive effect on their development and quality. We investigated the effect of OF-UF supplementation on the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), and the development of cloned and parthenogenetic Ovis aries embryos. However, at concentrations of 1 and 2% OF-UF, the blastocyst rate decreased in both groups of embryos. At a concentration of 1% OF-UF, both intracellular ROS and GSH decreased in the blastocysts of parthenogenetic embryos but not in cloned embryos. In cloned sheep embryos, OF-UF had no impact on the embryonic development or redox balance.Abstract Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has great potential for the replication of high-commercial-value animals, threatened wild species for conservation purposes, and transgenic animals for biomedical purposes. However, SCNT has a low success rate due to intrinsic factors of the technique itself, which leads to low rates of embryonic development and epigenetic alterations in cloned embryos. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of OF-UF on the intracellular concentrations of ROS and GSH and the development of cloned and parthenogenetic Ovis aries embryos. The results do not show a beneficial effect on the development of parthenogenetic and cloned embryos at concentrations of 0.5% OF-UF. Furthermore, at 1% OF-UF, an adverse effect was observed in cloned embryos at the blastocyst stage and 2% OF and UF in parthenogenetic embryos during the first divisions. Decreases in ROS and GSH levels were observed in the parthenogenetic blastocysts treated with 1% OF-UF, but not in the clones, in which a higher concentration of GSH and a similar concentration of ROS were observed. No effect of OF-UF was observed on embryonic development and redox balance in sheep embryos cloned via handmade cloning.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of feeding type on selected quality parameters and the nutritional characteristics of pork fat. Fats were extracted by using the modified Folch method from the groin, jowl and trimming shoulder of pigs fed two types of diets: liquid and dry. The peroxide values and fatty acid profiles, as well as their distribution, in the triacylglycerol molecules were determined. Additionally, nutritional indexes and thermal properties, including the oxidative stability of pork fat, were assessed. Among the tested fats, the groin fat was characterized by the best oxidative stability which did not depend on the diet type used. In the case of jowl and trimming shoulder, a higher share of monounsaturated fatty acids was determined in fats of pigs fed a liquid diet, whereas in the groin, jowl and trimming shoulder fats of pigs fed dry feed, a higher share of polyunsaturated fatty acids was found. Fats extracted from the groin, jowl and trimming shoulder of pigs fed a liquid diet showed a more favorable ratio of n-6 to n-3 acids. Despite the different feeding systems used, tested fats were characterized by a similar distribution of fatty acids in triacylglycerol molecules with a positive effect on fat digestibility. It is worth emphasizing that especially in the case of trimming shoulder fat, the influence of a diet used in pigs' nutrition on quality parameters was noticeable. The trimming shoulder fat of pigs fed a liquid diet was characterized by a longer induction time of oxidation, contained less saturated fatty acids and presented a more favorable fatty acid profile with a beneficial distribution of fatty acids in triacylglycerol molecules.

AB  - Plant-plant signalling via volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in response to insect herbivory has been widely studied, but its occurrence and specificity in response to pathogen attack has received much less attention. To fill this gap, we carried out a greenhouse experiment using two fungal pathogens (Fusarium solani and Phytophthora infestans) to test for specificity in VOC induction and signalling between potato plants (Solanum tuberosum). We paired potato plants in plastic cages, one acting as VOC emitter and the other as receiver, and subjected emitters to one of the following treatments: no infection (control), infected by F. solani, or infected by P. infestans. We measured total emission and composition of VOCs released by emitter plants to test for pathogen-specificity in VOC induction, and then conducted a pathogen infection bioassay to assess resistance levels on receiver plants by subjecting half of the receivers of each emitter treatment to F. solani infection and the other half to P. infestans infection. This allowed us to test for specificity in plant VOC signalling by comparing its effects on conspecific and heterospecific sequential infections. Results showed that infection by neither F. solani or P. infestans produced quantitative (total emissions) or qualitative (compositional) changes in VOC emissions. Mirroring these patterns, emitter infection treatment (control vs. pathogen infection) did not produce a significant change in pathogen infection levels on receiver plants in any case (i.e., either for conspecific or heterospecific sequential infections), indicating a lack of signalling effects which precluded pathogen-based specificity in signalling. We discuss possible mechanisms for lack of pathogen effects on VOC emissions and call for future work testing for pathogen specificity in plant-plant signalling and its implications for plant-pathogen interactions under ecologically relevant scenarios involving infections by multiple pathogens.

AB  - Based on the hypothesis that the variation of the metabolomes of latex is a response to selective pressure and should thus be affected differently from other organs, their variation could provide an insight into the defensive chemical selection of plants. Metabolic profiling was used to compare tissues of three Euphorbia species collected in diverse regions. The metabolic variation of latexes was much more limited than that of other organs. In all the species, the levels of polyisoprenes and terpenes were found to be much higher in latexes than in leaves and roots of the corresponding plants. Polyisoprenes were observed to physically delay the contact of pathogens with plant tissues and their growth. A secondary barrier composed of terpenes in latex and in particular, 24-methylenecycloartanol, exhibited antifungal activity. These results added to the well-known role of enzymes also present in latexes, show that these are part of a cooperative defense system comprising biochemical and physical elements.

AB  - Success of animal cloning is limited by oocyte quality, which is closely linked to reprogramming ability. The number of layers of cumulus cells is typically used to assess the quality of oocyte; a minimum of one-third of collected cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) are discarded as inferior oocytes because they have less cumulus cells. Melatonin, which has been recognised for its ability to sequester free radicals and perform multiple functions, has emerged as a potentially effective candidate for enhancing inferior oocytes quality and, consequently, embryo development competency. The current study investigates to improve the quality of inferior oocytes by supplementation of melatonin (10(-9) M) during in vitro maturation (IVM) and subsequent cloned embryo production and its mechanism. The results indicate that melatonin supplementation significantly (p<0.05) enhances inferior oocytes maturation, reduces oxidative stress by reducing ROS levels, and improves mitochondrial function by boosting GSH levels. The melatonin treatment (10(-9) M) enhances the expression of SOD, GPx1, GDF 9, BMP 15, ATPase 6, and ATPase 8 in inferior oocytes. Furthermore, melatonin treatment increases the total cell number in the treated groups, promoting cloned blastocyst formation rates derived from inferior oocytes. Furthermore, compared to the control, 10(-9) M melatonin supplementation enhances H3K9ac acetylation and lowers H3K27me3 methylation in cloned blastocysts derived from inferior oocytes. In conclusion, 10(-9) M melatonin supplementation during IVM increased inferior oocyte maturation and promoted cloned buffalo embryo development by lowering oxidative stress and promoting epigenetic alterations. These studies show that melatonin may improve the quality of poor oocytes and buffalo cloning.

AB  - ortho-Nitroaniline (o-NA) compounds are deemed to be a strongly toxic pollutant in nature and potentially carcinogenic; however, they are frequently utilized to synthesize dyes, pesticides, medicines, fungicides, pig-ments, and other organic chemicals. Their detection in an aqueous medium is fundamentally required to avoid the potential hazardous being created by these compounds. In this study, a novel sensor based on an Iron oxide (Fe3O4) containing highly dispersed nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs@Fe3O4 NFs) was demon-strated for the electrochemical detection of o-NA using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic vol-tammetry (CV) techniques. N-CQDs@Fe3O4 NFs were synthesized by hydrothermal method and studied by various analytical and spectroscopy techniques, which collectively reveal that the as-prepared composite has superior physical and chemical properties. The DPV study indicated that the o-NA sensor had a good limit of detection, linear range, and sensitivity in the range of 1.2 nm, 0.03-386.84 mu M, and 36.5575 mu A mu M-1 cm-2, respectively, along with the sensor showed superior sensitivity when compared to the previously reported modified electrodes. Further, N-CQD/Fe3O4 NFs worked as heterogeneous catalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of o-NA to o-phenylenediamine (o-PD) in an aqueous medium. The reaction was examined under UV-Visible spectroscopy, and the complete photocatalytic reduction was observed for the N-CQD/Fe3O4 NFs in about 6 min with 96% as compared to other control samples; thus, authenticating the superiority of the syn-thesized composite in rendering the real-time applications.

AB  - Interferon-gamma (IFNG) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by the porcine conceptus (embryo and extra-embryonic membranes) during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. IFNG modifies the endometrial inflammatory immune response and is required for the implantation and survival of the conceptus. It is not known how IFNG from the conceptus trophectoderm is transported across the endometrial luminal epithelium (LE). In the present study, immunofluorescence analyses detected immunoreactive IFNG protein in both the trophectoderm and endometrial LE on Day 15 of pregnancy, while our previous research localized IFNG mRNA only to conceptus trophectoderm. Using minced endometrial explants to disrupt the barrier posed by the intact endometrial LE, treatment with recombinant IFNG induced the expression of genes that were not induced when IFNG was infused into the uterine lumen in vivo by McLendon et al. (Biology of Reproduction. 2020;103(5):1018-1029). We hypothesized that during pregnancy extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as intercellular signaling vehicles to transport conceptus-derived IFNG across the intact endometrial LE and into the stromal compartment of the uterus. Western blotting detected the presence of IFNG in EVs isolated from the uterine fluid of pregnant gilts, but not nonpregnant gilts. Real-time PCR demonstrated increased expression of IFNG-stimulated genes in EV-treated endometrial explants and EV-mediated IFNG transport was confirmed in whole uterine sections cultured with EVs from Day 15 of pregnancy. These results suggest that EVs are involved in IFNG transport across the endometrial LE to enable paracrine communication between the conceptus and cells within the endometrial stroma.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is the native economic edible oil tree in China and anthracnose occurs commonly in its producing areas. We previously found that ubiquitin-like CfAtg8-related autophagy is essential for the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola, the major pathogen of anthracnose on C. oleifera. The aim of this study is to further elucidate the roles of autophagy in the pathogenesis of C. fructicola. Based on BLAST_P analysis and reverse genetics, we identified the central hub of another ubiquitin-like system, CfAtg5, and characterized its functions in C. fructicola. As suspected, we found that CfAtg5 is required for autophagy, both in MM-N and H2O2 induction conditions. Targeted gene deletion of CfATG5 revealed that CfAtg5 is involved in growth and conidiation. We further found that the ?Cfatg5 mutant is defective in appressorium formation and in responses to cell wall integrity and oxidative stresses. The combined effects, together with the abolished autophagy, result in the pathogenicity defects of the ?Cfatg5 mutant. Our study further illustrates the importance of normal autophagy in the physiology and pathogenicity of C. fructicola, and offers a potential target in the development of new anthracnose control strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Small-sized populations frequently undergo a significant loss of genetic variability that can lead to their extinction. Therefore, research on animal breeding has focused on mating systems for minimizing the disappearance of genetic variability. Minimizing the average coancestry of offspring has been described as the best strategy for this purpose. Traditionally, the preservation of genetic variability has been approached via breeding strategies for increasing the effective population size (Ne). The main objective of this study was to compare, via computer simulations, the performance of different breeding schemes to limit the losses of genetic diversity in small populations. This objective was achieved by monitoring the evolution of the effective size obtained by different strategies across 20 generations with a starting point of two pedigree real populations of Gazella cuvieri. The results showed that minimizing average coancestry in a cohort did not maximize the effective size as compared with new strategies that were designed for this study. Furthermore, the best strategy may vary for each population and should be studied individually. Small-sized animal populations can undergo significant loss of genetic variability that can lead to their extinction. Therefore, studies on animal breeding have focused on mating systems for minimizing the disappearance of genetic variability. The main objective of this study was to compare, using computer simulations, the performance of different breeding schemes to limit the loss of genetic diversity in small-sized populations. This objective was achieved by monitoring the evolution of the effective population size obtained by 23 strategies throughout 20 generations in two populations of Gazella cuvieri. The scenarios were designed with different assumptions, in both reference subpopulations, regarding: the use of parents coancestry or offspring coancestry, the use of their increases or the coefficients themselves, and the number of males and females involved. Computations were performed using an experimental module of Endog v4.9 developed for this purpose. The results of the study showed that strategies for minimizing the coancestry of the parents were better in the short term; however, these strategies were worse in the long term. Minimizing the average coancestry of the offspring was a better approach in the long term. Nevertheless, in both populations, the best results were obtained when both the coancestry of the parents and the coancestry of the offspring were weighted at 5% each and neither males nor females were assumed to contribute to the next generation. In any case, not all strategies had the same evolutionary pattern throughout generations in both populations. The current results show that neither traditional nor new strategies have any general use. Therefore, it is important to carefully test these strategies before applying them to different populations with different breeding needs under different conditions, such as different generation intervals, and different natural breeding systems such as monogamy or polygyny.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the production and nutritional value of Urochloa ruziziensis, in response to maintenance fertilization with liquid swine slurry (LSS). The design was in randomized blocks with five treatments, four doses of LSS (0, 120, 240, and 360 m(3) ha(-1) plotted in 0, 30, 60, and 90 m(3) ha(-1) per cut, respectively) and mineral fertilization (200 kg ha(-1) N in four applications of 50 kg ha(-1)). Vegetative and nutritive characteristics of the plants were evaluated. The 360 m(3) ha(-1) dose showed results equal to mineral fertilization in most of the studied variables. The emission index decreased 34% in relation to the control with the application of 90 m(3) ha(-1) of LSS in the soil. In the neutral and acid detergent fiber (NDF and ADF) variables, there was no difference between the doses of LSS and the mineral dose. The increments in the comparison between doses were plant height (39%), crude protein (15%), extractions of N (140%), P (153%), K (147%), Ca (89%), Mg (110%), S (107%), Fe (119%), Zn (104%), Mn (106%), and Cu (101%). The dose of 90 m(3) ha(-1) of LSS by cut promoted an increase in dry matter yield and crude protein content, without altering NDF and ADF, in addition to linearly increasing macro and micronutrients in Urochloa ruziziensis.

AB  - In mammalian cochlea, sound-induced vibration is amplified by a three-row lattice of Y-shaped microstructures consisting of electromotile outer hair cell and supporting Deiters cell. This highly organized structure is thought to be essential for hearing of low-level sounds. Prior studies reported differences in geometry and synaptic innervation of the outer hair cells between rows, but how these fine features are achieved at subcellular level still remains unclear. Using serial block-face electron microscopy, we acquired few-hundred-micron-sized cytoarchitecture of mouse organ of Corti at nanometer resolution. Structural quantifications were performed on the Y-shapes as well as afferent and efferent projections to outer hair cells (OHCs). Several new features, which support the previously observed inter-row heterogeneity, are described. Our result provides structural bases for the gradient of mechanical properties and diverse centrifugal regulation of OHC rows.

AB  - To investigate the long-term effects of dietary zinc oxide nanoparticle (Nano-ZnO, 20-40 nm) on the relative organ weight, liver function, deposition, and absorption of trace minerals in intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) pigs, piglets were allocated to NBW (6 normal birth weight piglets fed basal diets), IUGR (6 IUGR piglets fed basal diets) and IUGR+NZ (6 IUGR piglets fed basal diets + 600 mg Zn/kg from Nano-ZnO) groups at weaning (21 days of age), which were sampled at 163 days of age. There were no noteworthy changes in the relative weight of organs, hepatic histomorphology, serum alkaline phosphatase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase activities, and Mn, Cu, and Fe concentrations in leg muscle, the liver, the tibia, and feces among the IUGR, NBW, and IUGR+NZ groups (P > 0.05), and no intact Nano-ZnO in the jejunum, liver, and muscle was observed, while dietary Nano-ZnO increased the Zn concentrations in the tibia, the liver, serum, and feces (P < 0.05) and mRNA expression of metallothionein (MT) 1A, MT2A, solute carrier family 39 member (ZIP) 4, ZIP14, ZIP8, divalent metal transporter 1, solute carrier family 30 member (ZnT) 1, ZnT4 and metal regulatory transcription factor 1, and ZIP8 protein expression in jejunal mucosa (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that dietary Nano-ZnO increased the relative optical density of ZIP8 (mainly expressed in cells of brush border) and MT2A (mainly expressed in villus lamina propria and gland/crypt) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, long-term dietary Nano-ZnO showed no obvious side effects on the development of the major organs, liver function, and metabolism of Cu, Fe, and Mn in IUGR pigs, while it increased the Zn absorption and deposition via enhancing the expression of transporters (MT, ZIP, and ZnT families) in the jejunum, rather than via endocytosis as the form of intact nanoparticles.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are critical compounds that directly or indirectly regulate the tritrophic interactions among herbivores, natural enemies and plants. The synthesis and release of HIPVs are regulated by many biotic and abiotic factors. However, the mechanism by which multiple factors synergistically affect HIPVs release remains unclear. Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is the object of this study because of its rich and varied volatile metabolites. In this study, benzyl nitrile was released from herbivore-attacked tea plants more in the daytime than at night, which was consistent with the feeding behaviour of tea geometrid (Ectropis grisescens Warren) larvae. The Y-tube olfactometer assay and insect resistance analysis revealed that benzyl nitrile can repel tea geometrid larvae and inhibit their growth. On the basis of enzyme activities in transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana plants, CsCYP79 was identified as a crucial regulator in the benzyl nitrile biosynthetic pathway. Light signalling-related transcription factor CsPIF1-like and the jasmonic acid (JA) signalling-related transcription factor CsMYC2 serve as the activator of CsCYP79 under light and damage conditions. Our study revealed that light (abiotic factor) and herbivore-induced damage (biotic stress) synergistically regulate the synthesis and release of benzyl nitrile to protect plants from diurnal herbivorous tea geometrid larvae.

AB  - Simple Summary The dietary supply of vitamin D-3, which is carried out in indoor husbandry due to limited sunlight, often results in a vitamin D status that is lower than that observed in outdoor pig farming. Studies have shown that the use of the vitamin D metabolite 25-hydroxycholecalciferol leads to a more efficient increase in vitamin D status. However, when nutrient intake is adequate, the replacement of the vitamin D source appears to have no or only marginal effects on the performance and bone metabolism of sows. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of both forms of vitamin D, vitamin D-3 and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, on the mineral homeostasis, bone metabolism, welfare and birth progress of sows fed protein- and phosphorus-reduced diets. Supplementation with 25-hydroxycholecalciferol instead of vitamin D-3 improved vitamin D status and reduced gait changes. However, mineral homeostasis and bone metabolism were not affected by the replacement of the vitamin D form. In conclusion, under conditions of a dietary reduction in protein and phosphorus, the replacement of the vitamin D form seems to help to improve the locomotion of sows, although bone mineralization is probably not affected. To investigate the influence of two dietary sources of vitamin D on the vitamin D status, bone metabolism, welfare and birth progress of gestating and lactating sows, forty-nine multiparous sows were randomly assigned to one of two diets: "CON" (n = 25; 50 mu g vitamin D-3/kg feed) and "HYD" (n = 24; 50 mu g 25-hydroxycholecalciferol/kg feed). The basal diets were protein- and phosphorus-reduced. The trial started on day 3 ante insemination of the sows and ended with weaning of the piglets on day 28 postpartum. Dietary supplementation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol resulted in improved maternal vitamin D status (p < 0.001), fewer gait changes (p < 0.01) and longer standing time after feeding (day 5 ante partum; p < 0.05) compared to vitamin D-3. However, the bone markers CrossLaps and osteocalcin were not affected. Overall, the present results suggest that sows fed 25-hydroxycholecalciferol instead of vitamin D-3 showed improved locomotion and stance strength. However, this outcome is probably not related to altered bone metabolism. The underlying mechanisms must be investigated in further studies.

AB  - This study compared the follicular growth, superovulatory response, and in vivo embryo production after administering two doses of porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH) in Santa Ine s ewes. The estrous cycle of 36 multiparous ewes was synchronized with the Day 0 protocol and superovulated with 133 mg (G133, n =18) or 200 mg (G200, n =18) of pFSH. Ultrasonographic evaluations of the ovaries were performed, ewes were mated and submitted to nonsurgical embryo recovery. Viable blastocysts were stained with Nile Red and Hoechst. The G200 had a greater number of medium and large follicles, as well as a larger size of the third largest follicle. A total of 97.2% (35/36) of the ewes came into estrus and it was possible to transpose cervix in 80.6% (29/36). There were no effects of treatments in the response to superovulation, the proportion of ewes in which was possible to transpose the cervix, the number of corpora lutea, the number of anovulatory follicles, the proportion of ewes flushed with at least one recovered structure, number of recovered structures, number of viable embryos, viability rate, and recovery rate. The G200 ewes were in estrus for a longer period of time than the G133 ewes (54.0 +/- 4.5 h vs. 40.3 +/- 3.6 h) and produced more freezable embryos (6.5 +/- 1.6 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.7) than G133. Both doses promoted an efficient superovulatory response and did not affect embryonic lipid accumulation. The dose of 200 mg of pFSH showed greater potential to increase the superovulatory response, as it increased follicular recruitment and the recovery of freezable embryos.

AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to test how acute stress and levels of circulating estrogens together influence acquisition and retention of spatial learning, as well as explorative behaviors in female rats. We used the hippocampus-dependent Open-field Tower Maze (OFTM) task to assess acquisition followed by a retention test (reacquisition) that was given 48 h later. Immediately prior to acquisition, experimental rats were exposed to an acute restraint stress and were trained under bright lights. Female rats' estrous cycles were tracked throughout training and testing. Exposure to stress did not affect learning when levels of estrogens were low (i.e., during estrus and metestrus). However, acute stress exposure significantly lowered spatial acquisition of the female rats in the phases with rising levels of estrogens (i.e., during diestrus and proestrus). Furthermore, this stress-induced diminishment during acquisition was evident at the beginning of the retention without any presentation of stress. The present findings provide insight about the interactive relationship between stress and sex hormones on cognitive functions.

AB  - To identify herbivorous grazing species and record their occurrence frequency in a nori Neopyropia yezoensis and an ao-nori Ulva linza seaweed farm, we conducted observation studies using three types of camera. A time-lapse camera (TLC200Pro) and an intermittent video camera (Raspberry pi) were used to record the occurrence and behavior of fish, while a 3G camera (TREL3G) that can send images via e-mail was used to monitor the occurrence of ducks. The factors that affected the occurrence frequency of ducks were also examined. The occurrence and feeding-like behavior of ducks Anas spp. and black sea bream Acanthopagrus schlegelii were frequently recorded in the nori farm, and those of mullet Mugil cephalus were recorded in the ao-nori farm. There was a strong autocorrelation in the daily total number of ducks, and once they occurred, they tended to continue the following day.

AB  - Dicynodonts were a globally distributed group of herbivorous synapsids that first appeared during the middle Permian (Guadalupian) and survived the Permian-Triassic Mass Extinction, until their extinction in the Late Triassic. Their fossil record in South America is almost entirely concentrated in the Triassic, with only two described Permian species. One of these, Rastodon procurvidens, was found in the Rio do Rasto Formation in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and represents one of the best-preserved Permian therapsids from South America. The phylogenetic position of Rastodon within dicynodonts remains debated, with competing hypotheses leading to radically different conclusions regarding the early biogeography of dicynodonts. In this study, we present a detailed description of both the cranial and postcranial skeleton of the R. procurvidens holotype using microcomputed tomography. Phylogenetic analyses under both maximum parsimony and Bayesian criteria support the placement of Rastodon within the emydopoid clade Kingoriidae. These findings provide the first evidence of Emydopoidea and Kingoriidae in South America and underscore the limited knowledge of dicynodonts during the Guadalupian, particularly outside southern Africa. Furthermore, they suggest an earlier origin of Kingoriidae and the possibility that the group originated in west rather than east Gondwana.

AB  - Simple Summary A valid strategy for increasing the sustainability of food production systems is the use of industrial by-products in livestock diets, which allows food processing industries to profitably mitigate the costs generated by waste disposal. The agro-industrial olive sector produces large quantities of olive by-products, considered extremely toxic, with a highly adverse environmental impact. Thus, to valorise a by-product of the oil industry, the aim of this study was to evaluate the inclusion of different levels of ensiled olive cake in the fattening diets of Apulo-Calabrese pigs as a strategy to partially replace the conventional cereal-based diet and improve animal performance and meat fatty acid profile. The results showed that the inclusion of ensiled olive cake in the diet improves the fatty acid composition of meat, improving health by increasing the oleic acid level (C8:1n-9, p < 0.001), decreasing the linoleic acid level (C18:2n-6, p < 0.001) and altering the polyunsaturated/saturated ratio (P/S, p < 0.001). In conclusion, ensiled olive cake is suitable for dietary supplementation at up to 40% for fattening pigs and could represent a valid strategy for naturally improving the nutritional value of meat and valorising a by-product of the olive industry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inclusion of different amounts of ensiled olive cake, a major pollutant from olive oil production, in the fattening diets of 30 Apulo-Calabrese pigs as a strategy to partially substitute the traditional cereal-based diet and improve animal performance and meat fatty acid composition. The animals, during a fattening period of 120 days, were fed with three dietary treatments containing increasing levels of ensiled olive cake: 0% (C), 20% (OC20) and 40% (OC40) on dry matter. No effect of the dietary treatment was found on the animal performance and proximate meat analysis results. The inclusion of ensiled olive cake in the diet led to differences in the fatty acid (FA) profile of intramuscular fat, with a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA; p < 0.001) and oleic acid (C8:1n-9, p < 0.001) and a lower concentration of polyunsaturated (PUFA, p < 0.001) and linoleic acid (C18:2n-6, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the supplementation of ensiled olive cake at up to 40% in the diets of fattening pigs could represent a useful strategy in Mediterranean areas to naturally improve the nutritional value of meat and valorise a by-product of the olive industry, reducing its environmental impact and promoting the exploitation of this local feed resource according to the principles of the circular economy.

AB  - 3D printed titanium scaffold has promising applications in orthopedics. However, the bioinert titanium presents challenges for promoting vascularization and tissue growth within the porous scaffold for stable osteointegration. In this study, a modular porous titanium scaffold is created using 3D printing and a gradient-surface strategy to immobilize QK peptide on the surface with a bi-directional gradient distribution. This design featured high peptide density in the interior and low peptide density on both ends, aiming to induce cell migration from ends to interior and subsequently enhance vascularization and osteointegration within the scaffold. In vitro results showed that besides the inherent bioactivity, the gradient distribution of QK positively correlated with endothelial cell migration and promoted angiogenesis. In vivo assay was performed by a segmental bone defect model in rabbit and a spine repair model in sheep. Various staining and Micro-CT results demonstrated that compared to that with uniformly QK-functionalized surface, the scaffold with bi-directional gradient QK-functionalized surface (Ti-G) significantly encouraged new tissue growth toward the interior of the scaffold, subsequently facilitated angiogenesis and osteointegration. This study provides an effective strategy for enhancing the bioactivity of peptide-functionalized scaffolds through the concept of bi-directional gradients, and holds potential for various 3D printed scaffolds.

AB  - Introduction The brown planthopper (BPH) poses a significant threat to rice production in Asia. The use of resistant rice varieties has been effective in managing this pest. However, the adaptability of BPH to resistant rice varieties has led to the emergence of virulent populations, such as biotype Y BPH. YHY15 rice, which carries the BPH resistance gene Bph15, exhibits notable resistance to biotype 1 BPH but is susceptible to biotype Y BPH. Limited information exists regarding how resistant rice plants defend against BPH populations with varying levels of virulence.Methods In this study, we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiling analyses to study the differential responses of YHY15 rice to both avirulent (biotype 1) and virulent (biotype Y) BPH.Results YHY15 rice demonstrated a rapid response to biotype Y BPH infestation, with significant transcriptional changes occurring within 6 hours. The biotype Y-responsive genes were notably enriched in photosynthetic processes. Accordingly, biotype Y BPH infestation induced more intense transcriptional responses, affecting miRNA expression, defenserelated metabolic pathways, phytohormone signaling, and multiple transcription factors. Additionally, callose deposition was enhanced in biotype Y BPH-infested rice seedlings.Discussion These findings provide comprehensive insights into the defense mechanisms of resistant rice plants against virulent BPH, and may potentially guide the development of insect-resistant rice varieties.

AB  - Cotton Boll Weevil (CBW, Anthonomus grandis) is a devastating insect-pest affecting cotton (Gossypium spp), using cotton internal floral structures for larval development, making it difficult to control. Little is known about the mechanism underlying CBW-plant interactions leading to infestation or resistance. Here, we investigated the plant molecular responses triggered by CBW extracts from eggs, larvae, and oral secretions (OS) of larvae and adult. The MAPK pathway, one of the early signaling events in plant pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), was activated by CBW extracts in Arabidopsis thaliana. In cotton, CBW OS activated GhMPK3 and GhMPK6. Importantly, CBW OS activated the PTI marker gene FRK1 and the effector-triggered immunity (ETI) marker gene WRKY46 in Arabidopsis reporter lines, suggesting that Herbivore-Associated Molecular Patterns (HAMPs) present in OS from CBW can elicit plant defense responses in cotton and Arabidopsis. Interestingly, CBW OS-induced MAPK activation shows similar patterns in wild-type and Arabidopsis mutants, which bear mutations in already known receptor and co-receptors complex components, suggesting a distinct signaling cascade likely triggered by the putative HAMPs present in CBW OS. The work points to potentials in the identification and development of CBW extract-derived elicitors for effective pest control combating CBW infestation.

AB  - The first detailed description of Ancylotherium pentelicum (Gaudry and Lartct, 1856) from the late Miocene (Turolian) of Kerassia (Greece) is provided based on three metapodial elements. Potential intraspecific variability of this species in the Eastern Mediterranean has been previously discussed, but no decisive conclusions could be drawn. The present comparison of metapodial elements of A. pentelicum from Kerassia, Pikermi, Samos (Greece), Pinaryaka, Salihpasalar (Turkey), Kiro Kuchuk (North Macedonia), and Hadjidimovo (Bulgaria) provides evidence for the existence of notable intraspecific variation in both the morphology and especially the size of the species. The morphological differences in the shape and occurrence of some metapodial articular facets are probably associated with the anticipated individual variability and not with sexual dimorphism. On the other hand, the notable metrical variability observed among metapodials of A. pentelicum may be indicative of sexual dimorphism, as has been previously documented in other chalicotheriids.

AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are a group of microorganisms that have potential for replacing synthetic chemical pesticides. However, EPF virulence is often insufficient, and therefore adoption of EPF biopesticides has been relatively limited. Previous studies have shown that herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) promoted the virulence of Lecanicillium lecanii, and that extracellular proteases and chitinases are important virulence factors of entomopathogenic fungi. We therefore put forward the hypothesis that HIPVs promote L. lecanii virulence by inducing extracellular protease or/and chitinase activity. Lecanicillium lecanii was treated with tomato HIPVs induced by various numbers/densities of Bemisia tabaci, the effect of HIPVs on L. lecanii virulence and activities of virulence-related enzymes (extracellular proteases and chitinases) was analyzed. Changes in enzyme activities were confirmed by measuring the variations in Pr1 and Chit II genes expression of virulence-related enzymes under the influence of HIPVs. Finally, the correlation between virulence and virulence-related enzymes or genes was analyzed to explore the mechanism of promoting HIPVs in L. lecanii virulence enhancement. The results showed that volatiles produced by the tomato plants induced by 50 B. tabaci adults (50-HIPVs) significantly enhanced the virulence of L. lecanii. When exposed to both 50-HIPVs and L. lecanii, the mortality rate of B. tabaci reached 79.0% within 7 days compared to 28.87% in the control group. Additionally, 50-HIPVs significantly promoted the activity of chitinase and the relative expression of Chit II genes, which consequently increased by 62.74% and 48.55%, respectively. However, each group of HIPVs had no promoting effect on extracellular protease and Pr1 gene expression. Correlation analysis results showed that the virulence of L. lecanii is significantly correlated with the activity of chitinase and relative expression of Chit II genes. Thus, HIPVs induced virulence of L. lecanii by increasing chitinase activity. This study demonstrates important methods to enhance the virulence of L. lecanii. Moreover, from the perspective of chemical ecology, the findings provide theoretical support for field application of EPF, and also reveal the impact of HIPVs on EPF from a biochemical perspective.

AB  - Seen as an integral part of sustainable development, circular economy represents a model of production and consumption notably based on the limitation of both resource wastage and environmental impact. Laboratories and commercial companies working on plant pathogens, in particular quarantine species, must effectively disinfect their waste to avoid disseminating these organisms. The methods used for waste disinfection can however incur high energy costs or pose environmental and human health hazards. Here, we tested the effectiveness of five disinfection methods - chlorination, heat treatment, composting, mesophilic methanation and waste stabilization ponds - on plant-parasitic nematodes belonging to the genera Globodera and Meloidogyne. For the widely used chlorination and heat treatment methods, we showed that they can be very effective in inactivating nematodes at relatively low chlorine doses and temperatures (60 ?-3 min and 50 ?-30 min), respectively. For the three other disinfection methods tested, initially designed for waste recycling, we obtained different levels of efficiency. Composting and mesophilic methanation (based on cattle or pig slurry) both led to the complete elimination of nematodes, even for short treatment durations. However, waste stabilization ponds showed contrasting results, ranging from virtually no effect to high levels of inactivation of nematodes. Our study demonstrates that it is possible to use more environmentally friendly disinfection methods to control plant-parasitic nematodes. In particular, this finding paves the way towards the treatment of infected plant materials using composting or methanation, providing that disinfection is still reached under other (real-life) treatment conditions, especially with other kinds of waste. Both composting and methanation recycle and thus valorize infected waste; they are viable alternatives to landfilling or incineration, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of a circular economy approach.

AB  - Several beneficial microbes have been shown to activate defensive mechanisms in plants, enhancing their resistance against herbivores. However, it remains unclear whether different beneficial microbes can synergize to improve defenses in wild plants, similar to their effects in cultivated plants against insect pests. Here, we investigated the effect of the endophytic entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii, both individually and in combination with the growth-promoting rhizobacteria Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, on plant growth and volatile emissions in the cultivated Solanum lycopersicum and its two wild parents, S. pimpinellifolium and S. habrochaites. We also assessed the ovipositional preference of the destructive pest Tuta absoluta and the olfactory responses of its natural enemy, the mirid predator Macrolophus basicornis, toward these treatments across each tomato species. Both wild and cultivated plants inoculated with M. robertsii exhibited enhanced growth and emitted higher levels of specific volatile compounds than non-inoculated plants. Furthermore, T. absoluta females laid fewer eggs on S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites inoculated with M. robertsii. Additionally, the inoculation of this beneficial fungus resulted in increased attraction of M. basicornis to the volatiles of S. lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium. Interestingly, the combined inoculation of B. amyloliquefaciens and M. robertsii generally did not yield an additive effect on volatile emissions and resistance against T. absoluta compared to M. robertsii alone in wild and cultivated tomato plants. These results suggest that the inoculation of M. robertsii could be a promising tool for protecting tomato plants against T. absoluta and enhancing the attraction of its natural enemy, M. basicornis.

AB  - Applying nitrogen fertilization is an important way to improve the yield and quality of autumn tea (Camellia sinensis L.), but the effects of nitrogen application rate and nitrogen form still remain unclear. Field experiments were conducted in a drip-irrigated tea garden in Rizhao City, China in 2020 and 2021. The effects of nitrogen application levels (N: 0 kg center dot hm(-2), CK; N: 45 kg center dot hm(-2), U1; 75 kg center dot hm(-2), U2; and 105 kg center dot hm(-2), U3) and nitrogen application forms (ammonium bicarbonate, AB; ammonium bicarbonate + urea, UAB; and urea, U) on soil moisture, as well as nitrogen spatiotemporal change, and autumn tea yield and quality, were studied. Results showed that applying ammonium bicarbonate or urea through a drip irrigation system can significantly increase the tea plant evapotranspiration and the autumn tea yield and quality (including free amino acids and tea polyphenols). With the same nitrogen application, the urea fertilization treatment had the higher ammonium nitrogen content within the 0-60 cm soil layer. The application form of nitrogen fertilizer had a significant impact on the yield of autumn tea, and the yield increasing ability was U > UAB > AB. The partial factor productivity of applied nitrogen under the AB treatment was the lowest. The yield-increasing effect of nitrogen fertilizer can be observed only 16-18 days after topdressing through the drip irrigation system. In 2020 and 2021, the yield of autumn tea under the U3 treatment increased by 40.6% and 23.0%, respectively, compared with the CK treatment. In conclusion, the topdressing with urea 105 kg center dot hm(-2) with drip irrigation for tea plants in autumn is recommended. This recommendation will provide a theoretical basis for efficient irrigation and yield increase in tea gardens.

AB  - The charcoal stock in a forestry business is controlled based on the theoretical capacity of the masonry ovens (input) and shipped trucks (output). During the year, the company must monitor the stock for accountability reports and internal governance. This paper proposes a more efficient and precise survey method that overcomes the challenges of the common monitoring system in Brazil. In this study, a monitoring method based on digital stereoscopy from UAV images was implemented and evaluated. The results were compared with those of the traditional topographic survey based on RTK equipment. A multi-engine UAV, with an integrated global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) equipment was used to fly over and survey a masonry oven complex containing eight charcoal heaps. Two stereoscopic processing methods were applied: (1) very low quality and (2) high quality to image alignment, reconstruction of a dense cloud, facet count and a three-dimensional mesh creation. Low-quality products showed geometric deformities when compared to high quality, but resulted in estimations similar to the topographic survey. Results indicated that the volume estimation of the charcoal heaps using UAV derived orthomosaics can replace the conventional method of GNSS RTK surveys with considerable gains in stockpile volume accuracy, inventory frequency and labour safety. The high quality processing method registered improvements in geometric precision and accuracy.

AB  - Intervertebral disc degeneration is a leading cause of chronic low back pain. Cell-based strategies that seek to treat disc degeneration by regenerating the central nucleus pulposus (NP) hold significant promise, but key challenges remain. One of these is the inability of therapeutic cells to effectively mimic the performance of native NP cells, which are unique amongst skeletal cell types in that they arise from the embryonic notochord. In this study, we use single cell RNA sequencing to demonstrate emergent heterogeneity amongst notochord-derived NP cells in the postnatal mouse disc. Specifically, we established the existence of progenitor and mature NP cells, corresponding to notochordal and chondrocyte-like cells, respectively. Mature NP cells exhibited significantly higher expression levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes including aggrecan, and collagens II and VI, along with elevated transforming growth factor-beta and phosphoinositide 3 kinase-protein kinase B signaling. Additionally, we identified Cd9 as a novel surface marker of mature NP cells, and demonstrated that these cells were localized to the NP periphery, increased in numbers with increasing postnatal age, and co-localized with emerging glycosaminoglycan-rich matrix. Finally, we used a goat model to show that Cd9+ NP cell numbers decrease with moderate severity disc degeneration, suggesting that these cells are associated with maintenance of the healthy NP ECM. Improved understanding of the developmental mechanisms underlying regulation of ECM deposition in the postnatal NP may inform improved regenerative strategies for disc degeneration and associated low back pain.

AB  - An interferon-inducible gene, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-1 (OAS1), plays an essential role in uterine receptivity and conceptus development by controlling cell growth and differentiation in addition to anti-viral activities. As OAS1 gene has not yet been studied in caprine (cp), so present study was designed with the aim to amplify, sequence, characterize and in-silico analyze the coding sequence of the cpOAS1. Further, expression profile of cpOAS1 was performed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot in the endometrium of pregnant and cyclic does. An 890 bp fragment of the cpOAS1 was amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences revealed 99.6-72.3% identities with that of ruminants and non-ruminants. A constructed phylogenetic tree revealed that Ovis aries and Capra hircus differ from large ungulates. Various post-translational modifications (PTMs), 21 phosphorylation, two sumoylation, eight cysteines and 14 immunogenic sites were found in the cpOAS1. The domain, OAS1_C, is found in the cpOAS1 which carries anti-viral enzymatic activity, cell growth, and differentiation. Among the interacted proteins with cpOAS1, Mx1 and ISG17 well-known proteins are found that have anti-viral activity and play an important role during early pregnancy in rumi-nants. CpOAS1 protein (42/46 kDa and/or 69/71 kDa) was detected in the endometrium of pregnant and cyclic does. Both cpOAS1 mRNA and protein were expressed maximally (P<0.05) in the endometrium during preg-nancy as compared to cyclic does. In conclusion, the cpOAS1 sequence is almost similar in structure and probably in function also to other species along with its higher expression during early pregnancy.

AB  - Robust plant immunity negatively affects other fitness traits, including growth and seed production. Jasmonate (JA) confers broad-spectrum protection against plant consumers by stimulating the degradation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins, which in turn relieves repression on transcription factors (TFs) coincident with reduced growth and fecundity. The molecular mechanisms underlying JA-mediated decreases in fitness remain largely unknown. To assess the contribution of MYC TFs to growth and reproductive fitness at high levels of defence, we mutated three MYC genes in a JAZ-deficient mutant (jazD) of Arabidopsis thaliana that exhibits strong defence and low seed yield. Genetic epistasis analysis showed that de-repression of MYC TFs in jazD not only conferred strong resistance to insect herbivory but also reduced shoot and root growth, fruit size and seed yield. We also provided evidence that the JAZ-MYC module coordinates the supply of tryptophan with the production of indole glucosinolates and the proliferation of endoplasmic reticulum bodies that metabolise glucosinolates through the action of beta-glucosidases. Our results establish MYCs as major regulators of growth- and reproductive-defence trade-offs and further indicate that these factors coordinate tryptophan availability with the production of amino acid-derived defence compounds.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between the leaf structure of Camellia weiningensis and cold resistance. In July 2021, leaves were selected from 30 excellent trees and denoted wn-number. Paraffin sectioning was performed to observe 11 anatomical structural indices. Based on variance analysis, correlation analysis and cluster analysis, four typical indices were determined. A membership function was employed to comprehensively evaluate cold resistance. The leaves were composed of the cuticle, upper epidermis, palisade tissue, spongy tissue, stoma and lower epidermis and were bifacial. The upper and lower epidermis was composed of mono layer cells, and stomata were only observed in the lower epidermis. The palisade tissue was composed of densely arranged cells. The palisade tissue of most leaves contained three layers of cells, with a few leaves containing four layers. The main vein consisted of collenchyma, xylem, phloem and parenchyma. The trees differed greatly in terms of the 11 anatomical structural indices, where wn-4 had the thickest leaves. The average thickness of its upper and lower epidermis was 27.81 mu m and 24.68 vim, respectively, with an average palisade tissue -spongy tissue ratio of 0.9 and a cuticle ranging from 9.46 mu m to 17.71 mu m in thickness. According to cluster analysis and correlation analysis, the indices most related to cold resistance included the thickness of the spongy tissue, the thickness of the lower epidermis, vein thickness and tissue structure tightness. According to the membership function values, the plants with strong cold resistance were wn-1, wn-3, wn-19, wn-22 and wn-28.

AB  - This study had a correlational design and aimed to develop and validate a database of dual-perspective (entire face and 3/4 face) face-focused photographs depicting pets (dogs, cats, miniature rabbits) and livestock animals (pigs and cattle). Participants (n = 268, 82% women, Mage = 28.2, SD = 8.5) viewed 72 pairs of photographs and evaluated each animal's similarity across two photographs, as well as their valence, typicality, familiarity, cuteness, and dangerousness. The results confirmed that livestock animals received lower ratings in terms of similarity across the two photographs and were perceived as less positively valenced, less typical, less familiar, less cute, and more dangerous compared with pets. Furthermore, individual characteristics were found to be related to the perception of animals. Compared with non-owners, pet owners rated both livestock and pets more positively valenced and cuter. Additionally, the frequency of meat consumption was associated with perceiving livestock animals as less positively valenced, less cute, and more dangerous. The database provides realistic and valid stimuli, which have the potential to facilitate investigations into animal perception and recognition within the context of human-animal relationships.

AB  - Huge number of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been widely detected in phage genomes from anthropogenic environment or animal farms, whereas little is known about the dynamic changes of phage contribution to resistance under a feedlot wastewater treatment facility (WTF) pressure. Here, a metagenomics method was used to characterize the sewage phageome and identifies the antibiotic resistome. The results showed that the phage families of Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae were always the most dominant. Analysis of ARGs carried by bacterial and phages showed that MLS and tetracycline resistance genes always had the highest abundances and the other ARG types also have a fixed hierarchy, showing that there is no significant change in overall ARGs abundance distribution. However, an extensively cored antibiotic resistome were specifically identified in aerobic environment. ARGs encoding ribosomal protection proteins, especially for the ARG subtypes lsaE, tet44, tetM, tetP, macB, MdlB and rpoB2, were more inclined to be selected by phages, suggesting that a more refined mechanism, such as specialized transduction and lateral transduction, was probably involved. In all, these results suggest that monitoring of dynamic changes of phage contribution to resistance should be given more attention and ARGs-carrying phage management should focus on using technologies for controlling cored ARGs rather than only the overall distribution of ARGs in phages.

AB  - Visfatin (VIS), also known as nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Recently, VIS has been also recognized as an adipokine. Our previous study revealed that VIS is produced in the anterior and posterior lobes of the porcine pituitary. Moreover, the expression and secretion of VIS are dependent on the phase of the estrous cycle and/or the stage of early pregnancy. Based on this, we hypothesized that VIS may regulate porcine pituitary function. This study was conducted on anterior pituitary (AP) glands harvested from pigs during specific phases of the estrous cycle. We have shown the modulatory effect of VIS in vitro on LH and FSH secretion by porcine AP cells (determined by ELISA). VIS was also found to stimulate cell proliferation (determined by Alamar Blue) without affecting apoptosis in these cells (determined using flow cytometry technique). Moreover, it was indicated that VIS may act in porcine AP cells through the INSR, AKT/PI3K, MAPK/ERK1/2, and AMPK signaling pathways (determined by ELISA or Western Blot). This observation was further supported by the finding that simultaneous treatment of cells with VIS and inhibitors of these pathways abolished the observed VIS impact on LH and FSH secretion (determined by ELISA). In addition, our research indicated that VIS affected the mentioned processes in a manner that was dependent on the dose of VIS and/or the phase of the estrous cycle. Thus, these findings suggest that VIS may regulate the functioning of the porcine pituitary gland during the estrous cycle.

AB  - Following infestation by phytophagous insects, changes in the composition and relative proportion of volatile components emitted by plants may be observed. Some phytophagous insects can accurately identify these compounds to locate suitable host plants. We investigated whether herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) generated by herbivory on Pistacia chinensis Bunge (Sapindales: Aceraceae) might be semiochemicals for the host location of Batocera horsfieldi Hope (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). We performed two-choice bioassays (indoor darkroom, inside cages) on plants damaged by adult feeding and intact control plants. Volatiles from these plants were then collected and identified, and the response of adult antennae to these compounds was tested via electroantennography (EAG). The behavioral responses of B. horsfieldi to these compounds were finally assessed using a Y-tube olfactometer. Host plant choice tests show that B. horsfieldi prefers feeding-damaged P. chinensis over healthy trees. In total, 15 compounds were collected from healthy and feeding-damaged P. chinensis, 10 of which were shared in both healthy and feeding-damaged P. chinensis, among which there were significant differences in the quantities of five terpenes, including alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, D-limonene, and beta-ocimene. In EAG assays, the antennae of B. horsfieldi adults responded strongly to (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, beta-ocimene, 3-carene, gamma-terpinene, D-limonene, myrcene, and alpha-phellandrene. The antennae of B. horsfieldi adults responded in a dose-response manner to these compounds. Y-tube behavioral experiments showed that four compounds attracted mated females ((Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, beta-ocimene, 3-carene, and alpha-phellandrene), two compounds ((Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and alpha-phellandrene) attracted males, and adults of both sexes avoided D-limonene. Feeding bioassays showed that (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and beta-ocimene could promote the feeding of B. horsfieldi and that D-limonene inhibited this response. These results could provide a theoretical basis for developing attractants or repellents for B. horsfieldi.

AB  - Present study aimed to establish the stimulatory effects of bee drone larvae (BDL) on the androgenic effects and growth performance of goat male kids (GMK). The effects of BDL on growth and testosterone hormone levels were investigated in Saanen male kids. A total of 26 Saanen male kids (13 heads control, 13 heads treatment groups) were used for determining the effects of BDL 60 days after the weaning period. BDL was obtained from "good beekeeping practices" hives. Hormone levels, growth trials, testes characteristics, and body measurements were determined every 14 days on the days 75, 90, 105, 120, and 135 of the trial. The increasing level of testosterone hormone in the treatment group on 135 days strengthened the hypothesis that the BDL could have greater effects in the case of more application that is expensive and considering the time of maturity of Saanen GMK. The lipid composition of BDL was identified by GC/MS. Oleic acid (64.75 %) and palmitic acid (26.08 %) were the dominant lipid compounds of BDL. Additionally, the phenolic/organic acid profile investigated by HPLC-DAD revealed that trans-aconitic acid (11.20 +/- 0.32 mu g/g) and fumaric acid (5.03 +/- 0.41 mu g/g) were found as major compounds in BDL.

AB  - Zebrafish provide a valuable emerging complementary model for neurobehavioral research. They offer a powerful way to screen for the potential therapeutic effects of neuroactive drugs. A variety of behavioral tests for zebrafish have been developed and validated for assessing neurobehavioral function. The novel tank diving test is a straightforward, reproducible way of measuring anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish. When introduced into a novel tank, zebrafish normally dive to the bottom of the tank and then gradually explore the higher levels of the water column as time progresses. Buspirone is an effective anxiolytic drug in humans, which has been found, with acute administration, to reduce this anxiety-like response in zebrafish. The current study used the zebrafish model to evaluate the potential anxiolytic effects of alkaloids, commonly found in Solanaceae plants, with known neuropharmacology relevant to mood regulation. In line with previous findings, acute treatment with anxiolytic positive controls buspirone and the plant alkaloid nicotine reduced the anxiety-like diving response in the zebrafish novel tank diving test. Further, both buspirone and nicotine continued to produce anxiolytic-like effects in zebrafish after 5 days of exposure. In the same treatment paradigm, the effects of five other alkaloids-cotinine, anatabine, anabasine, harmane, and norharmane-were investigated. Cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, also caused anxiolytic-like effects, albeit at a dose higher than the effective dose of nicotine. Nicotine's anxiolytic-like effect was not shared by the other nicotinic alkaloids, anabasine and anatabine, or by the naturally present monoamine oxidase inhibitors harmane and norharmane. We conclude that nicotine uniquely induces anxiolytic-like effects after acute and subchronic treatment in zebrafish. The zebrafish model with the novel tank diving test could be a useful complement to rodent models for screening candidate compounds for anxiolytic effects in nonclinical studies.

AB  - The Switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodelling complex is closely related to chromatin openness and gene transcriptional activity. To understand if the chromatin openness of donor cells was related to the development efficiency of somatic cell cloning embryos, two buffalo fetal fibroblasts (BFF), BFF1 and BFF3, with significantly different cloned blastocyst development rates (18.4% and 30.9% respectively), were selected in this study. The expression of SWI/SNF complex genes, chromatin openness, and transcript level of these two cell lines were analysed, and the effect of ATP on the expression of the SWI/SNF complex genes was further explored. The results showed that compared with BFF1, the expression of SWI/SNF complex family genes was higher in BFF3 at the G0/G1 phase, where SMARCC1, SMARCC2 and SMARCE1 were significantly different (p < .05). Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) results showed that, at the genome-wide level, BFF3 had more open chromatin, especially which having more open chromatin peaks at SMARCA4, SMARCA2, and RBPMS2 (RNA Binding Protein, mRNA Processing Factor 2) sites. In total, 2,712 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the RNA-Seq method, with 1380 up- and 1332 down-regulated genes in BFF3. Interestingly, the ATPase-related genes ATP1B1 and ATP11A were extreme significantly up-regulated in BFF3 (p < .01). The ATP content and the expression of SWI/SNF complex genes in both BFF1 and BFF3 decreased when treated with rotenone. The above results demonstrated that the SWI/SNF complex contributed to chromatin opening, and chromatin opening of donor cells was essential for cloned embryo development.

AB  - Cultivated plants of Gossypium hirsutum Cav. (cotton) consistently emit low levels of volatile organic compounds, primarily mono-and sesquiterpenoids, which are produced and stored in pigment glands. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the terpene profiles of wild G. hirsutum plants sourced from sites located throughout natural distribution of this species, thus providing the first in-depth assessment of the scope of its intraspecific chemotypic diversity. Chemotypic variation can potentially influence resistance to herbivory and diseases, or interact with abiotic stress such as extreme temperatures. Under controlled environmental condi-tions, plants were grown from seeds of sixteen G. hirsutum populations collected along the coastline of the Yucatan Peninsula, which is its likely centre of origin. We found high levels of intraspecific diversity in the terpene profiles of the plants. Two distinct chemotypes were identified: one chemotype contained higher levels of the monoterpenes gamma-terpinene, limonene, alpha-thujene, alpha-terpinene, terpinolene, and p-cymene, while the other chemotype was distinguished by higher levels of alpha-and beta-pinene. The distribution of chemotypes followed a geographic gradient from west to east, with an increasing frequency of the former chemotype. Concurrent analysis of maternal plants revealed that chemotypes in wild G. hirsutum are highly heritable.

AB  - Many wildlife species vary habitat selection across space, time, and behavior to maximize rewards and minimize risk. Multi-scale research approaches that identify variation in wildlife habitat selection can highlight not only habitat preferences and risk tolerance but also movement strategies that afford coexistence or cause conflict with humans. Here, we examined how anthropogenic and natural features influenced coyote (Canis latrans) habitat selection in a mixed-use, agricultural landscape in Mendocino County, California, USA. We used resource selection functions and hidden Markov models to test whether coyote selection for anthropogenic and natural features varied by time of day or by behavioral state (resting, foraging, and traveling). We found that coyotes avoided development, but, contrary to our expectations, coyotes selected for roads, agriculture, and areas with risk of human encounter and rifle use regardless of diel period or behavioral state. While traveling, coyotes increased selection for roads and avoided ruggedness, indicating that unpaved roads may enhance connectivity for coyotes in mixed-use landscapes. Finally, we found that coyotes selected for mountain lion habitat when resting and at night, signifying that risk from natural predators was not a factor in habitat selection at coarse scales. Coyote habitat selection for places and times associated with human activity, without variation across scales, signals a potential for conflict if coyotes are perceived by people as a nuisance.

AB  - The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on the surface of epithelial cells, leading to fusion, and entry of the virus into the cell. This interaction can be blocked by the binding of llama-derived nanobodies (VHHs) to the RBD, leading to virus neutralisation. Structural analysis of VHH-RBD complexes by X-ray crystallography enables VHH epitopes to be precisely mapped, and the effect of variant mutations to be interpreted and predicted. Key to this is a protocol for the reproducible production and crystallization of the VHH-RBD complexes. Based on our experience, we describe a workflow for expressing and purifying the proteins, and the screening conditions for generating diffraction qu ality crystals of VHH-RBD complexes. Production and crystallization of protein complexes takes approximately twelve days, from construction of vectors to harvesting and freezing crystals for data collection.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the most suitable and practical definition of spatial and temporal proximities between grouped-housed horses by comparing GPS position data. In total, 43 horses held in a "HIT Active Stable (R)" were equipped with GPS loggers. Different definitions of spatial (< 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 m) and temporal proximity (< 10, 30, 60, 90, 120 s interruptions between recording points) were investigated for morning pasture periods of 30 days analyzing proximity lengths, number of proximities as well as the network parameters density and fragmentation. With increasing spatial proximity definition, the duration of proximities rose from 9 % (4 compared to 5 m) to 76 % (1 compared to 2 m). The number of proximities also increased accordingly. Ascending temporal proximity definitions provided a lower number of proximities by 13-21 % (10 s to 30 s) depending on the spatial definition and the proximities became longer. Further, with higher spatial proximity definition, the network density ascended and fragmentation decreased, which shows that more horses had proximities and group formation occurred. We identified a proximity definition of 3 m for at least 60 s as the most useful solution because of a decreasing change in proximity length and number due to biological and technical restrictions. Further, it is suspected that this approach helps to better characterize the group formation of horses kept in groups.

AB  - This study examined the association, promoter methylation of Interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) gene, and their effects on mRNA expression and meat quality traits in pig. Muscle samples (n=300) were randomly collected from the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) to determine meat quality traits including drip loss, thawing loss, cooking loss, meat pH [at 45 minutes (pH45min) and at 24 hours (pH24h) post-mortem], shear force (for tenderness), and lightness (L*) in pigs. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Muscle samples (5 per group) with divergent meat pH (low vs high) were selected for promoter methylation study using bisulfate and pyrosequencing. Muscle samples from animals (5 per group) with divergent phenotypes (low vs high meat pH and low vs high drip loss) were used for mRNA expression study by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results showed that a polymorphism in IFI6 gene (g.370A>G) was significantly (P < 0.01) associated with meat pH24h. Furthermore, four CpG regions were identified in IFI6 promoter, of which DNA methylation in a CG site was higher in low meat pH24h group compared to high meat pH24h group (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of IFI6 gene was significantly (P < 0.01) downregulated in low meat pH24h group than high meat pH24h group. This result postulated that high DNA methylation at CG site in the promoter region might downregulate the IFI6 gene expression, hence lower the muscle pH that might lead to higher drip loss and lower tenderness. Therefore, porcine IFI6 gene might be a potential candidate gene for meat quality trait in pig. Nevertheless, further research is needed to confirm the role of IFI6 gene in controlling meat quality traits in other commercial populations.

AB  - Over the past few decades, inadvertent consequences have stemmed from the intensified use of neonicotinoids in agroecosystems. Neonicotinoid applications can result in both positive (e.g., reduced persistent virus transmission) and negative (e.g., increased host susceptibility) repercussions exhibiting ambiguity for their use in crop production. In soybean, aspects of neonicotinoid usage such as the impact on nonpersistent virus transmission and efficacy against nontarget herbivores have not been addressed. This study evaluated the interaction between the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and soybean variety and the impact on different pest feeding guilds. Feeding and behavioral bioassays were conducted in the laboratory to assess the effect of thiamethoxam on the mortality and weight gain of the defoliator, Chrysodeixis includens (Walker). Bioassays evaluated impacts dependent and independent of soybean tissue, in addition to both localized and systemic efficacy within the soybean plant. Additionally, using the electrical penetration graph technique (EPG), the probing behavior of 2 piercing-sucking pests, Aphis gossypii Glover and Myzus persicae (Sulzer), was observed. Results from defoliator bioassays revealed thiamethoxam had insecticidal activity against C. includens. Distinctions in thiamethoxam-related mortality between bioassays dependent and independent of soybean tissue (similar to 98% versus similar to 30% mortality) indicate a contribution of the plant towards defoliator-related toxicity. Observations of defoliator feeding behavior showed a preference for untreated soybean tissue relative to thiamethoxam-treated tissue, suggesting a deterrent effect of thiamethoxam. EPG monitoring of probing behavior exhibited a minimal effect of thiamethoxam on piercing-sucking herbivores. Findings from this study suggest neonicotinoids like thiamethoxam may provide some benefit via insecticidal activity against nontarget defoliators.

AB  - Efficient white-emitting phosphor-in-glass (PiG) was successfully synthesized by synergistic complexation of Ce3+-doped YAG phosphor and Eu3+-doped sodium calcium silicate glass. The crystalline phosphor was obtained via sol-gel route using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), whereas glasses were prepared by melting-quenching method. Rare-earth ions were successfully incorporated into the YAG and glass host lattices without changing their original structures. Through adjusting the Eu3+-doped glass and Ce3+:YAG phosphorus contents in the PiG, it was possible to optimize the chromaticity emission from yellow-green to orange-red in CIE 1931 diagram. Combination of a violet LED and samples emissions, allowed to achieve the chromaticity parameters closer to an ideal white light source [CIE-(0.33, 0.33); CCT 5000K]. Moreover, adjusting the luminescence intensity ratio between the LED and the PiG emission provides a tuning route for smart white light devices.

AB  - Simple Summary: In recent years, farming the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens (L.) (Diptera: Stratiomydiae) has gained popularity across the globe due to its usefulness mainly in animal feed production and waste management. The short cycle time taken to rear the BSF and the high protein content present in its larvae makes it a suitable source of feed for a variety of animals (e.g., poultry, fish, and pigs); the livestock bred as food for humans. However, despite the farming of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) as a source of feed, its production levels are low and do not meet the existing market demand. This study explored data science and machine learning modeling approaches to discern optimal rearing conditions for improved BSFL farming. The random forest regressor machine learning algorithm gave the best prediction results. The algorithm also ranked the variables that contributed most to the prediction of the expected larvae weight. Given the studied rearing conditions, the prediction algorithm can discern and predict the expected weight of BSFL to be harvested. Tuning the production system parameters according to the order of the ranked parameters can further optimize the production of BSFL. BSFL are a source of feed for the animals that are a source of food for humans; therefore, this research contributes to alleviating food insecurity.
   As the world population continues to grow, there is a need to come up with alternative sources of feed and food to combat the existing challenge of food insecurity across the globe. The use of insects, particularly the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens (L.) (Diptera: Stratiomydiae), as a source of feed stands out due to its sustainability and reliability. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have the ability to convert organic substrates to high-quality biomass rich in protein for animal feed. They can also produce biodiesel and bioplastic and have high biotechnological and medical potential. However, current BSFL production is low to meet the industry's needs. This study used machine learning modeling approaches to discern optimal rearing conditions for improved BSF farming. The input variables studied include the cycle time in each rearing phase (i.e., the rearing period in each phase), feed formulation type, length of the beds (i.e, rearing platforms) at each phase, amount of young larvae added in the first phase, purity score (i.e, percentage of BSFL after separating from the substrate), feed depth, and the feeding rate. The output/target variable was the mass of wet larvae harvested (kg per meter) at the end of the rearing cycle. This data was trained on supervised machine learning algorithms. From the trained models, the random forest regressor presented the best root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.91 and an R-squared value of 80.9%, implying that the model can be used to effectively monitor and predict the expected weight of BSFL to be harvested at the end of the rearing process. The results established that the top five ranked important features that inform optimal production are the length of the beds, feed formulation used, the average number of young larvae loaded in each bed, feed depth, and cycle time. Therefore, in that priority, it is expected that tuning the mentioned parameters to fall within the required levels would result in an increased mass of BSFL harvest. These data science and machine learning techniques can be adopted to understand rearing conditions and optimize the production/farming of BSF as a source of feed for animals e.g., fish, pigs, poultry, etc. A high production of these animals guarantees more food for humans, thus reducing food insecurity.

AB  - . Research on human-elephant interactions (HEI) seeks to better understand relationships between people and elephants with the goal of reducing unwanted interactions for the long-term survival of elephants in social-ecological systems. Many examinations of HEI often rely on a short temporal scale of several seasons to several years, often because of limited data availability across time. These examinations offer limited understanding of processes that influence HEI and mutual adaptations of people and elephants. In this synthesis, I present an ethnographic case study from the Okavango Delta, Botswana, where human and elephant populations have increased in the past 20 years. I use bricolage, a practice of using available materials at hand, to weave together diverse historical and current scholarship and primary data to understand dynamics of HEI and coadaptation across three different periods (pre-colonial, colonial, and post-independence). I show that people and elephants were coadapted in the pre-colonial period when people were highly mobile and hunted elephants with rudimentary technologies in ways that supported human development across southern Africa with minimal impact on elephants. European colonization brought sweeping changes, including through the introduction of guns and the development of the ivory trade that led to massive declines in elephant populations. Development policies that were magnified in the years following independence, including the establishment of land policies that settled communities, additionally disrupted the formally fluid nature of HEI. Simultaneously, wildlife conservation policies that coincided with dramatic increases in elephant populations shape how people perceive HEI and elephants as a predominant environmental force today. I argue that the incorporation of wider historical contexts, where necessary through the practice of bricolage, reveals coadaptation across time and offers understanding of possibilities of coexistence where people and elephants thrive alongside each other.

AB  - Seed inoculation with entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) causes plant-mediated effects against arthropod herbivores, but the responses vary among EPF isolates. We used a wheat model system with three isolates representing Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium spp. causing either negative or positive effects against the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Activities of six carbohydrate enzymes increased in plants showing biomass build-up after EPF inoculations. However, only aldolase activity showed positive correlation with R. padi numbers. Plants inoculated with M. robertsii hosted fewest aphids and showed increased activity of superoxide dismutase, implying a defense strategy of resistance towards herbivores. In M. brunneum-inoculated plants, hosting most R. padi, activities of catalase and glutathione reductase were increased suggesting enhanced detoxification responses towards aphids. However, M. brunneum simultaneously increased plant growth indicating that this isolate may cause the plant to tolerate herbivory. EPF seed inoculants may therefore mediate either tolerance or resistance towards biotic stress in plants in an isolate-dependent manner.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Consideration of animal welfare in food choices has become an influential contemporary theme. Traditional animal welfare views about food have been largely restricted to direct and intentional harms to livestock in intensive animal agriculture settings. However, many harms to animals arising from diverse food production practices in the world are exerted indirectly and unintentionally and often affect wildlife. Here we apply a qualitative analysis of food production by considering the breadth of harms caused by different food production systems to wild as well as domestic animals. Production systems are identified that produce relatively few and relatively many harms. The ethical implications of these findings are discussed for consumers concerned with the broad animal welfare impacts of their food choices.
   Ethical food choices have become an important societal theme in post-industrial countries. Many consumers are particularly interested in the animal welfare implications of the various foods they may choose to consume. However, concepts in animal welfare are rapidly evolving towards consideration of all animals (including wildlife) in contemporary approaches such as "One Welfare". This approach requires recognition that negative impacts (harms) may be intentional and obvious (e.g., slaughter of livestock) but also include the under-appreciated indirect or unintentional harms that often impact wildlife (e.g., land clearing). This is especially true in the Anthropocene, where impacts on non-human life are almost ubiquitous across all human activities. We applied the "harms" model of animal welfare assessment to several common food production systems and provide a framework for assessing the breadth (not intensity) of harms imposed. We considered all harms caused to wild as well as domestic animals, both direct effects and indirect effects. We described 21 forms of harm and considered how they applied to 16 forms of food production. Our analysis suggests that all food production systems harm animals to some degree and that the majority of these harms affect wildlife, not livestock. We conclude that the food production systems likely to impose the greatest overall breadth of harms to animals are intensive animal agriculture industries (e.g., dairy) that rely on a secondary food production system (e.g., cropping), while harvesting of locally available wild plants, mushrooms or seaweed is likely to impose the least harms. We present this conceptual analysis as a resource for those who want to begin considering the complex animal welfare trade-offs involved in their food choices.

AB  - The functional adaptive responses of higher plants to biotic interactions with herbivores and fungi have long been topics of research. One constraint to obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the most general plant responses, however, has been the difficulty of studying all plant functional shifts simultaneously due to analytical limitations. Now this is possible with the advent of metabolomics. Using 151 records from the WEB of SCIENCE database, we have analyzed the development and application of metabolomic profiles to ecological studies in the last two decades. We have used meta-analysis and pathway enrichment analyses to assess the whole set of constitutive and inducible defenses. Constitutive defenses against herbivores were mainly based on a significant high level of the metabolism of several amino acids with parallel increases in the concentrations of flavones (phenolics) and saponins (glycosides). Inducible defenses, though, were mainly based on the increases in concentration of methyl-ketone, pantothenate, and Coenzyme A. Butyrate metabolism and the mitochondrial electron-transport chain were upregulated, in agreement with previous reports that herbivory-activated plant chemical defenses were mainly based on jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene-associated pathways. The metabolic responses/acclimations to pathogenic fungi were mainly linked with increases in aspartate and pyruvate metabolism, the transfer of acetyl groups within mitochondria, and the upregulation of branched-chain amino acids degradation pathways. These responses/acclimations were accompanied by higher concentrations of the most important groups of secondary metabolites such as phenolics (anthocyanins, flavonoids), quinones, alkaloids, terpenoids, and polyamines and other compounds related to antistress mechanisms such as proline. The leaves of mycorrhized plants accumulated nucleotide sugars, sphingolipids, and methylhistidine. These responses were associated with maintaining the integrity of plant cell membranes under fungal hypha penetration. The responses were accompanied by increases in the concentrations of phenolics, blumenols, and alkaloids and decreases in the concentrations of polyamines, consistent with the mycorrhizal inhibition of polyamines. This summary provides a clear synthesis of the most successful plant strategies selected after millions of years of evolution and will be a very promising tool for the management of crops and ecosystems and for selecting the main lines in breeding studies for future research.

AB  - Diet plays a pivotal role in the biology of apex predators, shaping their ecological niche, population dynamics, distribution, and adaptability to global changes. The African wolf (Canis lupaster), a large canid endemic to Africa, was recently delineated as a distinct species, taxonomically phagocytizing what was formerly considered the African golden jackal. In this study, we characterised for the first time through DNA metabarcoding the omnivorous diet of the African wolf based on faecal samples collected in northern Algeria. Our results highlighted PCR false negatives in COI (arthropods), while 12S (vertebrates) and trnl (plants) were, respectively, prone to host DNA over-representation and lower taxonomic resolution. Despite these limitations, DNA metabarcoding detected a broader range of consumed items than the morphological analysis applied to the faecal samples, and revealed two vertebrate species, one order of arthropods, and 11 plant families not previously described as part of the African wolf's diet. The African wolf exhibited an overall reliance on vertebrates and plants with both wild and domestic origins, suggesting yet unobserved cooperative hunting of large prey (wild boar) and regular feeding on livestock carcasses in anthropized areas. Our results indicate that the species employs an opportunistic foraging strategy, with a seasonal shift driven by the abundant consumption of a cultivated fruit (Ficus carica) in summer. Because reliance on farming activities might exacerbate conflicts with humans, there is a need for better knowledge on the foraging strategies of the African wolf, to which further improved, multigene DNA metabarcoding can contribute.

AB  - This study evaluates the economic viability of sheep finishing systems on irrigated Tamani grass pasture under continuous stocking, using castor bean cake. Four production systems were simulated: sheep supplemented with soybean meal on pasture fertilized with urea (SMUR), sheep supplemented with detoxified castor bean cake on pasture fertilized with urea (CCdUR), sheep supplemented with soybean meal on pasture fertilized with in natura castor bean cake (SMCC) and sheep supplemented with detoxified castor bean cake on pasture fertilized with in natura castor bean cake (CCdCC). A minimum unit of 3 hectares and an average slaughter weight of 28 kg were considered. A minimum selling price, at which the least profitable system would become profitable, was stablished: US$ 2.38 and US$ 4.45/kg per kilogram of body weight and carcass weight equivalent, adopting a minimum rate of return of 3.5% per year, based on the Selic rate. The costs for organic fertilization were 46.01% higher than in systems using chemical fertilization. The selling of live animals was not attractive in any of the systems evaluated, and the opposite was observed for the selling of carcasses and non-carcass components. System SMUR proved to be more profitable, with a gain of US$ 0.53 per kg carcass.

AB  - Counteracting goat reproduction seasonality and ensuring acceptable fertility rates are critical points of the success of selection of synchronisation protocols. The present study aims to investigate the factors that affect the performance of specific protocols to increase the probability of pregnancy results in the Murciano-Granadina breed within the official breeding program and way in which such factors interrelate. This study evaluated 11,008 artificial inseminations carried out between 2010 and 2013, using three different synchronisation protocols and eCG combinations. A categorical regression model (CATREG) was used to determine the impact of farm, doe age, birth number, kidding type, kid number, number of alive and dead born kids, synchronisation protocol, kidding month, type of semen, kidding season, eCG concentration, and their inter-actions. Results indicated that all variables, except for the number of alive and dead kids and semen type, significantly (p < 0.05) contributed to explaining the variability in pregnancy rates. Conclusively, rather than the role of eCG levels and artificial insemination (AI) protocol separately, Farm x eCG x AI Protocol interaction and the multifactorial influences on pregnancy rates should be considered when selecting does for insemination to maximise the outcomes of reproductive performance.

AB  - Featured Application The proposed technique is an application for people detection and counting which is evaluated over several challenging benchmark datasets. The technique can be applied in heavy crowd assistance systems that help to find targeted persons, to track functional movements and to maximize the performance of surveillance security. Automatic head tracking and counting using depth imagery has various practical applications in security, logistics, queue management, space utilization and visitor counting. However, no currently available system can clearly distinguish between a human head and other objects in order to track and count people accurately. For this reason, we propose a novel system that can track people by monitoring their heads and shoulders in complex environments and also count the number of people entering and exiting the scene. Our system is split into six phases; at first, preprocessing is done by converting videos of a scene into frames and removing the background from the video frames. Second, heads are detected using Hough Circular Gradient Transform, and shoulders are detected by HOG based symmetry methods. Third, three robust features, namely, fused joint HOG-LBP, Energy based Point clouds and Fused intra-inter trajectories are extracted. Fourth, the Apriori-Association is implemented to select the best features. Fifth, deep learning is used for accurate people tracking. Finally, heads are counted using Cross-line judgment. The system was tested on three benchmark datasets: the PCDS dataset, the MICC people counting dataset and the GOTPD dataset and counting accuracy of 98.40%, 98%, and 99% respectively was achieved. Our system obtained remarkable results.

AB  - Simple Summary The enteric nervous system (ENS) is responsible for regulating the main functions of the intestines, i.e., absorption, secretion, peristalsis and sensation. The ENS is composed of nerve cells that form clusters in the form of ganglia arranged in nerve plexuses. Individual ganglia communicate through a system of nerve fibres. Each nerve cell or nerve fibre contains biologically active substances exerting a specific effect on the ENS. One such substance is extracellular adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP), which by activating purinoreceptors (including P2X2 receptors) may affect the functioning of the ENS. Previous research on the P2X2 receptor has focused mainly on laboratory animals, while little is known about this receptor in large mammals. Therefore, our research concerned the presence of the P2X2 receptor in the ENS of the small intestine of the pig and whether it coexists with the biologically active substances included in standard analyses in the ENS. The research showed that the P2X2 receptor is present in the neurons of the small intestine and coexists with some of the biologically active substances tested. These findings may suggest that the P2X2 receptor, activated by ATP, may exert an influence on the function of the small intestinal ENS of the pig. Extracellular adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) is one of the best-known and frequently studied neurotransmitters. Its broad spectrum of biological activity is conditioned by the activation of purinergic receptors, including the P2X2 receptor. The P2X2 receptor is present in the central and peripheral nervous system of many species, including laboratory animals, domestic animals, and primates. However, the distribution of the P2X2 receptor in the nervous system of the domestic pig, a species increasingly used as an experimental model, is as yet unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the presence of the P2X2 receptor in the neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the pig small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) by the immunofluorescence method. In addition, the chemical code of P2X2-immunoreactive (IR) ENS neurons of the porcine small intestine was analysed by determining the coexistence of selected neuropeptides, i.e., vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P (sP), and galanin. P2X2-IR neurons were present in the myenteric plexus (MP), outer submucosal plexus (OSP), and inner submucosal plexus (ISP) of all sections of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). From 44.78 +/- 2.24% (duodenum) to 63.74 +/- 2.67% (ileum) of MP neurons were P2X2-IR. The corresponding ranges in the OSP ranged from 44.84 +/- 1.43% (in the duodenum) to 53.53 +/- 1.21% (in the jejunum), and in the ISP, from 53.10 +/- 0.97% (duodenum) to 60.57 +/- 2.24% (ileum). Immunofluorescence staining revealed the presence of P2X2-IR/galanin-IR and P2X2-IR/VIP-IR neurons in the MP, OSP, and ISP of the sections of the small intestine. The presence of sP was not detected in the P2X2-IR neurons of any ganglia tested in the ENS. Our results indicate for the first time that the P2X2 receptor is present in the MP, ISP, and OSP neurons of all small intestinal segments in pigs, which may suggest that its activation influences the action of the small intestine. Moreover, there is a likely functional interaction between P2X2 receptors and galanin or VIP, but not sP, in the ENS of the porcine small intestine.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) infection of the CNS produces synapse loss which correlates with cognitive decline in patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Lithium is mood stabilizer of unknown mechanism used to treat bipolar disorder and is known to exhibit neuroprotective properties. Here, we studied the effects of lithium on HIV-1 Tat-induced synapses between rat hippocampal neurons. The number of synapses was quantified to detect clusters of the scaffold protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) which is clustered at glutamatergic synapses on cultured rat hippocampal neurons in vitro. Lithium protected synapses from HIV-1 Tat-induced synapse loss and subsequent neuronal death. This synaptic protection was prevented by both the activation of NMDA receptor leading to intracellular signaling and the regulatory pathway of lithium including inositol depletion and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta). These results suggest that mood stabilizers might be effective drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders including HAND.

AB  - Citri Grandis Exocarpium (CGE) is derived from the immature or nearly mature dried outer peel of Citrus grandis 'Tomentosa' (Huazhou pomelo) or C. grandis (L.) Osbeck (pomelo). CGE is a traditional medicinal herb from Guangdong Province (China) that primarily contains active substances, such as flavonoids, with expectorant, antitussive, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the differences in quality and the mechanisms underlying these differences between the two plant sources specified in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia have not been fully elucidated. For the first time, this study systematically analyzed Huazhou pomelo (C. grandis 'Tomentosa' ) from its authentic production region and Sanhong pomelo (C. grandis (L.) Osbeck) from Meizhou by using an integrated analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics. The results showed that the flavonoid components in both extracts were generally consistent, indicating that both pomelos could serve as sources of CGE. However, the content differed significantly. Flavonoids related to medicinal effects, such as naringin and hesperidin, were significantly more abundant in Huazhou pomelo than in Sanhong pomelo, with compounds such as 5-demethylnobiletin detected only in Huazhou pomelo. The integrative metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis identified 11 key structural genes and transcription factors potentially involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, providing candidate targets for functional validation. This study uncovered the molecular basis for Huazhou pomelo being superior in quality to Sanhong pomelo as an authentic medicinal material for CGE and provided scientific evidence for optimizing quality standards and enhancing its commercial value. Furthermore, this study provided a theoretical foundation for further functional research.

AB  - Laron syndrome (LS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and high levels of growth hormone (GH) due to mutations in the growth hormone receptor gene (GHR). A GHR-knockout (GHR-KO) pig was developed as a model for LS, which displays many of the same features as humans with LS-like transient juvenile hypoglycemia. This study aimed to investigate the effects of impaired GHR signaling on immune functions and immunometabolism in GHR-KO pigs. GHR are located on various cell types of the immune system. Therefore, we investigated lymphocyte subsets, proliferative and respiratory capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), proteome profiles of CD4(-) and CD4(+) lymphocytes and IFN-a serum levels between wild-type (WT) controls and GHR-KO pigs, which revealed significant differences in the relative proportion of the CD4(+)CD8a(-) subpopulation and in IFN-a levels. We detected no significant difference in the respiratory capacity and the capacity for polyclonal stimulation in PBMCs between the two groups. But proteome analysis of CD4(+) and CD4(-) lymphocyte populations revealed multiple significant protein abundance differences between GHR-KO and WT pigs, involving pathways related to amino acid metabolism, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, insulin secretion signaling, and oxidative phosphorylation. This study highlights the potential use of GHR-KO pigs as a model for studying the effects of impaired GHR signaling on immune functions.

AB  - The presence of Salmonella in pig feces is a major source of abattoir and carcass contamination, and one of the main sources of human salmonellosis. This study assessed whether using a form of esterified formic acid (30% formic acid) in drinking water (10 kg/1000 L) 5 days before slaughter could be a helpful strategy to mitigate this public health issue. Thus, 240 pigs from three Salmonella-positive commercial fattening farms were selected. From each farm, 40 pigs were allocated to a control group (CG) and 40 to a treatment group (TG). At the abattoir, fecal samples from both groups were collected for Salmonella detection (ISO 6579-1:2017) and quantification (ISO/TS 6579-2:2012). Salmonella was present in 35% (95% IC = 29.24-41.23) of the samples collected. The prevalence was significantly higher in the CG than in the TG (50% vs. 20%; p < 0.001). In all farms, the TG showed a lower percentage of shedders than the CG. A random-effects logistic model showed that the odds of shedding Salmonella were 5.63 times higher (95% CI = 2.92-10.8) for the CG than for the TG. Thus, the proportion of pigs shedding Salmonella that was prevented in the TG due to the use of this form of organic acid was 82.2%. In addition, a Chi-squared analysis for trends showed that the higher the Salmonella count, the higher the odds of the sample belonging to the CG. These results suggest that adding this type of acid to drinking water 5 days before slaughter could reduce the proportion of Salmonella-shedding pigs and the Salmonella loads in the guts of shedder pigs.

AB  - Ankylosaurs are a widespread but rare constituent of the latest Cretaceous dinosaur faunas of Europe. In the famous Upper Cretaceous continental deposits of the Ha & tcedil;eg Basin (Romania), ankylosaurs were first reported over 100 years ago and since then have been found in various localities across the wider Transylvanian area; nevertheless, they still represent an uncommon faunal component. We report here the first evidence of the group from the fossil-rich Maastrichtian 'Pui Beds' of the eastern Ha & tcedil;eg Basin. The specimen, an isolated scapula, can be confidently assigned to Struthiosaurus sp. based on thorough morphological comparisons. Among the scapulae referred to Struthiosaurus from France, Austria and Romania, the Pui scapula is most similar to S. transylvanicus from roughly coeval strata of the central Ha & tcedil;eg Basin. Besides reporting this new specimen, we provide a detailed overview of the ankylosaur fossil record from Transylvania and discuss its implications for the palaeoecology and evolution of ankylosaurs in the eastern part of the Late Cretaceous European Archipelago. Contrary to previous hypotheses, ankylosaurs do not seem to have been environmentally segregated from the more common sympatric herbivorous dinosaur clades (rhabdodontids, titanosaurs, hadrosauroids) on Ha & tcedil;eg Island, but instead were widely distributed albeit numerically subordinate members of the palaeofauna(s). According to our updated overview, ankylosaurs first appeared in the Transylvanian Basin and only later show up in the Ha & tcedil;eg Basin. Finally, in stark contrast to the situation in the western Ibero-Armorican Landmass, ankylosaurs were present throughout the entire Maastrichtian in the Transylvanian area.

AB  - Ovarian aging results in reproductive disorders and infertility in mammals. Previous studies have reported that the ferroptosis and autophagy caused by oxidative stress may lead to ovarian aging, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we compared the morphological characteristics between the aged and young ovaries of pigs and found that the aged ovaries were larger in size and showed more corpora lutea. TUNEL assay further showed that the apoptosis level of granulosa cells (GCs) was relatively higher in the aged ovaries than those in young ovaries, as well as the expressions of autophagy-associated genes, e.g., p62, ATG7, ATG5, and BECN1, but that the expressions of oxidative stress and aging-associated genes, e.g., SOD1, SIRT1, and SIRT6, were significantly lower. Furthermore, the RNA-seq, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence suggested that phospholipid phosphatase 3 (PLPP3) protein was significantly upregulated in the aged ovaries. PLPP3 was likely to decrease the expressions of SIRT1 and SIRT6 to accelerate cellular senescence of porcine GCs, inhibit the expressions of SOD1, CAT, FSP1, FTH1, and SLC7A11 to exacerbate oxidative stress and ferroptosis, and arouse autophagy to retard the follicular development. In addition, two SNPs of PLPP3 promoter were significantly associated with the age at puberty. g.155798586 (T/T) and g.155798718 (C/C) notably facilitated the mRNA and protein level of PLPP3. In conclusion, PLPP3 might aggravate the oxidative stress of GCs to accelerate ovarian aging, and two molecular markers of PLPP3 were identified for ovarian aging in pigs. This work not only contributes to investigations on mechanisms for ovarian aging but also provides valuable molecular markers to postpone ovarian aging in populations.

AB  - Research on the effects of organic and inorganic Cu sources on metabolic processes and mechanisms in pigs is lacking. This study investigated the effects of different copper (Cu) sources and levels on hepatic Cu metabolism and transporter factors in growing pigs. Sixty healthy piglets (initial body weight 14.00 +/- 0.30 kg) were randomly divided into four groups with five replicates of three pigs each. Four diets (AM, AH, BM, and BH) had different Cu sources [Cu sulphate (CuSO4): A and Cu amino acids (Cu-AA): B] and levels [supplemented (120 mg/kg DM): M, supplemented (240 mg/kg DM): H]. The pre-feeding period was 7 days, followed by a 45-day feeding period. Slaughter and sample collection were carried out on the 46th day of the formal feeding period. Significant differences were considered at p < 0.05. The final weight and average daily gain (ADG) of growing pigs in the Cu-AA groups were significantly higher than those in the CuSO4 groups. Serum Cu increased with increasing Cu supplementation on days 20 and 40. Cu concentrations in muscle, liver, and liver subcellular organelles were higher in Cu-AA groups. In the CuSO(4 )groups, Cu concentrations were higher in kidneys and faeces. In Cu-AA groups, both the Cu concentrations in lysosomes and cytosol were higher, and the activities of cathepsin D (CTSD), beta-glucosidase (BGL), and acid phosphatase (ACP) in lysosomes and cytoplasm were higher. Comparisons between groups showed that liver mRNA of copper transporter protein 1 (CTR1), ATPase copper-transporting beta (ATP7B), ceruloplasmin (CP), antioxidant protein 1 (ATOX1), and metallothionein (MT) was lower in the CuSO(4 )group than in the Cu-AA group, with the best performance at 120 mg/kg Cu. mRNAs for ATPase copper-transporting alpha (ATP7A), cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone 17 (COX17), and copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) showed a decreasing trend in the Cu-AA groups. Cu-AA is better for Cu deposition, enhances the utilisation of Cu, reduces Cu excretion, and promotes the expression of relevant enzymes and transporters in the liver.

AB  - Simple Summary: Evaluating disease control in commercial pig herds requires the use of infection surveillance tools as well as observing clinical signs and measuring production changes. Many disease control studies evaluate treatments in research facilities where conditions do not equate with commercial farms, specifically with respect to the presence of multiple and repeated challenges to pigs. This study evaluated the control of the wasting disease proliferative enteropathy with disinfection, vaccination, and/or medication in 84 pig pens under commercial conditions using epidemiological tools. Vaccinated pigs housed in lime-disinfected pens showed the best control of proliferative enteropathy with reduced diarrhea and fecal shedding of Lawsonia intracellularis and an increased growth rate and prevalence of protective antibodies. Continuous medication with olaquindox prevented L. intracellularis infection until it was removed at 17 weeks of age, leaving na & iuml;ve finisher pigs susceptible to intestinal hemorrhage, bloody feces, reduced growth, and mortalities. To avoid proliferative enteropathy, control strategies need to suppress but not prevent L. intracellularis infection, while enabling protective antibodies to develop. This study demonstrated the value of monitoring the timing and level of excretion of L. intracellularis in pig pens to compare proliferative enteropathy control on commercial farms. Proliferative enteropathy (PE) is characterized by diarrhea and reduced weight gains in growing pigs and intestinal hemorrhage in finishers. Vaccination, antibiotic medication, and improved hygiene can control PE, but their efficacy depends upon the epidemiology of PE. This study monitored the timing and severity of PE in 84 commercial pens across seven treatments, including disinfection, vaccination, no treatment, medication with olaquindox (50, 25 and 12.5 ppm), and combined disinfection and vaccination. Vaccination with or without lime disinfection suppressed clinical signs of PE and reduced the number of excreted L. intracellularis relative to untreated pigs housed in cleaned or cleaned and disinfected pens between 9 and 17 weeks of age. Continuous olaquindox mediation to 17 weeks of age prevented L. intracellularis infection, leaving finisher pigs na & iuml;ve. These finisher pigs suffered an outbreak of hemorrhagic enteropathy with significant reductions in weight gain, feed intake, and mortalities of 4.6%. Over the 13 week grow/finish period, vaccinated pigs housed in disinfected pens showed significantly higher weight gain and feed intake relative to all other treatments, equating to a weight gain difference of between 3.6 and 3.9 kg per pig. Monitoring the immune response and fecal excretion of L. intracellularis in pens of pigs enabled effective PE control strategies to be evaluated on the farm.

AB  - Food storing to cope with food reduction during winter has been observed in many rodents in the northern hemisphere. Food storing could also be adaptive in semi-deserts of the southern hemisphere, which experience food-restricted dry seasons. We studied the function of dried food plants found at the stick lodges of bush Karoo rats in a semi-desert in South Africa. We performed 998 focal animal observations and monitored 12 lodges to record the fate of plant pieces carried back to the lodges. Collected plant species were eaten green (68 %), eaten as plantong (12 %), incorporated into the structure of the lodge (11 %), or their fate was unknown (9 %). Especially succulents carried back to the lodge dried out, forming what we refer to as plantong. This happened mainly in the food rich moist season. However, plantong was not stored from the moist to the dry season but was consumed within 6 +/- 5 days. Bush Karoo rats readily ate plantong presented to them experimentally. We regard plantong as leftover from food freshly consumed at the lodge, but not as food collected in the moist season to be stored for later consumption during the dry season.

AB  - The effect of diets containing 0% of wheat bran levels (control buffel grass and cactus pear) contrasted with diets with cactus pear as the only forage source and wheat bran levels (30; 37 and 44%) on nutrient digestibility, feed intake, animal performance, carcass characteristics, and economic analysis was evaluated. Twenty-eight male, non-castrated crossbred lambs (22.6 +/- 2.37 kg) were submitted to confinement for 62 days. A completely randomized design was used with four treatments and seven repetitions. Four diets were formulated considering an intended mean daily weight gain of 200 g/animal/day. Means were compared by contrasts using Dunnett test at 5%. Animals fed cactus pear as the only roughage source (diets with 30; 37, and 44% of wheat bran) had lower dry matter intake and nutrient intake, Average Dairy Gain, and total weight gain than animals fed the control diet. Final body weight and slaughter weight of animals fed 44% of wheat bran was similar to the animals fed the control diet. Hot and cold carcass yields were higher in animals fed cactus pear and 30 and 37% of wheat bran. Feeding costs were lower when cactus pear was used as the only roughage source associated with wheat bran and consequently profit was greater. The use of cactus pear as the only roughage source associated with up to 44% of wheat bran is a viable alternative of the diet to confined lambs without modifying carcass characteristics with greater cost:benefit ratio.

AB  - Several lines of evidence have consistently indicated that physical exercise has antidepressant effects by improving hippocampal function, although the signaling pathways underpinning these responses are not well established. Therefore, this study investigated the role of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin signaling in the antidepressant-like effect of physical exercise. We showed that physical exercise (treadmill running - 45 min/day/5 days/week for 4 weeks) produced an antidepressant-like effect as indicated by a reduction on the immobility time in mice subjected to the forced swimming test (FST) without altering locomotor activity in the open field test (OFT). Rapamycin (a selective mTORC1 inhibitor, 0.2 nmol/site, i.c.v.) administration completely abolished the antidepressant-like effect of physical exercise in the FST, suggesting that mTORC1 activation plays a role for its behavioral effect. Accordingly, physical exercise increased the number of phosphorylated mTORC1 (Ser2448)-positive cells in the entire and ventral subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyms. Physical exercise was also effective in augmenting the hippocampal FNDC5/irisin immunocontent, but rapamycin administration did not alter this effect. Our results reinforce the notion that physical exercise exerts an antidepressant-like effect and identifies the mTORC1-mediated signaling pathway as a target for its behavioral effects. This study provides additional evidence that physical exercise increases hippocampal FNDC5/irisin immunocontent, but this effect seems to be independent on hippocampal mTORC1 activation. Altogether the results contribute to elucidate possible molecular targets implicated in the antidepressant effects of physical exercise and highlight the role of mTORC1 signaling for its behavioral response.

AB  - Simple SummaryThis study investigated the effect of various growth factors and hormones in an in vitro growth medium on in vitro maturation and the developmental competence of oocytes derived from small antral follicles in pigs. Cumulus-oocyte complexes derived from small antral follicles (<3 mm) were cultured in an in vitro growth medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin, or growth hormone (GH). The effects on oocyte growth, nuclear progression, oocyte maturation, and embryonic development after parthenogenesis were examined. Insulin treatment during oocyte growth was found to have a positive effect on nuclear maturation, embryonic development after parthenogenesis, and the expansion of cumulus cells. Insulin showed positive results by enhancing cytoplasmic maturation, decreasing free radical content, and increasing maturation-promoting factor activity.This study evaluated the effect of various growth factors and hormones in an in vitro growth (IVG) medium on the in vitro maturation (IVM) and developmental competence of oocytes derived from small antral follicles (SAFs) in pigs. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) derived from SAFs were either untreated or treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin, or growth hormone (GH) for 2 days of IVG. Following IVG, COCs were cultured for maturation, and IVM oocytes were induced for parthenogenesis (PA). During IVG, the nuclear maturation of oocytes was significantly increased by the insulin treatment compared to other treatments. Moreover, the insulin treatment significantly increased blastocyst formation after PA relative to the No-IVG, control, EGF, and GH treatments. The cumulus expansion score after IVG-IVM was significantly higher in the insulin group than in the other groups. The glutathione (GSH) contents in IVM oocytes were increased through treatment with IGF, insulin, and GH compared to those of No-IVG oocytes. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in IVM oocytes in all treatment groups was significantly lower after IVG culture than in the No-IVG group. The maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity after IVM in the insulin-treated oocytes was significantly higher than that of the oocytes treated with EGF, IGF-1, and GH. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that insulin treatment during IVG culture improves the maturational and developmental competence of oocytes derived from SAFs in pigs through its effect on cumulus cell expansion and cytoplasmic microenvironments, such as GSH, ROS, and MPF activity.

AB  - For more than 350 million years, there have been ongoing dynamic interactions between plants and insects. In several cases, insects cause-specific feeding damage with ensuing herbivore-associated molecular patterns that invoke characteristic defense responses. During feeding on plant tissue, insects release oral secretions (OSs) containing a repertoire of molecules affecting plant defense (effectors). Some of these OS components might elicit a defense response to combat insect attacks (elicitors), while some might curb the plant defenses (suppressors). Few reports suggest that the synthesis and function of OS components might depend on the host plant and associated microorganisms. We review these intricate plant-insect interactions, during which there is a continuous exchange of molecules between plants and feeding insects along with the associated microorganisms. We further provide a list of commonly identified inducible plant produced defensive molecules released upon insect attack as well as in response to OS treatments of the plants. Thus, we describe how plants specialized and defense-related metabolism is modulated at innumerable phases by OS during plant-insect interactions. A molecular understanding of these complex interactions will provide a means to design eco-friendly crop protection strategies.

AB  - The Ullafelsen at 1869 m above sea level (a.s.l.) in the Tyrolean Stubai Alps next to Innsbruck is an important (geo)archeological reference site for the Mesolithic period. Buried fireplaces on the Ullafelsen plateau were dated at 10.9 to 9.5 ka cal BP and demonstrate together with thousands of flint stone artifacts the presence of hunter-gatherers during the Early Holocene. Grazing livestock has been a predominant anthropozoological impact in the Fotsch Valley presumably since the Bronze Age (4.2-2.8 ka). In order to study the human and/or livestock faeces input on the Ullafelsen, we carried out steroid analyses on 2 modern ruminant faeces samples from cattle and sheep, 37 soil samples from seven archeological soil profiles, and 9 soil samples from five non-archeological soil profiles from the Fotsch Valley used as reference sites. The dominance of 5 beta-stigmastanol and deoxycholic acid in modern cattle and sheep faeces can be used as markers for the input of ruminant faeces in soils. The OAh horizons, which have accumulated and developed since the Mesolithic, revealed high contents of steroids (sterols, stanols, stanones and bile acids); the eluvial light layer (E (LL)) horizon coinciding with the Mesolithic living floor is characterized by medium contents of steroids. By contrast, the subsoil horizons Bh, Bs and BvCv contain low contents of faecal biomarkers, indicating that leaching of steroids into the podsolic subsoils is not an important factor. High content of 5 beta-stigmastanol and deoxycholic acid in all soil samples gives evidence for faeces input of ruminants. The steroid patterns and ratios indicate a negligible input of human faeces on the Ullafelsen. In conclusion, our results reflect a strong faeces input by livestock, rather than by humans as found for other Anthrosols such as Amazonian dark earths. Further studies need to focus on the question of the exact timing of faeces deposition.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the views and concerns of precision livestock farming (PLF) held by the key players in the US swine industry is particularly important for its widespread acceptability. Using a Q-methodology approach following initial individual in-depth interviews 6 months earlier, we found that while most stakeholders view PLF as good and beneficial to pigs and humans, some expressed concerns about its limitations and pitfalls. Specifically, stakeholders who are optimistic about PLF think it should augment but not replace effective management. They also think it will improve pig health, welfare, and make pig keepers' jobs simpler, safer, and better. However, stakeholders who are concerned about PLF view it as a poor proxy for farmers to keep an eye on the herd, see issues, and resolve them. They also believe PLF does little to lessen the negative effects of swine farming on the environment. We contend that competing perceived benefits and concerns about PLF may hinder widespread adoption.Abstract This study used the Q-methodology approach to analyze perceptions of precision livestock farming (PLF) technology held by stakeholders directly or indirectly involved in the US swine industry. To see if stakeholders' perceptions of PLF changed over time as PLF is a rapidly evolving field, we deliberately followed up with stakeholders we had interviewed 6 months earlier. We identified three distinct points of view: PLF improves farm management, animal welfare, and laborer work conditions; PLF does not solve swine industry problems; PLF has limitations and could lead to data ownership conflict. Stakeholders with in-depth knowledge of PLF technology demonstrated elevated levels of optimism about it, whereas those with a basic understanding were skeptical of PLF claims. Despite holding different PLF views, all stakeholders agreed on the significance of training to enhance PLF usefulness and its eventual adoption. In conclusion, we believe this study's results hold promise for helping US swine industry stakeholders make better-informed decisions about PLF technology implementation.

AB  - The lateral habenula (LHb) is a critical brain structure involved in the aversive response to drug abuse. It has been determined that the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system plays the main role in morphine dependency. The role of GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) in LHb on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) remains unknown. In this study, the effect of bilateral intra-LHb microinjection of GABA(A)R agonist and antagonist on the acquisition and expression phases of CPP, utilizing a 5-day CPP paradigm in male rats, was evaluated. Subcutaneous administration of different doses of morphine caused a dose-dependent CPP. Intra-LHb microinjection of the GABA(A)R agonist, muscimol, in combination with morphine (5 mg/kg; subcutaneously) enhanced CPP scores in the acquisition phase of morphine CPP, whereas the GABA(A)R antagonist, bicuculline, significantly reduced the conditioning scores in the acquisition phase. Furthermore, pretreatment with a high dose of bicuculline reversed the additive effect of muscimol during the acquisition phase, yet the low dose of antagonist had no significant effect on agonist-induced CPP scores. On the other hand, muscimol (3 mu g/rat) significantly increased CPP scores in the expression phase but bicuculline did not induce a significant effect on CPP scores. Bicuculline and muscimol microinjections did not affect locomotor activity in the testing sessions. Our results confirm that GABA(A)Rs in LHb play an active role in morphine reward. In addition, microinjections of bicuculline/muscimol may alter the morphine response through the GABAergic system.

AB  - This study focuses on the numerical investigation of the hull girder loads on a flexible containership S175 with intact and damaged conditions advancing in regular head waves. In this study, a two-way coupled fluid-structure interactions framework is applied, in which the interactions between the flooding water inside the damaged tanks and wave fields are modelled by a Computational Fluid Dynamics toolbox OpenFOAM. The structural deformation is predicted using a multibody solver MBDyn. Hydroelasticity computations are performed for two different damage scenarios. The numerical results obtained show that the damaged ship experiences less vertical motions but greater global wave loads than the intact ship. It is also demonstrated that ship damages greatly influence the hull girder vertical bending moments (VBMs), while still water VBM is sensitive to the added weight from flooding water. In specific ship-damage conditions, local hogging moments at several amidship sections are found to exceed the limits specified by international regulations. Therefore, a new safety factor is recommended to avoid hogging moments of damaged ships remain below the limiting value. The results can also be used to determine whether the damaged ship will experience secondary damage due to hydroelastic response, helping with the design of future conventional ships.

AB  - Ectotherms are particularly vulnerable to climate change, especially those living in extreme areas, such as deserts, where species are already thermally constrained. Using the vulnerable herbivorous lizard Saara hardwickii as a model system, we used a multi-pronged approach to understand the thermal ecology of a desert agamid and potential impacts of rising temperatures. Our data included field-based measures of operative temperatures, body temperatures, and activity, as well as lab-based measures of thermal limits, preferences, and sprint speed. As expected, the temperature dependence of locomotor performance and foraging activity were different, and in the worst-case global warming scenario (SSP5-8.5), potential sprint speed may decrease by up to 14.5% and foraging activity may decrease by up to 43.5% by 2099. Burrows are essential thermal refuges, and global warming projections suggest that S. hardwickii may be restricted to burrows for up to 9 h per day by 2099, which would greatly limit critical activities, like foraging and seeking mating opportunities. Overall, we show that key information on thermal ecology, including temperaturesensitive behaviours in the wild, is necessary to understand the multiple ways in which increasing temperatures may influence ectothermic vertebrates, especially for species like S. hardwickii that are already vulnerable to environmental change.

AB  - It has become clear that omnivorous predators can induce plant defences that affect the performance and host plant choice of herbivores. They are also known to induce the production of plant volatiles that can affect the behaviour of herbivores searching for plants. These volatiles may also affect the searching behaviour of other predators, which was investigated here. The predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis preferred plants previously exposed to the omnivorous mirid Macrolophus pygmaeus over clean plants. The mites were equally attracted to plants previously exposed to the omnivore and subsequently infested by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae, prey of the predatory mite and the omnivore) and plants infested with spider mites alone. Moreover, the mites were more attracted to plants infested with prey and subsequently exposed to the omnivore than plants infested with prey but not exposed to the omnivore. The predatory mites were also significantly more attracted to plants on which the omnivores were still present. Experience of the predatory mites with volatiles from plants previously exposed to the omnivore and without prey resulted in a loss of the preference for volatiles emitted by plants exposed to the omnivore. Analysis of the volatiles showed that plant exposure to omnivores induced qualitative and quantitative changes in the volatile blend. Together, these results suggest that omnivorous predators induce the production of plant volatiles that can interfere with the searching behaviour of other predators. The consequences of such interference for biological pest control remain to be investigated.

AB  - Aims: The present study was developed to investigate how litter reduction-induced obesity promotes early depressive-related behaviors in rodent offspring. Main methods: We employed a standardized litter size reduction protocol, dividing litters into groups: normal litters (NL), consisting of six males and six females pups and small litters (SL), comprising two males and two females pups. Maternal behavior was monitored during the initial week of lactation. Subsequently, we assessed the pups for weight gain, locomotor activity, social play behavior, and performance in forced swimming test. We further evaluated the weights of retroperitoneal and perigonadal fat tissues, along with the expression of glial fibrillary acidic pprotein (GFAP) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the offspring. Key findings: Our results indicated that litter size reduction led to an increased the maternal behavior. In contrast, offspring from the SL group displayed greater weight gain and increased, retroperitoneal and perigonadal fat. Both male and female rodents in the SL group exhibited decreased social play behavior, and male offspring spent more time immobile during the forced swimming test, suggesting a depressive-like phenotype. Notably, we observed an increase in the GFAP expression in the prefrontal cortex of male rodents, with a trend toward increased expression in the hippocampus. Significance: Obesity may facilitate the development of early depressive-like behaviors, potentially associated with elevated GFAP expression in the prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Background The behavioural repertoire of every species evolved over time and its evolution can be traced through the phylogenetic relationships in distinct groups. Cranes (family Gruidae) represent a small, old, monophyletic group with well-corroborated phylogenetic relationships on the species level, and at the same time they exhibit a complex and well-described behavioural repertoire. Methods We therefore investigated the evolution of behavioural traits of cranes in a phylogenetic context using several phylogenetic approaches and two types of trait scoring. The cranes exhibit more than a hundred behavioural displays, almost one third of which may be phylogenetically informative. Results More than half of the analysed traits carry a significant phylogenetic signal. The ancestor of cranes already exhibited a quite complex behavioural repertoire, which remained unchanged in Balearicinae but altered greatly in Gruinae, specifically by the shedding of traits rather than their creation. Trait scoring has an influence on results within the Gruinae, primarily in genera Bugeranus and Anthropoides. Conclusions Albeit the behavioural traits alone cannot be used for resolving species-level relationships within the Gruidae, when optimized on molecular tree, they can help us to detect interesting evolutionary transformations of behaviour repertoire within Gruiformes. The Limpkin (Aramus guarauna) seems to be the most enigmatic species and should be studied in detail for its behavioural repertoire, which may include some precursors of crane behavioural traits.

AB  - Lu3Al5O12:Ce3+ phosphor ceramics were fabricated by vacuum sintering. On this basis, a bi-layer composite phosphor was prepared by low-temperature sintering to cover the phosphor ceramics with a layer of SrAlSiN3:Eu2+-phosphor-in-glass (PiG). The optical, thermal, and colorimetric properties of LuAG:Ce3+ phosphor ceramics, SrAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphors and SrAlSiN3:Eu2+-PiG were studied individually. Combining the bi-layer composite phosphors with the blue LED chip, it is found that the spectrum can be adjusted by varying the doping concentration of SrAlSiN3:Eu2+-PiG and the thickness of Lu3Al5O12:Ce3+ phosphor ceramics. The maximal color rendering index value of the white LED is 86, and the R9 is 61. Under the excitation of a laser diode, the maximum phosphor conversion efficacy of the bi-layer composite phosphors is 120 lm/W, the R-a is 83, and the correlated color temperature is 4534 K. These results show that the bi-layer composite phosphor ceramic is a candidate material to achieve high color rendering index for high brightness lighting.

AB  - A resurgence in U.S. niche markets catering to customers demanding high-quality pork products has renewed U.S. producers' interest in lard-type, heritage breeds such as the Mangalica pig. However, the excessive amount of lard associated with Mangalica production poses a limitation to the adoption of this breed. This study aimed to determine if feeding 20 mg per kg of ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) to growing Mangalica pigs would improve their growth performance without impairing carcass merit. Feeding RAC improved both Average Daily Gain and gain efficiency while increasing loin eye area and promoting darker objective color scores. These changes occurred without impacting marbling score or measures of tenderness. Therefore, feeding RAC may be a viable strategy to improve the economic feasibility of utilizing this breed to target niche markets.Mangalica pigs are gaining popularity within the U.S. as a niche breed, given their reputation for superior-quality pork. However, slow growth rates, a poor lean yield, and excessive adiposity limit the widespread adoption of Mangalica. To determine if feeding the metabolic modifier, ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC), would improve growth performance without impairing pork quality in the Mangalica, pigs were fed either 0 or 20 mg per kg RAC for 21 days. At 24 h postharvest, pork quality and carcass composition measurements were recorded; then, primal cuts were fabricated and assessed. RAC increased ADG (p < 0.04) and gain efficiency (p < 0.03) by 24% and 21%, respectively. RAC increased Loin Eye Area (p < 0.0001) by 21% but did not impact the 10th rib fat depth (p > 0.90) or marbling score (p > 0.77). RAC failed to alter any primal cut weights. Feeding RAC lowered b* values (p < 0.04) and tended to lower L* values (p < 0.08) while not affecting a* values (p > 0.30), suggesting RAC darkened loin color. Finally, RAC decreased cook yield percentage (p < 0.02) by 11% without impacting Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (p > 0.31). These data support the hypothesis that feeding RAC to Mangalica improves growth performance without impairing pork quality in this breed.

AB  - Determination of the dynamics between microalgae and bacteria in pig farming biogas digestate is vital for a consistent and reliable application towards sustainable wastewater treatment and biofuel production. This study assesses the reliability of using physicochemical parameters as indicators for the rapid evaluation of microalgal bacterial dynamics in real digestate under impacts of light, nutrient loads, and N:P ratios. The relationship between variation profiles of nutrients, biomass and physicochemical properties in each experiment was analyzed. High light and high nutrient load enhanced biomass growth and nutrient removal rate. Ammonium addition (high N:P ratio) elevated NH3 level which inhibited the growth of microalgae, subsequently reducing the biomass growth and nutrient removal. Low N:P ratio triggered the accumulation of phosphorus and the growth of chlorophyll-a but exerted little influence on treatment. Variation profiles of dissolved oxygen, nutrient and biomass were highly consistent in every experiment allowing us to identify the shift from microalgal to bacterial predomination under unfavorable conditions including low light intensity and high N:P ratio. Strong linear correlation was also found between total nitrogen removal and electrical conductivity (R-2 = 0.9754). The results show the great potential of rapid evaluation of microalgal bacterial dynamics for large scale system optimization and modelling.

AB  - Background: As one of the four most valuable animal medicines, Fel Ursi, named Xiong Dan (XD) in China, has the effect of clearing heat, calming the liver, and brightening the eyes. However, due to the special source of XD and its high price, other animals' bile is often sold as XD or mixed with XD on the market, seriously affecting its clinical efficacy and consumers' rights and interests. In order to realize identification and adulteration analysis of XD, UHPLC-QTOF-MSE and multivariate statistical analysis were used to explore the differences in XD and six other animals' bile. Methods: XD, pig gall (Zhu Dan, ZD), cow gall (Niu Dan, ND), rabbit gallbladder (Tu Dan, TD), duck gall (Yan Dan, YD), sheep gall (Yang Dan, YND), and chicken gall (Ji Dan, JD) were analyzed by UHPLC-QTOF-MSE, and the MS data, combined with multivariate analysis methods, were used to distinguish between them. Meanwhile, the potential chemical composition markers that contribute to their differences were further explored. Results: The results showed that XD and six other animals' bile can be distinguished from each other obviously, with 27 ions with VIP > 1.0. We preliminarily identified 10 different bile acid-like components in XD and the other animals' bile with significant differences (p < 0.01) and VIP > 1.0, such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid, Glycohyodeoxycholic acid, and Glycodeoxycholic acid. Conclusions: The developed method was efficient and rapid in accurately distinguishing between XD and six other animals' bile. Based on the obtained chemical composition markers, it is beneficial to strengthen quality control for bile medicines.

AB  - In south-eastern Alpine region, archaeozoological research of Early Medieval contexts has for a long time been all but neglected. In recent years, however, a few sites have been systematically investigated providing the opportunity to get deeper insights into some of the most characteristic aspects of the role of various animals in the economy of human communities of the time. Animal husbandry provided most of the consumed meat with caprines, pigs and poultry often significantly outnumbering cattle. Considering also the diminishing body-size and the relatively high average age-at-death values of these animals, the settlements are believed to have been economically autarkic units, existing on subsistence economy. The fairly homogeneous pattern of intra-site spatial distribution of animal finds is indicative of limited social stratification and functional differentiation of the population. The interaction of the first Slavic newcomers of the 6th century AD with indigenous inhabitants in at least some parts of the studied area apparently resulted in a partial modification of animal husbandry strategy of the former, believed to have been traditionally based on pig rearing. The insights into the role of animals in the local mythology of that time are poor. The most prominent find is a canid skeleton from one of the burial sites, where it supposedly represented one of the points of spatial connotations of the area.

AB  - BackgroundPigs are excellent large animal models with several similarities to humans. They provide valuable insights into biomedical research that are otherwise difficult to obtain from rodent models. However, even if miniature pig strains are used, their large stature compared with other experimental animals requires a specific maintenance facility which greatly limits their usage as animal models. Deficiency of growth hormone receptor (GHR) function causes small stature phenotypes. The establishment of miniature pig strains via GHR modification will enhance their usage as animal models. Microminipig is an incredibly small miniature pig strain developed in Japan. In this study, we generated a GHR mutant pig using electroporation-mediated introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into porcine zygotes derived from domestic porcine oocytes and microminipig spermatozoa.Methods and resultsFirst, we optimized the efficiency of five guide RNAs (gRNAs) designed to target GHR in zygotes. Embryos that had been electroporated with the optimized gRNAs and Cas9 were then transferred into recipient gilts. After embryo transfer, 10 piglets were delivered, and one carried a biallelic mutation in the GHR target region. The GHR biallelic mutant showed a remarkable growth-retardation phenotype. Furthermore, we obtained F1 pigs derived from the mating of GHR biallelic mutant with wild-type microminipig, and GHR biallelic mutant F2 pigs through sib-mating of F1 pigs.ConclusionsWe have successfully demonstrated the generation of biallelic GHR-mutant small-stature pigs. Backcrossing of GHR-deficient pig with microminipig will establish the smallest pig strain which can contribute significantly to the field of biomedical research.

AB  - Historical records of the red brocket deer (Mazama temama) and the margay (Leopardus wiedii) in northeastern Mexico, particularly were limited to the southern of Tamaulipas. However, between September 2020 and November 2021, a mammal monitoring project was carried out using camera traps in the southern portion of Altas Cumbres, Victoria, Tamaulipas. Five camera traps georeferenced were installed and established near wildlife crossing sites. Among the documented mammals, the presence of M. temama and L. wiedii stands out, both recorded for the first time in the area. The presence of a pair of red brocket deer increases the northern range of the species to about 61.69 km. While, for margay, the northern record is expanded to 61.80 km, and the most northwestern population located in Nuevo Leon to 47.09 km, being a key link between these populations.

AB  - Simple Summary The rumen plays an essential role as a digestive organ and serves as the primary site of energy substrate absorption for the productive ruminants. Understanding gene expression profiles is necessary to explore the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms of rumen development in goats. The selection of suitable reference genes (RGs) was the primary assay before the real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We identified sixteen genome-wide candidate RGs for normalization of gene expression assessments in goat rumen tissues. We demonstrate that the RGs selected (RPS4X and RPS6) were more stably expressed than the commonly used HKGs (ACTB and GAPDH) in goat rumen tissues, suggesting that the ribosomal protein gene family may be another source for the RG pool. As the largest chamber of the ruminant stomach, the rumen not only serves as the principal absorptive surface and nutrient transport pathway from the lumen into the animal, but also plays an important short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolic role in addition to protective functions. Accurate characterization of the gene expression profiles of genes of interest is essential to the exploration of the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms of rumen development in goats. Thus, the selection of suitable reference genes (RGs) is an important prerequisite for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In the present study, 16 candidate RGs were identified from our previous transcriptome sequencing of caprine rumen tissues. The quantitative expressions of the candidate RGs were measured using the RT-qPCR method, and the expression stability of the RGs was assessed using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs. GeNorm analysis showed that the M values were less than 0.5 for all the RGs except GAPT4, indicating that they were stably expressed in the rumen tissues throughout development. RPS4X and RPS6 were the two most stable RGs. Furthermore, the expressions of two randomly selected target genes (IGF1 and TOP2A), normalized by the selected most stable RGs (RPS4X and RPS6), were consistent with the results of RNA sequencing, while the use of GAPDH and ACTB as RGs resulted in altered profiles. Overall, RPS4X and RPS6 showed the highest expression stability and the lowest coefficients of variation, and could be used as the optimal reference combination for quantifying gene expression in rumen tissues via RT-qPCR analysis.

AB  - Background Identification of biomarkers, which are measurable characteristics of biological datasets, can be challenging. Although amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be considered potential biomarkers, identifying important ASVs in high-throughput sequencing datasets is challenging. Noise, algorithmic failures to account for specific distributional properties, and feature interactions can complicate the discovery of ASV biomarkers. In addition, these issues can impact the replicability of various models and elevate false-discovery rates. Contemporary machine learning approaches can be leveraged to address these issues. Ensembles of decision trees are particularly effective at classifying the types of data commonly generated in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies due to their robustness when the number of features in the training data is orders of magnitude larger than the number of samples. In addition, when combined with appropriate model introspection algorithms, machine learning algorithms can also be used to discover and select potential biomarkers. However, the construction of these models could introduce various biases which potentially obfuscate feature discovery. Results We developed a decision tree ensemble, LANDMark, which uses oblique and non-linear cuts at each node. In synthetic and toy tests LANDMark consistently ranked as the best classifier and often outperformed the Random Forest classifier. When trained on the full metabarcoding dataset obtained from Canada's Wood Buffalo National Park, LANDMark was able to create highly predictive models and achieved an overall balanced accuracy score of 0.96 +/- 0.06. The use of recursive feature elimination did not impact LANDMark's generalization performance and, when trained on data from the BE amplicon, it was able to outperform the Linear Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression models, and Stochastic Gradient Descent models (p <= 0.05). Finally, LANDMark distinguishes itself due to its ability to learn smoother non-linear decision boundaries. Conclusions Our work introduces LANDMark, a meta-classifier which blends the characteristics of several machine learning models into a decision tree and ensemble learning framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply this type of ensemble approach to amplicon sequencing data and we have shown that analyzing these datasets using LANDMark can produce highly predictive and consistent models.

AB  - Cardiac fibrosis is a major public health problem worldwide, with high morbidity and mortality, affecting almost all patients with heart disease worldwide. It is characterized by fibroblast activation, abnormal proliferation, excessive deposition, and abnormal distribution of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The maladaptive process of cardiac fibrosis is complex and often involves multiple mechanisms. With the increasing research on cardiac fibrosis, redox has been recognized as an important part of cardiac remodeling, and an imbalance in redox homeostasis can adversely affect the function and structure of the heart. The metabolism of metal ions is essential for life, and abnormal metabolism of metal ions in cells can impair a variety of biochemical processes, especially redox. However, current research on metal ion metabolism is still very limited. This review comprehensively examines the effects of metal ion (iron, copper, calcium, and zinc) metabolism-mediated redox homeostasis on cardiac fibrosis, outlines possible therapeutic interventions, and addresses ongoing challenges in this rapidly evolving field.

AB  - Abnormal mossy fiber connections in the hippocampus have been implicated in schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear whether this abnormality in the patients is genetically determined and whether it contributes to the onset of schizophrenia. Here, we showed that iPSC-derived hippocampal NPCs from schizophrenia patients with the A/A allele at SNP rs16864067 exhibited abnormal NPC polarity, resulting from the downregulation of SOX11 by this high-risk allele. In the SOX11-deficient mouse brain, abnormal NPC polarity was also observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and this abnormal NPC polarity led to defective hippocampal neurogenesis-specifically, irregular neuroblast distribution and disrupted granule cell morphology. As granule cell synapses, the mossy fiber pathway was disrupted, and this disruption was resistant to activity-induced mossy fiber remodeling in SOX11 mutant mice. Moreover, these mutant mice exhibited diminished PPI and schizophrenia-like behaviors. Activation of hippocampal neurogenesis in the embryonic brain, but not in the adult brain, partially alleviated disrupted mossy fiber connections and improved schizophrenia-related behaviors in mutant mice. We conclude that disrupted mossy fiber connections are genetically determined and strongly correlated with schizophrenia-like behaviors in SOX11-deficient mice. This disruption may reflect the pathological substrate of SOX11-associated schizophrenia.

AB  - At the end of the 1950s, studies began to create high-yield cultivars with the aim of increasing the supply of basic foods in the world, this action was called "green evolution ". It was associated with the increase in the use of inputs to increase production levels, leading agriculture to a possible increase in environmental impacts and "harmful habits " of management. To characterize the historical damage of this action, it is necessary to use methods that generate universal results, capable of representing the world. Then, we use Life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate the historical evolution of the environmental impacts of the two main feedstock for feed in the world, soybeans, and corn, from 1961 to 2021. To better understand the variation in their impacts, we consider the change in agricultural management when we use as a functional unit the amount of area needed to produce 1 kg of grain. Although emissions and impacts from agriculture, by area, have increased each decade, when considering productivity through the area/production ratio, we note that a number of emissions were avoided, along with impacts in all categories evaluated. Therefore, the development and use of technologies that modify the area/production ratio can contribute to avoiding environmental impacts.

AB  - Cyclic changes in snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) fecundity have been attributed to changes in winter forage availability and predation pressure. Disentangling how nutrition and predation pressure affect snowshoe hare physiology is complex. As an herbivore of the northern boreal forests, snowshoe hares cope with extreme seasonal changes in diet, ambient temperature, and energy demands. We examined seasonal variation in the body condition index, blood biomarkers indicative of nutritional status, and fecal cortisol metabolite concentrations, in snowshoe hares across five ecologically distinct times of year in relation to adult survival rates. Snowshoe hares sampled from a high-density population in northern Alaska during 2018 showed decreases in survival and in plasma concentrations of total protein (TP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hematocrit (Hct), Chloride (Cl) and glucose during March and October. Increased survival and concentrations of Cl, TP, BUN, Hct, sodium (Na) and glucose were observed during August. Decreases in mass and survival from August to October suggest limited forage. Increases in TP, BUN, Hct and glucose in December suggest higher metabolic turnover. Fecal cortisol concentrations were not significantly associated with seasonal nutritional condition. A two-fold increase in mean cortisol was observed during August, potentially associated with energetically costly processes such as increased movement and reproduction. This work provides seasonal observations of snowshoe hare plasma biochemical values (N = 164) indicative of nutritional status, and supports the idea of using a collective biomarker approach to advance our understanding of how seasonality may play a role in snowshoe hare physiology.

AB  - The flesh fly Sarcophaga ruficornis (Fabricius) is one of the fly species of significant medical and forensic importance since it is one of the most common flesh flies used in forensic investigations. Zolpidem tartrate is a sedative-hypnotic drug used for the short-term treatment of insomnia in adults and its use has been implicated in many suicide cases worldwide. Fresh chopped liver of buffalo Bubalus bubalis (Artiodactyla: Bovidae) containing different concentrations of Zolpidem tartrate was given to S. ruficornis larvae to evaluate the effect of Zolpidem tartrate on the developmental rate of the different stages, life cycle duration, and the morphological parameters. The findings have shown significant variation in the time required for the different developmental stages and total life cycle duration, which correlated positively with the Zolpidem tartrate concentration in different cultures. Compared to the control, the morphological parameters were negatively correlated with the concentration of Zolpidem tartrate in the treated cultures. The obtained results indicate that the Zolpidem tartrate retards larval development and alters the estimation of the total developmental duration. Thus, when Zolpidem tartrate may be the cause of death, the entomological evidence needs to be analyzed so it takes zolpidem-related changes to the mPMI into account.

AB  - Hydrolyzable tannins (HTs), a class of polyphenolic compounds found in dicotyledonous plants, are widely used in food and pharmaceutical industries because of their beneficial effects on human health. Although the biosynthesis of simple HTs has been verified at the enzymatic level, relevant genes have not yet been identified. Here, based on the parent ion-fragment ion pairs in the feature fragment data obtained using UPLC-Q-TOF-/MS/MS, galloyl phenolic compounds in the leaves of Camellia sinensis and C. oleifera were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Correlation analysis between the transcript abundance of serine carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferases (SCPL-ATs) and the peak area of galloyl products in Camellia species showed that SCPL3 expression was highly correlated with HT biosynthesis. Enzymatic verification of the recombinant protein showed that CoSCPL3 from C. oleifera catalyzed the four consecutive steps involved in the conversion of digalloylglucose to pentagalloylglucose. We also identified the residues affecting the enzymatic activity of CoSCPL3 and determined that SCPL-AT catalyzes the synthesis of galloyl glycosides. The findings of this study provide a target gene for germplasm innovation of important cash crops that are rich in HTs, such as C. oleifera, strawberry, and walnut.

AB  - Prolonged stress beginning in adolescence can contribute to the dysregulation of the neuroendocrine system in adulthood. As the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems participate in bi-directional regulatory control, adolescent stress can prime the neuroimmune system to future inflammatory insults. Previous work from our group demonstrates that stress exaggerates the hippocampal response to inflammation, which can lead to deficits in learning and memory. In the current study, we sought to interrogate the interaction between an acute pe-ripheral challenge of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in male and female Wistar rats with a history of stress beginning in adolescence (CAS). Males from the CAS group were more vulnerable to the peripheral effects of LPS compared to non-stressed males including porphyrin staining and ruffled fur. In contrast, LPS generated similar peripheral effects in females regardless of adolescent stress history. Learning and memory were differentially impacted by LPS as a function of stress history and effects manifested differently when stratified by sex. Males with a history of adolescent stress exhibited deficits in initial learning. Females from the CAS group performed similar to controls during acquisition but exhibited a slight impairment during reversal learning. Males and females with a history of stress displayed memory impairment during the probe assessments as compared to their same-sex control group. We conclude that while stress beginning in adolescence enhanced the vulnerability of learning and memory to an inflammatory challenge, the phenotype of this effect manifested differently in males and females. These data demonstrate a sustained impact of adolescent stress on the neuroimmune system which is sufficient to influence cognitive performance in both sexes.

AB  - Exposure to electromagnetic radiation (ER) in the radio frequency is one of the most common and rapidly growing environmental factors affecting human. Therefore, given the increasing global growth of telecommunication towers and Wi-Fi waves, understanding the potential of positive or negative effects of Wi-Fi electromagnetic waves (WEW) on the quality and quantity parameters of plants is essential. An experiment was carried out during the years 2020-2021 at the Research Farm of Tarbiat Modares University to investigate the effect of WEW on grain yield, fatty acid composition (FA), oil content, and antioxidant properties of camelina. Seeds were subjected to Wi-Fi electromagnetic radiation at distances of 15 cm (ER15) and 25 cm (ER25) from the modem for 24 h. The results showed that electromagnetic waves significantly affected grain yield , increasing it by approximately 23.45%. Additionally, the amount of oil and protein, crucial components of camelina seeds, exhibited a respective increase of 6.91% and decrease of 2.9% under Wi-Fi radiation conditions. Total tocopherol decreased by 6.39%, while beta-T remained unaffected by Wi-Fi radiation. Furthermore, the quantity of sterols (brassicasterol, cholesterol, and campesterol) decreased significantly due to Wi-Fi radiation. Based on the fatty acid profile responses, the maximum content of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-ary sumation PUFA) was obtained in ER15 treatment, representing an increase of approximately 1.62%. Consequently, these waves resulted in a decrease in saturated fatty acids ( n-ary sumation SFA) and erucic acid, thereby increasing the quality of camelina oil. In conclusion, WEW pretreatment has potential to increase grain yield, oil percentage, and quality of camelina oil.

AB  - Hu sheep is an indigenous breed from the Taihu Lake Plain in China, known for its high fertility. Although Hu sheep belong to the Mongolian group, their demographic history and genetic architecture remain inconclusive. Here, we analyze 697 sheep genomes from representatives of Mongolian sheep breeds. Our study suggests that the ancestral Hu sheep first separated from the Mongolian group approximately 3000 years ago. As Hu sheep migrated from the north and flourished in the Taihu Lake Plain around 1000 years ago, they developed a unique genetic foundation and phenotypic characteristics, which are evident in the genomic footprints of selective sweeps and structural variation landscape. Genes associated with reproductive traits (BMPR1B and TDRD10) and horn phenotype (RXFP2) exhibit notable selective sweeps in the genome of Hu sheep. A genome-wide association analysis reveals that structural variations at LOC101110773, MAST2, and ZNF385B may significantly impact polledness, teat number, and early growth in Hu sheep, respectively. Our study offers insights into the evolutionary history of Hu sheep and may serve as a valuable genetic resource to enhance the understanding of complex traits in Hu sheep.

AB  - Groundwater acts as a natural insurance in ensuring sustainable freshwater supply for multiple sectors, as well as drinking water for 2.5 billion people globally. In Malaysia, Kelantan, Perlis, and Negeri Sembilan have shifted to groundwater as a freshwater alternative to combat existing water scarcity issues. Multiple sectors in Malaysia such as domestic (60%), industrial (35%), and agricultural (5%) sectors utilise groundwater to ensure economic progression. Aligning with the 6th Sustainable Development Goal (Clean Water and Sanitation), this study aims to assess the overall groundwater quality, factors controlling the groundwater hydrochemistry, and its suitability for drinking purposes. In this study, 108 groundwater samples (dry and wet seasons) were collected along the Linggi River Basin for the determination of physicochemical parameters, followed by the application of statistical analyses (principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), Pearson's correlation), as well as drinking water quality assessments (pollution index of groundwater (PIG) and groundwater quality index (GWQI)). The PCA indicated that weathering of rocks influenced the groundwater hydrochemistry the most, followed by agricultural practices, intrusion of seawater, and dissolution of ions. The Piper plot exhibited the occurrence of seawater intrusion due to the transition of groundwater type from Ca -HCO 3 to Ca -Cl water type and Na -Cl during the wet season. Stations BH12 (PIG: 8.54, GWQI: 1034.55) and BH13 (PIG: 6.97, GWQI: 952.55) experienced high contamination from their respective PIG and GWQI values during the wet season. The HCA justified the classification of these polluted stations during the wet season by dividing the polluted stations into a separate cluster (Cluster II). Overall, the outcome of this study indicates that groundwater quality during the wet season is more polluted than in the dry season. As a precaution, it is advisable to treat the groundwater in Linggi River Basin before further consumption.

AB  - Introduction The most striking feature of depression is sadness and a loss of interest in activities, which represents a major cause of disability globally. Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel antidepressants for clinical practice. Ginsenoside Rh2 (Rh2) is one of the major bioactive ginsenosides that can be extracted from Panax ginseng and has been demonstrated to improve both memory and learning. The purpose of this study was to provide broad insight into the mechanisms underlying depression and gain greater insights into antidepressant therapy. Methods In this study, we first established an effective and feasible depression animal model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and behavioral testing was evaluated by the forced swim test (FST), the tail suspension test (TST) and the sucrose preference test. Following pretreatment with Rh2 (10 and 20 mg/kg), the immobility time of mice was reduced without affecting locomotor activity in both the FST and TST. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to investigate the activation of the hippocampal BDNF signaling pathway and hippocampal neurogenesis. Results Different concentrations of Rh2 significantly reduced depressive-like symptoms in CUMS-induced mice and downregulated the effects of the BDNF signaling cascade and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the administration of K252a completely prevented the antidepressant-like activity of Rh2 in mice. Conclusion The results indicated that Rh2 possesses the antidepression action via the positive regulation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary Oxytocin is gaining importance in human and animal studies because of its role in welfare stress response, but there is no evidence of oxytocin measurement in hair, which would allow an evaluation of this analyte over a long period of time. For this reason, in this study, a new immunoassay to measure oxytocin in the hair of pigs was developed and validated. In addition, the possible changes in concentrations of oxytocin in hair during the reproductive cycle of pigs were evaluated. The assay was precise and accurate and when applied to the hair extracts of pigs, higher oxytocin values were obtained at days 23 and 59 after farrowing in the winter-spring period. When oxytocin concentrations were compared to cortisone and cortisol, it showed moderate and low correlations, respectively. Based on the results of this report, oxytocin can be measured in the hair of pigs, and changes in concentrations can be detected during a pig's reproductive cycle. There is growing interest in oxytocin as a biomarker of stress and welfare. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a procedure based on a highly sensitive immunoassay to measure oxytocin in the hair of pigs. In addition, a pilot study to apply this procedure to evaluate possible changes in concentrations of oxytocin in hair during the reproductive cycle of pigs at different periods of the year was conducted. This procedure used methanol for sample extraction, since it offered better recoveries than acetonitrile, and the immunoassay developed was precise and accurate for the quantification of the oxytocin in the hair. When this procedure was applied to hair collected at different times of the reproductive cycle and season, higher values were found at days 23 and 59 after farrowing in the winter-spring period. In addition, higher oxytocin values in the spring-summer period were found in hair collected 5 days before farrowing compared to winter-spring. Oxytocin in hair showed moderate and low correlations with cortisone and cortisol in hair, respectively. This study represents the first report in which oxytocin was measured in hair and could open new lines for future research about the measurement of oxytocin in pigs and other biological species as a biomarker of stress.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing in frequency and severity worldwide due to nonpoint source nutrient pollution, mainly a product of agricultural runoff. This issue is compounded by the steady, global loss of wetlands and their water quality services. Wetlaculture, an integrated system of wetlands and agriculture, has been proposed as a solution to HABs in which farmland located on former wetlands is flipped to serve as a nutrient-sequestering treatment wetland for a period of years, then flipped back to farmland which consumes the stored nutrients for crop production without the need for fertilizers. A wetlaculture mesocosm experiment was initiated at Buckeye Lake, Ohio in 2016, where all of the site's mesocosms had been functioning as treatment wetlands fed with water from an adjacent, nutrient-impaired stream prior to the 2020 season. This study serves as both a continuation of the treatment wetland experiment, and a first attempt at the cultivation of an agricultural crop in wetlaculture mesocosms. Eight of the twenty-eight mesocosms were drained and planted with corn (Zea mays), while the remaining twenty continued to function as treatment wetlands. Inflow and outflow concentrations of five nutrient species were monitored in the wetland mesocosms, while suitability for corn was evaluated via preplant soil tests and ultimate grain yield, which was compared to that of a nearby commercial farm. End-of-season soil analyses from both the corn and wetland mesocosms were taken to determine the impact of these disparate management regimes on total soil N, P, K, and C. Results indicate that the treatment wetlands continued to improve water quality and that the mesocosms planted with corn produced a grain crop without fertilization. Mesocosm yields (58 +/- 9.5 bu./ac) fell significantly below those of the reference farm (160 +/- 15.3 bu./ac)(p = 0.004). Some of that difference may be due to the frequent herbivory that occurred during this study, in addition to the limited soil volume in the 0.285 m(3) mesocosm tubs versus the open agricultural field.

AB  - Objectives understanding drug resistance in cancer is of importance in treatment. Cancer stem cells are main factor for drug resistance. Therefore, the possible gene/gene interactions/proteins were explored in our study using a cancer stem cell-enriched population (H1299/S) derived from a parental non-small cell lung cancer cell line (H1299/P).Methods response to cisplatin, which is the main drug for the treatment of lung cancer, was evaluated with the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) viability test. As a result of the gene expression analysis, while 14 genes were not evaluated, expression profiles were obtained for 37 genes out of 51 genes. By the drug-protein interaction analyses, Topoisomerase I (TOPI), Topoisomerase 2 alpha (TOP2A), Topoisomerase 2 beta (TOP2B), Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 (CDK4), Cyclin-dependent kinases 6 (CDK6), ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1), ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 3 (ABCC3), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), Breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) genes and protein products were statistically significantly found to be in association with drug resistance.Results and discussion in bioinformatics analyses, it was observed that 13 pathways were affected due to expression changes and 12 genes related to these pathways were determined to activate multidrug resistance mechanisms.Conclusions platinum-based drugs, as well as a broad range of other agents including topoisomerase and PARP1 inhibitors, and anthracyclines, have been shown to potentially possess multiple drug resistance.

AB  - Escherichia coli is one of the key bacteria responsible for a variety of diseases in humans and livestock-associated infections around the globe. It is the leading cause of mortality in neonatal and weaned piglets in pig husbandry, causing diarrhea and significant harm to the industry. Furthermore, the frequent and intensive use of antimicrobials for the prevention of diseases, particularly gastrointestinal diseases, may promote the selection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. These resistant genotypes can be transmitted through the excrement of animals, including swine. It is common practice to use porcine manure processed by biodigesters as fertilizer. This study aimed to examine the antimicrobial susceptibility, the presence of virulence genes frequently associated with pathotypes of intestinal pathogenic E. coli (InPEC), and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) of 28 E. coli isolates collected from swine manure fertilizers. In addition, the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) technique was used to investigate the genetic relationship among the strains. Using disk diffusion, the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the strains were determined. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 14 distinct virulence genes associated with the most prevalent diarrhea and intestinal pathogenic E. coli (DEC/InPEC) and five ARGs were analyzed. All isolates tested positive for multidrug resistance. There was no detection of any of the 14 virulence genes associated with InPECs, indicating the presence of an avirulent commensal microbiota. Molecular classification by ERIC-PCR revealed that the majority of isolates (27 isolates) coalesced into a larger cluster with a genetic similarity of 47.7%; only one strain did not cluster in this cluster, indicating a high level of genetic diversity among the analyzed isolates. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to conduct epidemiological surveillance of animal breeding facilities in order to determine their microbiota and formulate plans to reduce the use of antimicrobials and improve animal welfare.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes global swine outbreaks, but its cellular pathogenesis is poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA data from ASFV-infected pig spleens across four timepoints, we identified macrophages as the primary viral reservoir, with infection driving lymphoid depletion and myeloid expansion. We characterized four functionally distinct macrophage subsets, including a metabolically reprogrammed SusceptibleMac population serving as the major viral niche and an AntiviralMac subset rapidly depleted during infection. Viral gene expression analysis revealed E165R as a central hub in viral replication networks, while host transcriptomics uncovered disruption of Netrin signaling pathways that may facilitate immune evasion. Pseudotime analysis revealed dynamic macrophage state transitions during infection. These findings provide a high-resolution cellular atlas of ASFV pathogenesis, revealing macrophage subset-specific responses that shape disease outcomes and identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - It is well known that sensory information driven from whiskers serves as an example of tactile perception in rodents, and plays an important role in social behavior, environmental exploration, and decision-making processes, the influence of manipulations performed during the development of whiskers, on learning has been received little attention in the literature. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of tactile stimulation (TS) on spatial memory performance and neuronal density in the hippocampus during adulthood in early sensory-deprived rats. Wistar albino male rats were divided into four groups: control (CTL), bilateral whisker trimming (BWT), tactile stimulation (TS), and bilateral whisker trimming+tactile stimulation (BWT + TS). All whiskers were trimmed between P0-10, a critical period for whisker development. TS was applied from P3 to P21 using a soft brush. In this study, the 8-arm radial maze test was conducted from postnatal days 77 to 81 to assess spatial memory Animals sacrificed by intracardial perfusion and neuronal density in CA1, CA3, vDG, and dDG regions of the hippocampus were evaluated by Nissl staining. TS exposure negatively affected spatial memory performance and hippocampal neuronal density compared to BWT. We conclude that TS in healthy offspring can cause stress by interrupting maternal care, given the vulnerability of early development. On the contrary, the sensory deprivation protocol in this study was terminated at a time of high homeostatic plasticity and did not produce complete whisker deprivation, have triggered learning by inducing moderate stress early in development.

AB  - Benzophenone chemicals (BPs) have been developed to prevent the adverse effects of UV radiation and they are widely contaminated. 11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11 beta-HSD1) catalyze the conversion of inactive glucocorticoid to active glucocorticoid, playing critical role in many physiological function. However, the direct effect of BPs on human, pig, rat, and mouse 11 beta-HSD1 remains unclear. In this study, we screened the inhibitory strength of 12 BPs on 4 species, and performed the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and in silico docking analysis. The inhibitory potency of BPs was: for human 11 beta-HSD1, BP6 (IC50 = 18.76 mu M) > BP8 (40.84 mu M) > BP (88.89 mu M) > other BPs; for pig 11 beta-HSD1, BP8 (45.57 mu M) > BP6 (59.44 mu M) > BP2 (65.12 mu M) > BP (135.56 mu M) > other BPs; for rat 11 beta-HSD1, BP7 (67.17 mu M) > BP (68.83 mu M) > BP8 (133.04 mu M) > other BPs; and for mouse 11 beta-HSD1, BP8 (41.41 mu M) > BP (50.61 mu M) > other BPs. These BP chemicals were mixed/ competitive inhibitors of these 11 beta-HSD1 enzymes. The 2,2 '-dihydroxy substitutions in two benzene rings play a key role in enhancing the effectiveness of inhibiting 11 beta-HSD1, possibly via increasing hydrogen bond interactions. Docking analysis shows that these BPs bind to NADPH/glucocorticoid binding sites and forms hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues Ser and/or Tyr. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that BP chemicals can inhibit 11 beta-HSD1 from 4 species, and there are subtle species-dependent difference in the inhibitory strength and structural variations of BPs.

AB  - The functional role of estrogen receptor activation factor (E-RAF), a 66 kDa protein in mediating the biological actions of estrogen and progesterone in goat uterus, has been highlighted in this work. Here we report that E-RAF stimulates the expression of splicing factor gene, arginine/serine rich in goat uterine nuclei (GenBank Accession No. MT473439). cDNA subtractive hybridization method using nuclear run-on transcription assay was used to identify the differentially expressed genes. The upregulation of the splicing factor gene was demonstrated further using a PCR-based nuclear run-on transcription system. Confocal microscopic analysis has confirmed the endoplasmic reticulum as the primary site of intracellular location of E-RAF. The effect of estrogen and progesterone on the intracellular distribution of E-RAF and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the transport of E-RAF to nucleus in the presence of progesterone has been studied. Our results offer a new perspective in steroid hormone action in uterus.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) is highly expressed in trophoblast tissues in pregnancy during which the protein participates in diverse events, including embryo implantation and placental formation. However, little is known about the role of PPAR? in embryonic development. This study investigated the function of PPAR? in sheep trophoblast cells. The coding sequence of sheep PPAR? encoded 475 amino acids and included one synonymou mutation compared with the sheep reference sequence for PPAR?. The PPAR? protein was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of sheep trophoblasts. The relative expression of PPAR? was elevated in cells treated with rosiglitazone and reduced following administration of GW9662. Activation of PPAR? promoted cell proliferation and mobility, but inhibited apoptosis. In addition, stimulation of PPAR? promoted the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes FABP4 and PLIN2. The expression of prostaglandin metabolism-related genes PLA2G4A, PTGS2 and PTGES also was upregulated significantly in trophoblast cells when PPAR? was activated. In contrast, activation of PPAR? did not impact expression of the prostaglandin-related genes PGFS and SLCO2A1. At the same time, activation of PPAR? activity increased the ratio of PGE2 to PGF2a. Furthermore, fluorescence labelling showed that the numbers of cell lipid droplets increased after stimulation of PPAR? activity, but decreased when PPAR? was inhibited. In conclusion, PPAR? is critical for the regulation of lipid metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis and secretion in sheep trophoblast cells and also has a potent effect on cell proliferation and viability.

AB  - Modulation of Tonic Immobility (TI) concerns environmental and individual factors. TI is modulated by processes of habituation and sensitization.
   In poikilotherm frog and lizard, TI duration is much shorter at usual environmental temperatures and is potentiated at higher or lower temperatures, as the last resource for survival. During ontogeny, age may differentially affect TI susceptibility to the induction procedures, as in the case of newborn ectothermic and older endothermic rabbits.
   TI duration displays a daily rhythm, with longer TI in the night. Its resistance to habituation indicates that in the dark TI is the most prominent defense against nocturnal predators. In all studied species, there is synchronization of the prey's defensive responses with the feeding activity of predators.
   Ecological factors and exposure to different anthropogenic environmental pressures may alter morphology, behavior and TI in wild populations.
   TI duration has been associated with a genomic region comprising the dystrophin gene on quail chromosome 1.

AB  - Chemical immobilisation of pinnipeds is a routine procedure in research and veterinary practice. Yet, there are inevitable risks associated with chemical immobilisation, and the physiological response to anaesthetic agents in pinnipeds remains poorly understood. The current study used wearable continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from 10 trials of prolonged anaesthesia (0.5 to 1.4 h) induced through ketamine and midazolam in five grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) involved in other procedures. The aim of this study was to (1) analyse the effect of each compound on heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and relative concentration changes in oxygenated [Delta O(2)Hb] and deoxygenated haemoglobin [Delta HHb] in cerebral tissue and (2) to investigate the use of NIRS as a real-time physiological monitoring tool during chemical immobilisation. Average group responses of ketamine (n = 27) and midazolam (n = 11) administrations were modelled using generalised additive mixed models (GAMM) for each dependent variable. Following ketamine and midazolam administration, [Delta HHb] increased and [Delta O(2)Hb] remained relatively stable, which was indicative of apnoea. Periods of apnoea were confirmed from respiratory band data, which were simultaneously collected during drugging trials. Given that SpO(2) remained at 97% during apnoea, we hypothesized that increasing cerebral [Delta HHb] was a result of venous congestion as opposed to decreased oxygen delivery. Changes in heart rate were limited and appeared to be driven by the individual pharmacological actions of each drug. Future research could include simultaneous measures of metabolic rate, such as the relative change in concentration of cytochrome-c-oxidase, to guide operators in determining when apnoea should be considered prolonged if changes in [Delta HHb] and [Delta O(2)Hb] occur beyond the limits recorded in this study. Our findings support the use of NIRS as real-time physiological monitoring tool during pinniped chemical immobilisation, which could assist veterinarians and researchers in performing safe anaesthetic procedures.

AB  - Intracellular Zn2+ concentrations increase via depolarization-mediated influx or intracellular release, but the immediate effects of Zn2+ signals on neuron function are not fully understood. By simultaneous recording of cytosolic Zn2+ and organelle motility, we find that elevated Zn2+ (IC50 approximate to 5-10 nM) reduces both lysosomal and mitochondrial motility in primary rat hippocampal neurons and HeLa cells. Using live-cell confocal microscopy and in vitro single-molecule TIRF imaging, we reveal that Zn2+ inhibits activity of motor proteins (kinesin and dynein) without disrupting their microtubule binding. Instead, Zn2+ directly binds to microtubules and selectively promotes detachment of tau, DCX, and MAP2C, but not MAP1B, MAP4, MAP7, MAP9, or p150glued. Bioinformatic predictions and structural modeling show that the Zn2+ binding sites on microtubules partially overlap with the microtubule binding sites of tau, DCX, dynein, and kinesin. Our results reveal that intraneuronal Zn2+ regulates axonal transport and microtubule-based processes by interacting with microtubules.
   Minckley et al. identify a Zn2+-dependent mechanism that regulates microtubule-based processes, in which microtubule decoration by Zn2+ disturbs axonal transport via directly inhibiting movement of motor proteins and regulating microtubule binding of doublecortin (DCX), tau, and MAP2C, without disrupting other MAPs.
