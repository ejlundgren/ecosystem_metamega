AB  - Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) can work at high temperatures, but they suffer from poor cycle life stability due to the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides. In this study, pollen-derived porous carbon/cuprous phosphide (PC/Cu3P) hybrids were rationally synthesized using a one-step carbonization method using pollen as the source material, acting as the sulfur host for LSBs. In the hybrid, polar Cu3P can markedly inhibit the "shuttle effect" by regulating the adsorption ability toward polysulfides, as confirmed by theoretical calculations and experimental tests. As an example, the camellia pollen porous carbon (CPC)/Cu3P/S electrode shows a high capacity of 1205.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.038% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1 C, and a rather high initial Coulombic efficiency of 98.5%. The CPC/Cu3P LSBs can work well at high temperatures, having a high capacity of 545.9 mAh g(-1) at 1 C even at 150 degrees C. The strategy of the PC/Cu3P hybrid proposed in this study is expected to be an ideal cathode for ultrastable high-temperature LSBs. We believe that this strategy is universal and worthy of in-depth development for the next generation energy storage devices.

AB  - The theory of the brain-gut axis has confirmed that gut microbiota and metabolites are involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases through multiple pathways. However, few studies have highlighted the role of gut microbiota in cognitive impairment induced by aluminum (Al) exposure and its correlations with the homeostasis of essential metal content in the brain. To explore the relationship between alterations in the content of essential metals in the brain and relative abundance changes in gut microbiota induced by Al exposure, the Al, zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co) content level in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and midbrain tissue were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) methods after Al maltolate was intraperitoneally injected every other day for exposed groups. Then the unsupervised principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) were used to analyze the relative abundance of the gut microbiota community and the structure of the gut microbiome. Finally, the correlations between gut microbiota composition and essential metal content in the different exposure groups were explored by using the Pearson correlation coefficient method. Based on the results, we indicated that the content of Al in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and midbrain tissue was increased and then decreased with the increasing exposure duration, with peaks occurring between 14 and 30 days. Concomitantly, Al-exposure decreased the Zn, Fe, and Mn levels in these tissues. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing results indicated that significant differences in the intestinal microbial community structure at the phylum, family, and genus levels were found in the Day 90 exposed group compared with the Day 7 exposed group. Ten enriched species in the exposed group were identified as markers at the three levels. Furthermore, ten bacteria at the genus level were identified to have a significantly strong correlation (r = 0.70-0.90) with Fe, Zn, Mn, and Co.

AB  - Left unchecked, macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) can exhibit irruptive population dynamics, rising rapidly to a peak, then crashing when overwhelmed by inadequate resources. This predictable population trajectory frequently leads to overabundance issues, particularly in peri-urban parks and nature reserves. Management decisions are usually guided by estimates of population density, which can be difficult to obtain, sometimes inaccurate and often inadequate because long-term data are needed to estimate population growth. Alternatively, density-dependent vital rates could be used to predict the growth trajectory of a population before management issues become evident. We applied a framework of sequential changes in vital rates to examine potential indicators of population growth trajectory. We sampled 16 populations of Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) in south-eastern Australia. Using a range of methods, we measured one vital rate (female reproductive rate) and one surrogate rate (adult sex ratio). As population density increased before irruptive peaks, female reproductive rate (90% breeding) was higher than during post-peak declines (66% breeding). Similarly, sex ratios in increasing populations were at parity and then became more female-biased (65% females) after peaks. These variables are readily measured in small parks and reserves, and therefore offer promising indicators of population growth trajectory, which can be used to forecast management issues and initiate timely management actions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since its invasion of China, the fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) has rapidly become a major threat to maize production, raising significant concerns about national food security. This study investigates the effects of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), released by maize in response to FAW larval infestation, on the oviposition behavior of female FAW. RESULTS: Larval feeding behavior induces the release of specific volatiles that deter female oviposition through olfactory repulsion and oviposition inhibition. Notably, compounds such as linalool, beta-caryophyllene, (E)-beta-farnesene and indole significantly deter FAW oviposition. Among these, linalool and beta-caryophyllene display dual functions, both deterring FAW and attracting natural enemies. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the dual role of HIPVs in deterring FAW and attracting natural enemies, revealing crucial ecological interactions among FAW, HIPVs, and their natural enemies. These findings provide valuable insights into sustainable and eco-friendly pest management strategies. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and phytohormones collectively regulate plant growth and root development, but their individual and combined effects on tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] cutting seedings remain unclear. This study examined the individual and combined effects of two species of AMF (Rhizophagus intraradices, RI and Funneliformis mosseae, FM) and two types of palnt hormones (strigolactones, SLs; polyamines, PAs) on tea cutting seedings, by evaluating the growth and physiobiochemical characteristics of plants treated with the AMFs and/or hormones. The results showed that inoculation with either AMF individually or hormones treatment alone could significantly enhanced mycorrhizal colonization, growth target and physiobiochemical characteristics of tea cutting seedlings. Interestingly, the addition of a combination of AMFs and hormones showed superior effects, while SL and RI exhibited the most improvements to the colonization rate, plant growth, root-morphological traits, root DHA activity, photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, soluble sugar content in leaves, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT), compared to other treatment combinations (SL + FM, PA + RI, and PA + FM). Correlation analyses revealed a significantly (p < 0.05) positive correlation of root AMF colonization with root-related traits (e.g., DHA, root total length, surface area, and volume) and leaf-related traits (e.g., leaf area, shoot biomass, total chlorophyll, and antioxidant enzyme activities). This study demonstrated that while the apllication of individual AMF or plant hormones had a certain good effects on most growth and physiobiochemical characteristics parameters of tea cutting seedings, the additive effect was from specific combined of AMF and plant hormones. These results highlight the possibility for combined of AMF and plant hormones to improve the asexual reproduction of tea plants via cuttings.

AB  - The hippocampal formation is crucial for the generation and regulation of several brain functions, including memory and learning processes; however, it is vulnerable to neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of epilepsy, changes the hippocampal circuitry and excitability, under the contribution of both neuronal degeneration and abnormal neurogenesis. Classically, neurodegeneration affects sensitive areas of the hippocampus, such as dentate gyrus (DG) hilus, as well as specific fields of the Ammon's horn, CA3, and CA1. In addition, the proliferation, migration, and abnormal integration of newly generated hippocampal granular cells (GCs) into the brain characterize TLE neurogenesis. Robust studies over the years have intensely discussed the effects of death and life in the hippocampus, though there are still questions to be answered about their possible benefits and risks. Here, we review the impacts of death and life in the hippocampus, discussing its influence on TLE, providing new perspectives or insights for the implementation of new possible therapeutic targets.

AB  - The anti-inflammatory effect of trypsin in animals and humans is the basis for the development of new veterinary and medical drugs and alternatives to antibiotics. The current experiment analyzed the effect of pig pancreatic tissue lyophilizate and crystalline trypsin on the hemodynamic and morpho-biochemical parameters of rabbit blood. The experiments were carried out on 20 rabbits of the Soviet chinchilla breed of 6-8 months of age. Animals were intramuscularly injected with sterile solution of 0.9% NaCl in 0.5 mL (group 1, n = 5), sterile solution of crystalline trypsin in 0.9% NaCl at a concentration of 0.25 mg/kg body weight (group 2, n = 5), sterile solution of crystalline trypsin in 0, 9% NaCl at a concentration of 0.5 mg/kg body weight (group 3, n = 5), or sterile suspension of pig pancreas lyophilizate at a concentration of 1 mg/kg body weight (group 4, n = 5). Animals were injected once daily for five consecutive days. Significant changes in arterial blood pressure, serum enzymes activity, and the count of various blood cellular components were induced by the administration of different trypsin preparations. All data obtained indicate the presence of a biologically active substance in the lyophilizate, the effect of which requires further animal studies to create a prototype for the development of new drugs for human and animal use.

AB  - Surra is an infectious disease caused by Trypanosoma evansi (T. evansi), which is spread in developing countries. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and genetic characterization of T. evansi in cattle in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Blood samples from 150 cattle were collected and examined by a blood smear and PCR targeting the RoTat 1.2VSG gene. The findings revealed that the prevalence of T. evansi varied depending on the detection test, ranging from 20.7% to 25.3% by blood smear examination and PCR. RoTat 1.2VSG sequences analysis of two T. evansi isolates revealed little difference compared to similar sequences in the database. The phylogenetic tree revealed that local T. evansi isolates in this study were clustered with other T. evansi sequences from Egypt, India, Nigeria, Kenya, and Pakistan. The sequences in the study and the Egyptian sequence (MG674485, camel strain) were grouped into a single clade with little genetic variation. In conclusion, the results of this study urge for the introduction and adoption of appropriate control strategies to reduce the effect of T. evansi infection on cattle production in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is an important swine pathogen that has caused considerable economic losses in the global swine industry. During our surveillance of pigs in Shandong, China, from 2018 to 2020, we found that the PCV2 infection rate was 7.89% (86/1090). In addition, we found frequent mixed infections of PCV2 with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine herpesvirus (PRV). Thirteen positive clinical samples were selected to amplify the complete genome of PCV2, and were sequenced. Among the 13, we detected two genotypes: PCV2b (1/13) and PCV2d (12/13). This suggests that PCV2d is the dominant genotype circulating in Shandong Province. Additionally, we found three positively selected sites in the ORF2 region, located on the previously reported antigenic epitopes.

AB  - This study was conducted in a Portuguese slaughterhouse for finishing pigs. A total of 93 batches with an average slaughter weight of 93.3 kg (+/- 0.6) were assessed in the lairage pens using the qualitative behavior assessment (QBA) tool to evaluate both positive and negative descriptors. Social interaction behaviors and the physical conditions of pigs in each batch were also measured. Physical examination revealed that pigs with body condition scores of 4 or 5 were less active and playful, presenting negative correlations with these descriptors. Groups of pigs at rest showed negative correlations (p < 0.001) with active (r = -0.338), lively (r = -0.352), and playful (r = -0.424) behaviors, while resting behavior was positively correlated (p < 0.01) with relaxed groups (r = 0.331). The presence of fighting and mounting the backs of other animals was highly correlated (p < 0.001) with negative emotional states like agitation, distress, irritability, and tense. Batches exhibiting positive emotional states, such as calmness and relaxation, showed significant associations with behaviors like fighting and mounting the backs of other animals. This indicates that experiencing positive emotions can lead to a decrease in aggressive or stress-related behaviors. Ear biting correlated with the descriptor "bored", indicating a potential relationship between this behavior and a lack of environmental stimulation. The descriptors "frustration" and "bored" (p < 0.001) showed an association with the behavior of chewing without a substrate, regardless of whether fights occurred. Descriptors like "active", "friendly", "positively occupied", "sociable", and "lively" have higher loadings on principal component 1 (PC1), reflecting positive affective welfare. In PC2, descriptors representing relaxation are positioned as opposite to terms like "irritable", "distressed", and "tense", suggesting that PC2 could be useful for identifying conditions of high stress in pigs. These findings underscore the relationship between emotional states and behaviors, suggesting that combining QBA with behavioral observations provides a comprehensive framework for assessing animal welfare. Improving pig welfare could be achieved by reducing aggression and enhancing environmental enrichment to alleviate boredom during lairage.

AB  - Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) can serve as a nutritional intervention to regulate quality, function, and fat infiltration in skeletal muscles, but the specific cytological mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulates fat infiltration in skeletal muscles based on pig models. We investigated the regulatory effects of CLAs on cell populations and molecular characteristics in pig muscles and found CLAs could promote the transformation of fast glycolytic myofibers into slow oxidative myofibers. We also observed three subpopulations including SCD+/DGAT2(+), FABP5(+)/SIAH1(+), and PDE4D(+)/PDE7B(+) subclusters in adipocytes and CLAs could increase the percentage of SCD+/DGAT2(+) adipocytes. RNA velocity analysis showed FABP5(+)/SIAH1(+) and PDE4D(+)/PDE7B(+) adipocytes could differentiate into SCD+/DGAT2(+) adipocytes. We further verified the differentiated trajectory of mature adipocytes and identified PDE4D(+)/PDE7B(+) adipocytes could differentiate into SCD+/DGAT2(+) and FABP5(+)/SIAH1(+) adipocytes by using high intramuscular fat (IMF) content Laiwu pig models. The cell-cell communication analysis identified the interaction network between adipocytes and other subclusters such as fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis and RNA velocity analysis also showed FAPs could differentiate into PDE4D(+)/PDE7B(+) preadipocytes and we discovered the differentiated trajectory of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Besides, we found CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into SCD+/DGAT2(+) adipocytes via inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in vitro. This study provides a foundation for regulating fat infiltration in skeletal muscles by using nutritional strategies and provides potential opportunities to serve pig as an animal model to study human fat infiltrated diseases.

AB  - Porcine sapelovirus (PSV) is a new pathogen that negatively impacts the pig industry in China. Affected pigs experience severe diarrhea and even death. Vaccination is used to control disease outbreaks, and sensitive diagnostic methods that can distinguish infected animals from vaccinated animals (DIVA) are essential for monitoring the effectiveness of disease control programs. Tests based on the detection of the nonstructural protein (NSP) 3AB are reliable indicators of viral replication in infected and vaccinated animals. In this study, the recombinant PSV 3AB protein was expressed by a prokaryotic expression system, and an indirect ELISA method was established. Serum samples from healthy animals, immunized animals, and infected animals were evaluated. The ELISA method identified 3AB with high sensitivity (99.78%) and specificity (100.0%), and no cross-reaction was observed with serum antibodies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), infection with classical swine fever virus (CSFV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), or foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The ELISA method described here can effectively distinguish infected and vaccinated animals and is an important inexpensive tool for monitoring serum and controlling PSV.

AB  - STIP1 Homology and U-Box Containing Protein 1 (STUB1), a ubiquitin E3 ligase initially involved in immune responses, has recently emerged as a pleiotropic regulator of different biological systems, including skeletal and male reproduction systems. On the latter, a homozygous mutation in the STUB1 gene has been identified in patients with hypogonadism. However, the pattern of expression and biological actions of STUB1 in testis remains so far unexplored. Herein, we report analyses on the testicular expression of STUB1 in human testes with impaired spermatogenesis and paracrine regulation of STUB1 expression in mouse testis development and the direct effects of ablation STUB1 on Sertoli cell (SC) functions. STUB1 was expressed abundantly in pachytene spermatocytes and SCs, and weakly in spermatogonia and differentiating spermatids in normal human testis. In contrast, Sertoli-specific expression of STUB1 was significantly decreased in the human testes with impaired spermatogenesis. Throughout postnatal development of mouse testis, however, STUB1 was expressed exclusively in the nuclei of the functionally mature SCs. The adjacent germ cell (GC)-derived IL-1 alpha overtly regulated STUB1 expression through promoting the ETS domain transcription factor Elk-1 (ELK1)-mediated transactivation. Importantly, ablation of endogenous STUB1 caused lipid accumulation and senescence in GC co-incubated SCs. Together with previous reports on the stimulatory effects of IL-1 alpha on cell senescence, our findings suggest that STUB1 may serve as an important negative feedback signaling to modulate the magnitude of GCs-derived IL-1 alpha, which is normally maintained at low levels within testis.

AB  - Featured Application A potential application of this work is the use of generative LLMs to support medical education by providing automated explanations and practice materials in Brazilian Portuguese. The models could also assist in the development of decision support tools that offer preliminary guidance on diagnoses and treatments.Abstract This study aimed to compare the performance of various Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering multiple-choice questions from the last six editions (2017 to 2024) of Revalida exam. The evaluation focused on models capable of processing content in Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR), including open-source models, namely LLaMA 3.1 (8B parameters), Qwen 2.5 (7B parameters), and their reasoning-oriented distilled variants based on the DeepSeek-R1 architecture, as well as open-access commercial models such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Gemini. After evaluating the models' accuracy against the official answer keys, GPT-4o emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an average accuracy of 63.85%. Next, GPT-4o was prompted to justify its answers to the 2024 exam, and its explanations were independently reviewed by three licensed physicians. The evaluators reported full agreement with the clinical reasoning presented, indicating the model's ability to produce coherent and medically relevant justifications. Lastly, justifications generated by GPT-4o for correctly answered questions from previous exams (2017-2023) were compiled into a knowledge base, which was then used to enhance GPT-4o through retrieval-augmented generation and to fine-tune LLaMA 3.1, leading to measurable performance improvements on the 2024 exam. Despite promising performance, these models still demonstrate variability in responses, hallucinations, and limited reliability in high-stakes contexts. As such, their outputs should always be reviewed by qualified professionals, and human expertise remains essential in clinical decision-making and medical education scenarios, considering the PT-BR language. However, the observed gains from integrating prior exam content indicate that domain-specific adaptation strategies may help mitigate some of these limitations and enhance model alignment.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) species characterize the effectiveness of the P fertilizer. In this study, the P species and distribution in different manures (pig manure, dairy manure and chicken manure) and their digestate were systematically investi-gated through combined characterization methods of Hedley fractionation (H2O\\P, NaHCO3-P, NaOH-P, HCl-P, and Residual), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The results from Hedley fractionation showed that >80 % of P in the digestate was inorganic and the HCl-P content in manure increased signif-icantly during anaerobic digestion (AD). XRD manifested that insoluble hydroxyapatite and struvite belonging to HCl-P were presented during AD, which was in agreement with the result of Hedley fractionation. 31P NMR spectral anal-ysis revealed that some orthophosphate monoesters were hydrolyzed during AD, meanwhile the orthophosphate dies -ter organic phosphorus like DNA and phospholipids content has increased. After characterizing P species by combining these methods, it was found that chemical sequential extraction could be an effective way to fully understand the Pin livestock manure and digestate, with other methods used as auxiliary tool depending on the purpose of studies. Mean-while, this study provided a basic knowledge of utilizing digestate as P fertilizer and minimizing the risk of P loss from livestock manure. Overall, applying digestates can minimize the risk of P loss from directly applied livestock manure while satisfying plant demands, and is an environmentally friendly P fertilizer.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the influence of feruloyl esterase-producing Lactobacillus plantarum A1 (Lp A1) and grape pomace (GP) alone, or in combination (LG) on ensiling characteristics and bacterial community, in vitro ruminal fermentation, methane (CH4) emission, and the microbiota of ensiled alfalfa. Alfalfa at 42% dry matter (DM) was treated in a 2 x 2 factorial design: with the application of Lp A1 at 0 (control) or 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of fresh forage, and GP at 0 or 5% of fresh forage. After 60 d of ensiling, a decrease in nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) was observed in GP treated silage. Lp A1 inoculated silage had a lower fiber content than silages without Lp A1. The lowest NPN was found in silage treated with LG, and an obvious increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus paracasei was detected in silages treated with Lp A1 and LG, respectively. In vitro ruminal experiments indicated that, although the application of GP deceased ruminal total gas, CH4 production, nitrogen degradation and the number of methanogenic archaea in alfalfa silage, it also reduced silage DM digestibility. In contrast, inoculation with Lp A1 not only increased DM digestibility and populations of ruminal Ruminococcus flavefaciens and fungi, but also improved ruminal total gas and CH4 production. As expected, LG treatment decreased alfalfa silage ruminal total gas and CH4 production relative to Lp A1 treatment alone, and increased silage DM digestibility compared with GP treated silage. In conclusion, the application of LG before ensiling alfalfa, balanced silage proteolysis, feed digestibility, and CH4 emission, and could be a promising strategy for using food industry by-products to produce a nutritional and environmentally-friendly legume silage that will mitigate N and greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants.

AB  - BackgroundNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent cause of chronic hepatic disease and results in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which progresses to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Although the Leptin deficient rodent models are widely used in study of metabolic syndrome and obesity, they fail to develop liver injuries as in patients.MethodsDue to the high similarity with humans, we generated Leptin-deficient (Leptin-/-) pigs to investigate the mechanisms and clinical trials of obesity and NAFLD caused by Leptin.ResultsThe Leptin-/- pigs showed increased body fat and significant insulin resistance at the age of 12 months. Moreover, Leptin-/- pig developed fatty liver, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis with age. Absence of Leptin in pig reduced the phosphorylation of JAK2-STAT3 and AMPK. The inactivation of JAK2-STAT3 and AMPK enhanced fatty acid beta-oxidation and leaded to mitochondrial autophagy respectively, and both contributed to increased oxidative stress in liver cells. In contrast with Leptin-/- pig, although Leptin deletion in rat liver inhibited JAK2-STAT3 phosphorylation, the activation of AMPK pathway might prevent liver injury. Therefore, beta-oxidation, mitochondrial autophagy and hepatic fibrosis did not occurred in Leptin-/- rat livers.ConclusionsThe Leptin-deficient pigs presents an ideal model to illustrate the full spectrum of human NAFLD. The activity of AMPK signaling pathway suggests a potential target to develop new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD.

AB  - In ruminants, the level of food intake affects net chewing efficiency and hence faecal particle size. For nonruminants, corresponding data are lacking. Here, we report the effect of an increased food intake of a mixed diet in four domestic rabbit does due to lactation, and assess changes in particle size (as determined by wet sieving analysis) along the rabbit digestive tract. During lactation, rabbits achieved a distinctively higher dry matter intake than at maintenance, with a concomitant reduction in mean retention times of solute and particle markers, an increase in dry matter gut fill, a reduction in apparent digestibility of dry matter, and an overall increase in digestible dry matter intake. By contrast, there was no change in faecal mean particle size (mean +/- SD: 0.58 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.01 mm). A comparison of diet, stomach content and faecal mean particle size suggested that 98% of particle size reduction occurred due to ingestive mastication and 2% due to digestive processes. Very fine particles passing the finest sieve, putatively not only of dietary but mainly of microbial origin, were particularly concentrated in caecum contents, which corresponds to retention of microbes via a 'wash-back' colonic separation mechanism, to concentrate them in caecotrophs that are re-ingested. This study gives rise to the hypothesis that chewing efficiency on a consistent diet is not impaired by intake level in nonruminant mammals.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary zinc (Zn) supplementation on performance, immune responses and gastrointestinal tract features of broilers fed wheat-soybean meal diet. In addition, optimised dietary Zn level was estimated based on dose-response data. A total of 500 one-day-old male Ross-308 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 10 dietary treatments with five replicates and ten birds per replicate in a 5 x 2 factorial arrangement of five graded (+40 mg/kg) dietary Zn levels with or without phytase (500 FTU/kg of diet) supplementation. By increasing dietary Zn concentration, final live body weight (LBW), daily weight gain (WG), feed intake (FI), and European Production Efficiency Factor (EPEF), antibody titres against the sheep red blood cell inoculation, cutaneous basophils hypersensitivity to PHA-P injection, jejunum villus height, and apparent dry matter digestibility (ADMD) increased with a significant linear trend. Phytase supplementation improved WG and ADMD and decreased pancreas and intestine relative weights. The interaction effects of dietary Zn concentration and phytase supplementation on the whole of evaluated traits were not significant. Optimum dietary Zn levels were estimated by the regression models at 70, 82, 98, and 110 mg/kg of diet for optimised EPEF and immunity, LBW and WG, appetites, and ADMD, respectively. It is concluded, in the broiler chickens fed wheat-soybean meal diet, Zn and phytase supplementation can improve growth performance, immune response, digestibility, and intestinal features. The Zn requirement is higher than the NRC (1994) recommendation. The efficacy of dietary Zn was not affected by dietary phytase supplementation.

AB  - Simple Summary The mechanism of adipose browning in mammals has not been clarified completely. This study examined the influence of isoproterenol, a catecholamine preparation, on dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells from pig fat primary culture lacking functional uncoupling protein (UCP) 1. The DFAT was redifferentiated to adipocytes and used in this study. The adipocytes were examined for the expression of genes related to the browning and fragmentation of droplets after the administration of isoproterenol. PGC-1 alpha, UCP3, and COX family expressions increased following administration of 1 mu M isoproterenol. Exposure to 1 mu M isoproterenol significantly decreased the size of lipid droplets in the adipocytes of pigs. Furthermore, the promoter assay indicated that the UCP3 promoter was activated by PPAR gamma and PGC-1 alpha, similar to mouse UCP1. In summary, this study demonstrated that catecholamine preparation may induce adipose browning with an upregulation of UCP3 in pig fat primary culture without UCP1. This study indicates the functional similarity between UCP1 and UCP3 and that UCP3 may contribute to adipose browning in mammals.Abstract Adipose tissue plays an important role in regulating body temperature and metabolism, with white adipocytes serving as storage units for energy. Recent research focused on the browning of white adipocytes (beige adipocytes), causing thermogenesis and lipolysis. The process of browning is linked to the activation of uncoupling protein (UCP) expression, which can be mediated by the beta 3 adrenergic receptor pathway. Transcriptional factors, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and PPAR gamma coactivator 1 alpha, play vital roles in cell fate determination for fat cells. Beige adipocytes have metabolic therapeutic potential to combat diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, owing to their significant impact on metabolic functions. However, the molecular mechanisms that cause the induction of browning are unclear. Therefore, research using animal models and primary culture is essential to provide an understanding of browning for further application in human metabolic studies. Pigs have physiological similarities to humans; hence, they are valuable models for research on adipose tissue. This study demonstrates the browning potential of pig white adipocytes through primary culture experiments. The results show that upregulation of UCP3 gene expression and fragmentation of lipid droplets into smaller particles occur due to isoproterenol stimulation, which activates beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Furthermore, PPAR gamma and PGC-1 alpha were found to activate the UCP3 promoter region, similar to that of UCP1. These findings suggest that pigs undergo metabolic changes that induce browning in white adipocytes, providing a promising approach for metabolic research with potential implications for human health. This study offers valuable insights into the mechanism of adipocyte browning using pig primary culture that can enhance our understanding of human metabolism, leading to cures for commonly occurring diseases.

AB  - IntroductionComposting is a highly effective method for managing the growing quantity of agricultural waste, promoting nutrient recycling, and advancing sustainable agriculture. However, the significant amounts of volatile inorganic compounds (VICs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated during the composting process cannot be ignored due to their serious ecological environmental hazards and detrimental impact on human health. The types and pathways of VICs and VOCs produced during the composting process remain not well understood. MethodsIn this study, we investigated the VOCs produced during chicken manure and straw composting using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). We performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of VOCs in composting emissions gases and their correlation with odor. ResultsOur results showed that 44 VOCs were detected during composting, including 4 oxidation-containing compounds, 2 sulfur-containing organics, 5 alkanes, 19 halogenated compounds, and 14 aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds were found to be the main component of VOCs, accounting for 59.14% of the total content. The highest VOC content was found in the pre-composting period, and the highest emitting VOC was p-Isopropyl Toluene, which reached 7870.50 mu g/m(3). We identified eight substances that were highly correlated with odor concentration (p < 0.01) and are the main odor-causing substances that need to be monitored and controlled. DiscussionOur study provides important insights into the transformation of volatile gases during the composting process. It highlights the need for proper management practices to control VOCs emissions and reduce their environmental impact.

AB  - Microbial biotransformation is a recommended and reliable method in face of formidable tetracycline (TC) with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Herein, comprehensive characteristics of a newfound strain and its molecular mechanism in process of TC bioremediation were involved in this study. Specifically, Serratia marcescens MSM2304 isolated from pig manure sludge grew well in presence of TC and achieved optimal removal efficiency of 61% under conditions of initial TC concentration of 10 mg/L, pH of 7.0, cell inoculation amount of 5%, and tryptone of 10 g/L as additional carbon. The pathways of biotransformation include EPS biosorption, cell surface biosorption and biodegradation, which enzymatic processes of biodegradation were occurred through TC adsorbed by biofilms was firstly broken down by extracellular enzymes and part of TC migrated towards biofilm interior and degraded by intracellular enzymes. Wherein extracellular polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from biofilm of strain MSM2304 mainly performed extracellular adsorption, and changes in position and intensity of C - - O, =CH and C -O -C/C -O of EPS possible further implied TC adsorption by it. Biodegradation accounting for 79.07% played a key role in TC biotransformation and could be fitted well by firstorder model that manifesting rapid and thorough removal. Potential biodegradation pathway including demethylation, dihydroxylation, oxygenation, and ring opening possibly involved in TC disposal process of MSM2304, TC-degrading metabolites exhibited lower toxicity to indicator bacteria relative to parent TC. Whole genome sequencing as underlying molecular evidence revealed that TC resistance genes , dehydrogenases-encoding genes , monooxygenase-encoding genes , and methyltransferase-encoding genes of strain MSM2304 were positively related to TC biodegradation. Collectively, these results favored a theoretical evaluation for Serratia marcescens MSM2304 as a promising TC-control agent in environmental bioremediation processes.

AB  - Mechanical stimuli can affect plant growth, development, and defenses. The role of water spray stimulation, as a prevalent mechanical stimulus in the environment, in crop growth and defense cannot be overlooked. In this study, the effects of water spray on tomato plant growth and defense against the chewing herbivore Helicoverpa armigera and necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea were investigated. Suprathreshold water spray stimulus (LS) was found to enhance tomato plant defenses against pests and pathogens while concurrently modifying plant architecture. The results of the phytohormone and chemical metabolite analysis revealed that LS improved the plant defense response via jasmonic acid (JA) signaling. LS significantly elevated the level of a pivotal defensive metabolite, chlorogenic acid, and reduced the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from tomato plants, thereby defending against pest and pathogen attacks. The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that LS enhances tomato plant defenses against biotic stresses, which will pave the way for further work on the application of mechanical stimuli for pest management.

AB  - Tea-oil (Camellia oleifera Abel) is an important woody crop for producing high-quality edible oil, which has been extensively cultivated in an unattended manner and exposed to various light stresses. To gain insights into the tea-oil plant's adaption to different light environments, leaf anatomical characteristics, chlorophyll fluorescence quenching kinetics, and antioxidant enzyme activities were investigated under high (HL), medium (ML), and low light intensity (LL) conditions. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were also performed to reveal the changes in secondary metabolites and lipid profiles. The results showed that HL and ML had a rapid NPQ relaxation compared to LL. As light intensity decreased, the chlorophyll fluorescence yields and PSII photochemical efficiency improved during both the light-adapted steady-state and dark relaxation phases. ML and LL exhibited lower PSII activity and higher NPQ compared to HL, as instantaneous light intensity increased. The increased leaf thickness, elevated CAT activity, and the up-regulated synthetic pathways of flavonoids, lignans, tannins, and triterpenoids helped tea-oil plants survive under HL and ML. SOD and POD played an important role in acclimation to LL, resulting in a lower level of lipid oxidation. HL and ML promoted lipid biosynthesis, while LL inhibited fatty acid elongation, enhanced degradation pathways of triacylglycerol and fatty acids, and facilized sphingolipid metabolism. These findings shed light on the adaptive mechanism of tea-oil plant to varying light intensity environments. To further unravel the complex interactions among lipids, secondary metabolites and the antioxidant system, future study should focus on verifying the functions of differentially expressed genes identified in this study.

AB  - Hippophae tibetana (Tibetan sea-buckthorn) is one of the highest distributed woody plants in the world (3,000-5,200 meters a.s.l.). It is characterized by adaptation to extreme environment and important economic values. Here, we combined PacBio Hifi platform and Hi-C technology to assemble a 1,452.75 Mb genome encoding 33,367 genes with a Contig N50 of 74.31 Mb, and inferred its sexual chromosome. Two Hippophae-specific whole-genome duplication events (18.7-21.2 million years ago, Ma; 28.6-32.4 Ma) and long terminal repeats retroelements (LTR-RTs) amplifications were detected. Comparing with related species at lower altitude, Ziziphus jujuba (<1, 700 meters a.s.l.), H. tibetana had some significantly rapid evolving genes involved in adaptation to high altitude habitats. However, comparing with Hippophae rhamnoides (<3, 700 meters a.s.l.), no rapid evolving genes were found except microtubule and microtubule-based process genes, H. tibetana has a larger genome, with extra 2, 503 genes (7.5%) and extra 680.46 Mb transposable elements (TEs) (46.84%). These results suggest that the changes in the copy number and regulatory pattern of genes play a more important role for H. tibetana adapting to more extreme and variable environments at higher altitude by more TEs and more genes increasing genome variability and expression plasticity. This suggestion was supported by two findings: nitrogen-fixing genes of H. tibetana having more copies, and intact TEs being significantly closer genes than fragmentary TEs. This study provided new insights into the evolution of alpine plants.

AB  - Genetically modified xenografts are one of the most promising solutions to the discrepancy between the numbers of available human organs for transplantation and potential recipients. To date, a porcine heart has been implanted into only one human recipient. Here, using 10-gene-edited pigs, we transplanted porcine hearts into two brain-dead human recipients and monitored xenograft function, hemodynamics and systemic responses over the course of 66 hours. Although both xenografts demonstrated excellent cardiac function immediately after transplantation and continued to function for the duration of the study, cardiac function declined postoperatively in one case, attributed to a size mismatch between the donor pig and the recipient. For both hearts, we confirmed transgene expression and found no evidence of cellular or antibody-mediated rejection, as assessed using histology, flow cytometry and a cytotoxic crossmatch assay. Moreover, we found no evidence of zoonotic transmission from the donor pigs to the human recipients. While substantial additional work will be needed to advance this technology to human trials, these results indicate that pig-to-human heart xenotransplantation can be performed successfully without hyperacute rejection or zoonosis.
   In a short-term study in which hearts from gene-edited pigs were transplanted into two recently deceased human recipients, the hearts were able to function for the duration of the study without signs of rejection and without evidence of pig virus transmission, encouraging further clinical study of cardiac xenotransplantation.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of three different farrowing huts on the behaviour of outdoor housed sows and piglets during summer in Eastern Canada, with a focus on thermoregulatory and crushing behaviours. Forty-two second parity sows were housed outdoors in groups of three during lactation (N = 42). Within each group, sows had access to three farrowing huts: a Wood modified A-frame hut, a Plastic round calf hutch, and a Metal ark English-style hut. Cameras were installed in the huts to observe behaviour on days 1, 2, 7 and 14 of lactation. Temperature and humidity were recorded outside and inside the huts. Hourly temperature averages were analysed for the effect of the hut type for day and night separately. Sows farrowed in the huts between August and October and observations of sow and piglet location, posture, nursing, and crushing events were collected in the morning and afternoon. The Wood huts showed the least variation in temperature between days and nights, with the Metal huts showing similar thermal properties to the Wood huts (P < 0.05). The Plastic hut was hotter and drier during the day, but cooler and more humid during the night (P < 0.05). No hut type effect was observed on sow use of the hut, posture, or nursing behaviour. Piglets showed greater expression of thermoregulating behaviour in the morning on day two in the Wood hut as it was the coolest (P = 0.03). Huddling was found to be the most common technique employed by piglets for thermoregulation in all huts, representing 61.2-73.8% of their time. Piglets were in contact with the sow 10.6-16.1% of the time while not nursing. The percentages of sows killing at least one piglet by crushing or trauma during the first week after farrowing were 93%, 86% and 43% for Wood, Plastic, and Metal huts, respectively (P = 0.02). Mortalities during the first week due to crushing or trauma were 18%, 15%, and 11% of liveborn piglets for the Wood, Plastic, and Metal huts, respectively (P = 0.44). The riskiest time for piglets, in terms of being crushed was found to be when the sow was standing (P = 0.04). This study suggests that the indoor risk factors for crushing change when sows are housed in huts. The Metal hut appears to be the best compromise considering thermal environment, behaviour, and litter survival, but the results suggest a need for future research into hut designs for farrowing sows on pasture to reduce crushing risks.

AB  - Mycotoxins, unavoidable contaminants in feed and feed ingredients, have the potential to influence the incidence and severity of various diseases upon ingestion. Sheep coccidiosis is an enteric disease caused by protozoa of Eimeria spp. However, the extent to which the presence of aflatoxin b1 (AFB1) synergistically exacerbates damage to intestinal health in lambs with Eimeria remains unclear. 50-day-old female lambs were randomly assigned to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments for 15 days to assess the impact of AFB1 exposure on lambs with or without Eimeria (E.) ovinoidalis infection. Our findings reveal that AFB1 synergistically intensifies damage to intestinal health in lambs challenged by E. ovinoidalis. This is evidenced by disruptions to the intestinal microbiota and reductions in the production of short-chain fatty acids. AFB1 further aggravates damage to the cecal mechanical barrier. Additionally, AFB1 contributes to the entry of lipopolysaccharide into the bloodstream, activating the inflammatory response. Interestingly, AFB1 exposure history results in an early peak of oocyst excretion and a decreased number of oocyst excretion in E. ovinoidalis infected lambs. This may be closely linked to the destruction of the intestinal epithelial cell structure and its apoptosis, as indicated by a decreased ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax and increased caspase-3 levels. Mechanistically, proteomics analysis identified mitochondrial dysfunction (inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway) as the primary factor intensifying intestinal epithelial cell destruction caused by coccidia, exacerbated by AFB1 through the inhibiting the conversion of NADH to NAD+ in the cecum of lambs via down-regulation of the PGC-1 alpha/NRF1/TFAM pathway. Overall, these results offer novel insights into the AFB1 complicity in accelerating intestinal damage caused by E. ovinoidalis in lambs. Targeting the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway of the intestine may represent a new therapeutic strategy against the detrimental effects of mycotoxin and coccidia.

AB  - Two Mediterranean horseshoe bats Rhinolophus euryale were observed in Romanian Dobrudja on the 12 January 2016. This observation is the first record in Romania of the species away from its Carpathian Range. The two specimens were found hibernating in an abandoned mine shaft in the Padurea i Valea Canaraua Fetii, Iortmac Natural Reserve, near Baneasa, Constanta County, SE Romania. The only published record of the species in this region is from Bulgaria (Malkata Badzhaliya Cave in the valley of the Taban Dry River), about 24 km southwest of the Padurea Canaraua Fetii Natural Reserve. The karst area of the southern part of the Dobrudjan Plateau, which is characterised by dry valleys (former riverbeds) and scattered thermophilous deciduous forests, may represent the sole suitable habitat for the northernmost population of the Mediterranean horseshoe bats near the western shores of the Black Sea.

AB  - Simple Summary Termites are eusocial insects that live in large colonies made up of queens, kings, workers, and soldiers. Queens and kings start new colonies and continually reproduce. Workers are responsible for many crucial roles, including colony husbandry, foraging, and nest construction. Soldiers are adapted for colony defense, usually with large heads and mandibles to ward off predators, but their defensive adaptations prevent them from caring for themselves or performing tasks within the nest. The soldiers of some termite species participate in foraging, either directly by scouting food sources and recruiting workers, or indirectly by influencing worker foraging behavior through their presence. Colonies of the Formosan subterranean termite maintain relatively large soldier proportions compared to termites in their invasive range, but the potential soldier influence on foraging workers has not yet been studied. Since the soldiers of other termite species can influence food exploration, we hypothesized that soldier presence also influences foraging behavior in this species. We compared the exploratory behavior of foraging groups of 100 workers and either 0, 2, 10, or 30 soldiers to determine whether soldier concentration influenced tunnel complexity, tunnel speed, food location, or food collection. In the context of this study, soldier presence did not influence worker foraging behavior, which suggests that workers of the Formosan subterranean termite can maintain foraging efficiency regardless of fluctuations in soldier presence. Termites are eusocial insects that live in organized colonies consisting of reproductives, workers, and soldiers. Soldiers are specialized for defense but are expensive to maintain, as they are incapable of husbandry and must be fed and groomed by workers. The soldiers of several species influence foraging behavior by acting as scouts that initiate foraging or by mediating worker behavioral plasticity during food exploration. These behaviors imply that soldiers may play a keystone role in termite colony function, apart from defense. Subterranean termite workers tunnel through soil in search of food while accompanied by varying proportions of soldiers, depending on the species and colony conditions. Previous studies have shown that soldiers accelerate worker exploratory tunneling behavior in two Reticulitermes species, the colonies of which contain fewer than 2% soldiers. This effect, however, is unknown in other subterranean species with different soldier proportions. In this study, we examined the influence of soldiers on exploratory foraging behavior in the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, which is an economically devastating invasive species that maintains a relatively high soldier proportion (about 10%). When 100 foraging workers were grouped with 0, 2, 10, or 30 soldiers in two-dimensional foraging arenas, we found no significant effect of soldiers on the tunnel length, branch pattern, food source interception, or food collected within 96 h. These results suggest that C. formosanus colonies maintain food exploration efficiency regardless of soldier proportion variation.

AB  - Lactation represents a critical evolutionary adaptation in mammals, imposing heightened nutritional demands that drive shifts in foraging behavior and intestinal microbiota to optimize nutrient acquisition. In the sexually dimorphic Pratt's leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros pratti), males exhibit enlarged transverse lobes posterior to the nasal leaf, a morphological trait may influence echolocation dynamics and dietary niche partitioning. This provides an opportunity to examine dietary and microbiota differences between genders and across various reproductive states. Using high-throughput sequencing of fecal samples from male (HPM), non-lactating female (HPF), and lactating female (HPFL) H. pratti collected in late June, we identified gender- and physiology-linked ecological strategies. While dietary diversity indices showed no significant intergroup differences, compositional analysis revealed distinct prey preferences: both HPM and HPFL predominantly consumed Coleoptera, whereas HPF favored Diptera. Coleoptera's larger size and nutrient profile-rich in leucine, isoleucine, and chitin-likely optimize energy efficiency for HPFL, reducing foraging effort while supplying amino acids critical for mammary gland function and immunity. Gender-based differences were observed in intestinal microbiota diversity, with females demonstrating higher diversity indices compared to males. Males showed a notable abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, a proteolytic genus associated with Coleoptera digestion but linked to inflammatory risks via pathogenic strains. The HPFL group exhibited microbiota enriched in Lactococcus (chitinolytic taxa) and lactation-adapted symbionts: Lachnoclostridium may suppress pro-inflammatory responses via acetate production, while Pseudonocardia may enhance calcium homeostasis and antimicrobial defense. This study advances understanding of host-microbe coadaptation in mitigating life-history trade-offs and highlights ecological drivers of microbiota plasticity in insectivorous bats.

AB  - Simple Summary: Pork is one of the most important types of sources of protein in the human diet. Swine diseases cause major economic losses to the global pig industry. Early diagnosis and prevention of diseases are fundamental factors for maintaining the health of animals on pig farms. The present article is the first report on the successful isolation of the swinepox virus in Russia. The results of a laboratory experiment on animals revealed a low pathogenicity of the Russian isolate for pigs. We suggest that this isolate can be used as a viral vector for the development of vaccines for animals. In addition, we have demonstrated for the first time that nasal and oral swabs can be used for PCR diagnosis of the disease and for swinepox virus isolation.
   Abstract: Swinepox virus (SWPV) is the only member of the Suipoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family and is an etiologic agent of a worldwide disease specific for domestic and wild pigs. SWPV outbreaks are sporadically recorded in different regions of Russia. In 2013, an outbreak of the disease causing skin lesions was registered on a pig farm in Russia. The presence of SWPV in the scab samples was assessed by in-house real-time PCR, reference PCR amplification, and nucleotide sequencing of the viral late transcription factor-3 (VLTF-3) gene and was then confirmed by virus isolation. Thus, the in-house real-time PCR proposed in this study could serve as a useful tool for the rapid specific detection of the swinepox virus. In the study, it has been demonstrated for the first time that nasal and oral swabs can be used for PCR diagnosis of the disease and for swinepox virus isolation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolated virus was closely related to SWPV isolates registered in Germany, USA, and Brazil, and slightly differed from the Indian isolates. During experimental infection of pigs, a low pathogenicity of the Russian isolate was observed. Our data provides the first report on the isolation and characterization of swinepox virus in Russia.

AB  - In this study, the advantages of the vortex melting reduction treatment of red mud were verified. Vortex melting reduction can improve the feeding rate, promote the reaction and the directional deposition of iron, which was conducive to the separation of slag and gold. The effects of different adding methods, stirring speed and reaction time on iron recovery were investigated by using red mud, aluminum leached slag and calcified slag as raw materials. According to the experiment, the best reaction conditions were that the raw material put into the furnace by rolling pellets, stirring speed 125 RPM, and reaction time 30 min. The results provided an experimental basis for the harmless and high-value utilization of high-iron red mud treated by vortex melting reduction.

AB  - Recent advancements in supercapacitor technology have underscored the potential of graphite electrodes paired with ionic liquid electrolyte 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF6]) for efficient energy storage. While significant research has explored ion transport mechanisms at the electrode-electrolyte interface, particularly in porous electrodes, the influence of surface imperfections, such as point defects and square hole-like defects, on the graphite electrode surface remains less understood. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how random point defects and square hole defects affect the charging dynamics and ion diffusion behavior in graphite-based supercapacitors. We analyze the impact of these surface imperfections on key performance metrics, including charging time, surface charge density, and ion diffusion under varying electric field and pressure. For pristine graphite, we observe a camel-shaped differential capacitance-voltage dependence, with reduced charging time and increased cross-plane ion diffusion coefficient as voltage increases. The diffusion coefficient saturating at an applied voltage of 1.5 V. Point defects have minimal effect on charging relaxation time and the surface charge density, though the differential capacitance peaks at a defect concentration of 1.2%. In contrast, square pore-like defects lead to increases in charge density with defect size and depth, while charging time and diffusion coefficient display more complex dependencies. These results offer insight into defect-mediated electrochemical behavior in graphite electrodes and suggest pathways for engineering improved supercapacitor performance.

AB  - Simple Summary Over the last decades, sows' genetic selection was aimed at increasing litter size to improve profitability in the swine industry. However, large litter size has been associated with low birth weight, increased stillbirth rate and high perinatal mortality, which are traits linked to compromised welfare in modern pig production. These side effects related to large litter size are, in part, associated with early conceptuses and placental development. The action of progesterone is essential during early pregnancy stimulating the uterine tissue to produce and secrete nutrients, growth factors, ions, cytokines and other substances that together support a proper early embryo development and placentation, which in turn may result in greater litter traits at birth. The present study demonstrated that altrenogest (progesterone analogue) supplementation during early pregnancy (from day 6 to 12 of pregnancy) may contribute to profitability and welfare in pig production systems since it increased the number of total piglets born and born alive and decreased the stillbirth rate and the number of low birth weight (<800 g) piglets. Progesterone plays an important role in initial conceptus development and in a successful pregnancy, but results related to progesterone or its analogues (altrenogest) supplementation in early pregnancy of pigs are conflicting. The present study evaluated the effects of altrenogest supplementation in sows during days 6 and 12 of pregnancy on reproductive performance. On day 6 of pregnancy, 301 females were allocated at random to one of the following treatments: CON (Control: non-supplemented females, n = 163) or ALT (females daily supplemented with 20 mg of altrenogest, orally, from day 6 to 12 of pregnancy, n = 138). Ovulation was considered as occurred at 48 h after the first estrus detection to standardize the first day of pregnancy. The supplementation increased the number of total piglets born (ALT: 17.3 +/- 0.4; CON: 16.6 +/- 0.4), piglets born alive (ALT: 15.6 +/- 0.4; CON: 14.8 +/- 0.3), and placenta weight (ALT: 4.2 +/- 0.1; CON: 3.8 +/- 0.1) and decreased the stillbirth rate (ALT: 5.9 +/- 0.6; CON: 7.6 +/- 0.6) and the number of piglets born weighing less than 800 g (ALT: 6.6 +/- 0.6; CON: 8.0 +/- 0.6), without impairment on farrowing rate. These results demonstrated that altrenogest supplementation on swine females between days 6 and 12 of pregnancy may be used to improve reproductive performance.

AB  - Camellia japonica petals are colorful, rich in anthocyanins, and possess important ornamental, edible, and medicinal value. However, the regulatory mechanism of anthocyanin accumulation in C. japonica is still unclear. In this study, an integrative analysis of the metabolome and transcriptome was conducted in five C. japonica cultivars with different petal colors. Overall, a total of 187 flavonoids were identified (including 25 anthocyanins), and 11 anthocyanins were markedly differentially accumulated among these petals, contributing to the different petal colors in C. japonica. Moreover, cyanidin-3-O-(6('')-O-malonyl) glucoside was confirmed as the main contributor to the red petal phenotype, while cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside were responsible for the deep coloration of the C. japonica petals. Furthermore, a total of 12,531 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and overlapping DEGs (634 DEGs) were identified by RNA sequencing, and the correlation between the expression level of the DEGs and the anthocyanin content was explored. The candidate genes regulating anthocyanin accumulation in the C. japonica petals were identified and included 37 structural genes (especially CjANS and Cj4CL), 18 keys differentially expressed transcription factors (such as GATA, MYB, bHLH, WRKY, and NAC), and 16 other regulators (mainly including transporter proteins, zinc-finger proteins, and others). Our results provide new insights for elucidating the function of anthocyanins in C. japonica petal color expression.

AB  - Simple Summary Phytogenic feed additives are botanic origin compounds added to animal diets with organoleptic and bioactive properties that produce benefits on performance, health, and welfare, and they contribute to reducing the use of antibiotics based on the antimicrobial properties of many of them. Globally, their use as in-feed additives in pig diets has become more frequent, especially during the weaning period. Weaning is a particularly stressful period for the young pig that is associated with an abrupt change from the mother's milk to the dry feed and frequent outbreaks of digestive disorders and diarrhea, which is the main cause of mortality at this age. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of two plant-based feed supplementations to improve pig adaptation to weaning and to reduce the incidence of post-weaning colibacillosis by using an experimental model of disease. Our work showed that both supplements helped piglets fight enterotoxigenic E. coli but probably by means of different modes of action. Whereas the supplement based on essential oils seems to improve the microbiota balance, increasing the fecal lactobacilli/coliforms ratio, the combined supplement of essential oils and non-volatile compounds seems to have anti-inflammatory properties with a reduction in the intestinal damage and an improved immune response. This study evaluates the efficacy of two plant-based feed supplementations to fight colibacillosis in weanlings. A total of 96 piglets (32 pens) were assigned to four diets: a control diet (T1) or supplemented with ZnO (2500 ppm Zn) (T2) or two different plant supplements, T3 (1 kg/t; based on essential oils) and T4 (T3 + 1.5 kg/t based on non-volatile compounds). After one week, animals were challenged with ETEC F4, and 8 days after, one animal per pen was euthanized. Performance, clinical signs, microbial analysis, inflammatory response, intestinal morphology, and ileal gene expression were assessed. ZnO improved daily gains 4 days after challenge, T3 and T4 showing intermediate values (96, 249, 170, and 157 g/d for T1, T2, T3, and T4, p = 0.035). Fecal lactobacilli were higher with T3 and T4 compared to ZnO (7.55, 6.26, 8.71, and 8.27 cfu/gFM; p = 0.0007) and T3 increased the lactobacilli/coliforms ratio (p = 0.002). T4 was associated with lower levels of Pig-MAP (p = 0.07) and increases in villus/crypt ratio (1.49, 1.90, 1.73, and 1.84; p = 0.009). Moreover, T4 was associated with an upregulation of the REG3G gene (p = 0.013; p(FDR) = 0.228) involved in the immune response induced by enteric pathogens. In conclusion, both plant supplements enhanced animal response in front of an ETEC F4 challenge probably based on different modes of action.

AB  - During weaning, infants and young animals are susceptible to severe enteric infections, thus inducing intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal inflam-mation, and impaired intestinal barrier function. Pectin (PEC), a prebiotic polysaccharide, enhances intestinal health with the potential for a therapeutic effect on intestinal diseases. One 21-d study was conducted to investigate the protective effect of pectin against intestinal injury induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a piglet model. A total of 24 piglets (6.77 +/- 0.92 kg BW; Duroc x Landrace x Large White; barrows; 21 d of age) were randomly assigned into three groups: control group, LPS-challenged group, and PEC + LPS group. Piglets were administrated with LPS or saline on d14 and d21 of the experiment. All piglets were slaughtered and intestinal samples were collected after 3 h administration on d21. Pectin sup-plementation ameliorated the LPS-induced inflammation response and damage to the ileal morphology. Meanwhile, pectin also improved intestinal mucin barrier function, increased the mRNA expression of MUC2, and improved intestinal mucus glycosylation. LPS challenge reduced the diversity of intestinal mi-crobiota and enriched the relative abundance of Helicobacter. Pectin restored alpha diversity and improved the structure of the gut microbiota by enriching anti-inflammatory bacteria and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, and increased the concentrations of acetate. In addition, Spearman rank correlation analysis also revealed the potential relationship between intestinal microbiota and intestinal morphology, intestinal inflammation, and intestinal glycosylation in piglets. Taken together, these results indicate that pectin enhances intestinal integrity and barrier function by altering intestinal microbiota composition and their metabolites, which subsequently alleviates intestinal injury and finally improves the growth performance of piglets.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The most commonly used technique to vitrify pig embryos is the super open pulled straw (SOPS), where a maximum of 6 embryos can be vitrified simultaneously per device without compromising the mini-mum volume necessary for optimal preservation. Since optimal embryo transfer (ET) demands a transfer of 20-40 embryos per recipient, the customary use of SOPS complicates embryo warming and ET in field conditions. Such complications could be avoided when using the Cryotop (R) (OC) system, which has been proven to be an effective option for vitrifying at least 20 porcine embryos simultaneously. This study aimed to investigate the changes in the transcriptome of blastocysts caused by vitrification using both systems. In vivo-derived blastocysts were OC-(n 1/4 60; 20 embryos/device) and SOPS-(n 1/4 60; 4-6 embryos/device) vitrified and cultured for 24 h after warming. Nonvitrified blastocysts (n 1/4 60) cultured for 24 h postcollection acted as controls. At the end of culture, 48 viable embryos from each group (6 pools of 8 embryos) were selected for microarray (GeneChip (R) Porcine Genome Array, P/N 900624, Affymetrix) analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The survival rate of embryos vitrified with the OC and SOPS systems (>97%) was similar to that of the control embryos (10 0%). Microarray analysis of each vitrification system compared to the control group showed 245 DEGs (89 downregulated and 156 upregulated) for the OC system and 210 (44 downregulated and 166 upregulated) for the SOPS system. Two pathways were enriched for the DEGs specifically altered in each vitrification system compared to the control (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and carbon metabolism pathways for the OC system and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism and lysosome pathways in the SOPS group). The OC group showed 31 downregulated and 24 upregulated genes and two enriched pathways (mineral absorption and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways) when compared to the SOPS group. In summary, vitrification with the OC system altered fewer genes related to apoptosis and activated genes related to cell proliferation. We conclude that vitrification with either the OC or SOPS system has a moderate to low effect on the transcriptome of in vivo-derived porcine blastocysts. Further investigation is needed to elucidate how the differences in the transcriptome of embryos vitrified with these systems affect their subsequent developmental ability after ET.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Since determining the weight of pigs during large-scale breeding and production is challenging, using noncontact estimation methods is vital. This study proposed a novel pig weight prediction method based on a modified mask region-convolutional neural network (mask R-CNN). The modified approach used ResNeSt as the backbone feature extraction network to enhance the image feature extraction ability. The feature pyramid network (FPN) was added to the backbone feature extraction network for multi-scale feature fusion. The channel attention mechanism (CAM) and spatial attention mechanism (SAM) were introduced in the region proposal network (RPN) for the adaptive integration of local features and their global dependencies to capture global information, ultimately improving image segmentation accuracy. The modified network obtained a precision rate (P), recall rate (R), and mean average precision (MAP) of 90.33%, 89.85%, and 95.21%, respectively, effectively segmenting the pig regions in the images. Five image features, namely the back area, body length, body width, average depth, and eccentricity, were investigated. The pig depth images were used to build five regression algorithms (ordinary least squares (OLS), AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost, and random forest (RF)) for weight value prediction. AdaBoost achieved the best prediction result with a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.987, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.96 kg, a mean square error (MSE) of 12.87 kg 2 , and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.45%. The results demonstrated that the machine learning models effectively predicted the weight values of the pigs, providing technical support for intelligent pig farm management. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Pre-pubertal females produce more oocytes than adult individuals, but the ability of oocytes to undergo embryonic development and produce viable offspring is less in pre-pubertal animals than in adult animals. Oocyte quality is associated with abnormal gene expression. To date, the transcriptome profiles of 1-month-old lamb oocytes after in vitro maturation (IVM) are poorly reported. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lamb oocytes with varying competencies, affecting oocyte competence. Using RNA sequencing (RNA developmental -seq) technology, the transcriptome profiles of 1-month-old lamb oocytes after IVM were assessed, and oocytes from adult sheep large follicles were used as controls. We found 11 up-regulated and 39 down-regulated DEGs in lamb oocytes. Gene Ontology analysis of DEGs showed that molecular functions were clustered in catalytic and binding activities, while biological processes were clustered in metabolic process, cellular process, single-organism process and biological regulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the DEGs were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway, or DNA replication. In lamb MII oocytes, down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes (ATP5E, NDUFA7 and COX6C), thiol protease inhibitor (CSTB) and 26S proteasome component (SHFM1) and up-regulation of CUL1, MARCH7 and TRIM17 might cause low competence of lamb embryos. In conclusion, this study provided detailed information on mRNA transcriptomes in lamb oocytes after IVM, which offers insights into the reduced developmental potential of lamb oocytes.

AB  - Many specialist herbivores have evolved strategies to cope with plant defences, with gut microbiota potentially participating to such adaptations. In this study, we assessed whether the history of plant use (population origin) and microbiota may interact with plant defence adaptation. We tested whether microbiota enhance the performance of Melitaea cinxia larvae on their host plant, Plantago lanceolata and increase their ability to cope the defensive compounds, iridoid glycosides (IGs). The gut microbiota were significantly affected by both larval population origin and host plant IG level. Contrary to our prediction, impoverishing the microbiota with antibiotic treatment did not reduce larval performance. As expected for this specialized insect herbivore, sequestration of one of IGs was higher in larvae fed with plants producing higher concentration of IGs. These larvae also showed metabolic signature of intoxication (i.e. decrease in Lysine levels). However, intoxication on highly defended plants was only observed when larvae with a history of poorly defended plants were simultaneously treated with antibiotics. Our results suggest that both adaptation and microbiota contribute to the metabolic response of herbivores to plant defence though complex interactions.

AB  - Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have the unique ability of both self-renewing and to produce progeny that undergoes differentiation to spermatozoa. As SSCs exist in very low numbers, therefore efficient in vitro expansion of SSCs is important prior to their clinical applications. In this study, we tried to improve the functionality of putative SSCs (pSSCs) during culture using poly-D-lysine (PDL) coating. For this, plates were coated with 0.01% PDL with different coating time interim treatments (5, 30 and 60 min) while control remained uncoated. The adequate amount of pSSCs of the goat was isolated and enriched using two-step enzymatic digestion and differential plating methods. Further, the functionality of pSSCs was evaluated by cell growth analysis, cell proliferation, senescence, and the presence of pluripotency (alkaline phosphatase, OCT-4) and SSC related (PGP-9.5) markers. The number and size of pSSCs colonies in 0.01% PDL coating groups were significantly (P <0.05) higher than in the control group. Similarly, pSSCs on uncoated plates expressed significantly (P <0.05) higher beta-galactosidase expression indicating higher senescence of pSSCs on uncoated plates than PDL-coated plates. The results suggest that PDL provides a favourable microenvironment for pSSCs culture as indicated by early attachment, proliferation, and decreased senescence. This strategy may significantly contribute to the efficient culture of pSSCs for further studies of the regulatory mechanism of pSSCs proliferation and differentiation.

AB  - Evidence from human and animal studies indicate that disrupted light cycles leads to alterations of the sleep state, poor cognition, and the risk of developing neuroinflammatory and generalized health disorders. Zebrafish exhibit a diurnal circadian rhythm and are an increasingly popular model in studies of neurophysiology and neuropathophysiology. Here, we investigate the effect of alterations in light cycle on the adult zebrafish brain: we measured the effect of altered, unpredictable light exposure in adult zebrafish telencephalon, homologous to mammalian hippocampus, and the optic tectum, a significant visual processing center with extensive telencephalon connections. The expression of heat shock protein-70 (HSP70), an important cell stress mediator, was significantly decreased in optic tectum of adult zebrafish brain following four days of altered light exposure. Further, pSer473-Akt (protein kinase B) was significantly reduced in telencephalon following light cycle alteration, and pSer9-GSK3 beta (glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) was significantly reduced in both the telencephalon and optic tectum of light-altered fish. Animals exposed to five minutes of environmental enrichment showed significant increase in pSer473Akt, which was significantly attenuated by four days of altered light exposure. These data show for the first time that unpredictable light exposure alters HSP70 expression and dysregulates Akt-GSK3 beta signaling in the adult zebrafish brain.

AB  - Introduction Articular cartilage is an avascular, aneural, and lymphatic tissue with limited capacity to regenerate. Numerous techniques have been employed to repair or regenerate; however, the success rate varies. In fact, most of them result in the formation of fibrocartilage, not hyaline cartilage. The future of treating cartilage defects lies in providing biological solutions through cartilage regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising therapy for cartilage regeneration. These cells secrete factors that enhance cartilage repair. This study studied the effects of intra-articular injection of human umbilical cord MSC (hUC-MSC) secretome on cartilage damage in a sheep model. Methods Standardized rectangular (5x5 mm) full-thickness chondral defects were created in the lateral femoral condyle of 15 adult sheep and debrided down to the subchondral bone plate. Three treatment groups were tested: 4 microfracture perforations using 1.0mm diameter awls (group 1), intra-articular injection of hUC-MSC secretome (group 2), and a combination of microfracture and intra-articular injection of hUC-MSC secretome (group 3). The osteochondral repair was assessed at 6 months using an established macroscopic and histological analyses. Results Macroscopically, combined therapy application shows significant cartilage repair improvement compared to microfracture alone (p=0.004). Microscopically, the application of combined therapy shows significant improvement of cartilage repair compared to secretome injection alone (p=0.031). Conclusion Microfracture combined with injection of hUCB-MSCs secretome could be an effective alternative for repairing articular cartilage defects in vivo.

AB  - The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), poses a significant threat to agricultural production due to its herbivorous feeding habits and pesticide resistance. This study investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of chlorfenapyr (LC10, LC20 and LC30) on the development an d reproduction of T. urticae and its predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) under controlled laboratory conditions. Bioassay tests were conducted using a leaf disk dipping method at various pesticide concentrations. The raw data from the life table experiments were analyzed based on age-stage, two-sex life table analysis at a 5% significance level. Ou r findings revealed significantly reduced T. urticae egg hatching time at LC20. The duration of larva an d protonymph stages of predatory mites often increased from LC20 onwards, while the deutonymph stage showed no significant changes. The total lifespan of T. urticae decreased from 23.11 days (control) to 18.65 days (LC30 ) and in both predators, it significantly reduced from LC20. The fecundity, GRR and R0 declined significantly at LC10 and above for all species, and the mean generation time (T) showed a significant reduction only in T. urticae. The results suggest that chlorfenapyr displays high toxicity against T. urticae, potentially enablin g effective control at low concentrations, while having minimal impact on N. californicus at field-relevant concentrations, as significant effects were observed at higher doses, and exhibiting moderately toxic to P. persimilis, demonstrating its selective toxicity and making it a viable option for IPM programs when applied at appropriate concentrations to minimize risks to beneficial predatory mites.

AB  - Herbivore-associated elicitors (HAEs) are active molecules produced by herbivorous insects. Recognition of HAEs by plants induces defence that resist herbivore attacks. We previously demonstrated that the tomato red spider mite Tetranychus evansi triggered defence in Nicotiana benthamiana. However, our knowledge of HAEs from T. evansi remains limited. Here, we characterize a novel HAE, Te16, from T. evansi and dissect its function in mite-plant interactions. We investigate the effects of Te16 on spider mites and plants by heterologous expression, virus-induced gene silencing assay, and RNA interference. Te16 induces cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, callose deposition, and jasmonate (JA)-related responses in N. benthamiana leaves. Te16-mediated cell death requires a calcium signalling pathway, cytoplasmic localization, the plant co-receptor BAK1, and the signalling components SGT1 and HSP90. The active region of Te16-induced cell death is located at amino acids 114-293. Moreover, silencing Te16 gene in T. evansi reduces spider mite survival and hatchability, but expressing Te16 in N. benthamiana leaves enhances plant resistance to herbivores. Finally, Te16 gene is specific to Tetranychidae species and is highly conserved in activating plant immunity. Our findings reveal a novel salivary protein produced by spider mites that elicits plant defence and resistance to insects, providing valuable clues for pest management.

AB  - PremiseDomestication of plant species results in phenotypic modifications and changes in biotic interactions. Most studies have compared antagonistic plant-herbivore interactions of domesticated plants and their wild relatives, but little attention has been given to how domestication influences plant-pollinator interactions. Floral attributes and interactions of floral visitors were compared between sister taxa of the genus Cucurbita (Cucurbitaceae), the domesticated C. moschata, C. argyrosperma ssp. argyrosperma and its wild progenitor C. argyrosperma ssp. sororia in the place of origin. MethodsWe conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to compare floral morphological traits and analyzed floral reward (nectar and pollen) quantity and quality between flowers of wild and domesticated Cucurbita taxa. Staminate and pistillate flowers of all three taxa were video recorded, and visitation and behavior of floral visitors were registered and analyzed. ResultsMost floral morphological characteristics of flowers of domesticated taxa were larger in both staminate and pistillate flowers. Staminate and pistillate flowers presented distinct correlations between floral traits and integration indices between domesticated and wild species. Additionally, pollen quantity and protein to lipid ratio were greater in domesticated species. Cucurbit pollen specialists, Eucera spp., had the highest probability of visit for all Cucurbita taxa. ConclusionsWe provide evidence that floral traits of domesticated and wild Cucurbita species experienced different selection pressures. Domesticated Cucurbita species may have more resources invested towards floral traits, thereby increasing attractiveness to pollinators and potentially plant reproductive success. Wild ancestor plant populations should be conserved in their centers of origin to preserve plant-pollinator interactions.

AB  - The pharmacological activation of the GPR39 receptor has been proposed as a novel strategy for treating seizures; however, this hypothesis has not been verified experimentally. TC-G 1008 is a small molecule agonist increasingly used to study GPR39 receptor function but has not been validated using gene knockout. Our aim was to assess whether TC-G 1008 produces anti-seizure/anti-epileptogenic effects in vivo and whether the effects are mediated by GPR39. To obtain this goal we utilized various animal models of seizures/epileptogenesis and GPR39 knockout mice model. Generally, TC-G 1008 exacerbated behavioral seizures. Furthermore, it increased the mean duration of local field potential recordings in response to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in zebrafish larvae. It facilitated the development of epileptogenesis in the PTZ-induced kindling model of epilepsy in mice. We demonstrated that TC-G 1008 aggravated PTZ-epileptogenesis by selectively acting at GPR39. However, a concomitant analysis of the downstream effects on the cyclic-AMP-response element binding protein in the hippocampus of GPR39 knockout mice suggested that the molecule also acts via other targets. Our data argue against GPR39 activation being a viable therapeutic strategy for treating epilepsy and suggest investigating whether TC-G 1008 is a selective agonist of the GPR39 receptor.

AB  - Silicon (Si) plays a pivotal role in enhancing plant resilience against abiotic stressors, yet the precise mechanisms underlying its potential in mitigating cadmium toxicity in camelina remain poorly elucidated. This study focuses on examining the impact of different treatments of foliar Si such as 0 ppm Si with 0 ppm Cd (T0Cd0), 2.5 ppm Si with 0 ppm Cd (T1Cd0), 5 ppm Si with 0 ppm Cd (T2Cd0), 0 ppm Si with 5 ppm Cd (T0Cd1), 2.5 ppm Si with 5 ppm Cd (T1Cd1), and 5 ppm with 5 ppm Cd (T2Cd1) application on two camelina cultivars cultivated under hydroponic conditions of cadmium-induced stress. Cadmium stress significantly impaired various aspects of plant development, including growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, and the activities of key antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase. Additionally, cadmium accumulation was higher in both root and leaf tissues under stress. The Canadian cultivar demonstrated greater susceptibility to cadmium at a concentration of 5 ppm compared to the Australian cultivar. However, the introduction of silicon at a concentration of 5 ppm effectively alleviated the toxic effects of cadmium, with the Australian cultivar showing a more substantial response relative to the Canadian counterpart. These findings highlight silicon's crucial role in mitigating cadmium toxicity in camelina, enhancing growth and antioxidant defenses under stress.

AB  - Aliphatic glucosinolates are a large group of plant secondary metabolites characteristic of Brassicaceae, including the model plant Arabidopsis. The diverse and complex degradation products of aliphatic glucosinolates contribute to plant responses to herbivory, pathogen attack, and environmental stresses. Most of the biosynthesis genes in the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway have been cloned in Arabidopsis, and the research focus has recently shifted to the regulatory mechanisms controlling aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation. Up till now, more than 40 transcriptional regulators have been identified as regulating the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway, but many more novel regulators likely remain to be discovered based on research evidence over the past decade. In the current study, we took a systemic approach to functionally test 155 candidate transcription factors in Arabidopsis identified by yeast one-hybrid assay, and successfully validated at least 30 novel regulators that could significantly influence the accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates in our experimental set-up. We also showed that the regulators of the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway have balanced positive and negative effects, and glucosinolate metabolism and plant development can be coordinated. Our work is the largest scale effort so far to validate transcriptional regulators of a plant secondary metabolism pathway, and provides new insights into how the highly diverse plant secondary metabolism is regulated at the transcriptional level.

AB  - California was the second largest sheep-producing state in the US, with an inventory of 533,000 head of sheep and lambs in 2022. Mastitis is a health and welfare concern for ewes and lambs. Mastitis is one of the top reasons for the removal of ewes from the flock and antibiotic use in ewes. In this study, California sheep producers were surveyed on the management of ewes. Seventy-one surveys were completed. Most respondents had flocks of >= 100 sheep (54%; 38/71). Twenty-three percent (16/70) of the respondents reported having >5% udder abnormalities in a flock per lactation. Further analysis showed two clusters among participating farms. Larger flock sizes, the use of breeding ewes for meat or wool production or contract grazing, and more extensive management practices were associated with >5% udder abnormalities and >= 5% orphan lambs. A subset of the respondents (20) participated in serological testing for small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) in sheep. A total of 1106 ewes or ewe lambs were sampled. The ewe-level seroprevalence was 14.1% (183/1106), and the flock-level seroprevalence was 75% (15/20) of the sampled farms. Our results describe flock demographics, management practices, and producer-reported udder health abnormalities in California ewes. Larger flock sizes and extensive management practices could be risk factors for udder abnormalities in ewes. (1) Background: Information is lacking on small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) status, prevalence, risk factors, and control measures for mastitis in California ewes. The goal of this survey was to outline characteristics of the sheep industry in California related to udder health and mastitis management. (2) Methods: An online survey consisting of 48 questions was completed by respondents between April 2022 and February 2023. Descriptive analysis and chi-squared tests were conducted to evaluate associations between variables. A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) of general management practices, udder health management, and flock demographics was performed to assess clustering. A subset of respondents (20) participated in SRLV serology testing. (3) Results: Seventy-one completed surveys were submitted. The MCA showed two clusters. Larger flock sizes, the use of breeding ewes for meat or wool production or contract grazing, and extensive management practices were more closely related to >5% udder abnormalities per lactation and >= 5% orphan lambs. The flock-level seroprevalence of SRLV was 75% (15/20), and ewe-level seroprevalence was 14.1% (183/1106). (4) Conclusions: The results of this study highlight areas that need further research, such as exploring differences in mastitis and SRLV incidences among management systems, the efficacy of mastitis treatments, and education on critical timepoints for mastitis diagnosis and control.

AB  - BACKGROUND The objective of the study was to examine the expression profiles of mitochondrial proteins in at-death and 24 h postmortem (PM) using tandem mass tag (TMT) approach to characterize the mitochondria possible mechanisms that are affiliated with tenderization. RESULTS Results showed that the tender meat at 24 h PM emerged with more serious mitochondrial damage. Altogether 456 mitochondrial proteins were identified, including 442 down-regulated and 14 up-regulated proteins. These differentially-expressed proteins were primarily involved in the progress of PM energy metabolism, apoptosis, and the morphological alterations of mitochondrial. Among them, 47 subunits (such as NDUFA2, COX4I1, and ATP5PB) were annotated into the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3 involving in the damage of MPTP, and IMMT, CHCHD3, APOL and APOO modulating the morphology of mitochondria, and DIABLO and AIFM1 released from mitochondria affect caspase's activation. HSPD1 and HSPE1 involved in apoptosis, mitochondrial physiological and morphological alterations. CONCLUSION The earlier-mentioned proteins were validated as potential indicators of tenderness regulated by mitochondrial damage. These results highlighted that mitochondrial damage possibly participate in PM tenderization of beef muscles by energy metabolism and cell apoptosis status. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Background: The presented study evaluated the suppositional changes in the airway expression of Nav1.8 and Nav1.7 and their role in the airway defense mechanisms in healthy animals and in an experimental asthma model. Methods: The effects of the blockers inhalation on the reactivity of guinea pig airways, number of citric-acid-induced coughs and ciliary beating frequency (CBF) were tested in vivo. Chronic inflammation simulating asthma was induced by repetitive exposure to ovalbumin. The expression of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 was examined by ELISA. Results: The Nav 1.8 blocker showed complex antitussive and bronchodilatory effects and significantly regulated the CBF in healthy and sensitized animals. The Nav1.7 blockers significantly inhibited coughing and participated in CBF control in the ovalbumin-sensitized animals. The increased expression of the respective ion channels in the sensitized animals corresponded to changes in CBF regulation. The therapeutic potency of the Nav1.8 blocker was evidenced in combinations with classic bronchodilators. Conclusion: The allergic-inflammation-upregulated expression of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 and corresponding effects of blocker inhalation on airway defense mechanisms, along with the Nav1.8 blocker's compatibility with classic antiasthmatic drugs, bring novel possibilities for the treatment of various respiratory diseases. However, the influence of the Nav1.8 blocker on CBF requires further investigation.

AB  - Simple Summary Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type C is a spore-forming pathogenic bacterium characterized by the secretion of fatal toxins, which are absorbed into the body, causing diarrhea. Diarrhea has already brought about tremendous economic losses in pig farms worldwide. However, the understanding of lncRNAs' regulatory mechanisms of the spleen in piglets challenged by C. perfringens type C is still limited. This paper aimed to identify antagonistic lncRNAs associated with the spleen in piglets challenged by C. perfringens type C. The study found that four lncRNAs are involved in immune-/inflammation-related pathways to regulate cytokine genes against C. perfringens type C infection.
   Abstract: LncRNAs play important roles in resisting bacterial infection via host immune and inflammation responses. Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type C is one of the main bacteria causing piglet diarrhea diseases, leading to major economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. In our previous studies, piglets resistant (SR) and susceptible (SS) to C. perfringens type C were identified based on differences in host immune capacity and total diarrhea scores. In this paper, the RNA-Seq data of the spleen were comprehensively reanalyzed to investigate antagonistic lncRNAs. Thus, 14 lncRNAs and 89 mRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) between the SR and SS groups compared to the control (SC) group. GO term enrichment, KEGG pathway enrichment and lncRNA-mRNA interactions were analyzed to identify four key lncRNA targeted genes via MAPK and NF-kappa B pathways to regulate cytokine genes (such as TNF-alpha and IL-6) against C. perfringens type C infection. The RT-qPCR results for six selected DE lncRNAs and mRNAs are consistent with the RNA-Seq data. This study analyzed the expression profiling of lncRNAs in the spleen of antagonistic and sensitive piglets and found four key lncRNAs against C. perfringens type C infection. The identification of antagonistic lncRNAs can facilitate investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to diarrhea in piglets.

AB  - Canada's livestock production and human populations are concentrated in southern regions. Understanding spatial and temporal distributions of animals and excreted nutrients is key to optimizing manure resources and minimizing impact of livestock. Here, we identify manureshed concerns and opportunities by reconciling nitrogen supply and demand on a regional and national scale. Data based on national statistics and farm surveys were allocated to homogeneous soil polygons (Soil Landscapes of Canada [SLC]) to quantify changes in nutrient distribution and ammonia (NH3) emissions across Canada (1981-2018). Livestock sectors tied to domestic consumption, dairy and poultry, were stable over time and well dispersed. Export driven beef production has moved west since 1981, whereas pig production was prominent in Manitoba, Quebec, and Ontario. Per ha manure N excretion across livestock sectors in 2018 was generally low with 58% and 6% of the SLCs averaging 100 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Although only 3% of SLCs had average NH3 emissions reaching 16-200 kg ha(-1), most of these were located near cities and emissions spiked in spring when more people might be exposed. The greatest concentrations of nutrients and livestock occurred around the three largest metropolitan areas: Toronto, Montreal-Quebec City, and Vancouver, posing challenges for nutrient recycling and public health. This study shows that as Canadian cities and livestock agriculture grow in southern Canada, so will challenges around food production, human health, and managing nutrients. Livestock and land use strategies are needed to reconcile changing animal sectors and growing populations.

AB  - In order to realize the independent and safe operation of trenching robot in Camellia oleifera forest, operation path planning is the key link. Aiming at the problem of trenching operation path planning in complex dynamic Camellia oleifera forest environment, a trenching operation path planning method of Camellia oleifera forest based on human-robot collaboration was proposed. In order to meet the requirements of trenching operation in Camellia oleifera forest, the ring trenching operation path was planned around Camellia oleifera tree; Aiming at the unknown obstacles in the dynamic Camellia oleifera forest environment, the digital twin technology was used to map the dynamic Camellia oleifera forest environment into the twin space in real time, assist the operator to recognize the dynamic Camellia oleifera forest environment information and issue decision instructions. According to the man-machine collaborative decision-making instructions and dynamic environmental information, the twin environment model of Camellia oleifera forest was updated in real-time, and the collision detection method combining virtual and real was adopted to avoid collision and re-plan the trenching operation path. The experimental results show that the repetition rate of the trenching operation path of the Camellia oleifera forest planned by this method is reduced by 1.64 percentage points, the slope standard deviation is reduced by 40.365 %, and the operation path is more stable; In addition, the re-planning of the operation path of the trenching robot based on digital twin under human-robot cooperation prevents collision with the dynamic obstacles of the Camellia oleifera forest, which provides a new idea for the intelligentization of the trenching operation of the Camellia oleifera forest.

AB  - ObjectivesIn the study, we examined the effects of ketamine and extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) on depression-like behavior, learning and memory, expression of GFAP, caspase-3, p53, BDNF, and NMDA receptor in animals subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). MethodsAfter applying 21 days of chronic unpredictable stress, male rats received intraperitoneal (IP) of ketamine (5 mg/kg) and then were exposed to ELF-EMF (10-Hz, 10-mT exposure conditions) for 3 days (3 h per day) and behavioral assessments were performed 24 h after the treatments. Instantly after the last behavioral test, the brain was extracted for Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR analyses. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to assess the effect of ketamine and ELF-EMF on the expression of astrocyte marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Also, real-time PCR analyses were used to investigate the impacts of the combination of ketamine and ELF-EMF on the expression of caspase3, p53, BDNF, and NMDA receptors in the hippocampus in rats submitted to the CUS procedure. Results were considered statistically significant when p Our results revealed that the combination of ketamine and ELF-EMF increased depression-like behavior, increased degenerated neurons and decreased the number of GFAP (+) cells in the CA1 area and mPFC, incremented the expression of caspase-3, and reduced the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus but showed no effect on the expression of p53 and NMDA-R. ConclusionsThese results reveal that combining ketamine and ELF-EMF has adverse effects on animals under chronic unpredictable stress (CUS).

AB  - Like a wide variety of other wild and cultivated plants, Camellia species carry cellular T-DNA sequences (cT-DNAs) in their nuclear genomes, resulting from natural Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Short and long DNA sequencing reads of 435 accessions belonging to 72 Camellia species (representing 12 out of 14 sections) were investigated for the occurrence of cT-DNA insertions. In all, 12 different cT-DNAs were recovered, either completely or partially, called CaTA to CaTL. Divergence analysis of internal cT-DNA repeats revealed that the insertion events span a period from 0.075 to 15 Mio years ago, and yielded an average transformation frequency of one event per 1.25 Mio years. The two oldest inserts, CaTA and CaTD, have been modified by spontaneous deletions and inversions, and by insertion of various plant sequences. In those cases where enough accessions were available (C. japonica, C. oleifera, C. chekiangoleosa, C. sasanqua and C. pitardii), the younger cT-DNA inserts showed a patchy distribution among different accessions of each species, indicating that they are not genetically fixed. It could be shown that Camellia breeding has led to intersectional transfer of cT-DNAs. Altogether, the cT-DNAs cover 374 kb, and carry 47 open reading frames (ORFs). Two Camellia cT-DNA genes, CaTH-orf358 and CaTK-orf8, represent new types of T-DNA genes. With its large number of cT-DNA sequences, the genus Camellia constitutes an interesting model for the study of natural Agrobacterium transformants.

AB  - To explore the individual and interactive effects of the interneurons cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons (CCKs) and parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (BCs) on sharp wave-ripples (SWR) and the underlying mechanisms, we constructed a mathematical model of the hippocampal CA3 network. By modulating the activity of CCKs and BCs, it was verified that CCKs inhibit the generation of SWR, while the activity of BCs affects the occurrence of SWR. Additionally, it was postulated that CCKs exert an influence on SWR through a direct mechanism, wherein CCKs directly modulate pyramidal cells (PCs). It was also discovered that BCs control SWR mainly through mutual inhibition among BCs. Furthermore, by adjusting the strength of the interaction between BCs and CCKs at various levels, it was identified that the interaction between these two types of interneurons has a relatively symmetrical effect on the regulation of SWR, functioning through a mutual inhibition mechanism. Our findings not only offer a deeper understanding of how CCKs and BCs independently regulate the generation of SWR but also provide novel insights into how changes in the strength of their interaction affect network oscillations. The results emphasize the crucial role of inhibitory interneurons in maintaining normal hippocampal oscillations, which are essential for proper brain function, particularly in the domains of memory consolidation and cognitive processes.

AB  - Emotional experiences can profoundly impact our conceptual model of the world, modifying how we represent and remember a host of information even indirectly associated with that experienced in the past. Yet, how a new emotional experience infiltrates and spreads across pre-existing semantic knowledge structures (e.g., categories) is unknown. We used a modified aversive sensory preconditioning paradigm in fMRI (n = 35) to investigate whether threat memories integrate with a pre-established category to alter the representation of the entire category. We observed selective but transient changes in the representation of conceptually related items in the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and occipitotemporal cortex following threat conditioning to a simple cue (geometric shape) pre-associated with a different, but related, set of category exemplars. These representational changes persisted beyond 24 h in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex. Reactivation of the semantic category during threat conditioning, combined with activation of the hippocampus or medial prefrontal cortex, was predictive of subsequent amygdala reactivity toward novel category members attest. This provides evidence for online integration of emotional experiences into semantic categories, which then promotes threat generalization. Behaviorally, threat conditioning by proxy selectively and retroactively enhanced recognition memory and increased the perceived typicality of the semantic category indirectly associated with threat. These findings detail a complex route through which new emotional learning generalizes by modifying semantic structures built up over time and stored in memory as conceptual knowledge.

AB  - Monoterpenes are one of the most common groups belonging to the terpenoid family, with a C10 structure comprising of two isoprene units. Most of monoterpenes are volatile plant compounds, and they act as signaling molecules between plants and the environment, particularly as defensive compounds against herbivores and pathogens. In this study, 1,8-cineole synthase (SgCINS) gene was identified and cloned from the leaves of Salvia guaranitica plant. To examine the role of SgCINS in insect resistance, we transformed and expressed this gene into tobacco leaves. The metabolic analysis revealed that the production of various types and amount of terpenoid was increased and decreased in SgCINS overexpression and control lines, respectively, suggesting that overexpressing SgCINS in transgenic tobacco plants lead to an increase in the production of various types of terpenoids and other phytochemical compounds. These results indicated why transgenic tobacco was highly resistant against cotton worm than the highly susceptible control plants. Our results demonstrate that the SgCINS gene can play an important role in plants against cotton worm insect attack, and pave the way for using terpenoids genes for improving resistance to insect attack in higher plants.

AB  - Zinc is an essential nutrient at low concentrations, but toxic at slightly higher ones. It has been proposed that hyperaccumulator plants may use the excess zinc to fend off pathogens and herbivores. However, there is little evidence of a similar response in other plants. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana leaves inoculated with the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina BMM (PcBMM) accumulate zinc and manganese at the infection site. Zinc accumulation did not occur in a double mutant in the zinc transporters HEAVY METAL ATPASE2 and HEAVY METAL ATPASE4 (HMA2 and HMA4), which has reduced zinc translocation from roots to shoots. Consistent with a role in plant immunity, expression of HMA2 and HMA4 was up-regulated upon PcBMM inoculation, and hma2hma4 mutants were more susceptible to PcBMM infection. This phenotype was rescued upon zinc supplementation. The increased susceptibility to PcBMM infection was not due to the diminished expression of genes involved in the salicylic acid, ethylene, or jasmonate pathways since they were constitutively up-regulated in hma2hma4 plants. Our data indicate a role of zinc in resistance to PcBMM in plants containing ordinary levels of zinc. This layer of immunity runs in parallel to the already characterized defence pathways, and its removal has a direct effect on resistance to pathogens.

AB  - For many mammals, the tongue provides an important functional interface with the environment through roles including manipulating, ingesting, and mechanically processing food items. As such, the adaptations of the tongue reflect different physical properties of an animal's diet. We sought to investigate whether adaptations of the tongue are apparent in two native Australian rodents that have divergent dietary niches: the semiaquatic and mixed feeding rakali (Hydromys chrysoga-ster) and the arid dwelling, herbivorous stick-nest rat (Leporillus conditor). Both species retained many lingual features typical of rodents. A notable difference was a large, annular pad surrounding the single circumvallate papilla in H. chrysogaster, suggesting an enhanced gustatory function, which would be consistent with adaptation to a semiaquatic, mixed diet. In contrast, L. conditor appeared to have reduced gustatory sensitivity and mechanical dexterity, consistent with crushing their preferred succulent plant forage and manipulating sticks for nest building. The descriptions provide a novel view of the evolution of soft tissues within Australian endemic rodents.

AB  - As the population grows, so does waste generation, which is a major concern, particularly in developing countries. Although composting and vermicomposting are environmentally friendly methods of managing organic waste, one of the major downsides is the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The most essential elements influencing GHG generation are aeration, C/N ratio, temperature, pH, bulking agent, and moisture content, all of which are thoroughly explained in this review. Vermicomposting emits less GHGs than composting in many cases mostly in reduction of methane (CH4) emissions; however, earthworms are also significant contributors to nitrous oxide (N2O) during vermicomposting, imposing the need to juxtapose both processes in context to GHGs emission (GHGsE). Effective GHGsE measuring methodologies allows for the calculation of emissions while also assisting in the identification of the critical elements relevant to GHGs emission reduction. Various methodology implemented for GHGs measurement and among them chamber method is the most common method used. Finally, the review also discussed the already existing mitigation measures as well as perspectives.

AB  - Background In zoology, species descriptions conventionally rely on invasive morphological techniques, frequently leading to damage of the specimens and thus only a partial understanding of their structural complexity. More recently, non-destructive imaging techniques have successfully been used to describe smaller fauna, but this approach has so far not been applied to identify or describe larger animal species. Here, we present a combination of entirely non-invasive as well as minimally invasive methods that permit taxonomic descriptions of large zoological specimens in a more comprehensive manner. Results Using the single available representative of an allegedly novel species of deep-sea cephalopod (Mollusca: Cephalopoda), digital photography, standardized external measurements, high-field magnetic resonance imaging, micro-computed tomography, and DNA barcoding were combined to gather all morphological and molecular characters relevant for a full species description. The results show that this specimen belongs to the cirrate octopod (Octopoda: Cirrata) genus Grimpoteuthis Robson, 1932. Based on the number of suckers, position of web nodules, cirrus length, presence of a radula, and various shell characters, the specimen is designated as the holotype of a new species of dumbo octopus, G. imperator sp. nov. The digital nature of the acquired data permits a seamless online deposition of raw as well as derived morphological and molecular datasets in publicly accessible repositories. Conclusions Using high-resolution, non-invasive imaging systems intended for the analysis of larger biological objects, all external as well as internal morphological character states relevant for the identification of a new megafaunal species were obtained. Potentially harmful effects on this unique deep-sea cephalopod specimen were avoided by scanning the fixed animal without admixture of a contrast agent. Additional support for the taxonomic placement of the new dumbo octopus species was obtained through DNA barcoding, further underlining the importance of combining morphological and molecular datasets for a holistic description of zoological specimens.

AB  - Placental development plays a pivotal role in ensuring successful pregnancy outcomes, yet its molecular regulatory mechanisms in sheep remain poorly characterized. This study aimed to systematically investigate stage-specific proteomic dynamics and functional adaptations in ovine placental tissues across gestation to elucidate molecular drivers of placental maturation. Using data-independent acquisition proteomics, we identified 7774 proteins in Hu sheep placental tissues at gestational days 50, 80, and 120. Comparative analysis revealed 1450, 1026, and 1964 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the 50 d vs. 80 d, 80 d vs. 120 d, and 50 d vs. 120 d comparisons, respectively. DEPs were functionally enriched in biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, nutrient transport, and steroid synthesis, with prominent involvement of the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and estrogen signaling pathways. Protein interaction networks identified SRC, MAP3K1, KRAS, and TJP1 as central regulators exhibiting dynamic expression patterns across gestation. Temporal expression trends showed progressive upregulation of tight junction, immune response, and glucose metabolism proteins, contrasting with downregulation of endoplasmic reticulum protein processing and proteasome components. Validation experiments confirmed elevated proliferation/transport gene expression at 80 d versus 50 d, followed by increased apoptosis/transport genes and decreased proliferation markers at 120 d. This comprehensive proteomic profiling reveals stage-specific regulatory networks governing placental development in sheep, highlighting coordinated shifts in proliferative, metabolic, and structural remodeling processes. These findings advance our understanding of placental adaptation mechanisms and provide valuable insights for improving reproductive management in livestock species.

AB  - The article summarizes the results of two surveys of the bat fauna of the Tay Con Linh mountain range in northern Vietnam (Ha Giang Province) on the border with China. Previously published data on these mountains showed the presence of a rich and unique fauna of rodents and, especially, insectivores, but information about chiropterans for this territory has so far been fragmentary. Surveys carried out in March 2017 and April 2023 at altitudes ranging from 570 to 2300 m asl identified at least 30 bat species from four families. Some of the species found are known in Indochina from isolated records and were first discovered in Ha Giang Province. The bat fauna of Tay Con Linh includes both widespread, ecologically flexible species (e.g., Cynopterus sphinx, Rhinolophus affinis), as well as species of the Indo-Himalayan fauna that penetrate into the territory of Vietnam along mountain ranges (e.g., Mirostrellus joffrei), species which distribution patterns are not clear due to extremely fragmented ranges (e.g., Rhinolophus siamensis, Hipposideros khaokhouayensis, Arielulus cf. circumdatus), and at least one Palearctic species (Myotis altarium). At the same time, due to the absence of karstic caves on the massif, there are no species obligately associated with karst, and petrophilic species are generally few in number. Most of widespread species are confined to low and medium elevations. On the contrary, a number of species (Harpiola isodon, Murina chrysochaetes, M. huttoni, Myotis altarium, Arielulus cf. circumdatus, Mirostrellus joffrei) were found only at altitudes of 1700 m asl and higher. It is noteworthy that these species are also known from the more western provinces of northern Vietnam, which suggests that the Red River (Hong Ha) valley does not play any significant role as an isolating barrier for bats.

AB  - Lipids and their degradation products were investigated in samples of suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected in summer 2015 from surface waters of a South-North transect (ca. 65-81?N) of the Chukchi Sea. This material appeared to be composed mainly of diatoms (dominated by Thalassiosirales) and copepod faecal pellet debris. The high solar irradiances measured in the surface waters (up to 500 W m(-2)) favour chlorophyll (sensitizer) photobleaching at the expense of Type II photosensitized oxidation of unsaturated lipid components of phyto-and zooplankton (photodynamic effect). The weak photoreactivity of wax esters of herbivorous zooplankton in these SPM samples contrasts with previous observations of strong photooxidation of these compounds in sinking particles, which suggests that the photodynamic effect should be favoured in large faecal pellets of herbivorous copepods sinking quickly in weakly irradiated zones. Autoxidation (free radical induced oxidation) processes operating in all oxic environments appeared to be particularly efficient in faecal pellets of omnivorous and carnivorous zooplankton and limited in those of herbivorous origin. These differences were attributed to the consumption of algal antioxidants (such as mycosporine-like amino acids and carotenoids) during the diet of omnivorous and carnivorous copepods, favouring the involvement of free radical oxidation processes.

AB  - Alcohol addiction is a widespread disease, and the exact causes and consequences are still not fully determined. Neurotransmitters and neuronal circuits are not only the target structure of alcohol and responsible for its direct effects but also play a central role in the development of addiction. A gene that has been linked to alcohol use disorder in recent studies is the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene. The present study focuses on the hippocampus, a brain region particularly vulnerable to alcohol and rich in Gdap1 gene expression. Using an established drinking model, alcohol drinking behavior was induced in adult male Long Evans rats. After 6 weeks of voluntary alcohol intake, followed by 2 weeks of deprivation, the animals were divided into two groups based on the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE). Gdap1 gene expression was measured with real-time PCR in the hippocampus. Results reveal significantly decreased mRNA expression in the high ADE group compared to the low ADE group. This decrease was specifically detected within the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) region. Gdap1 expression in this region also negatively correlated with ADE in all animals. Taken together, results indicate that Gdap1 might not only be associated with alcohol consumption but might even play a role in alcohol dependence.

AB  - Genetic mosaicism, characterized by multiple genotypes within an individual, is considered an obstacle to CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in animal models. Despite the various strategies for minimizing mosaic mutations, no definitive methods exist to eliminate them. This study aimed to enhance gene editing efficiency in porcine zygotes using CRISPR/Cas9, which targets specific genes through centrifugation and zona pellucida removal before electroporation. Centrifugation at 2000 x g did not adversely affect blastocyst formation rates in zygotes electroporated with gRNA targeting the GGTA1 gene; instead, it led to increased total and monoallelic mutation rates compared with control zygotes without centrifugation. However, the groups had no significant differences in biallelic mutation rates. In zygotes electroporated with gRNA targeting the CMAH gene, centrifugation treatments exceeding 1000 x g significantly increased both biallelic mutation rates and mutation efficiency. The combination of centrifugation and zona pellucida removal did not have a detrimental effect on blastocyst formation rates. It led to a higher rate of double biallelic mutations in embryos targeting both GGTA1 and CMAH compared to embryos without centrifugation treatment. In summary, our results demonstrate that pre-electroporation treatments, including centrifugation and zona pellucida removal, positively influenced the reduction of mosaic mutations, with the effectiveness of centrifugation depending on the specific gRNA used.

AB  - Studies have shown the therapeutic effects of a ketogenic diet (KD) on epilepsy, but the effect of a KD on drug reinstatement is largely unclear. This study aims to investigate whether KD consumption possesses thera-peutic potential for cocaine reinstatement and the molecular mechanism. We find that a KD significantly re-duces cocaine-induced reinstatement in mice, which is accompanied by a markedly elevated level of 8-hy-droxybutyrate (8-OHB), the most abundant ketone body, in the hippocampus. The underlying mechanism is that 8-OHB posttranslationally modifies CaMKII-a with 8-hydroxybutyrylation, resulting in significant inhibi-tion of T286 autophosphorylation and downregulation of CaMKII activity. Collectively, our results reveal that 8-hydroxybutyrylation is a posttranslational modification of CaMKII-a that plays a critical role in mediating the effect of KD consumption in reducing cocaine reinstatement.

AB  - Maternal exposure to anesthetic agents could impose significant neurocognitive risks on the developing brain of infants. Myelin produced by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is essential for the development of brain. However, the concrete effect of general anesthesia on the development and myelination of OLs is still elusive. In this study, we aim to investigate postnatal myelination and neural behavior after maternal exposure to sevoflurane. Pregnant C57BL/6 J mice (gestational day 15.5) were anesthetized with 2.5% sevoflurane (in 97.5% O2) for 6 h. Cognitive function and motor coordination of the offspring mice were evaluated with novel object recognition, Morris water maze and accelerating rotarod tests. Myelination and development of hippocampal OLs were analyzed with immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, western blotting and electron microscopy. The functionality of myelin was measured with electrophysiology. Our results showed that sevoflurane anesthesia during the gestational period induced cognitive and motor impairments in offspring mice, accompanied with damages of myelin structure and down regulations of myelin-associated genes and proteins (including MBP, Olig1, PDGFRa, Sox10, etc.). The development and maturation of OLs were suppressed, and the axonal conduction velocity was declined. These results demonstrated that maternal sevoflurane exposure could induce detrimental effects on cognitive and motor functions in offspring, which might be associated with disrupted myelination of OLs in the hippocampus.

AB  - Thyroid hormones are crucial for brain development and their deficiency during fetal and postnatal periods can lead to mood and cognitive disorders. We aimed to examine the consequences of thyroid hormone deficiency on anxiety-related behaviors and protein expression of hippocampal glutamate transporters in congenital hypothyroid male offspring rats. Possible beneficial effects of treadmill exercise have also been examined. Congenital hypothyroidism was induced by adding propylthiouracil (PTU) to drinking water of pregnant Wistar rats from gestational day 6 until the end of the weaning period (postnatal day 28). Next, following 4 weeks of treadmill exercise (5 days per week), anxiety-related behaviors were examined using elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/ dark box tests. Thereafter, protein expression of astrocytic (GLAST and GLT-1) and neuronal (EAAC1) glutamate transporters were measured in the hippocampus by immunoblotting. Hypothyroid rats showed decreased anxiety-like behavior, as measured by longer time spent in the open arms of the EPM and in the light area of the light/dark box, compared to control rats. Hypothyroid rats had significantly higher GLAST and GLT-1 and lower EAAC1 protein levels in the hippocampus than did the euthyroid rats. Following exercise, anxiety levels decreased in the euthyroid group while protein expression of EAAC1 increased and returned to normal levels in the hypothyroid group. Our findings indicate that thyroid hormone deficiency was associated with alterations in protein expression of glutamate transporters in the hippocampus. Up-regulation of hippocampal GLAST and GLT1 could be at least one of the mechanisms associated with the anxiolytic effects of congenital hypothyroidism.

AB  - Fasciolosis, or liver fluke disease, is a parasitic ailment in sheep that has been responsible for significant mortality in flocks, likely since the Neolithic period. However, the earliest unequivocal description of this condition is medieval, with fasciolosis identified in three French-language agricultural treatises from the 13th and 14th centuries: the anonymous Seneschaucie (England, c. 1270); the Hosebonderie by Walter of Henley (England, c. 1280); and Le bon bergier by Jean de Brie (Ile-de-France, 1379). While the "disease of the dauves" described by Jean de Brie has been previously discussed, fasciolosis does not seem to have been recognized in the two Anglo-Norman works, perhaps because it is not explicitly named. Nevertheless, their etiological and clinical descriptions of the disease, remarkably clear, leave no doubt about the pathology involved. These three texts collectively provide remarkable evidence of the observational and interpretative skills of medieval authors regarding a complex pathological phenomenon, involving not only their domestic livestock but also a parasitic worm whose life cycle would only be elucidated in the late 19th century. The conditions for the onset of the disease are correctly identified, and the diagnostic criteria proposed, both clinical and necropsy-based, are still employed to some extent today. The Seneschaucie goes so far as to propose a comprehensive management plan for the disease, with a collective approach involving semi-random diagnostic slaughters every three years, allowing the detection of the pathogen in the population even before the onset of initial symptoms. In this article, we explore, through a new French translation of the Anglo-Norman passages, the scientific approach adopted by these medieval authors and compare their recommendations with current knowledge on liver fluke disease. Additionally, we present results from other analytical approaches focusing on fasciolosis from the 13th to 14th centuries: the analysis of manorial accounts and of archaeological data. Thus, this manuscript aims, through the example of the liver fluke, to highlight how rigorous empirical observation of an animal disease, considering anatomical, pathological, and zoological criteria, helped mitigate its deleterious effects on medieval livestock economy.

AB  - Social information gathering is a complex process influenced by neuroendocrine-modulated neural plasticity. Oxytocin (OXT) is a key regulator of social decision-making processes such as information gathering, as it contextually modulates social salience and can induce long-term structural plasticity, including neurogenesis. Understanding the link between OXT-induced plasticity and communicative awareness is crucial, particularly because OXT is being considered for treatment of social pathologies. We investigated the role of chronic OXT-dependent plasticity in attention to novel social information by manipulating the duration of time following cessation of intranasal treatment to allow for the functional integration of adult-born neurons resulting from OXT treatment. Following a 3-week delay, chronic intranasal OXT (IN-OXT) increased approach behavior of both female and male mice towards aggressive vocal playbacks of two unseen novel conspecifics, while no effect was observed after a 3-day delay. Immature neurons increased in the ventral hippocampus of females and males treated with chronic IN-OXT after the 3-week delay, indicating a potential association between ventral hippo-campal neurogenesis and approach/acoustic eavesdropping. The less the mouse approached, the higher the level of neurogenesis. Contrary to expectations, the correlation between ventral hippocampal neurogenesis and approach behavior was not affected by IN-OXT, suggesting that other plasticity mechanisms underlie the long-term effects of chronic OXT on social approach. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between ventral hippocampal neurogenesis and freezing behavior. Overall, our results demonstrate that chronic IN-OXT-induced long-term plasticity can influence approach to vocal information and we further reinforced the link between neurogenesis and anxiety.

AB  - The detailed study of the morphology and morphometrics of the auditory ossicles in swine became a topic for investigation due to their resemblance to the human ear. The methods used in this study cover the typical macroscopical investigation of gross morphology: a detailed metrical and histological assessment through H&E standard protocol on auditory ossicles originating from eight pig fetuses originating from four distinctive sows. The ossicular assembly in the malleus, incus and stapes present in 66-day fetuses shows all the features generally described in swine. The malleus comprises two uneven laminae of mineralized hyaline cartilage and a medullary cavity. The areas of the head and neck show a high degree of vascularization. The incus has two similar cortical fascicles separated by a compartmentalized medullary cavity, with the highest degree of mineralization found at the distal part of the long process. Stapes show an early degree of mineralization at the level of the crura, lacking medullary cavities. The ossicular chain shows typical morphological elements, similar to adults, and from a dimensional perspective, our investigations point to an uneven degree of development of the ossicles, according to gestational age: the malleus and stapes reach almost 80% and the incus about 50-60% of their adult sizes.

AB  - Oral and craniofacial bone regeneration remains challenging due to unique anatomical and functional demands. Rodent models have limited translational value because of significant structural differences from humans. The study reveals high similarity in calvarial periosteal cell composition between miniature pigs and humans at single-cell resolution. ALPL+PDGFD+ (AP+) cells are identified as distinct calvarial periosteal stem cells (PeSCs) that possess self-renewal and differentiation potential in both swine and human calvarial periosteum. Postnatally, AP+ PeSCs exhibit reduced activity compared to their embryonic counterparts, with EGR1 recognized as a crucial factor for their activation. Upon activation, these cells effectively facilitate the repair of craniofacial bone injuries. EGR1 regulates PeSCs development by modulating BMP signaling through its Znf2 domain and activating these cells via the CTNNB1/WNT10B pathway through its Znf2/3 domains in response to injury. The validation of the findings using human cranial periosteal samples from various developmental stages (embryonic and adult) further supports the results obtained from large animal experiments, providing a solid scientific foundation for the clinical application of AP+ cranial periosteal stem cells. Additionally, targeting specific EGR1 domains for in situ activation of PeSCs offers a promising strategy for enhancing bone regeneration.

AB  - As a non-nutritive sweetener, aspartame is widely used in everyday life. However, its safety is highly controversial, especially its effects on neurobehavior. We evaluated the effects of chronic daily oral administration of aspartame-containing drinking water (at doses equivalent to 7-28% of the FDA-recommended human DIV) on memory and rhythm behaviors in mice and further investigated changes at the molecular level in the brains. Our results demonstrated that mice exposed to aspartame exhibited memory impairment. Disorders of hippocampal neurotransmitter metabolism and pathological damage may be responsible for the aspartame-induced memory impairment via inhibition of the BDNF/TrkB pathway. Furthermore, our findings suggested that disturbed clock gene expression in the hypothalamus after aspartame exposure led to altered rest-activity behavior, and this disruption of the circadian rhythm may exacerbate memory impairment. This study highlights the negative neurobehavioral effects of aspartame and provides valuable insights into its rational and safe use.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to estimate body weight from various biometric measurements and features such as genotype (share of Suffolk and Polish Merino genotypes), birth weight (BiW), sex, birth type and body weight at 12 months of age (LBW) and some body measurements such as withers height (WH), sacrum height (SH), chest depth (CD), chest width (CW), chest circumference (CC), shoulder width (SW) and rump width (RW). Three hundred and forty-four animals were used in the study. Data mining and machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression and classification and regression tree were used to estimate the body weight from various features. Results show that the random forest procedure may help breeders improve characteristics of great importance. In this way, the breeders can get an elite population and determine which features are essential for estimating the body weight of the herd in Poland. The study's main goal was to compare several data mining and machine learning algorithms to estimate body weight based on body measurements at a different share of Polish Merino in the genotype of crossbreds (share of Suffolk and Polish Merino genotypes). The study estimated the capabilities of CART, support vector regression and random forest regression algorithms. To compare the estimation performances of the evaluated algorithms and determine the best model for estimating body weight, various body measurements and sex and birth type characteristics were assessed. Data from 344 sheep were used to estimate the body weights. The root means square error, standard deviation ratio, Pearson's correlation coefficient, mean absolute percentage error, coefficient of determination and Akaike's information criterion were used to assess the algorithms. A random forest regression algorithm may help breeders obtain a unique Polish Merino Suffolk cross population that would increase meat production.

AB  - Background Targeted knock-in assisted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system is an advanced technology with promising applications in various research fields including medical and agricultural sciences. However, improvements in the efficiency, precision, and specificity of targeted knock-in are prerequisites to facilitate the practical application of this technology. To improve the efficiency of targeted knock-in, it is necessary to have a molecular system that allows sensitive monitoring of targeted knock-in events with simple procedures. Methods and results We developed an assay, named CD55 correction assay, with which to monitor CD55 gene correction accomplished by targeted knock-in. To create the reporter clones used in this assay, we initially introduced a 7.7-kb heterozygous deletion covering CD55 exons 2-5, and then incorporated a truncating mutation within exon 4 of the remaining CD55 allele in human cell lines. The resultant reporter clones that lost the CD55 protein on the cell membrane were next transfected with Cas9 constructs along with a donor plasmid carrying wild-type CD55 exon 4. The cells were subsequently stained with fluorescence-labeled CD55 antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry to detect CD55-positive cells. These procedures allow high-throughput, quantitative detection of targeted gene correction events occurring in an endogenous human gene. Conclusions The current study demonstrated the utility of the CD55 correction assay to sensitively quantify the efficiency of targeted knock-in. When used with the PIGA correction assay, the CD55 correction assay will help accurately determine the efficiency of targeted knock-in, precluding possible experimental biases caused by cell line-specific and locus-specific factors.

AB  - Depression is a serious mental illness. Previous studies found that early life stress (ELS) plays a vital role in the onset and progression of depression. However, relevant studies have not yet been able to explain the specific effects of early stress on stress-induced depression sensitivity and individual behavior during growth. Therefore, we constructed a maternal separation (MS) model and administered chronic social frustration stress at different stages of their growth while conducting metabolomics analysis on the hippocampus of mice. Our results showed that the immobility time of mice in the forced swimming test was significantly reduced at the end of MS. Meanwhile, mice with MS experience significantly decreased total movement distance in the open field test and sucrose preference ratio in the sucrose preference test when subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) during adolescence. In adulthood, the results were the opposite. In addition, we found that level changes in metabolites such as Beta-alanine, l-aspartic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid, and Glycine are closely related to behavioral changes. These metabolites are mainly enriched in Pantothenate, CoA biosynthesis, and Beta Alanine metabolism pathways. Our experiment revealed that the effects of ELS vary across different age groups. It will increase an individual's sensitivity to depression when facing CSDS in adolescence, but it will reduce their sensitivity to depression when facing CSDS in adulthood. This may be achieved by regulating the hippocampus's Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis and Beta Alanine metabolism pathways represented by Beta-alanine, lAspartic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid, and Glycine metabolites.

AB  - Objective Chronic stress is considered a severe risk factor leading to various disorders, including anxiety and cognitive decline. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Origanum vulgare (oregano) extract on improving anxiety-like behavior and learning and memory defection caused by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Method A 10-day CUS protocol was executed on male rats, and on day 10, their anxiety, learning, and memory status were evaluated. After that, in addition to the CUS, the rats were treated with the oregano extract for 2 weeks. Then, the expression of BDNF, TrkB, and TLR2/4 genes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the rats was evaluated. Also, the liver- and kidney-related serum parameters, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, creatinine, urea, serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were assessed. Further, the extract's lethal effect and its impact on animals' body weight were investigated. Results Behavioral tests confirmed the anxiety-like behavior and learning-memory function impairment caused by CUS. In contrast, the administration of the extract could significantly alleviate the mental deficiencies and diminished anxiety-like behaviors. Molecular assessments showed that CUS could markedly decrease the BDNF and TrkB genes' expression levels while increasing that of TLR2 and TLR4. In contrast, in extract-treated animals, mRNA levels of BDNF and TrkB considerably increased, yet TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA levels reduced. Additionally, consumption of the extract caused weight gain, while having no lethality and detrimental effect on the liver and kidneys functions. Conclusions These findings indicate the anxiolytic properties of the extract and its improving effect on cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - It is well known that mechanical stimulation promotes indirect fracture healing by triggering callus formation. We investigated the short-term response of healing tissue to mechanical stimulation to compare the changes in tissue stiffness during stimulation and resting phases in a preclinical case-series. Four sheep underwent a tibial osteotomy and were instrumented with a custom-made active fixator which applied a mechanical stimulation protocol of 1000 cycles/day, equally distributed over 12 h, followed by 12 h of rest. During each cycle, a surrogate metric for tissue stiffness was measured, enabling a continuous real-time monitoring of the healing progression. A daily stiffness increase during stimulation and an increase during resting were evaluated for each animal. One animal had to be excluded from the evaluation due to technical reasons. For all included animals, the stiffness began to increase within the second week post-op. A characteristic pattern was observed during daily measurements: the stiffness dropped considerably within the first stimulation cycles followed by a steady rise throughout the rest of the stimulation phase. However, for all included animals, the average daily stiffness increase within the first three weeks post operation was larger during resting than during stimulation (Sheep I: 16.9% vs. -5.7%; Sheep II: 14.7% vs. -1.8%; Sheep III: 8.9% vs. 1.6%). A continuous measurement of tissue stiffness together with a controlled fracture stimulation enabled the investigation of the short-term effects of specific stimulatory parameters, such as resting periods. Resting was identified as a potentially determining factor for bone healing progression. Optimizing the ratio between stimulation and resting may contribute to more robust fracture healing in the future.

AB  - The aim of this study was to optimize the laparoscopic intrauterine insemination (LAI) methodology by testing different time intervals between the natural heat detection and ewe insemination. Three exper-iments were performed in the breeding conditions of Southern Kazakhstan. Ewes (n = 243) were exposed for one hour to direct contact with the teaser rams (once a day, morning or evening). Ewes expressing behavioral symptoms of heat were detected and inseminated with the use of LAI during 210- 1290 min (3.5-21.5 hrs) after heat detection. Reproductive traits of lambing rate (LR) and litter size (LS) were recorded according to the births registered at 137 to 152 days post insemination. Our statistical model showed significance only for the effects of ewe age category and the time interval from heat detec-tion to LAI on the LR attribute. The highest LR (38.8%) was detected in ewes at 2.5-3.5 years of age. Corrected least-square means of LR indicated 18.5 hrs. as an optimal time for LAI of ewes in natural heat. In the present study, the percentage value of lambing rate obtained at 18.5 h interval was 70.7%. Therefore, our study suggested an effective methodology to spread valuable genetic information in the sheep population in the regions of extensive farming where heat cycle synchronization is not usually per-formed. Importantly, our study is among the first ones that follow the European strategy to eliminate the occurrence of hormones in livestock production and the environment. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Green algae are well known for their plant growth-promoting role, but the biofertilization potential of some industrial algae waste has yet to be tested. Industrial algae production facilities are increasing rapidly yearly, but most growing liquids are unused and remain as waste. Here we examined the effects of various microalgae byproducts as tea plant growth biostimulants. The roles of cell-free supernatant (CFS), sonicated microalgae biomass and living cells of the freshwater alga Chlorella vulgaris in promoting tea plant growth were investigated through real field applications. All three algae by-products of the same culture were applied to the tea plants three times either from aerial parts or from the soil. After 40 days of incubation, it was determined that all microalgae waste, even CFS, significantly improved the vegetative growth of the treated tea plants. CFS were also able to improve chlorophyll accumulation, node length, leaf length, and leaf width by 23%-26%, 62%-69%, 5%-36%, and 23%-54%, respectively. Notably, the sonicated microalgae effluents were able to improve the node growth by 123%. To our knowledge, this is the first study revealing the significant biofertilization potential of C. vulgaris CFS for shoot growth of tea plants. The obtained results highlight the agricultural potentials of both microalgae culture broths and degreased microalgae wastes as sustainable and environmentally-friendly biofertilizers for Camellia sinensis organic farming.

AB  - The present study aims to evaluate culture temperature-dependent variation in survival, growth characteristics and expression of stress, pluripotency, apoptosis, and adhesion markers in enriched caprine male germline stem cells (cmGSCs). For this, testes from pre-pubertal bucks (4-5 months; n = 4) were used to isolated cells by a two-step enzymatic digestion method. After enrichment of cmGSCs by multiple methods (differential platting, Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and MACS), viability of CD90(+) cells was assessed before co-cultured onto the Sertoli cell feeder layer at different temperatures (35.5, 37.0, 38.5, and 40.0 degrees C). The culture characteristics of cells were compared with MTT assay (viability); cluster-forming activity assay, SA-beta 1-gal assay (senescence), BrdU assay (proliferation), and transcript expression analyses by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the co-localization of pluripotency markers (UCHL-1, PLZF, and DBA) was examined by a double-immunofluorescence method. The cells grown at 37.0 degrees C showed faster proliferation with a significantly (p < 0.05) higher number of viable cells and greater number of cell clusters, besides higher expression of pluripotency markers. The transcript expression of HSPs (more noticeably HSP72 than HSP73), anti-oxidative enzymes (GPx and CuZnSOD), and adhesion molecule (beta 1-integrin) was significantly (p < 0.05) downregulated when grown at 35.0, 38.5, or 40.0 degrees C compared with 37.0 degrees C. The expression of pluripotency-specific transcripts was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in cmGSCs grown at the culture temperature lower (35.5 degrees C) or higher (38.5 degrees C and 40.0 degrees C) than 37.0 degrees C. Overall, the culture temperature significantly affects the proliferation, growth characteristics, and expression of heat stress, pluripotency, and adhesion-specific markers in pre-pubertal cmGSCs. These results provide an insight to develop strategies for the improved cultivation and downstream applications of cmGSCs.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus plays an important role for pattern separation, the process of separating similar inputs and forming distinct neural representations. Estradiol modulates neurogenesis and hippocampus function, but to date no examination of estradiol's effects on pattern separation have been conducted. Here, we examined estrogenic regulation of adult neurogenesis and functional connectivity in the hippocampus after the spatial pattern separation task in female rats. Ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats received daily injections of vehicle, 0.32 & mu;g (Low) or 5 & mu;g (High) of estradiol benzoate until the end of experiment. A single bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected one day after initiation of hormone or vehicle treatment and rats were tested in the delayed nonmatching to position spatial pattern separation task in the 8-arm radial maze for 12 days beginning two weeks after BrdU injection. Rats were perfused 90 min after the final trial and brain sections were immunohistochemically stained for BrdU/neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (new neurons), Ki67 (cell proliferation), and the immediate early gene, zif268 (activation). Results showed that high, but not low, estradiol reduced the density of BrdU/NeuN-ir cells and had significant inter-regional correlations of zif268-ir cell density in the hippocampus following pattern separation. Estradiol treatment did not influence pattern separation performance or strategy use. These results show that higher doses of estradiol can reduce neurogenesis but at the same time increases correlations of activity of neurons within the hippocampus during spatial pattern separation.

AB  - The two fungal species Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophytonviolaceum are common pathogens on human, infecting keratinized tissue of the outer body parts. Both species are belonging to the "Trichophyton rubrum complex" and share very high similarity in the genome. Secreted proteinases, key factors for keratin degradation, are nearly identical. Contrary, the ecological niches are differing. Trichophytonrubrum preferably infects skin and nails, whereas T. violaceum preferably infects the scalp. We postulate, that differences in the protease expression contribute to differences in ecological preferences. We analyzed the expression profiles of all 22 endoprotease genes, 12 subtilisins (S8A), 5 deuterolysins (M35) and 5 fungalysins (M36), for both species. To compare the influence of the keratin source, we designed experiments with human nail keratin, sheep wool keratin and keratin free cultivation media. Samples were taken at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 96 h post incubation in keratin medium. The expression of the proteases is higher in wool-keratin medium compared to human nail medium, with the exception of MEP4 and SUB6. Expression in the keratin-free medium is lowest. The expression profiles of the two species are remarkable different. The expression of MEP1, MEP3, SUB5, SUB11 and SUB12 are higher in T. rubrum compared to T. violaceum. MEP2, NpIIc, NpIIe, SUB1, SUB3, SUB4, SUB7 and SUB8 are higher expressed in T. violaceum compared to T. rubrum. The differences of the protease expression in the two species may expalin the differences in the ecological niches. Further analysis are necessary to verify the hypothesis.Please check and conform the edit made in title.Here I thinke the species of strains shouldnt be capital? and the right expression should be, "Expression Profiles of Protease in Onychomycosis-Related Pathogenic Trichophyton rubrum and Tinea Capitis-Related Pathogenic Trichophyton violaceum"Author names: Please confirm if the author names are presented accurately and in the correct se-quence (given name, middle name/initial, family name).

AB  - Simple Summary Multi-suckling systems aim to improve animal welfare, but in these systems, a large variation is seen in piglet growth rate. This study investigated relationships between birthweight and growth rate, and other piglet traits in this system, and studied if specific traits are indicative of the ability of catch-up growth in low birthweight piglets. We found that birthweight was positively related with survival, growth rate, the number of sucklings, milk intake and feed intake, and with skin lesion scores. Irrespective of birthweight, fast-growing piglets tended to eat more feed, were present less often at teats of alien sows, and had more skin lesions. Our study provides little insight into the piglet traits that affect catchup growth in a multi-suckling environment, but it confirms the effects of piglet birthweight on survival and body weight gain, which is related to increased milk and feed intake. Multi-suckling systems aim to improve animal welfare, but in these systems, a large variation is seen in piglet growth rate. Birthweight (BiW) plays an important role in explaining the variation in body weight (BW) gain of piglets. This study aims to investigate the relationships between BiW and piglet traits up to day 44 postpartum (p.p.). A total of 55 sows were used. The growth rate and mortality were assessed for all piglets. Feed and milk intake, behaviours, and skin lesions were assessed in four focal piglets per litter. Focal piglets were divided into four groups based on their BiW class (high BiW (HBiW) vs. low BiW (LBiW)) and growth rate class (fast vs. slow). Results showed that increased mortality was observed in piglets with a BiW below 1.1 kg. Birthweight was positively related with the number of sucklings (beta = 2.8 no./kg of BiW per 7.5 h), corresponding to milk intake (beta = 102 g/kg of BiW per day), and to a lesser extent, to the intake of sow feed (beta = 44 g/kg of BiW per day) in week 6. Birthweight was positively related with the number of skin lesions (beta = 4.3 no./kg of BiW) in week 4. We found no indications that fast-growing LBiW piglets differed from fast-growing HBiW piglets, however, fast-growing piglets of both HBiW and LBiW tended to eat more feed (485 +/- 18 vs. 420 +/- 17 g/day, p = 0.068), were present less often at teats of alien sows (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.3, p = 0.010), and had more skin lesions (9.0 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.4 +/- 0.4, p = 0.047), compared to slow growing piglets. Our study, thus, provides little insight into the traits that affect catchup growth in a multi-suckling environment but increases insight into the differences between fast-growing and slow-growing piglets, regardless of their birthweight class.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter is a gene superfamily in plants. ATP-binding cassette subfamily C (ABCC) protein is a multidrug resistance-associated (MRP) transporter. They play various roles in plant growth, development, and secondary metabolite transport. However, there are few studies on ABCC transporters in tea plants. In this study, genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content in 108 strains of Kingbird revealed that CsABCCs may be involved in EGCG transport. We identi fi ed 25 CsABCC genes at the genomic level of the tea plant, their phylogenetic tree, gene structure, targeted miRNA and other bioinformatics were analyzed. The expression patterns of CsABCCs in eight different tissues and abiotic stress indicate that they have potential roles in regulating the growth, development, and defense of tea plants. The correlation analysis revealed that the expression of the CsABCC11 gene was closely related to the EGCG content in tea buds of 108 strains of the Kingbird, and the subcellular localization experiments in tobacco showed that CsABCC11 protein was localized on the plasma membrane. The virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) strategy in tea plants further veri fi ed that CsABCC11 was involved in EGCG accumulation. Our study laid a foundation for studying the biological function of CsABCC and provided a new candidate molecular marker gene for further EGCG-related variety breeding, which will be of great interest to breeders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Silicon can enhance crop resistance, while nutrient solutions supply crops with essential nutrients for growth. Studies on the combined effects of silicon and nutrient solutions in wheat production are limited. RESULTS: To explore this synergy, four silicon concentrations (SiO2: 0 g L-1 (control), 1 g L-1, 2 g L-1, and 3.5 g L-1) were applied to wheat seedlings grown with nutrient solution. An experiment to investigate the difference between soil culture and hydroculture of wheat treated by integrated silicon and nutrient solution to wheat growth and aphid control, including developmental duration, fecundity, alate aphid proportion, feeding preference of Sitobion avenae, silicon content, height and biomass of wheats. The results comparative experiments of hydroponic and soil cultivation techniques showed silicon increased silicon content of wheat leaves and reduced aphid longevity, reproduction, and increased alatae aphid percentage. Specially, the 2 g L-1 silicon treatment increased plant height and reduced aphid feeding selectivity at various time points. The combination of silicon and nutrient solution significantly enhanced wheat biomass, height and chlorophyll content compared to nutrient solution alone. Additionally, hydroponic cultivation with 2 g L-1 silicon and nutrient solution increased wheat biomass and reduced aphid fecundity compared to soil propagation. Regression analysis showed a significant negative linear correlation between aphid reproduction and leaf silicon content. CONCLUSION: The synergistic effect of hydroponic technology using 2 g L-1 silicon fertilizer and nutrient solution promoted wheat growth, suppressed aphid reproduction, and altered aphid feeding preferences. These findings offer valuable insights for integrated management strategies against Sitobion avenae. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The muga silkworm, Antheraea assamensis Helfer bears great economic importance, producing golden yellow muga silk which is in global demand for both the textile and biomedical industries. The insect's larval stages are maintained in the field by farmers on its primary host plant Persea bombycina Kost in Assam located in the North-East part (25.57 degrees N, 93.25 degrees E) of India. If continuous feeding by A. assamensis is inducing any direct defense in P. bombycina, the aspect is not yet questioned. We used the activity of lipoxygenases (LOX) and trypsin inhibitors as markers for determining defense responses in P. bombycina and Litsea monopetala Roxb, the two primary host plants of the silkworm due to insect feeding. The induction of anti-herbivore trypsin inhibitor by insect feeding was examined by studying their effect on the midgut trypsin activity of A. assamensis larvae. This is the first report showing that the LOX- trypsin inhibitor axis is differentially activated in the two host plants and greater induction of the defense response is exhibited in P. bombycina, the most commercially used host plant in muga silkworm rearing.

KW  - Machine learning
KW  - Precision livestock farming
KW  - Sustainable food production
AB  - Recent years have seen an increase in the use of advanced data collection systems to improve management in pig farms, however, the cost of implementing such systems remains a barrier to many. Some of the most useful data for farm management are on an individual pig level, which requires investment of labour and expense of systems such as RFID tagging. In this paper an alternative solution is proposed, where pen-level pig weight measurements (i.e. measurements not linked to a specific pig identity), which are significantly cheaper to obtain, are used to estimate individual-level growth trajectories using machine learning. We evaluated our method on group-level data that were simulated from individual-level weight data, which thus allowed for the verification of the accuracy of the trajectory predictions using a root mean squared error score. The on-average best performing predictor for this task was based on a Random Forest model which achieved a best-case score of 2.00 Kg per pig and a worst-case score of 2.45 Kg per pig depending upon the simulated conditions that were used, thus showing that these predicted trajectories could be accurate enough for commercial usage. The usefulness of the predicted trajectories was then evaluated through a growth prediction downstream task whereby the future weights of pigs two weeks into the future were predicted using a variety of machine learning models. It was found that, on average, the growth prediction models that utilised the predicted trajectories outperformed a method that utilised group-level weights directly by 1.42 Kg root mean squared error but were still outperformed by the models that utilised RFID growth trajectories by 0.83 Kg on average. These results show the potential of this method as an alternative to both RFID and photo-based systems for individual-level data estimation.

KW  - DEPRESSION
KW  - INFLAMMATION
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder with high morbidity. Stress negatively affects for MDD development, whereby transport of stress-induced inflammatory mediators to the central nervous system (CNS) is associated with the etiology of mood disorders. Muscone is a pharmacologically active ingredient isolated from musk, with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. We hypothesized that muscone may ameliorate depression-like behavior by regulating inflammatory responses. To test this hypothesis, we used the chronic restraint stress (CRS) depression model, and CRS mice were treated with muscone (10 mg/kg, i.g., respectively) for 14 days. The effects of the drug on depressive-like behaviors were evaluated via the open field test (OFT), novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to assess levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, COX2, and IL-1) and the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). We also determined levels of oxidative stress factors (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase), as well as doublecortin (DCX) expression by immunofluorescence. The results showed that depression-like behavior and inflammatory levels were improved after muscone treatment. Muscone also significantly improved neurogenesis in the CRS mouse hippocampus and decreased oxidative stress in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In conclusion, this work is the first to demonstrate that muscone has an antidepressant effect using a CRS model. Oxidative stress, neurogenesis, and inflammatory pathways are key factors affected by the drug and may represent new therapeutic targets to treat MDD, in this impact. These results may represent a new therapeutic target for MDD.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is one of the most highly consumed beverages globally after water. Several countries import large quantities of tea from other countries to meet domestic needs. Therefore, accurate and timely prediction of tea yield is critical. The previous studies used statistical, deep learning, and machine learning techniques for tea yield prediction, but crop simulation models have not yet been used. However, the calibration of a simulation model for tea yield prediction and the comparison of these approaches is needed regarding the different data types. This research study aims to provide a comparative study of the methods for tea yield prediction using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations AquaCrop simulation model and machine learning techniques. We employed weather, soil, crop, and agro-management data from 2016 to 2019 acquired from tea fields of the National Tea and High-Value Crop Research Institute (NTHRI), Pakistan, to calibrate the AquaCrop simulation model and to train regression algorithms. We achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.45 t/ha, a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.23 t/ha, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.48 t/ha in the calibration of the AquaCrop model and, out of the ten regression models, we achieved the lowest MAE of 0.093 t/ha, MSE of 0.015 t/ha, and RMSE of 0.120 t/ha using 10-fold cross-validation and MAE of 0.123 t/ha, MSE of 0.024 t/ha, and RMSE of 0.154 t/ha using the XGBoost regressor with train test split. We concluded that the machine learning regression algorithm performed better in yield prediction using fewer data than the simulation model. This study provides a technique to improve tea yield prediction by combining different data sources using a crop simulation model and machine learning algorithms.

AB  - The mechanisms by which astrocytes modulate neural homeostasis, synaptic plasticity, and memory are still poorly explored. Astrocytes form large intercellular networks by gap junction coupling, mainly composed of two gap junction channel proteins, connexin 30 (Cx30) and connexin 43 (Cx43). To circumvent developmental perturbations and to test whether astrocytic gap junction coupling is required for hippocampal neural circuit function and behavior. we generate and study inducible, astrocyte-specific Cx30 and Cx43 double knockouts. Surprisingly, disrupting astrocytic coupling in adult mice results in broad activation of astrocytes and microglia, without obvious signs of pathology. We show that hippocampal CA1 neuron excitability, excitatory synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation are significantly affected. Moreover, behavioral inspection reveals deficits in sensorimotor performance and a complete lack of spatial learning and memory. Together, our findings establish that astrocytic connexins and an intact astroglial network in the adult brain are vital for neural homeostasis, plasticity, and spatial cognition.

AB  - Objective: Individuals with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) primarily exhibit deficits in communication and social interaction, along with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. This disorder is often associated with anxiety, nociceptive disorders, and pain. While medical treatment generally focuses on treating the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying causes, traditional medicine is sometimes used as an alternative. Piptadeniastrum africanum is used in Cameroonian medicinal folks to treat cognitive disorders. However, its effects and mechanisms of action regarding the inhibition of ASD-like symptoms remain unclear. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate the anxiolytic and analgesic effects of the water extract of P. africanum on autistic triad induced in rats by sodium valproate. Material and Methods: The study investigated the secondary metabolites in P. africanum extract using UHPLC-MS. DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP tests were performed to assess the extract's ability to neutralize free radicals. Molecular docking was utilized to evaluate the extract's binding to various receptors. For the experimental study, 33 pregnant female rats were divided into two groups after pregnancy was confirmed. One group was given distilled water orally at 10 mL/kg, while the other group received sodium valproate at 800 mg/kg on gestation days 11, 12, and 13. When the male offspring reached 3 weeks old, they were evaluated for anxiety, social interaction, and pain sensitivity, with those displaying any disorders selected for further study. The remaining rats were split into six groups of five and treated with either a vehicle, bumetanide, or P. africanum extract at 190 and 760 mg/kg. Behavioral assessments focusing on sociability, anxiety, and pain sensitivity were conducted on days 28 and 37 after weaning. In the end, biochemical markers related to GABA metabolism, serotonin levels, and oxidative status were analyzed in the cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala alongside histopathological analyses in the brain. Results: UHPLC-MS allows us to identify several compounds. They bind to H3R (7F61) and HDAC2 through conventional hydrogen bonding. Findings showed that prenatal administration of sodium valproate induced in male offspring a deficit in social interaction (p < 0.001), anxiety disorders (p < 0.001), hypersensitivity to pain (p < 0.001), increased GABA and serotonin concentration (p < 0.001), disturbed oxidative status (p < 0.001), and neuronal loss (p < 0.001) as well as neuronal disorganization in the hippocampus, cerebellum and amygdala in young rats compared to neurotypical animals. P. africanum extract at doses used, like bumetanide, corrected these disorders and protected against neuronal loss. These results suggest that the extract has anxiolytic and anti-nociceptive effects. It has been found that the positive effects can be achieved by restoring GABAergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, coupled with antioxidant and neuromodulatory activity. Conclusion: The current findings support that P. africanum induces anxiolytic and analgesic effects in a sodium valproate-induced autistic disorders model.

AB  - Background: Lipid metabolism dysregulations have been associated with depressive and anxious behaviors which can affect pregnant and lactating individuals, with indications that such changes extend to the offspring. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a maternal high-fat diet on the neurobehavioral, biochemical and inflammatory parameters of their adult female offspring.Methods: Wistar rats +/- 90 days old were mated. The dams were allocated to consume a control (CTL) or high-fat (HFD) diet during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, the female offspring from the CTL (N = 10) and HFD (N = 10) groups received standard chow. The offspring behavioral tests were started at 120 days old. Then, the somatic measures were evaluated followed by euthanasia, histological and biochemical analyses.Results: The HFD group had less ambulation and longer immobility time in the open field test compared to the CTL. The HFD group had lower HDL (48.4%) and a higher adiposity (71.8%) and LDL (62.2%) than the CTL. The CTL had a higher organic acid concentration in the intestine, mainly acetic and butyric acids, however the HFD had a higher citric and acetic acid concentration in the brain and ischemic lesion in the hippocampus with a higher NF-?B concentration.Conclusion: The results demonstrate deleterious effects of a maternal HFD on the neurobehavioral and biochemical parameters of their offspring which may be associated with the role of organic acids and NF-?B in fetal programming.

AB  - Simple Summary Farm animal health and welfare have been paid increasing concern in the world, which is generally assessed by the measurements of physical health, immune response, behavior, and physiological indicators, such as stress-related hormone, cortisone, and norepinephrine. Gut microbiota as a "forgotten organ" has been reported for its great influence on the host phenotypes through the immune, neural, and endocrine pathways to affect the host health and behavior. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation as a novel approach is applied to regulating the composition and function of the recipient farm animals. In this review, we summarized recent studies that gut microbiota influenced health, immunity, behavior, and stress response, as well as the progress of fecal microbiota transplantation in farm animals. The review will provide new insights into the measurement of farm animal health and welfare concerning gut microbiota, and the implication of fecal microbiota transplantation to improve productivity, health, and welfare. Above all, this review suggests that gut microbiota is a promising field to evaluate and improve animal welfare. In the past few decades, farm animal health and welfare have been paid increasing concern worldwide. Farm animal health and welfare are generally assessed by the measurements of physical health, immune response, behavior, and physiological indicators. The gut microbiota has been reported to have a great influence on host phenotypes, possibly via the immune processes, neural functions, and endocrine pathways, thereby influencing host phenotypes. However, there are few reviews regarding farm animals' health and welfare status concerning the gut microbiota. In this point of view, (1) we reviewed recent studies showing that gut microbiota (higher alpha diversity, beneficial composition, and positive functions) effectively influenced health characteristics, immunity, behaviors, and stress response in farm animals (such as pigs, chickens, and cows), which would provide a novel approach to measure and evaluate the health status and welfare of farm animals. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as one of the methods can modulate the recipient individual's gut microbiota to realize the expected phenotype. Further, (2) we highlighted the application of FMT on the improvement of the production performance, the reduction in disease and abnormal behavior, as well as the attenuation of stress in farm animals. It is concluded that the gut microbiota can be scientifically used to assess and improve the welfare of farm animals. Moreover, FMT may be a helpful strategy to reduce abnormal behavior and improve stress adaption, as well as the treatment of disease for farm animals. This review suggests that gut microbiota is a promising field to evaluate and improve animal welfare.

AB  - Building level terraces is a crucial strategy for agriculture development in mountainous areas. There have been many studies on improving the soil quality of terraces, but the main factors involved are still unclear. We conducted an 18-year long-term experiment on a newly built terrace with four fertilization treatments: applied mineral nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (NP), applied sheep manure (M), applied sheep manure combined with mineral nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (MNP), and an unfertilized control (CK). A soil quality index (SQI) was used to evaluate the dynamic evolution of soil quality in the terrace for these fertilization treatments, and the relationship between soil quality and crop yield was investigated. A total data set (TDS) and a minimum data set (MDS) were used to calculate the SQIs according to the linear scoring method and the nonlinear scoring method of soil indicators, respectively. The results showed that the SQI for all treatments increased over time, and both the SQI and crop yield were significantly increased by fertilization treatments. The SQI of all three fertilized treatments in the sixth rotation cycle increased by 38-313% compared to the control in the first rotation cycle (3 years). There was no significant difference in the SQI between the M and MNP, but it was significantly higher than for both the NP and CK. During the 18 year experimental period, the SQI for the M and MNP treatments showed an upward trend, while it tended to be stable after initially increasing for the NP and CK treatments. For each treatment, the SQI calculated by the linear and nonlinear scoring methods using the MDS and TDS were all significantly positively correlated, and were also significantly positively correlated with crop yield. Overall, the soil quality in the terrace was increased by fertilization; however, the application of manure was the key to a rapid increase in soil quality, and the SQI measurements demonstrated a clear link between the soil quality of the terrace and crop yield.

AB  - "Bryndza" cheese is an important Slovak traditional regional product. New knowledge on the role of microorganisms involved the "Bryndza" ripening process may provide valuable data on its quality and safety. In our study, the "Bryndza" made from pasteurized ewes milk was studied towards total count of bacteria, coliforms bacteria, enterococci, lactic acid bacteria, and microscopic filamentous fungi. All those groups of microbiota were detected using classical microbiological methods and identified using mass spectrometry. A total of 3,758 isolates were identified with score higher than 2.00. Altogether, 13 families, 24 genus, and 44 species of microbiota were identified in Slovak cheese "Bryndza." The most often isolated species were yeasts Yarrowia lipolitica and Dipodascus geotrichum and the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei.

AB  - Objective: We analyzed the impact of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) on functional connectivity (FC) between mesiotemporal structures. Functional connectivity modifications related to word retrieval were investigated. Methods: High-density EEG of 21 patients with TLE with HS (12 left TLE and 9 right TLE) and 10 healthy controls (HCs) were recorded during a verbal subsequent memory paradigm. Electroencephalography data were reconstructed into the source space and FC was calculated from the source activity of regions of interest. Results: A significant decrease in FC between the right-and left-sided mesiotemporal structures in TLE was observed. The decrease was significant only with words that were correctly recognized. The decrease in interhemispheric FC between mesiotemporal structures was found in the 8-to 20-Hz frequency range in both left and right TLE. Significance: The decreased FC between the mesiotemporal structures in TLE is a condition for successful performance of a memory retrieval task. The successful memory retrieval in TLE is related to functional segregation of lesional from nonlesional mesiotemporal structures. This decrease was absent in non successful responses.

AB  - Few studies have described the effects of larval diet quality on adult insect flight performance. Flight muscle development and high-powered flight in insects are associated with costly energetic demands. Because larval diet is the energy source that powers these mechanisms, we asked whether larval diet has an impact on flight performance and metabolism in the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus Linnaeus).Monarch caterpillars from the eastern North American and Puerto Rican populations were fed a diet of either Asclepias incarnata L. (native to the eastern North American population) or Asclepias curassavica L. (native to the Puerto Rican population and uncommon in eastern North America). We flew the monarchs on a tethered flight mill to acquire flight performance metrics including velocity, distance, duration, power, and oxygen consumption rate.Monarchs reared on the A. incarnata L. milkweed showed slower, shorter, and less powerful flights than those fed on A. curassavica L. However, eastern North American and Puerto Rican monarchs, which were reared under summer conditions, did not differ in flight metrics or post-flight metabolic rates.The results suggest that flight in eastern North American and Puerto Rican monarchs is similar during the breeding season, yet the milkweed the caterpillars consume has important implications for flight performance.

AB  - Good natural ventilation can improve the comfort of campus dormitories and effectively avoid pollution caused by particle accumulation. Parametric design can effectively address the feedback and connection between building performance analysis and design. This study employs an architect-friendly digital design method based on the Rhino/Grasshopper parametric platform. It takes campus dormitories in the cold region as a case, using parameterized digital tools, such as the Butterfly plugin to simulate wind performance under three influencing factors: building layout, opening position, and building facade (shape and spoiler). Finally, the optimal design that can simultaneously meet the local winter and summer wind environment requirements is selected and validated. In addition, the reasonable design of external balconies and bathrooms in a dormitory can form buffer spaces to achieve effective wind shelter and insulation effects in cold regions. This article describes how to use digital tools to quickly and easily optimize the design of building forms based on wind simulations to promote campus sustainability.

AB  - Activin/inhibin is an important factor for the fecundity of Hu sheep, and it is involved in follicular development in ovaries. Inhibin subunit beta A (INHBA) participates in the synthesis of activin A and inhibin A. In this study, we also noted a positive correlation between INHBA level and the secretion of both activin A and inhibin A in culture medium. Nevertheless, both knockdown and overexpression of INHBA downregulated the expression of Inhibin Subunit Alpha (INHA). Based on RNA-Sequencing, we further examined the effect and molecular mechanism of INHBA knockdown in GCs on mRNA expression. A total of 1,687 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (Fold change >= 2; False-discovory-rates (FDR) < 0.01), of which 602 genes were upregulated and 1,087 genes were downregulated in the INHBA interference group compared with the control groups. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment indicated that these DEGs were mainly involved in the regulation of cell cycle, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Moreover, DEGs were significantly enriched in 40 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including P53, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. We also noted a positive correlation between INHBA level and many PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway-related genes at the gene or/and protein expression. Overall, this study may contribute to a better understanding of the roles of INHBA on GCs of prolific sheep, as well as the molecular effect of low INHBA expression on GCs, clarifying some reproductive failures.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Under natural conditions, piglets have the opportunity to interact with non-littermates before weaning. Nevertheless, in intensive production systems, piglets only have contact with penmates during lactation. Social interactions can be encouraged by removing the barrier between litters whilst the sows are kept in their own crates. However, when piglets are co-mingled at the first days of lactation, studies have shown that a high percentage of them suck with their own mother during all the suckling period, regardless of nipples availability. This study aimed to investigate the effect of switching sows' positions between early co-mingled litters on suckling episodes, durations and maternal suckling. Eight sows' pairs were housed in adjacent pens before farrowing. Piglets were socialized by removing the separating barriers between two adjacent pens on day 2 post-farrowing. The position of four sows' pairs was switched at day 14 post-farrowing (Switched group), while the remaining four sows' pairs remained in their original crates (Control group). The suckling behaviour of piglets was video recorded during the whole experiment (day 2-23). After sows were switched, a decrease suckling duration was observed in Switched group (P = 0.015), a situation that was also observed when analysing one day before and after the change in position. (P = 0.018). The number of suckling episodes decreased in both groups (P < 0.001) after sows were switched. However, when analysing one day before and after switching the number of suckling episodes increased (P 0.001). Maternal suckling decrease in both groups after sows were switched (P = 0.013). However, no differences were observed one day before and after the switching of sows. No effect of switching sows' position was observed on productive parameters of piglets (P 0.05). The suckling behaviour in early comingled piglets slightly change after the sows' position was switched at an intermediate stage of lactation. A decrease in the suckling duration and an increase in the number of episodes one day after sows were switched probably reflect a momentary confusion of the animals. However, although there may have been operant conditioning at the site of consumption, this was not enough to significantly reduce maternal suckling in contrast with previous literature that separated barriers at the middle of the suckling period, reinforcing the operant conditioning through a greater period of conditioning experience.

AB  - Seed odor plays a crucial role in affecting the scatter-hoarding behavior of small rodents that rely on spatial memory and olfaction to cache and recover. However, evidence of how seed odor modifies olfaction function and spatial memory is still lacking. Here, we coated seeds with waterproof glue to test how seed odor intensity alters the proteome of both the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus of a dominant scatter-hoarding rodent, Leopoldamys edwardsi, in Southwest China. We showed that animals repeatedly caching and recovering weak odor seeds exhibited greater olfactory ability and spatial memory, as indicated by alterations in the protein profiles of the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus. The upregulation of proteins closely related to neural connections between the olfactory bulb and hippocampus is highly responsible for improved olfactory function and spatial memory. Our study provides new insights into how scatter-hoarding rodents manage and respond to cached seeds differing in odor intensity from a neurobiological perspective, which is of significant importance for better understanding the parallel evolution of the olfactory and hippocampal systems.

AB  - Simple Summary Summer heat stress (HS) seriously affects the reproductive and lactation performance of sows and the long-term development of their offspring. Mannose oligosaccharide (MOS) is widely used as an ingredient in animal feed as it can limit the colonization of enteric pathogens. However, most animal experiments that use MOS to alleviate the effects of HS are often performed with broilers. The effect of MOS in sows affected by HS is unclear. Based on our results, dietary supplementation with MOS tended to alleviate HS in sows compared with the control. However, no significant interactive effects were found. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dietary supplementation with mannose oligosaccharide (MOS) on the condition of the body and the reproductive and lactation performances of sows. Eighty pregnant sows were randomly assigned to four groups with a 2 x 2 factorial design: with or without MOS (1 g/kg) and with or without heat stress (HS) challenge. The temperature in the HS groups (HS and HM group) was controlled at 31.56 +/- 1.22 degrees C, while the temperature in the active cooling (AC) groups (AC and AM group) was controlled at 23.49 +/- 0.72 degrees C. The weight loss of sows in the AC group was significantly lower than that of sows in the HS group (p < 0.01). The weight and backfat thickness loss of sows supplemented with MOS displayed a downward trend. The average birth weight of the litter significantly increased in the HM group (basic diet + MOS) compared with the HS group (p < 0.05). The milk protein of sows significantly decreased under the HS condition at 2 and 12 h after delivery (p < 0.05). However, the milk immunoglobin G (IgG) of sows in the HS group increased significantly compared with that of sows in the HM group (p < 0.05) at 12 and 24 h after delivery. The levels of serum urea nitrogen (UREA) and glucose (GLU) decreased significantly under the HS condition (p < 0.05), while the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased significantly under the HS condition (p < 0.05). Dietary supplementation with MOS also significantly reduced TNF-alpha under the AC conditions (p < 0.05). In conclusion, HS significantly affected the body condition, lactation performances and their offspring of sows. However, dietary supplementation with 1 g/kg MOS did not result in statistically significant changes.

AB  - An indigenous subterranean termite, Reticulitermes tibialis Banks, fed on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stakes in prescribed burn and non-burned field plots on an established sagebrushsteppe rangeland restoration study site on Red Mountain, southeastern Idaho, expanding the known distribution of the 'arid-land subterranean termite' species. Aspen and pine stakes in the plots as part of a 5-year wood-decay study were unexpectedly damaged by termites. Groups of 25, 15-cm-long stakes were placed horizontally on the soil surface, and groups of 25, 20-cm-long stakes were vertically inserted to a depth of 20 cm into the soil. Aspen stakes were more damaged by feeding termites than were pine stakes. Stakes inserted into soil sustained greater termite feeding and decay damage compared with stakes on the soil surface. During the first 4 years of the study, wood mass loss caused by termite feeding on stakes exceeded loss from decay. Losses from termite feeding and microbial decay were similar by the 5th year. Differences in termite feeding damage on aspen stakes were compared with pine stakes in prescribed burn and non-burned plots. Stakes in prescribed burn plots had more mass loss than those in non-burned plots.

AB  - Chuifeng Cave is one of the typical representatives of the Gigantopithecus-bearing mammalian assemblages in southern China. The Chuifeng mammalian assemblage, including 92 Gigantopithecus blacki teeth fossils, is important to construct the biochronological and paleobiogeographic framework for the Pleistocene mammalian assemblage in mainland Southeast Asia. Except for the G. blacki teeth fossils, the left 721 identified mammalian fossils have never been described in detail until now. Here, we present taxonomic descriptions of the rest mammalian fossils from Chuifeng Cave. The Chuifeng mammalian assemblage consists at least of 28 large mammal taxa, including the Neogene relict species, Sinomastodon sp. and Hippopotamodon ultimus, and the species for their first appearances in the Pleistocene, Hystrix magna, Stegodon huananensis, Ailuropoda microta, Rhinoceros fusuiensis, Tapirus sanyuanensis, Sus peii, Sus xiaozhu, Cervus fenqii and Megalovis guangxiensis. Comparisons to already-dated early Pleistocene mammalian assemblages in southern China indicate that the age of this assemblage is around 1.9 Ma, which is consistent with the ESR/U-series and paleomagnetic dating results. The occurrences of Equus in the Chuifeng, Liucheng Gigantopithecus, Longgudong and Longgupo sites imply that G. blacki may survive in an open woodland environment with grasslands nearby in the middle and north parts of southern China.

AB  - Pigs are usually bred through artificial insemination with liquid semen preserved at 15-20 degrees C. While this method of preservation brings many benefits, including a greater reproductive performance compared to frozen-thawed sperm, the period of storage is a limiting factor. As the mitochondrion regulates many facets of sperm physiology, modulating its activity could have an impact on their lifespan. Aligned with this hypothesis, the present study sought to investigate whether inhibition of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), which reside in the outer mitochondrial membrane and regulate the flux of ions between mitochondria and the cytosol in somatic cells, influences the resilience of pig sperm to liquid preservation at 17 degrees C. For this purpose, semen samples (N = 7) were treated with two different concentrations of TRO19622 (5 mu M and 50 mu M), an inhibitor of VDACs, and stored at 17 degrees C for 10 days. At days 0, 4 and 10, sperm quality and functionality parameters were evaluated by flow cytometry and computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). The effects of inhibiting VDACs depended on the concentration of the inhibitor. On the one hand, the greatest concentration of TRO19622 (50 mu M) led to a decrease in sperm motility, viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, which could be related to the observed intracellular Ca2+ increase. In contrast, total sperm motility was higher in samples treated with 5 mu M TRO19622 than in the control, suggesting that when VDACs channels are inhibited by the lowest concentration of the blocking agent the resilience of pig sperm to liquid storage increases. In conclusion, the current research indicates that mitochondrial function, as regulated by ion channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane like VDACs, is related to the sperm resilience to liquid preservation and may influence cell lifespan.

AB  - Eastern subterranean termites, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar), are widely distributed across North America where they are exposed to a broad range of environmental conditions. However, mechanisms for overwintering are not well understood. Wisconsin is a unique location to study mechanisms of cold tolerance as it represents the northern boundary for persistent R. flavipes populations. In this study, we evaluated seasonal shifts in cold tolerance using critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and supercooling point (SCP) and examined how these measurements correlate to changes in the microbial community of the termite gut. Results showed seasonal acclimatization to cold, which is consistent with the use of behavioral freeze-avoidant mechanisms. However, these insects also demonstrated an increased susceptibility to freezing later in the season, which may be tied to changes in gut microbiota. Our results found shifts in the composition of the gut microbiome in R. flavipes between mid- to late summer and early to late fall. These differences may be suggestive of a change in metabolism to adjust to a period of reduced feeding and increased metabolic stress during overwintering. Specifically, results showed an increased abundance of Methanobrevibacter sp. (Euryarchaeota) associated with cold, which may be indicative of a metabolic shift from acetogenesis to methanogenesis associated with overwintering. Further work is needed focusing on specific contributions of certain gut microbes, particularly their role in metabolic adaptability and in providing protection from oxidative stress associated with changes in environmental conditions.

AB  - Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is a component of the herbivore-induced volatile blend of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and an intermediate in long distance salicylic acid (SA) signaling. To investigate the role of MeSA in interactions between tomato and the lepidopteran pests Helicoverpa zea and Manduca sexta, we used transgenic tomato lines that were antisense (AS) or overexpressors (OE) of the tomato SA carboxyl methyl transferase SlSAMT1, which under- or over-produce MeSA, respectively. Transgenic AS plants produced less MeSA and were more susceptible to both insects compared to wild-type plants, while OE plants had elevated MeSA production but displayed increased resistance only to M. sexta. Pairwise choice and toxicity assays revealed that MeSA itself impacted the larvae as a deterrent rather than a toxin, and metabolic profiling indicated that increased susceptibility in the AS lines and resistance in the OE lines may be related to altered jasmonic acid and ABA mediated herbivore-induced defense signaling, and modified production of inducible defense compounds such as flavonoids and phenolamides. To expand beyond Lepidoptera, the settling preference of the piercing-sucking insect Bemisia tabaci was also examined and it displayed a strong preference for lines with less SlSAMT1 expression. These data indicate that herbivore-inducible SlSAMT1 expression and its associated MeSA production play an important and complex role in the defense of tomato against insect pests.

AB  - Newborn lamb mortality is a major economic and welfare concern for the sheep industry globally, which can potentially be reduced through automated monitoring of lambing difficulties and quantifying time of birth. This study investigated the identification of lambing ewes' behaviours during labour and post-partum licking, by applying deep learning algorithms to halter-mounted accelerometer sensor data. 101 lambing ewes from two experiments and 29 non-pregnant ewes from three other experiments, were fitted with the sensors. Ground truth behaviour labels, 5 s long, were obtained based on video recordings of the study sheep. Classification using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, was performed for different ethograms: labour behaviours, phases of labour, licking only, and labour and licking in the context of broader grazing behaviours. The model was fine-tuned with data of six sheep where the first birth fell within the observation period. A combined grazing and lambing behaviour ethogram achieved the best performance (accuracy: 81%) with recall of 0.85 for the licking behaviour. Fine-tuning increased performance further (average accuracy: 86.3%), with a best case recall of 0.88 for labour and 0.94 for licking. The licking only ethogram demonstrated strong recall for licking (0.9) when the epoch length was increased to 60 s. Isolation of the labour and licking behaviours achieved 84.8% accuracy, with a weighted F1-score of 0.85, demonstrating the ability to separate the labour phases. The study presents a strong foundation for the development of systems to detect lambing events and prolonged labour.

AB  - Temperature effect on digestive response is still unknown in most reptile species as is the case with the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria). Hatchlings were fed with two diets, one high in fiber (14.16% crude fiber, 39.20% neutral detergent fiber dry matter basis, DMB) and one high in starch (27.71% DMB), housed at 30 degrees C or 20 degrees C, to evaluate the temperature effect on food intake (FI), digesta passage, apparent digestive efficiency (Da), and growth. At 30 degrees C the animals showed higher FI and digestible energy (DEI), as well as metabolic mass-specific intake of digestible nutrients and energy (DEImm, 99.48 +/- 14.30 versus 43.18 +/- 17.26 kJ kg-0.86 day-1; P<0.001); daily gain (0.98 +/- 0.26 versus 0.32 +/- 0.11 g day-1; P<0.001), and growth of carapace length (0.25 +/- 0.05 versus 0.09 +/- 0.02 mm day-1; P<0.001) and width (0.15 +/- 0.03 versus 0.05 +/- 0.01 mm day-1; P<0.001). DEI at 30 degrees C was expressed: (R2=0.67). Non-diet effect was observed on digesta passage, however, at 20 degrees C the transit (5.50 +/- 1.36 versus 3.60 +/- 1.05 days; P<0.01) and retention times (13.80 +/- 1.29 versus 8.90 +/- 1.15 days; P<0.001) were longer than at 30 degrees C. Animals housed at colder conditions also presented lower gut content (30.39 +/- 13.39 versus 40.45 +/- 9.76 g Kg-1; P<0.05) and gut fill time (0.08 +/- 0.01 versus 0.02 +/- 0.01 g day-1; P<0.001). Da were similar between temperatures but due to the diet effect, hatchlings fed the high starch diet presented higher DM and energy coefficients. Environmental temperature influences the digestive response and growth of C. carbonaria. Overall digestive efficiency was temperatureindependent but rather influenced by diet quality and composition.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) affect a significant portion of the global population and have a substantial social and economic impact worldwide. Most NDDs manifest in early childhood and are characterized by deficits in cognition, communication, social interaction and motor control. Due to a limited understanding of the etiology of NDDs, current treatment options primarily focus on symptom management rather than on curative solutions. Moreover, research on NDDs is problematic due to its reliance on a neurocentric approach. However, recent studies are broadening the scope of research on NDDs, to include dysregulations within a diverse network of brain cell types, including vascular and glial cells. This review aims to summarize studies from the past few decades on potential new contributions to the etiology of NDDs, with a special focus on metabolic signatures of various brain cells. In particular, we aim to convey how the metabolic functions are intimately linked to the onset and/or progression of common NDDs such as autism spectrum disorders, fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome and Down syndrome.

AB  - Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that can cause excitatory neurotoxicity when its extracellular concentration is too high, leading to disrupted calcium balance and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cordycepin, a nucleoside adenosine derivative, has been shown to protect against excitatory neurotoxicity induced by glutamate. To investigate its potential neuroprotective effects, the present study employed fluorescence detection and spectrophotometry techniques to analyze primary hippocampal-cultured neurons. The results showed that glutamate toxicity reduced hippocampal neuron viability, increased ROS production, and increased intracellular calcium levels. Additionally, glutamate-induced cytotoxicity activated acetylcholinesterase and decreased glutathione levels. However, cordycepin inhibited glutamate-induced cell death, improved cell viability, reduced ROS production, and lowered Ca2+ levels. It also inhibited acetylcholinesterase activation and increased glutathione levels. This study suggests that cordycepin can protect against glutamate-induced neuronal injury in cell models, and this effect was inhibited by adenosine A1 receptor blockers, indicating that its neuroprotective effect is achieved through activation of the adenosine A1 receptor.

AB  - Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems. Cardinal features include cardiovascular disease, distinct facies, and a unique cognitive profile characterized by intellectual disability, hypersociability, and visuospatial weaknesses. Here, we synthesize neuroimaging research in WS with a focus on how the current literature and future work may be leveraged to improve health and quality of life in WS. More than 80 neuroimaging studies in WS have been conducted, the vast majority of which have focused on identifying morphometric brain differences. Aside from decreased volume of the parieto-occipital region and increased cerebellar volume, morphometric findings have been variable across studies. fMRI studies investigating the visuospatial deficit have identified dorsal stream dysfunction and abnormal activation of the hippocampal formation. Minimal work has been done using PET or MRS. Future approaches that conduct neuroimaging in tandem with clinical phenotyping, utilize novel imaging techniques to visualize brain vasculature or provide biochemical and molecular information, and include more homogenous age groups across the lifespan, have significant potential to advance clinical care.

AB  - Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is among the most significant beverage crops globally. The size of tea buds not only directly affects the yield and quality of fresh leaves, but also plays a key role in determining the suitability of different types of tea. Analyzing the genetic regulation mechanism of tea bud size is crucial for enhancing tea cultivars and boosting tea yield. In this study, a digital phenotyping technology was utilized to collected morphological characteristics of the apical buds of 280 tea accessions of representative germplasm at the 'two and a bud' stage. Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the length, width, perimeter, and area of tea buds followed a normal distribution and exhibited considerable variation across natural population of tea plants. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of phenotypic extreme materials revealed a strong negative correlation between the expression levels of four KNOX genes and tea bud size. A key candidate gene, CsKNOX6, was confirmed by further genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Its function was preliminarily characterized by heterologous transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of CsKNOX6 reduced the leaf area in transgenic plants, which initially determined that it is a key gene negatively regulating bud size. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of KNOX genes in tea plants and provide some references for uncovering the genetic regulatory mechanisms behind tea bud size.

AB  - Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) also known as "spotted wing Drosophila" is a polyphagous herbivore of Asian origin with a short life cycle, and high dispersal and reproduction rates. The arrival of this invasive pest forced a reevaluation of management strategies in Northern Patagonia. The aims of this work were to quantify the inter-annual variation of population levels, explore the influence of cultivated and wild hosts, assess the dispersal of the pest, and adjust a statistical model to describing population patterns as a function of degree days and relative humidity. We selected a cherry and raspberry orchard located in Plottier, Neuqu & eacute;n. Transect sampling was carried out and 33 traps were placed across an area of 12.5 km(2) between 2018 and 2023. D. suzukii used fruit crops such as peach, vineyard, and plum trees as alternate hosts. D. suzukii exhibited seasonal behavior, with higher captures observed during summer and autumn. The adjusted GAMM model showed an increase in captures at 1,500 degree days (DD) and population peaks between 3,000 and 3,200 DD. This model is the first to be used in Argentina with trap capture count. Unlike conventional models, it allows for the integration of nonlinear variables.

AB  - We present the novel results of studying tissue metabolites of the ear-nose-throat organs (pathological and relatively healthy mucosal tissues) during heating and thermal exposure using gas spectrometers of the terahertz (THz) frequency range based on non-stationary effects. Tissue metabolites of the ear-nose-throat organs obtained during surgery according to strict medical indications have been studied for the first time in the world. All the tissues used in the samples were histological verified for confirming the morphological diagnosis. For obtaining a unified picture, chemical compounds appearing during thermal decomposition of pathological and relatively healthy tissues were identified using the spectroscopic approach, with mandatory histological verification of the samples. The obtained results demonstrate that a powerful research tool has been proposed for evaluation of metabolites in otorhinolaryngology with detection of diseases markers.

AB  - Conceptus estrogens and prostaglandins have long been considered the primary signals for maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) in the pig. However, loss-of-function studies targeting conceptus aromatase genes (CYP19A1 and CYP19A2) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) indicated that conceptuses can not only signal MRP without estrogens or prostaglandins but can maintain early pregnancy. However, complete loss of estrogen production leads to abortion after day 25 of gestation. Although neither conceptus estrogens nor prostaglandins had a significant effect on early maintenance of corpora lutea (CL) function alone, the two conceptus factors have a biological relationship. To investigate the role that both conceptus estrogens and prostaglandins have on MRP and maintenance of pregnancy, a triple loss-of function model (TKO) was generated for conceptus CYP19A1, CYP19A2, and PTGS2. In addition, a conceptus CYP19A2(-/-) model (A2KO) was established to determine the role of placental estrogen during later pregnancy. Estrogen and prostaglandin synthesis were greatly reduced in TKO concept uses which resulted in a failure to inhibit luteolysis after day 15 of pregnancy despite the presence of conceptuses in the uterine lumen. However, A2KO placentae not only maintained functional CL but were able to maintain pregnancy to day 32 of gestation. Despite the loss of placental CYP19A2 expression, the allantois fluid content of estrogen was not affected as the placenta compensated by expressing CYP19A1 and CYP19A3, which are normally absent in controls. Results suggest conceptuses can signal MRP through production of conceptus PGE or stimulating PGE synthesis from the endometrium through conceptus estrogen. Failure of conceptuses to produce both factors results in failure of MRP and loss of pregnancy.

AB  - In tobacco planting in China, the artificial release of aphid parasitoids Aphidius gifuensis has been applied to control aphids for a decade. However, due to seasonal effects and crop rotation, the sustainability of releasing parasitoids and the aphid control efficacy have not been properly evaluated. In this study, effective semiochemical-based attractants were further screened and optimized in the tobacco fields. Film lures were developed to release the synthetic attractant blends. In tobacco planting fields, the synthetic mixture of beta-pinene, methyl salicylate, linalool, and limonene(6:6:2:20 mg) significantly increased the population of natural enemies, including A. gifuensis and ladybeetles (Coccinella septempunctata, Harmonia axyridis and Hippodamia variegate) monitored using using malaise traps. The increase in the natural enemy population was related to the season and the lure placement density in the tobacco fields, as well as the distribution of surrounding habitats and flowering plants. A density of 135 lures per hectare significantly increased the number of parasitoids, reduced the popu-lation of aphids, elevated the rate of parasitized aphids by 42%, and effectively suppressed the aphid population in the tobacco fields. Combined with the protection of flowering plants around tobacco fields, synthetic lures may provide a technical measure for conservative biological control.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to characterize the dry-cured loin and dry-cured "cachaco" of Bisaro pork and evaluate the effect of the inclusion of olive cake in the animals' diet on the cured products. For this purpose, forty loins and forty "cachacos" were used, followed by a process of cold curing with controlled ventilation, without adding nitrites or synthetic additives. The dry-cured loin and "cachaco" chemical compositions were significantly different in moisture, total fat, protein, chlorides, ash, and haem pigments. The "cachaco" showed a much higher value of total fat and a lower protein value. Its chloride content was lower and was related to the lower ash percentage. Neither product differed significantly in the water activity and collagen content. The proportions of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids were significantly different between these products. The dry-cured "cachaco" showed higher values of SFA and PUFA, and the dry-cured loin had higher MUFA content. No significant effect of different olive cakes on diet was observed in the chemical compositions. Both products are of high quality and with good nutritional and physicochemical characteristics, and the introduction of olive cake in the diet did not affect any of the quality parameters analyzed.

AB  - Simple Summary The focus of pigsty environmental monitoring is to deploy an appropriate number of sensors in optimal locations. Therefore, researching the optimal placement of sensors inside pigsties is of great significance. This study, through a clustering analysis of environmental data collected by sensors in pigsties, has devised a seasonal dynamic sensor layout, providing a feasible solution for optimizing the internal environmental monitoring of pigsties. This will offer more rational and reliable environmental monitoring data for the control system within pigsties, reducing the number of sensors and minimizing data redundancy. The results indicate that placing a smaller number of sensors at key locations inside pigsties can effectively monitor the internal environment.Abstract Sensors were of paramount importance in the context of poultry and livestock farming, serving as essential tools for monitoring a variety of production management parameters. The effective surveillance and optimal control of the swine facility environment critically depend on the implementation of a robust strategy for situating the optimal number of sensors in precisely the right locations. This study presents a dynamic sensor placement approach for pigsties using the three-way k-means algorithm. The method involves determining candidate sensor combinations through the application of the k-means algorithm and a re-clustering strategy. The optimal sensor locations were then identified using the Joint Entropy-Based Method (JEBM). This approach adjusts sensor positions based on different seasons (summer and winter) to effectively monitor the overall environment of the pigsty. We employ two clustering models, one based on particle swarm optimization and the other on genetic algorithms, along with a re-clustering strategy to identify candidate sensor combinations. The joint entropy-based method (JEBM) helps select the optimal sensor placement. Fused data from the optimal sensor layout undergo a fuzzy fusion process, reducing errors compared to direct averaging. The results show varying sensor needs across seasons, and dynamic placement enhances pigsty environment monitoring. Our approach reduced the number of sensors from 30 to 5 (in summer) and 6 (in winter). The optimal sensor positions for both seasons were integrated. Comparing the selected sensor layout to the average of all sensor readings representing the overall pigsty environment, the RMSE were 0.227-0.294 and the MAPE were 0.172-0.228, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sensor layout.

AB  - Measuring the inequality of leaf area distribution per plant (ILAD) can provide a useful tool for quantifying the influences of intra- and interspecific competition, foraging behavior of herbivores, and environmental stress on plants' above-ground architectural structures and survival strategies. Despite its importance, there has been limited research on this issue. This paper aims to fill this gap by comparing four inequality indices to measure ILAD, using indices for quantifying household income that are commonly used in economics, including the Gini index (which is based on the Lorenz curve), the coefficient of variation, the Theil index, and the mean log deviation index. We measured the area of all leaves for 240 individual plants of the species Shibataea chinensis Nakai, a drought-tolerant landscape plant found in southern China. A three-parameter performance equation was fitted to observations of the cumulative proportion of leaf area vs. the cumulative proportion of leaves per plant to calculate the Gini index for each individual specimen of S. chinensis. The performance equation was demonstrated to be valid in describing the rotated and right shifted Lorenz curve, given that >96% of root-mean-square error values were smaller than 0.004 for 240 individual plants. By examining the correlation between any of the six possible pairs of indices among the Gini index, the coefficient of variation, the Theil index, and the mean log deviation index, the data show that these indices are closely related and can be used interchangeably to quantify ILAD.

AB  - Stress or low level of estrogen could promote anxiety and depression; thus, it is of interest to investigate the combined effect of mild stress and the lack of estrogen on mental disorders by utilizing an animal model. This study was conducted to assess anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in ovariectomized (Ovx) rats exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS) and determine the alteration in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related transmission. Ovx rats were randomly assigned into four groups: (1) estrogen replacement (E2-NoCMS), (2) estrogen replacement and exposure to CMS (E2-CMS), (3) vehicle (VEH-NoCMS), and (4) vehicle and exposure to CMS (VEH-CMS). Following 4-week CMS, VEH groups (VEH-NoCMS and VEH-CMS) showed a similar level of anxiety-like behavior in elevated T-maze, whereas E2-CMS, VEH-NoCMS and VEH-CMS showed anxiety-like behavior in open field. The depressive-like behavior in the force swimming test tended to be affected by estrogen deprivation than CMS. The alteration of the GABAergic system as determined from the GABA level and mRNA expression of GABA-related transmission (i.e., glutamic acid decarboxylase, GABA transporter and GABA(A) subunits) showed that the GABA level in the amygdala and frontal cortex was affected by CMS. For mRNA expression, the mRNA profile in the amygdala and hippocampus of VEH-NoCMS and E2-CMS was the same but different from those of VEH-NoCMS and E2-CMS. In addition, compared with E2-NoCMS, the mRNA profile in the frontal cortex was similar in VEH-NoCMS, E2-CMS, and VEH-CMS. These findings indicated that the underlying mechanism of the GABAergic system was differently modified, although VEH-NoCMS and VEH-CMS showed anxiety-like behavior. The findings of this study may provide a comprehensive understanding of the modulation of the GABAergic system during estrogen deprivation under CMS, as observed in menopausal women who were daily exposed to stress.

AB  - Biochar is known to accelerate composting process and improve the quality of end-products. However, its effects on bioconversion of organic waste by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) remains largely unexamined. To investigate the effects of corn straw biochar (CS-BC) on bioconversion of soybean dregs (SD) by BSFL, SD was amended with four different dosages of CS-BC [0%, 2%, 5%, and 8% (w/w)] and digested by BSFL for ten days. The results indicated that the peak values of single larva wet weight in the treatments amended with CS-BC were advanced by 2-3 days and the reduction rate of SD increased from 72.09% to 85.37% with the increasing dosage of CS-BC. Meanwhile, SD mixed with 2%, 5% and 8% of CS-BC decreased ammonia (NH3) emission by 2.7%, 3.6% and 18.0%, respectively. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions reduced (-23.6%, -29.1% and -49.2%) with 2%, 5% and 8% CS-BC additions, respectively. In addition, the residual nitrogen of SD-nitrogen proportionally increased with CS-BC application (28.3%, 28.6%, 30.1% and 35.0% for application at the dosage of 0%, 2%, 5% and 8%, respectively). Based on the comprehensive evaluation of bioconversion performance, alleviation of pollutant gas emission, and nitrogen conservation, we recommend the introduction of 8% (w/w) CS-BC during bioconversion of SD by BSFL. This study confirmed the feasibility of CS-BC as an amendment for the BSFL-based bioconversion system.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, the common social and communicative behaviors of the Fonni's Dog maintained under different outdoor conditions were investigated in order to improve the scant knowledge currently available on the behavior features of this dog breed. The preliminary results obtained here show that both dogs confined to kennels and free-ranging ones showed a strong collaborative motivation with the owner. This indicates a behavior consistent with the attitude of the Fonni's Dog.Abstract This study aimed to investigate the common social and communicative behaviors of the Fonni's Dog under different outdoor conditions. For this study, 70 adult dogs (3-7 years; 32 intact males, 38 intact females) belonging to the Fonni's breed were used. A total of 35 dogs were kept in kennels and 35 were free-ranging dogs in their sheep/goat livestock units. A behavioral repertoire was adapted from the literature and an ethogram was filled in for each dog. All dogs were evaluated in the presence of the owner. Fisher's exact test, following Bonferroni's correction, was used to test possible differences in the categorical variables (presence or absence of the behavior) between free-ranging dogs and dogs kept in kennels. The study revealed that several categories of the dogs' body language were associated with the management condition. However, the breed motivations (guarding and defense of the territory) were satisfied both in kennel and in the animals who were free in the property. The current study suggests a good behavioral balance of the Fonni's Dogs which could be attributed to correct communication between dogs and owners.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most dangerous hemorrhagic infectious diseases that affect domestic and wild pigs. Currently, neither a vaccine nor effective treatments are available for this disease. As regards the degree of virulence, ASFV strains can be divided into high, moderate, or low virulence. The main detection methods are based on the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In order to prevent an uncontrolled spread of ASF, new on-site techniques that can enable the identification of an early-stage disease are needed. We have developed a specific immunological SPR-based assay for ASFV antigen detection directly in liquid samples. The developed assay allows us to detect the presence of ASFV at the dose of 10(3) HAD(50)/(mL).

AB  - Implant topography affects early peri-implant bone healing by changing the osteoconduction rate in the surrounding biological environment. Implant surfaces have been designed to promote faster and stronger bone formation for rapid and stable prosthesis loading. Early peri-implant bone healing has been observed with a sandblasted, acid-etched implant that was chemically modified to be hydrophilic (cmSLA). The present study investigates whether early peri-implant bone healing extends to a rough surface implant with a high crystalline hydroxyapatite surface (TSV MP-1 HA). Three implants were randomly placed in porous trabecular bone within both medial femoral condyles of 10 sheep. Early peri-implant bone stability was measured at 3- and 6-weeks healing time following implant insertion. Results indicated a similar implant stability quotient between the implants at insertion and over time. The significant increase over time of reverse torque values with respect to insertion torque (p < 0.001) did not differ between the implants. However, the bone-to-implant contact of TSV MP-1 HA was significantly higher than that of cmSLA implants at 6 weeks (p < 0.01). These data validate previous findings of a hydrophilic implant surface and extend the observation of early osseointegration to a rough surface implant in porous trabecular bone.

AB  - Adjuvant chemotherapy after pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer may reduce recurrence and improve survival rates; however, the benefits of this treatment are limited by the significant side effects that accompany it. The development of a novel in vivo lung perfusion (IVLP) platform would permit the localized delivery of high doses of chemotherapeutic drugs to target residual micrometastatic disease. Nonetheless, it is critical to continuously monitor the levels of such drugs during IVLP administration, as lung injury can occur if tissue concentrations are not maintained within the therapeutic window. This paper presents a simple chemical-biopsy approach based on sampling with a small nitinol wire coated with a sorbent of biocompatible morphology and evaluates its applicability for the near-real-time in vivo determination of oxaliplatin (OxPt) in a 72-h porcine IVLP survival model. To this end, the pigs underwent a 3-h left lung IVLP with 3 doses of the tested drug (5, 7.5, and 40 mg/L), which were administered to the perfusion circuit reservoir as a bolus after a full perfusion flow had been established. Along with OxPt levels, the biocompatible solid-phase microextraction (SPME) probes were employed to profile other low-molecular-weight compounds to provide spatial and temporal information about the toxicity of chemotherapy or lung injury. The resultant measurements revealed a rather heterogeneous distribution of OxPt (over the course of IVLP) in the two sampled sections of the lung. In most cases, the OxPt concentration in the lung tissue peaked during the second hour of IVLP, with this trend being more evident in the upper section. In turn, OxPt in supernatant samples represented & SIM;25% of the entire drug after the first hour of perfusion, which may be attributable to the binding of OxPt to albumin, its sequestration into erythrocytes, or its rapid nonenzymatic biotransformation. Additionally, the Bio-SPME probes also facilitated the extraction of various endogenous molecules for the purpose of screening biochemical pathways affected during IVLP (i.e., lipid and amino acid metabolism, steroidogenesis, or purine metabolism). Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the minimally invasive SPME-based sampling approach presented in this work can serve as (pre)clinical and precise bedside medical tool.

AB  - Chronic fetal hypoxia is one of the most common outcomes in complicated pregnancy in humans. Despite this, its effects on the long-term health of the brain in offspring are largely unknown. Here, we investigated in rats whether hypoxic pregnancy affects brain structure and function in the adult offspring and explored underlying mechanisms with maternal antioxidant intervention. Pregnant rats were randomly chosen for normoxic or hypoxic (13% oxygen) pregnancy with or without maternal supplementation with vitamin C in their drinking water. In one cohort, the placenta and fetal tissues were collected at the end of gestation. In another, dams were allowed to deliver naturally, and offspring were reared under normoxic conditions until 4 months of age (young adult). Between 3.5 and 4 months, the behavior, cognition and brains of the adult offspring were studied. We demonstrated that prenatal hypoxia reduced neuronal number, as well as vascular and synaptic density, in the hippocampus, significantly impairing memory function in the adult offspring. These adverse effects of prenatal hypoxia were independent of the hypoxic pregnancy inducing fetal growth restriction or elevations in maternal or fetal plasma glucocorticoid levels. Maternal vitamin C supplementation during hypoxic pregnancy protected against oxidative stress in the placenta and prevented the adverse effects of prenatal hypoxia on hippocampal atrophy and memory loss in the adult offspring. Therefore, these data provide a link between prenatal hypoxia, placental oxidative stress, and offspring brain health in later life, providing insight into mechanism and identifying a therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Biogas slurry was rich in phosphorus and serves as an important source for phosphorus recovery. Generally, the soluble orthophosphate (Ortho-P) was the main form of phosphorus recovered by adsorbents, however, the proportion of dissolved orthophosphate (Ortho-P) is less than 30% of TP. Therefore, promoting the transformation of other phosphorus forms to Ortho-P is extremely crucial for improving the recovery efficiency of phosphorus in biogas slurry. In this study, H2SO4 was used for the acidification pretreatment of biogas slurry to improve the efficiency of phosphorus recovery. The effects of different acidification conditions on the transformation of phosphorus forms and physicochemical properties of biogas slurry as well as the phosphorus recovery effect of the straw biochar magnesium-lanthanum hydrotalcite composite material (6YBC-LDO) were investigated. When H2SO4 was added to adjust the pH of the biogas slurry to 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0, the mass concentration of Ortho-P increased by a factor of 20, 9, and 4, respectively, compared with the original biogas slurry. The total phosphorus recovery capacity of 6YBC-LDO from acidified biogas slurry at pH 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 were 150.99, 144.73, and 40.32 mg/g, respectively, with phosphorus recovery rates of 64%, 85%, and 99%, respectively. The phosphorus recovery products from biogas slurry treated with pH 7 were mainly phosphate complexes with higher purity. High purity phosphorus recovery materials could be used as for efficient phosphorus fertilizers production in the future, which has profit of 4.44 RMB with treatment 1 m3 biogas slurry.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Antibiotics are commonly added to the diet of chickens grown for meat to reduce bacterial contamination of their gastrointestinal tract. The bacteria reduce the efficiency of feed utilization and, hence, growth. However, there are concerns about the inclusion of antibiotics in the feed of chickens grown for meat, because of the development of resistance in the bacteria. As a result, scientists are searching for alternative feed additives. Turnip extract is known to have antibacterial properties but has not been tested in the diet of broiler chickens. We tested several levels of turnip extract in the water for chickens and compared their growth and the level of bacterial contamination of their gut with that of chickens given a standard antibiotic. Although chickens with the highest level of turnip extract initially had slow growth, those given a medium level of turnip extract had faster growth overall, better feed conversion, fewer Gram-negative lactose bacteria in their cecum and fewer antibodies in their blood, compared with those fed the antibiotic. This suggests that inclusion of turnip extract in the diet of chickens could provide an alternative to conventional antibiotics.
   There are concerns about inclusion of antibiotics in the feed of broiler chickens, because of the development of antibiotic resistance, leading to a search for alternative feed additives. Turnip extract is known to have antibacterial properties but has not been tested in the diet of broiler chickens. We allocated 200 broiler chicks to receive one of four levels of turnip extract in their water, 0, 150, 300 or 450 ppm, or a standard antibiotic, Virginiamycin, over a 42-day growing period. Although initially there were detrimental effects of providing 450 ppm, overall the 150 ppm level of supplementation increased weight gain, compared with birds given Virginiamycin, and decreased gizzard weight. Birds given 150 ppm or Virginiamycin had increased low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and reduced very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) in their blood serum and reduced antibody responses to sheep red blood cells, compared to birds in the 450 ppm treatment. Birds given turnip extract at 450 ppm had fewer Gram-negative lactose and coliform bacteria than those provided with no turnip extract, and those provided with 150-300 ppm had the same as those provided with Virginiamycin. Turnip extract could potentially replace antibiotics included in the feed of broiler chickens for growth promotion and the control of bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - The roe deer bucks represent a spontaneous model to study the synchronized testicular involution and recrudescence cycles. However, cellular processes and hormonal control of steroidogenic glands are scarcely known. For the present study testes and adrenal glands obtained from roe deer during the prerut season were used. We aimed to determine (i) senescence and autophagy involvement in testis atrophy (immunohistochemical analysis for tumor suppressor protein encoded by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; p16 and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3; LC3, respectively), (ii) the size of the adrenal cortex and medulla (morphometric analysis), (iii) G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and estrogen-related receptors (ERRs; type a, b, and Y) distribution and expression (qRTPCR and immunohistochemical analyses) and (iv) serum testosterone and estradiol levels (immunoassay ELISA). This study revealed pre-rut characteristics of testis structure with the presence of both senescence and autophagy-positive cells and higher involvement of senescence, especially in spermatogenic cells (P < 0.05). In the adrenal cortex, groups of cells exhibiting shrinkage were observed. The presence of ERRs in cells of the seminiferous epithelium and interstitial Leydig cells and GPER presence distinctly in Leydig cells was revealed. In adrenals, these receptors were localized in groups of normal-looking cells and those with shrinkage. Morphometric analysis showed differences in cortex width which was smaller (P < 0.05) than that of the medulla. A weak immunohistochemical signal was observed for ERRb when compared to ERRa and ERRg. The mRNA expression level of ERRa and ERRg was lower (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) while ERRb was higher (P < 0.001) in adrenals when compared to testes. mRNA GPER expression was similar in both glands. In the pre-rut season, the testosterone level was 4.89 ng/ml while the estradiol level was 0.234 ng/ml. We postulate that: (i) senescence and autophagy may be involved in both reinitiation of testis function and/or induction of abnormal processes, (ii) hormonal modulation of testis inactivity may affect adrenal cortex causing cell shrinkage, (iii) ERRs and GPER localization in spermatogenic cells and interstitial cells, as well as cortex cells, may maintain and control the morpho-functional status of both glands, and (iv) androgens and estrogens (via ERRs and GPER) drive cellular processes in the testis and adrenal pre-rut physiology.

AB  - Ehrlichia chaffeensis infects and proliferates inside monocytes or macrophages and causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), an emerging life-threatening tick-borne zoonosis. After internalization, E. chaffeensis resides in specialized membrane-bound inclusions, E. chaffeensis-containing vesicles (ECVs), to evade from host cell innate immune responses and obtain nutrients. However, mechanisms exploited by host cells to inhibit E. chaffeensis growth in ECVs are still largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that host cells recognize E. chaffeensis Ech_1067, a penicillin-binding protein, and then upregulate the expression of PIT1, which is a phosphate transporter and transports phosphate from ECVs to the cytosol to inhibit bacterial growth. We found that host cells upregulate the PIT1 expression upon E. chaffeensis infection using transcriptome sequencing, qRT-PCR and Western blotting, and PIT1 is localized on the ECV membrane in infected THP-1 cells using confocal microscopy. Silence of PIT1 using shRNA enhances E. chaffeensis intracellular growth. Finally, we found that E. chaffeensis Ech_1067 induces the upregulation of PIT1 expression through the MyD88-NF-kappa B pathway using recombinant protein for stimulation and siRNA for silence. Our findings deepen the understanding of the innate immune responses of host cells to inhibit bacterial intracellular growth and facilitate the development of new therapeutics for HME.

AB  - Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with hippocampal system structural and functional impairments. Neurobiological models of PTSD posit that contextual memory for traumatic events is impaired due to hippocampal system dysfunction whilst memory of sensory details is enhanced due to amygdalar impact on sensory cortices. If hippocampal system dysfunction is a core feature of PTSD, then non-traumatic hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as scene construction, spatial processing, and memory should also be impaired in individuals with PTSD.
   Methods: Forty-six trauma survivors, half diagnosed with PTSD, performed two tasks that involved spatial processing. The first was a scene construction task which requires conjuring-up spatially coherent multimodal scenarios, completed by all participants. Twenty-six participants (PTSD: n = 13) also completed a navigation task in a virtual environment, and underwent structural T1, T2 and diffusion-tensor MRI to quantify gray and white matter integrity. We examined the relationship between spatial processing, neural integrity, and symptom severity in a multiple factor analysis.
   Results: Overall, patients with PTSD showed impaired performance in both tasks compared to controls. Scenes imagined by patients were less vivid, less detailed, and generated less sense of presence; importantly they had disproportionally reduced spatial coherence between details. Patients also made more errors during virtual navigation. Two components of the multiple factor analysis captured group differences. The first component explained 25% of the shared variance: participants that constructed less spatially coherent scenes also made more navigation errors and had reduced white matter integrity to long association tracts and tracts connecting the hippocampus, thalamus, and cingulate. The second component explained 20% of the variance: participants who generated fewer scene details, with less spatial coherence between them, had smaller hippocampal, parahippocampal and isthmus cingulate volumes. These participants also had increased white matter integrity to the right hippocampal cingulum bundle.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients with PTSD are impaired at imagining even neutral spatially coherent scenes and navigating through a complex spatial environment. Patients that showed reduced spatial processing more broadly had reduced hippocampal systems volumes and abnormal white matter integrity to tracts implicated in multisensory integration.

AB  - Mutations of PTEN-induced kinase I (PINK1) cause early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) with selective neurodegeneration in humans. However, current PINK1 knockout mouse and pig models are unable to recapitulate the typical neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in PD patients. This suggests that generating PINK1 disease models in non-human primates (NHPs) that are close to humans is essential to investigate the unique function of PINK1 in primate brains. Paired single guide RNA (sgRNA)/Cas9-D10A nickases and truncated sgRNA/Cas9, both of which can reduce off-target effects without compromising on-target editing, are two optimized strategies in the CRISPR/Cas9 system for establishing disease animal models. Here, we combined the two strategies and injected Cas9-D10A mRNA and two truncated sgRNAs into one-cell-stage cynomolgus zygotes to target the PINK1 gene. We achieved precise and efficient gene editing of the target site in three newborn cynomolgus monkeys. The frame shift mutations of PINK1 in mutant fibroblasts led to a reduction in mRNA. However, western blotting and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the PINK1 protein levels were comparable to that in wild-type fibroblasts. We further reprogramed mutant fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which showed similar ability to differentiate into dopamine (DA) neurons. Taken together, our results showed that co-injection of Cas9-D10A nickase mRNA and sgRNA into one-cell-stage cynomolgus embryos enabled the generation of human disease models in NHPs and target editing by pair truncated sgRNA/Cas9-D10A in PINK1 gene exon 2 did not impact protein expression.

AB  - Reboxetine, the first selective norepinephrine (NA) reuptake inhibitor used in the treatment of depression, mainly acts by binding to the NA transporter and blocking reuptake of extracellular NA. Recently, some other pharmacological targets beyond the NA transporter are being demonstrated for reboxetine. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Previous reports have demonstrated the role of hippocampal PPAR alpha in the pathophysiology of depression. Here we assume that hippocampal PPAR alpha may participate in the antidepressant mechanism of reboxetine. Therefore, the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model of depression, various behavioral tests, the western blotting and adenovirus associated virus (AAV)-mediated genetic knockdown methods were used together in the present study. Our results showed that repeated reboxetine treatment markedly restored the decreasing effects of CSDS on the expression of hippocampal PPAR alpha, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB). Pharmacological blockade of PPAR alpha notably prevented the antidepressant-like effects of reboxetine in the CSDS model. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of hippocampal PPAR alpha also fully abolished the antidepressant-like effects of reboxetine in the CSDS model. Taken together, promoting the hippocampal PPAR alpha expression participates in the antidepressant mechanism of reboxetine.

AB  - Centromeres in most multicellular eukaryotes are composed of long arrays of repetitive DNA sequences. Interestingly, several transposable elements, including the well-known long terminal repeat centromeric retrotransposon of maize (CRM), were found to be enriched in functional centromeres marked by the centromeric histone H3 (CENH3). Here, we report a centromeric long interspersed nuclear element (LINE), Celine, in Populus species. Celine has colonized preferentially in the CENH3-associated chromatin of every poplar chromosome, with 84% of the Celine elements localized in the CENH3-binding domains. In contrast, only 51% of the CRM elements were bound to CENH3 domains in Populus trichocarpa. These results suggest different centromere targeting mechanisms employed by Celine and CRM elements. Nevertheless, the high target specificity seems to be detrimental to further amplification of the Celine elements, leading to a shorter life span and patchy distribution among plant species compared with the CRM elements. Using a phylogenetically guided approach, we were able to identify Celine-like LINE elements in tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and green ash tree (Fraxinus pennsylvanica). The centromeric localization of these Celine-like LINEs was confirmed in both species. We demonstrate that the centromere targeting property of Celine-like LINEs is of primitive origin and has been conserved among distantly related plant species.

AB  - Previous literature links maternal pregnancy-specific anxiety (PSA) with later difficulties in child emotional and social cognition as well as memory, functions closely related to the amygdala and the hippocampus. Some evidence also suggests that PSA affects child amygdalar volumes in a sex-dependent way. However, no studies investigating the associations between PSA and newborn amygdalar and hippocampal volumes have been reported. We investigated the associations between PSA and newborn amygdalar and hippocampal volumes and whether associations are sex-specific in 122 healthy newborns (68 males/54 females) scanned at 2-5 weeks postpartum. PSA was measured at gestational week 24 with the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire Revised 2 (PRAQ-R2). The associations were analyzed with linear regression controlling for confounding variables. PSA was associated positively with left amygdalar volume in girls, but no significant main effect was found in the whole group or in boys. No significant main or sex-specific effect was found for hippocampal volumes. Although this was an exploratory study, the findings suggest a sexually dimorphic association of mid-pregnancy PSA with newborn amygdalar volumes.

AB  - Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is transmitted by insect vectors Nephotettix virescens and Nephotettix cincticeps (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) that threatens rice yield and results in substantial economic losses. RDV induces two volatiles ((E)-beta-caryophyllene (EBC) and 2-heptanol) to emit from RDV-infected rice plants. However, the effects of the two volatiles on the olfactory behavior of both non-viruliferous and viruliferous N. virescens are unknown, and whether the two volatiles could facilitate the spread and dispersal of RDV remains elusive. Combining the methods of insect behavior, chemical ecology, and molecular biology, we found that EBC and 2-heptanol influenced the olfactory behavior of non-viruliferous and viruliferous N. virescens, independently. EBC attracted non-viruliferous N. virescens towards RDV-infected rice plants, promoting virus acquisition by non-viruliferous vectors. The effect was confirmed by using oscas1 mutant rice plants (repressed EBC synthesis), but EBC had no effects on viruliferous N. virescens. 2-heptanol did not attract or repel non-viruliferous N. virescens. However, spraying experiments showed that 2-heptanol repelled viruliferous N. virescens to prefer RDV-free rice plants, which would be conducive to the transmission of the virus. These novel results reveal that rice plant volatiles modify the behavior of N. virescens vectors to promote RDV acquisition and transmission. They will provide new insights into virus-vector-plant interactions, and promote the development of new prevention and control strategies for disease management.

AB  - Simple Summary Titanium is one of the most commonly used biomaterials for implantation as a part of the orthopedic procedures. However, this biomaterial can cause an excessive inflammatory response, even leading to rejection of the implant. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the overall organism response after insertion of Ti implant and the activity of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), to evaluate the possible negative effect of this biomaterial on the host cells. Our study revealed that insertion of the Ti implant did not evoke systemic inflammatory response or activation of leukocytes. Additionally, we evaluated the activity of neutrophils and MDM after stimulation with autologous neutrophil products, namely, antimicrobial neutrophil extract and neutrophil degranulation product as two potential regulators of inflammatory response. Antimicrobial neutrophil extract appeared to be a factor causing the decrease of secretory neutrophil response and polarization of MDM towards pro-resolving phenotype, whereas the neutrophil degranulation product acted as pro-inflammatory. Titanium (Ti) is currently the most common biomaterial used for orthopedic implants; however, these implants may cause deleterious immune response. To investigate the possible mechanisms involved in excessive inflammation, we assessed the activity of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) during the insertion of the Ti implant in a sheep model. The study was conducted on 12 sheep, 4 of which were control animals and 8 were in the experimental group with inserted Ti implant. Neutrophil secretory response was estimated at two time points T0 before surgery and T1 1 h after implantation and was based on the release of enzymes from neutrophil granules and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) generation. MDM function was evaluated 5 months after implantation, on the basis of RONS generation arginase activity and morphological changes. Moreover, the influence of some autologous neutrophil derived products, namely, antimicrobial neutrophil extract (ANE) and neutrophil degranulation products (DGP) on leukocytes was estimated. Our study revealed that Ti implant insertion did not cause any adverse effects up to 5 months after surgical procedure. Stimulation of neutrophil cultures with ANE decreased the enzyme release as well as superoxide generation. Treatment of MDM with ANE diminished superoxide and NO generation and increased arginase activity. On the other hand, MDM stimulated with DGP showed elevated superoxide and NO generation as well as decreased arginase activity. To summarize, ANE exerted an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effect on studied leukocytes, whereas DGP acted as pro-inflammatory.

AB  - Background: Under fasting conditions, the pathway converting gluconeogenesis precursors into muscle glycogen becomes crucial due to reduced glycogen reserves. However, there is limited research on skeletal muscle gluconeogenesis and the impact of fasting on gluconeogenic gene expression. Methods: Sheep fetal skeletal muscle cells cultured in vitro were used to study the effects of varying lactic acid concentrations (0 to 30 mM) and 2.5 mM glucose on the expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes after 6 h of fasting. The effects on mRNA and protein expression of key genes involved in skeletal muscle gluconeogenesis were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and western blotting at 48 h. Results: Fasting increased the expression of key gluconeogenic genes, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (FBP2), glucose-6-phosphatase 3 (G6PC3), pyruvate kinase M (PKM), monocarboxylate transporter1 (MCTS1), glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), pyruvate carboxylase (PC), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). The mRNA levels of FBP2, G6PC3, and MCTS1 significantly decreased with glucose addition. Additionally, 10 mM lactic acid significantly promoted the expression of FBP2, PC, MCTS1, LDHA, GLUT4, and PKM while inhibiting phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression. At the protein level, 10 mM lactic acid significantly increased FBP2 and PKM protein expression. Conclusions: This study shows that fasting regulates key gluconeogenic gene expression in sheep skeletal muscle cells and highlights the role of lactic acid in inducing these gene expressions.

AB  - This review describes in detail the morphological, cytoskeletal and gene expression events leading to the gene regulatory network bifurcation point of trophoblast and inner cell mass cells in a variety of mammalian preimplantation embryos. The interrelated processes of compaction and polarity establishment are discussed in terms of how they affect YAP/WWTR activity and the location and fate of cells. Comparisons between mouse, human, cattle, pig and rabbit embryos suggest a conserved role for YAP/WWTR signalling in trophoblast induction in eutherian animals though the mechanisms for, and timing of, YAP/WWTR activation differs among species. Downstream targets show further differences, with the trophoblast marker GATA3 being a direct target in all examined mammals, while CDX2-positive and SOX2-negative regulation varies.

AB  - A large subset of plant stress-signaling pathways, including those related with chemical defense production, exhibit diurnal or circadian oscillations. However the extent to which diurnal or circadian time influences the stress mediated accumulation of plant specialized metabolites remains largely unknown. Because plant responses to physical stress (e.g., wounding) is considered a common component of mounting a response against a broad range of environmental stresses, including herbivory, we have utilized mechanical wounding as the stress stimulus to determine the direct contribution of time of day on the induced defenses of Brassica crops. We analyzed glucosinolates (GSLs) from leaves of broccoli (Brassica oleracea) and turnip greens (Brassica rapa) following exposure to mechanical wounding at dawn (ZT0), mid-day (ZT4), and dusk (ZT8). Several GSLs differentially accumulated and their changes depended upon the time of day at wounding was performed. This response varied considerably between species. In a parallel experiment, we investigated whether diurnal activation of Brassica phytochemicals in response to wounding might prime plants against herbivore attack. Results showed that maximal response of plant chemical defense against larvae of the generalist pest Mamestra brassicae occurred at ZT0 in broccoli and ZT8 in turnip greens. Metabolome analysis for global trends of time dependent compounds showed that sulfur-containing phytochemicals, GSL hydrolysis products, auxin-signaling components, and other metabolites activators of plant disease resistance (nicotinamide and pipecolate) had important contributions to the responses of M. brassicae feeding behavior in broccoli at morning. Overall, the findings in this study highlight a significant role for time of day in the wound stress responsive metabolome, which can in turn affect plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Heterocrossa rubophaga (raspberry bud moth) feed on a range of Rubus species, including commercial berryfruit crops where they are a pest. This study aimed to characterize the responses of native and non-native Rubus species to feeding by raspberry bud moth larvae. In a laboratory environment, in situ headspace volatiles of three Rubus species were collected from healthy plants and those fed upon by raspberry bud moth. Rubus cissoides (bush lawyer), the native host of raspberry bud moth, gave a limited response to larval feeding with green leaf volatiles (GLVs) representing the only new headspace constituents of the infested plants. The non-native hosts, Rubus ursinus var. loganobaccus cv Boysenberry (Boysenberry), and Rubus fruticosus (blackberry), gave strong responses to raspberry bud moth herbivory, releasing a number of unique nitrogenous compounds in conjunction with the GLVs. The nitrogenous compounds were identified as 2-methylbutanenitrile, (Z)- and (E)- 2-methylbutanal O-methyloxime, benzyl nitrile, (Z)- and (E)- phenylacetaldehyde O-methyloxime and indole. The four methyloximes and 2-methylbutanenitrile were confirmed by synthesis. Field collected phenology data showed that raspberry bud moth were active year round on both bush lawyer and blackberry.

AB  - The mitochondrial solute carrier family 8 sodium/calcium/ lithium exchanger, member B1 (NCLX) is an important mediator of calcium extrusion from mitochondria. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that physiological expression levels of NCLX are essential for maintaining neuronal resilience in the face of excitotoxic challenge. Using an shRNAmediated approach, we showed that reduced NCLX expression exacerbates neuronal mitochondrial calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) breakdown, and reactive oxygen species generation during excitotoxic stimulation of primary hippocampal cultures. Moreover, NCLX knockdown-which affected both neurons and glia-resulted not only in enhanced neurodegeneration following an excitotoxic insult but also in neuronal and astrocytic cell death under basal conditions. Our data also revealed that synaptic activity, which promotes neuroprotective signaling, can become lethal upon NCLX depletion; expression of NCLX-targeted shRNA impaired the clearance of mitochondrial calcium following action potential bursts, and was associated both with Delta Psi(m) breakdown and substantial neurodegeneration in hippocampal cultures undergoing synaptic activity. Finally, we showed that NCLX knockdown within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 region in vivo causes substantial neurodegeneration and astrodegeneration. In summary, we demonstrated that dysregulated NCLX expression not only sensitizes neuroglial networks to excitotoxic stimuli but also notably renders otherwise neuroprotective synaptic activity toxic. These findings may explain the emergence of neurodegeneration and astrodegeneration in patients with disorders characterized by disrupted NCLX expression or function, and suggest that treatments aimed at enhancing or restoring NCLX function may prevent central nervous system damage in these disease states.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that play a crucial role in the complex and dynamic network that regulates the apoptosis of porcine ovarian granulosa cells (POGCs). Resveratrol (RSV) is a nonflavonoid polyphenol compound that is involved in follicular development and ovulation. In previous study, we established a model of RSV treatment of POGCs, confirming the regulatory effect of RSV in POGCs. To investigate the miRNA-level effects of RSV on POGCs to reveal differentially expressed miRNAs, a control group (n = 3, 0 mu M RSV group), a low RSV group (n = 3, 50 mu M RSV group), and a high RSV group (n = 3, 100 mu M RSV group) were created for small RNA-seq. In total, 113 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified, and a RT-qPCR analysis showed a correlation with the sequencing data. Functional annotation analysis revealed that DE-miRNAs in the LOW vs. CON group may be involved in cell development, proliferation, and apoptosis. In the HIGH vs. CON group, RSV functions were associated with metabolic processes and responses to stimuli, while the pathways were related to PI3K24, Akt, Wnt, and apoptosis. In addition, we constructed miRNA-mRNA networks related to Apoptosis and Metabolism. Then, ssc-miR-34a and ssc-miR-143-5p were selected as key miRNAs. In conclusion, this study provided an improved understanding of effects of RSV on POGCs apoptosis through the miRNA modulations. The results suggest that RSV may promote POGCs apoptosis by stimulating the miRNA expressions and provided a better understanding of the role of miRNAs combined with RSV in ovarian granulosa cell development in pigs.

AB  - Hydroxyurea is approved for treating children and adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Despite its proven efficacy, concerns remain about its mutagenic and carcinogenic potential that hamper its widespread use. Cell culture- and animal-based investigations indicate that hydroxyurea's genotoxic effects are due to indirect clastogenicity in select cell types when high dose and time thresholds are exceeded (reviewed by Ware & Dertinger, 2021). The current study extends these preclinical observations to pediatric patients receiving hydroxyurea for treatment of SCA. First, proof-of-principle experiments with testicular cancer patients exposed to a cisplatin-based regimen validated the ability of flow cytometric blood-based micronucleated reticulocyte (MN-RET) and PIG-A mutant reticulocyte (MUT RET) assays to detect clastogenicity and gene mutations, respectively. Second, these biomarkers were measured in a cross-sectional study with 26 SCA patients receiving hydroxyurea and 13 SCA patients without exposure. Finally, a prospective study was conducted with 10 SCA patients using pretreatment blood samples and after 6 or 12 months of therapy. Cancer patients exposed to cisplatin exhibited increased MN-RET within days of exposure, while the MUT RET endpoint required more time to reach maximal levels. In SCA patients, hydroxyurea induced MN-RET in both the cross-sectional and prospective studies. However, no evidence of PIG-A gene mutation was found in hydroxyurea-treated children, despite the fact that the two assays use the same rapidly-dividing, highly-exposed cell type. Collectively, these results reinforce the complementary nature of MN-RET and MUT RET biomarkers, and indicate that hydroxyurea can be clastogenic but was not mutagenic in young patients with SCA.

AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) catalyze the ligation of amino acids to cognate tRNAs by consuming one molecule of ATP. Magnesium is essential for the enzymes' activity. Certain class II aaRSs, such as lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) and seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), recognize ATP together with three magnesium ions in the active site. The detailed role of how these magnesium ions facilitate the ATP recognition by the enzyme is unclear. Here, we report analyses of a crystal structure of human LysRS, in which the two enzymatic pockets of the LysRS dimer are in different states. One pocket is vacant of ATP, and the other is in an intermediate state of ATP recognition. Interestingly, only one magnesium ion instead of three is bound in both states. Compared with our previously solved LysRS structures, we proposed the order of binding for the three magnesium ions. These structures also reveal multiple intermediate ATP-bound states during the amino acid activation reaction, providing critical insights into the mechanisms of the magnesium-dependent enzyme activity of class II aaRSs.

AB  - BACKGROUNDTo control subterranean termite pests, chitin synthesis inhibitor (CSI) baits have been widely applied. Despite CSI baits having low impacts on the environment, they require a lengthy time period to eliminate colonies. 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) was proposed to speed up the baiting process as it showed faster mortality than CSI baits. However, the efficacy of 20E has previously not been tested at the colony level prior to applying in the field.RESULTSWe compared the effect of 20E, 20E + noviflumuron, noviflumuron and untreated control using colonies of Coptotermes formosanus. Our result revealed that both 20E and 20E + noviflumuron did not accelerate colony elimination and termite activity remained relatively stable during the observation periods. To determine the limited effects of 20E, we further investigated feeding duration and consumption amount of 20E with different concentrations (control, 100 and 1000 ppm) for 10 days. Termites ceased feeding after 1 day in 100 and 1000 ppm treatment and 100% mortality was observed within 10 days in 1000 ppm 20E, while mortality in the 100 ppm 20E treated group was much lower than that in the 1000 ppm group. Furthermore, no termites molted in the control and termites died from hyperecdysonism in 1000 ppm 20E treatment, whereas about 20% of termites molted in 100 ppm 20E.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrated that 20E may not be suitable as a sole active ingredient to accelerate elimination of a subterranean termite colony, while CSI baits and lower concentrations of 20E may reduce the lengthy time period in colony elimination.

AB  - The IntelliCage is an automated home-cage system that allows researchers to investigate the spontaneous behavior and learning abilities of group-housed mice. The IntelliCage enables us to increase the standardization and reproducibility of behavioral outcomes by the omission of experimenter-mouse interactions. Although the IntelliCage provides a less stressful environment for animals, standard IntelliCage protocols use controlled water access as the motivational driver for learning. To overcome possible water restrictions in slow learners, we developed a series of novel protocols based on appetitive learning, in which mice had permanent access to plain water but were additionally rewarded with sweetened water upon solving the task. C57BL/6NCrl female mice were used to assess the efficacy of these sweet reward-based protocols in a series of learning tasks. Compared to control mice tested with standard protocols, mice motivated with a sweet reward did equal to or better in operant performance and place learning tasks. Learning of temporal rules was slower than that in controls. When faced with a combined temporal x spatial working memory task, sweet-rewarded mice learned little and chose plain water. In a second set of experiments, the impact of environmental enrichment on appetitive learning was tested. Mice kept under enriched environment (EE) or standard housing (SH) conditions prior to the IntelliCage experiments performed similarly in the sweet-rewarded place learning task. EE mice performed better in the hippocampus-dependent spatial working memory task. The improved performance of EE mice in the hippocampus-dependent spatial working memory task might be explained by the observed larger volume of their mossy fibers. Our results confirm that environmental enrichment increases complex spatial learning abilities and leads to long-lasting morphological changes in the hippocampus. Furthermore, simple standard IntelliCage protocols could easily be adapted to sweet rewards, which improve animal welfare by removing the possibility of water restriction. However, complex behavioral tasks motivated by sweet reward-based learning need further adjustments to reach the same efficacy as standard protocols.

AB  - Chrome tanning is the most common method used to produce leather, but its environmental and health impacts have necessitated the search for alternatives that have proved to be challenging. The circular economy, which uses biomasses to reduce and recover waste, is seen as a potential solution. In Morocco, fruit waste produced by juice processing industries is an untapped source of tannins that could replace chrome tanning in a more sus-tainable manner. In this study, a new eco-friendly tanning method based on vegetable biomass has been developed to reduce chromium-related environmental pollution and enhance leather performance. Tanning activities of extracts from six Moroccan pomegranate rind (PR) varieties were investigated, by studying their crosslinking with the insoluble collagen (IC) extracted from a sheep hide, under industrial tanning conditions. Herein, molecular distribution of crosslinkers extracts were carried out using gel exclusion chromatography to follow polymerization degree and crosslinking kinetics during tanning process. Between linear and logarithmic profiles, tannins and phenolics behave differently during the crosslinking depending on their molecular weight. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy exhibits the existence of inter and intramolecular interaction between IC functional groups and extract. X-Ray Diffraction analysis shows the influence of crosslinkers extracts into the triple helix structure of collagen. Scanning Electron Microscopy observations shows the fibrial size variations of crosslinked collagenous structure by varying the extract variety. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and ther-mogravimetric measurements revealed that the thermal stabilities were affected by the extracts varieties origins. Theoretical studies using Gaussian was used as a complementally tool to compare the reactivity and the stability of the major molecules that contributes in the crosslinking process. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to examine correlations between the crosslinked IC and PR extracts' analyzed properties. The data set's dimension was reduced to two components via PCA, which accounted for 69.79% of the observed variability.

AB  - Early life stressors, such as social isolation (SI), can disrupt brain development contributing to behavioral and neurochemical alterations in adulthood. Purinergic receptors and ectonucleotidases are key regulators of brain development in embryonic and postnatal periods, and they are involved in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. The extracellular ATP drives purinergic signaling by activating P2X and P2Y receptors and it is hydrolyzed by ectonucleotidases in adenosine, which activates P1 receptors. The purpose of this study was to investigate if SI, a rodent model used to replicate abnormal behavior relevant to schizophrenia, impacts purinergic signaling. Male Wistar rats were reared from weaning in group-housed or SI conditions for 8 weeks. SI rats exhibited impairment in prepulse inhibition and social interaction. SI presented increased ADP levels in cerebrospinal fluid and ADP hydrolysis in the hippocampus and striatum synaptosomes. Purinergic receptor expressions were upregulated in the prefrontal cortex and downregulated in the hippocampus and striatum. A2A receptors were differentially expressed in SI prefrontal cortex and the striatum, suggesting distinct roles in these brain structures. SI also presented decreased ADP, adenosine, and guanosine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in response to D-amphetamine. Like patients with schizophrenia, uric acid levels were prominently increased in SI rats after D-amphetamine challenge. We suggest that the SI-induced deficits in prepulse inhibition might be related to the SI-induced changes in purinergic signaling. We provide new evidence that purinergic signaling is markedly affected in a rat model relevant to schizophrenia, pointing out the importance of purinergic system in psychiatry conditions.

AB  - Taenia solium cysticercosis is a neglected zoonosis that affects people throughout much of the developing world. The disease is endemic in Punjab state of India and controlling it is a public health challenge. No studies have been conducted to quantify the risk of T. solium exposure from consuming pork produced in the state. A stochastic quantitative risk assessment (QRA) model was constructed to understand the risk of human T. solium infection from consuming pork produced in Punjab. Input data were collected from official records, published literature, active surveillance and specifically for this study. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the influence of the input parameters on the main output probability that any one pork meal is infective (contains at least one viable cyst) at consumption. The probability of any pork meal in Punjab containing at least one viable T. solium cyst post-storage and post-cooking was median 5.57 x 10(-4) (95% PI 1.06 x 10(-4)-1.95 x 10(-3)). Sobol' sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the most influential input parameters on consumption of a pork meal with at least one viable T. solium were the probability that a meal is insufficiently cooked to render cysts unviable, and the proportion of infected carcasses following informal slaughter. Whilst improved sanitation and hygiene can prevent cysticercosis in people, efforts to reduce the prevalence of T. solium cysts in pig carcases by preventing pigs' access to human waste, increasing meat inspection and promoting effective cooking practices are also important to reduce this source of taeniasis.

AB  - Simple Summary: Various rhino and stag beetles are popular as pets, and their large adults are especially attractive. The female Hercules beetle larvae reared in humus supplemented with a thermophile-fermented compost showed improved growth. Feeding with compost increased the concentration of midgut potassium ions, which was associated with the production of a fermentative unidentified organic acid. Interestingly, adding compost to the humus induced the expression of a gene encoding a hemolymph juvenile hormone-binding protein. Our results suggested that a diet containing fermentative bacteria sex-dependently controls the hormonal condition of saprophagous beetle larvae. The Hercules beetle larvae grow by feeding on humus, and adding a thermophile-fermented compost to the humus can upregulate the growth of female larvae. In this study, the effects of compost on the intestinal environment, including pH, cation concentrations, and organic acid concentrations of intestinal fluids, were investigated, and the RNA profile of the fat body was determined. Although the total intestinal potassium ions were similar between the larvae grown without compost (control larvae) and those with compost (compost larvae), the proportion of potassium ions in the midgut of the compost larvae drastically increased. In the midgut, an unidentified organic acid was the most abundant, and its concentration increased in the compost larvae. Transcriptome analysis showed that a gene encoding hemolymph juvenile-binding protein (JHBP) was expressed in the compost female larvae and not in the control female larvae. Expression of many genes involved in the defensive system was decreased in the compost female larvae. These results suggest that the female-specific enhancement of larval growth by compost was associated with the increased JHBP expression under conditions in which the availability of nutrition from the humus was improved by an increase in potassium ions in the midgut.

AB  - A huge number of wild animals - mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, including rare ones, are annually killed on roads of the Russian Federation. Approximate estimates of loss of fauna for areas with a developed network of roads are hundreds (for large predators and ungulates), thousands (for medium-sized animals) and tens and hundreds of thousands (for small mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians). It is revealed that the death rates of animals depend not only on the status of the highway, but also on its connection to natural, agricultural and urbanized lands in different natural zones. On this basis the table reflecting specific indicators of death On n)ads of different groups of animals is constructed. Based on the analysis of foreign sources and data on different regions Russia there are presented materials on different ways to reduce the risk of animal death on the roads the use of protective fences of different heights and lengths, above-ground and underground access systems through highways, etc. The article also discusses the risk of collision of cars with animals, ecological and geographical approaches to the assessment of their death and to the planning of animal protection and constructions for the passage of animals on the roads of European Russia. There are shown modern practical solutions, taking into account international experience, as reflected in the environmental strategy of the "Avtodor" and in the standard developed on the basis of the paper authors' recommendations "Requirement to wildlife crossings on the roads of the state company "Avtodor".

AB  - Leaf spot caused by the fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae severely affects the quality and production of tea (Camellia sinensis) in plantations across southwestern China. Currently, no effective control measures are available, and the damage to tea leaves is also exacerbated by a lack of understanding regarding the epidemiology of the disease. Previous studies have suggested that gma-miR828a is differentially expressed during L. theobromae infection and may target and cleave the mRNA of CsMYB28. In this study, we characterised CsMYB28 as encoding a transcription factor (TF) that localises to the nucleus, cell membrane, and cytoplasm. This gene was found to be differentially and spatiotemporally expressed in leaf tissues following L. theobromae infection of leaves of the tea plant. Altered CsMYB28 expression, achieved by transient overexpression or stable genetic transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana, or transient silencing using antisense oligonucleotides (AsODN) in the tea plant, indicated that CsMYB28 contributes to resistance against L. theobromae. Using DNA affinity purification sequencing, yeast one-hybrid, and dual-luciferase assays, we also identified that CsMYB28 bound to the AATTAATT motif of CsRPP13, thereby activating the expression of CsRPP13. Additionally, degradome sequencing, beta-glucuronidase (GUS) assays, and RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed that miR828a cleaved CsMYB28 mRNA, negatively regulating its expression. The results from transient overexpression and stable transformation studies, combined with AsODN-mediated silencing in the tea plant, suggested that miR828a plays a negative regulatory role in modulating the response of the tea plant to L. theobromae infection. This study demonstrates that the miR828a-CsMYB28-CsRPP13 mediates the response of the tea plant to L. theobromae infection.

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) are two important enzymes involved in the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and other choline esters. Coumarins are biologically active compounds naturally found in the fruit, bark, stems, and leaves of many plants, including Tonka bean, acacia, lavender, deer tongue, apricot, strawberry, cherry, and cinnamon. Coumarin and coumarin hybrids have antitumor, antioxidant, antiviral, anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiproliferative activity. AChE and BuChE enzyme inhibition effects of 12 different coumarin derivatives (Ia-Ih) and (IIa-IId) synthesized and 16 coumarin-selenophene hybrid compounds (IVa-IVh) and (Va-Vh) were investigated. Compound (Vc) and (Vg) showed the most potent inhibitor activity against AChE.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to determine how early life exposure to plant extracts would influence grazing behavior and dietary preference. This experiment used ram lambs (n = 60; initial body weight = 41.8 +/- 3.8 kg, mean +/- standard deviation). Their dams were either provided no plant extract (CON), a seaweed (Ecklonia radiata) extract (10 mL/ram/d; SWE), or an extract of seaweed, chicory (Cichorium intybus), plantain (Plantago lanceolata), lucerne (Medicago sativa), and dock (Rumex obtusifolius; 10 mL/ram/d; SWP). Treatments were provided to the dams starting in late gestation (63.9 +/- 6.5 d before lambing), through to weaning of the lambs. After weaning (94 +/- 6.5 d old), lambs received the respective treatments of their dams until the initiation of the current experiment (66 d after weaning). At the initiation of the current experiment, the lambs were placed into a paddock containing spatially separated strips of ryegrass (Lolium perenne), chicory, plantain, lucerne, and dock, of which they received a fresh break, weekly. During week 1, SWP had more (P < 0.05) scans spent grazing than SWE and CON. Also, during week 1, SWP had a greater (P < 0.05) number of grazing bouts and a shorter (P < 0.05) grazing bout duration compared with SWE and CON. In week 1, SWP had 78.6 % and 167.3 % more (P < 0.05) proportion of grazing scans spent in chicory than CON and SWE, respectively. Concomitantly, SWP had 33.5 % and 59.7 % less (P < 0.05) grazing scans in ryegrass than CON and SWE, respectively. At the observation weeks 4 and 7, the grazing behavior and dietary preference between treatments was reduced, indicating learning occurred by CON and SWE. Overall, these results indicate that early life exposure to a plant extract alters dietary preference to the species contained in that extract and also changes grazing behavior, which suggests that the extract provided familiarity to the plants and thereby reduced dietary neophobia.

AB  - Gallic acid (GA), as a precursor of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) biosynthesis in tea plant, is one of the important components of tea flavor and has various health benefits. However, the mechanism of endogenous hormones regulating GA biosynthesis during the development of buds and leaves of tea shoots is still unclear. In this study, the buds and leaves of five different developmental stages of tea shoots were used as test materials to explore the mechanism of endogenous hormone signaling pathway regulating GA biosynthesis. The results showed that the decrease of D-erythrosyl-4-phosphate content and the increase of shikimic acid content affected the accumulation of GA content during the development of tea shoots. Jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin inhibited GA biosynthesis by down-regulating the expression of two CsaroDEs through twenty-three plant hormone signal transduction factors, such as CsMYC2, CsSNRK2, CsARR-A, and CsDELLA, respectively, which mediated the downregulation of sixteen transcription factors, such as CsMYB44, CsMYB108, and CsC2C2. CsMYC2 and CsSNRK2 co-mediated the downregulation of the expression of CsMYB44 and CsMYB108 in response to changes in endogenous JA and ABA content, respectively, and inhibited the expression of CsaroDE, thereby co-regulating GA biosynthesis. CsMYC2 may be a key interworking site for the endogenous Jasmonic acid and abscisic acid signaling pathways to jointly regulate GA biosynthesis. Our findings revealed the potential mechanism of endogenous hormones regulating GA biosynthesis during the development of buds and leaves of tea shoots and provided a scientific basis for the regulation of tea quality.

AB  - Phytic acid is the major organic phosphorus storage compound in rapeseed. Following oil extraction, the defatted meal is used in feed mixtures for livestock. However, monogastric pigs and chickens can only poorly metabolize phytate. Hence, their excrements are rich in phosphorus (P), which when applied as manure may lead to eutrophication of surface waters. The aim of the present study was to analyze the genetic variation for total and organic P concentration (i.e. mainly phytate) in rapeseed and to compare the results with soybean. Two sets of rapeseed material were tested in field experiments in different environments with varying soil P levels and harvested seeds were used for seed quality analysis. Results revealed significant genotypic differences in total seed P concentration, which ranged from 0.47 to 0.94%. Depending on the experiment, the heritability for total P concentration ranged from 52 to 93%. The organic P portion of total P concentration was above 90% for current rapeseed hybrids. In both sets, there was a significant positive correlation between seed protein and P concentration. A NIRS calibration for total P concentration in intact seeds showed in cross validation a standard error of 0.05% and a coefficient of determination of R-2=0.83. Total P concentration of soybean seeds and meal was between 0.55 and 0.65%, and around 1.1% for rapeseed meal. Rapeseed meal had a twofold higher ratio of total P to nitrogen concentration as compared to soybean which could be considered adverse when the meal is used for feeding livestock.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been significant progress in studying the foraging habitats of bats. However, these studies provide only a limited understanding of their requirements. Metabarcoding allows species-level identification of consumed prey, allowing us to determine their source habitats. In this study, we sampled faeces from three Rhinolophus hipposideros colonies in different climatic zones from spring to late August. Using metabarcoding, we examined how the lesser horseshoe bat diet changes over time and whether their most-consumed prey varies seasonally across landscapes. Our results show that bat diets change seasonally and differ between colonies, often presumably in response to new prey outbreaks. We deduced from the prey eaten by bats that they have varied habitat requirements. While woodland and shrubs are primary prey source habitats, bats also rely on other environments. We inferred that, in particular, open habitats are exploited more frequently than expected, indicating a high degree of plasticity in their trophic habitat needs. Therefore, protecting diverse, interconnected landscapes with varied prey is crucial for their conservation.

AB  - Introduction Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health problem frequently associated with biochemical disturbance and also, with a range of mental health disorders including such as anxiety and depression. Whereas, mercury chloride (HgCl2) is a common environmental pollutant, which is neurotoxic and induces oxidative stress, especially in metabolic disorders like diabetes. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the interaction between hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and HgCl2 toxicity and to assess their far-reaching effect spotlighted on biochemical and behavioral disturbances. By analyzing key oxidative stress markers and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Experimental design was carried out as follow: control group, HgCl2-treated group, diabetic group and diabetic HgCl2-treated group. Type 2 diabetes was induced in a diabetic model via streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NA) injections. For the HgCl2-exposed groups, rats were administered 0.375 mg/kg/day of HgCl2 orally for 45 consecutive days. Additionally, behavioral tests were performed to examine anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and hematological, biochemical, oxidative stress markers were assessed to evaluate systemic and neurotoxic effects. The results showed significant increases in fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic and HgCl2-treated diabetic groups compared to controls (p < 0.001). Body weight significantly decreased in all treated groups (p < 0.05), with the greatest reduction observed in the HgCl2-treated diabetic group. Behavioral analysis revealed heightened anxiety and depression-like behaviors, particularly in the HgCl2-treated diabetic group (p < 0.05). Biochemical assessments indicated significant disruptions in lipid profiles and hepatic and renal markers, with pronounced effects in HgCl2-treated diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Oxidative stress markers demonstrated elevated malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels in the liver, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, paired with diminished antioxidant defences, including catalase and superoxide dismutase activities (p < 0.05). These findings underscore the synergistic role of hyperglycemia and HgCl2 exposure in amplifying oxidative damage and emotional disturbances, suggesting a critical interplay between metabolic and neurotoxic pathways.

AB  - The textile industry, known for its significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, is increasingly active in exploring techniques and technologies to improve its environmental performance. The main tool to calculate environmental impacts is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, which is standardized and internationally recognized. Specific guidelines for the impact calculation of textile products are under development (Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs) for the category of Apparel and Footwear). In this context, this study contributes to the knowledge in the textile sector through the development of a cradle-to-gate LCA of a woolen undershirt produced in Italy. This study shares robust and recent (2021) primary data for the phases of weaving, cutting, and sewing, obtained from an Italian company. Data from previous studies of the authors, as well as secondary data, are also used to complete the inventory. A further analysis is developed to include the use phase as well. The impact on climate change of one undershirt results in 11.7 kg CO2 eq, primarily due to the farming phase of sheep, which accounts for 88% of the total emissions. The impact on climate change of energy used in the wool transformation process has a relatively low impact (11%), also thanks to the partial use of electricity produced by photovoltaic panels, while materials (e.g., chemicals) and transportation have negligible contributions. The farming phase, despite relying on secondary data, is identified as the primary contributor for most of the other indicators. Additionally, it has been found that user habits play a key role in the impact related to one wearing of the undershirt. The findings suggest that further work is necessary in the textile sector and emphasize (i) the need for guidelines, enabling the inclusion of the use phase without compromising the comparability between different LCAs of similar textile products; (ii) the need for improved traceability practices in the textile sector, to enhance inventory data collection on the raw material production (wool fibers in the case under analysis).

AB  - Background Tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is an important economic tea crop, but flowering will consume a lot of nutrients of C. sinensis, which will seriously affect the nutritional growth of C. sinensis. However, there are few studies on the development mechanism of C. sinensis flower, and most studies focus on a single C. sinensis cultivar. Results Here, we identified a 92-genes' C. sinensis flower development core transcriptome from the transcriptome of three C. sinensis cultivars ('BaiYe1', 'HuangJinYa' and 'SuChaZao') in three developmental stages (bud stage, white bud stage and blooming stage). In addition, we also reveal the changes in endogenous hormone contents and the expression of genes related to synthesis and signal transduction during the development of C. sinensis flower. The results showed that most genes of the core transcriptome were involved in circadian rhythm and autonomous pathways. Moreover, there were only a few flowering time integrators, only 1 HD3A, 1 SOC1 and 1 LFY, and SOC1 played a dominant role in the development of C. sinensis flower. Furthermore, we screened out 217 differentially expressed genes related to plant hormone synthesis and 199 differentially expressed genes related to plant hormone signal transduction in C. sinensis flower development stage. Conclusions By constructing a complex hormone regulation network of C. sinensis flowering, we speculate that MYC, FT, SOC1 and LFY play key roles in the process of endogenous hormones regulating C. sinensis flowering development. The results of this study can a provide reference for the further study of C. sinensis flowering mechanism.

AB  - Background Infectious diseases of farmed and wild animals pose a recurrent threat to food security and human health. The macrophage, a key component of the innate immune system, is the first line of defence against many infectious agents and plays a major role in shaping the adaptive immune response. However, this phagocyte is a target and host for many pathogens. Understanding the molecular basis of interactions between macrophages and pathogens is therefore crucial for the development of effective strategies to combat important infectious diseases. Results We explored how porcine pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can provide a limitless in vitro supply of genetically and experimentally tractable macrophages. Porcine PSC-derived macrophages (PSCdMs) exhibited molecular and functional characteristics of ex vivo primary macrophages and were productively infected by pig pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and African swine fever virus (ASFV), two of the most economically important and devastating viruses in pig farming. Moreover, porcine PSCdMs were readily amenable to genetic modification by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing applied either in parental stem cells or directly in the macrophages by lentiviral vector transduction. Conclusions We show that porcine PSCdMs exhibit key macrophage characteristics, including infection by a range of commercially relevant pig pathogens. In addition, genetic engineering of PSCs and PSCdMs affords new opportunities for functional analysis of macrophage biology in an important livestock species. PSCs and differentiated derivatives should therefore represent a useful and ethical experimental platform to investigate the genetic and molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions in pigs, and also have wider applications in livestock.

AB  - Golden Camellias have recently been used as a food, cosmetic, and traditional medicine in China and Vietnam. Forty-two species have natural distribution in Vietnam, of which thirty-two species were considered endemic species of this country. The morphology of leaves and flowers of these species were similar; therefore, their taxonomic identification usually needed experts and the authentication has often been confused among species. Our study aims to describe the genetic diversity and the relationship of six species Camellia phanii, Camellia tamdaoensis, Camellia tienii, Camellia flava, Camellia petelotii and Camellia euphlebia by using three chloroplast DNA-barcodes: matK, rbcL and trnH-psbA. We also clarified the significant differences in anatomical characteristics of midvein and blade of their leaves, which suggested the possibility to use these criteria in taxonomy. In addition, preliminary chemical profiles of the methanolic extracts of leaves from six Golden Camellias such as total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total anthocyanin content (TAC) and chlorogenic acids content (TCGAs) also showed the diversity among them. Interestingly, the discrimination on the catechins profile among six species followed the same tendency with the genetic distance on the phylogeny tree suggesting that catechins (i. e., discriminative catechins) can be biomarkers for the chemotaxonomy of these six Golden Camellias.

AB  - Understanding animal behaviours, such as anti-predator responses, that may affect the outcomes of conservation efforts is important. We developed a measure of boldness and agitation throughout the cage trapping process specific to woylies (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi). The method requires simple answers to questions clearly defined in an ethogram to ensure it is objective and has minimal impact on animal welfare. Across two woylie populations with varying exposure to predators, the measure proved repeatable within individuals, and captured a wide variety of behavioural phenotypes, making it a robust and valuable tool for quantifying the behaviour of woylies and potentially other mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary In semi-arid regions, providing a roughage adapted to water deficient conditions, such as spineless cactus, associated with a source of physically effective fiber, could be a feed alternative for sheep. Five inclusion levels of spineless cactus plus urea and ammonium sulfate to replace Tifton-85 hay were tested in sheep diets with a roughage/concentrate ratio of 70:30. The dry matter and digestible organic matter intake, as well as ruminal fermentation, nitrogen balance, and microbial protein supply, were evaluated. The results suggested that spineless cactus inclusion affected quadratically the dry matter and digestible organic matter intake, as well as retained nitrogen and microbial protein supply. The spineless cactus plus urea and ammonium sulfate improved nitrogen utilization, reducing linearly urinary nitrogen excretion, serum urea, and ammonia plasma. On the other hand, spineless cactus inclusion increased the ruminal acetate and propionate concentrations, while ruminal pH and ruminal ammonia nitrogen were decreased. We recommend a roughage consisting of spineless cactus (plus urea and ammonium sulfate) and Tifton-85 hay in a 41:29 ratio, in order to maximize the digestible organic matter intake and N-utilization. This could lead to an improvement in the productive performance of animals in semi-arid regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of replacing Tifton-85 hay (Cynodon spp. cv. Tifton 85) with 0, 150, 300, 450 and 600 g/kg dry matter (DM) of spineless cactus (SC, Nopalea cochenilifera Salm-Dyck) plus urea and ammonium sulfate (UAS; 9:1) on DM, digestible organic matter (DOM) and indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) intakes, as well as ruminal fermentation, N-balance, and microbial protein supply (MPS). Five rumen-fistulated and cannulated crossbred wethers, weighing 43.8 +/- 5.80 kg, were randomized in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. Isonitrogenous diets (14% crude protein) were supplied with a roughage/concentrate ratio of 70:30. The DOM intake, N-retained, and MPS showed quadratic responses (p < 0.05), with maximum values estimated at the levels of SC+UAS of 414, 438 and 418 g/kg DM, respectively. Rumen pH and ammonia nitrogen, iNDF intake, N-urinary excretion, and serum urea and plasma ammonia reduced linearly (p < 0.05) with increasing SC+UAS inclusion. Ruminal acetate and propionate concentrations increased linearly with increasing SC+UAS inclusion. In wethers fed diets with a roughage/concentrate ratio of 70:30, roughage constituted of a SC+UAS/hay (Tifton-85) ratio of 41:29 is recommended in order to maximize the DOM intake, N-retention, and MPS.

AB  - Introduction Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide, which is essential for a variety of physiological functions in the brain. Previous work has demonstrated the detrimental effects of eNOS deficiency on brain function in male eNOS knockout (eNOS KO) mice. However, the effect of eNOS deficiency on brain structure and any association between these effects and sex is unknown. Methods This study used three-dimensional high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral tests of anxiety and cognitive performance to investigate structure-function relationships in the brain of female and male eNOS KO mice in young adulthood. Results While there were no differences in anxiety-like behavior or locomotion, there was a sex-specific deficit in contextual fear memory retention in male, but not in female, eNOS mice compared to wild-type controls. Moreover, we found that eNOS deficiency induced changes in multiple brain regions that are involved in learning and fear memory including the hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and areas of the cortex. Several of these MRI-detectable neuroanatomical changes were dependent on sex. Conclusion The observation that eNOS deficiency impacts brain structure at an early age demonstrates the importance of eNOS for healthy brain development.

AB  - Key messageCotton plants undergo a drastic transcriptional reprogramming after cotton boll weevil infestation, modulating several defense pathways to cope with the damage.AbstractThe global demand for cotton fiber continues to rise, but pests and pathogens significantly hinder cotton production, causing substantial losses. Among these, the cotton boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) is one of the most destructive pests. To investigate the molecular responses of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) to boll weevil infestation, we evaluated the global gene expression of floral buds using mRNA-seq. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). Infestation by cotton boll weevil larvae triggered a rapid and drastic transcriptional reprogramming, with 1,656 and 1.698 genes modulated after two and twelve hours, respectively. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed significant regulation of defense-related and developmental processes, including photosynthesis, primary metabolism, and cell organization. Transcription factor families such as ERF, WRKY, GRAS, and NAC were strongly affected, highlighting their roles in coordinating defense responses. The jasmonate pathway showed intensive modulation, alongside secondary metabolite pathways like terpenoids and phenylpropanoids, which contribute to plant defense mechanisms. Non-coding RNAs also played a critical role in the response. We identified 921 unique known and novel miRNAs, with 36 modulated by the infestation, and predicted 98,850 putative lincRNAs, several of which were differentially expressed. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying cotton's defense against boll weevil, particularly during early infestation stages, is vital for developing biotechnological strategies to reduce pest damage. Our findings provide critical insights to enhance cotton resilience against herbivores.

AB  - Aims: Perinatal asphyxia is one of the major causes of neonatal death at birth. Survivors can progress but often suffer from long-term sequelae. We aim to determine the effects of perinatal asphyxia on mitochondrial dynamics and whether mesenchymal stem cell secretome (MSC-S) treatment can alleviate the deleterious effects. Materials and methods: Animals were subjected to 21 min of asphyxia at the time of delivery. MSC-S or vehicle was intranasally administered 2 h post-delivery. Mitochondrial mass (D-loop, qPCR), mitochondrial dynamics proteins (Drp1, Fis1 and OPA1, Western blot), mitochondrial dynamics (TOMM20, Immunofluorescence), as well as mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) (Safranin O) were evaluated at P1 and P7 in the hippocampus. Key findings: Perinatal asphyxia increased levels of mitochondrial dynamics proteins Drp1 and S-OPA1 at P1 and Fis1 at P7. Mitochondrial density and mass were decreased at P1. Perinatal asphyxia induced sex-specific differences, with increased L-OPA1 in females at P7 and increased mitochondria circularity. In males, asphyxiaexposed animals exhibited a reduced Delta Psi(m) at P7. MSC-S treatment normalised levels of mitochondrial dynamics proteins involved in fission. Significance: This study provides novel insights into the effects of perinatal asphyxia on mitochondrial dynamics in the developing brain and on the therapeutic opportunities provided by mesenchymal stem cell secretome treatment. It also highlights on the relevance of considering sex as a biological variable in perinatal brain injury and therapy development. These findings contribute to the development of targeted, personalised therapies for infants affected by perinatal asphyxia.

AB  - A major stress factor that can seriously limit plant growth and productivity is the soil degradation caused by salinity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) establish symbioses with most agricultural plants and improve growth under soil stress. In this study, tea plants with and without AMF inoculation under salt stress were investigated with the RNA-seq and the genome sequencing of tea plant, obtaining a positive insight into AMF-colonized involved in the improvement of growth and quality affected by lignin and cellulose synthesis under salt stress. Totals of 1402 and 1915 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in tea leaf with and without AMF under salt stress. Functional annotation analysis revealed that these DEGs were mainly involved in metabolic process, membrane and cell part and catalytic activity function. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched on the cellulose synthesis with AMF or enriched on the lignin and cellulose synthesis without AMF under salt stress. Further experiments verified that the more lignin deposited on the xylem vascular and the sclerenchyma of tea plants after salt stress, and lignin autofluorescence in tea plants with AMF was weaker than that without AMF. AMF inoculation could alleviate the salt stress, which showed in the decrease of lignin and cellulose accumulation. Moreover, the tea plants inoculated AMF increased tolerance by osmotic regulation and protective enzymes. In general, our results provide a more comprehensive insight into the role of AMF in adapting the adverse condition and keep the quality of fresh tea leaves in the northern Tea Area.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the factor "birth type" in lambs on the performance of the meat obtained from them. The studied lambs were of the Ile de France breed and were divided into two groups: the first group is Single and the second group - Multiple. The lambs were slaughtered at 120 days of age, with 4 lambs from each group slaughtered. Samples were taken at 24 hours post mortem from the following muscles: m. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL), m. iliopsoas (IP) and m. semimembranous (SM). The research of the samples for the chemical composition and technological qualities of the meat was carried out 48 h post mortem, stored at 4 degrees C. Regarding the total chemical composition of the meat, no significant difference was observed between the two study groups. There was also no significant difference between the groups in terms of technological qualities (pH value, color, roasting losses, brittleness). Only a significant difference (p < 0.01) was found in the indicator of water-holding capacity between the groups in the studied LTL and IP muscles.

AB  - Background Two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the most important plant pests in the world. Due to increased resistance of mites to acaricides, it is necessary to use other methods such as inducing resistance in plants by natural compounds for pests' management. Polyamins such as spermine are effective in increasing plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stressors. In this research, the effect of spermine treatments in cucumber plants on life table parameters of T. urticae was investigated. Also, top-down effect of spermine and T. urticae on cucumber biochemical parameters was measured. In the experiments, 1, 2 and 3 mM spermine concentrations were used.Results Amongst the spermine treatments, those mites that fed on cucumbers which received 1 mM spermine showed the shortest protonymphal period and higher ovipositon period, fecundity, gross and net reproductive rates and life expectancy compare to control. Treatment with 2 mM spermine lead to the longest teleochrysalis period and shortest range of age-stage-specific fecundity period. In addition, 2 mM spermine lowered intrinsic and finite rate of population increase in T. urticae. The longest larval period of T. urticae was observed in 3 mM spermine. Feeding of T. urticae from cucumber plants increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, electrolyte leakage (EL) level and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity but inhibited catalase (CAT) activity in this plant. Infested cucumber plants treated with 2 mM spermine showed lower H2O2 and MDA content and highest activity of APX and CAT on day 1 and 3 compare to the others. The 3 mM spermine increased H2O2 content in infested plants during the whole experiment as well as non-infested plants in day 5 and 9 only. This treatment induced the highest MDA content and lowest catalase activity on day1, 3 and 5 of experiment in infested plants.Conclusion This study showed that 2 mM spermine was the only effective concentration that reduce cucumber sensitivity to T. urticae. The trend of changes in biochemical parameters, especially H2O2, in 3 mM spermine was abnormal, and this concentration could be considered toxic.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is an obstinate disease that troubles neonatologists. At present, cognitive impairment after HIE has received increasing attention. Synaptic plasticity determines the development of cognitive function, so it is urgent to develop new drugs that can improve HIE-induced cognitive impairment. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced neuroinflammation affects synaptic plasticity. As a SIRT1 agonist, resveratrol has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect, but whether it has an effect on impaired synaptic plasticity in HIE and the potential mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, resveratrol was used to intervene in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) mice, and the effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and further mechanisms were explored through performing neurobehavioral, morphological observations, Golgi sliver staining, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments. We first found that resveratrol improves HI-induced long-term cognitive and memory deficits, and then we found that resveratrol reduces hippocampal neuronal damage and increases dendritic spine density and the expression of synaptic proteins. Finally, we found that this effect may be exerted by regulating the neuroinflammatory response mediated by the SIRT1/NF-kappa B axis. This study provides a new theoretical basis for resveratrol to prevent long-term neurological dysfunction following HIBI.

AB  - Simple Summary: Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is caused by a coronavirus that poses a serious threat to the global pig industry. Black soldier fly is a very high-quality protein raw material that could serve as a functional feed additive to improve intestinal health in piglets. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of black soldier fly extract (BFE) on growth performance, plasma biochemical parameters, antioxidant capacity and antiviral genes in PEDV-infected piglets. The results showed that the addition of 500 mg/kg BW BFE to the diet could improve the intestinal function of piglets and activate the immune system after PEDV infection. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has developed as a global problem for the pig business, resulting in significant financial losses. Black soldier fly extract (BFE) has been proven to improve intestinal growth in pigs after weaning. Consequently, the goal of the present investigation was to explore the effects of BFE supplementation on intestinal function in PEDV-infected piglets. Eighteen piglets were randomly allocated to three groups: control, PEDV, and BFE + PEDV. The piglets in the BFE + PEDV group received 500 mg/kg BW of BFE orally for seven days from day 4 to 10 of the study. On day 9 of the study, six pigs from each group received either clean saline or PEDV solution at a dosage of 10(6) TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. On day 11, samples of blood and intestine were taken for additional investigation. The results indicated a significant decrease in the average daily gain (ADG) of piglets infected with PEDV (p < 0.05). Additionally, PEDV infection led to an alteration of blood indexes and a reduction in plasma D-xylose concentration and villi height in the small intestine, while it increased plasma diamine oxidase activity and small intestinal crypt depth in piglets (p < 0.05). The PEDV infection significantly reduced antioxidant enzyme activity in plasma and the gut, including total superoxide dismutase and catalase, while increasing contents of oxidation-relevant products such as malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide in piglets. Moreover, PEDV infection increased the mRNA expression level of antiviral-related genes (p < 0.05). Nutritional supplementation with BFE improved intestinal histomorphological indicators and reduced oxidative stress produced by PEDV infection in piglets. Interestingly, BFE could significantly promote the mRNA expression level of antiviral-related genes in the ileum (p < 0.05). Overall, the preliminary results suggest that dietary BFE could improve intestinal function in piglets after PEDV infection. Currently, the findings put a spotlight on the role of BFE in the prevention and treatment of PED in piglets.

AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) causes a toxic effect on the central nervous system via poorly understood mechanisms. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that HBO2 inhibits the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) in the brain and increases the level of glutamatergic neurotransmission, thus leading to the development of epileptiform activity in the EEG and tonic-clonic motor seizures. In experiments on awake rats exposed to oxygen partial pressure of 4.65 ATA, the seizure onset latency was determined in animals with intact and inhibited GS. The enzymatic activity of GS was irreversibly suppressed using the selective inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine (MSO). It was found that the development of seizures under hyperbaric hyperoxia correlated with a decrease in the GS level in the brain. MSO accelerated the development of oxygen-induced seizures. The obtained data indicate that the manifestation of convulsive syndrome under extreme hyperoxia depends on the enzymatic activity of GS, a key enzyme regulating glutamatergic neurotransmission.

AB  - Excessive zinc (Zn) is toxic to plants, but the effect of zinc-stressed plants on herbivorous insects is still unclear. Hence, we assessed the effect of zinc-stressed rice plants on its feeding pest, Nilaparvata lugens. The soil-rice-N. lugens system was treated with Zn2+ solution. Sugar content in rice was measured, and the reproduction and trehalose metabolism in N. lugens were assessed. The trehalase activity in rice significantly decreased at 100 mg center dot kg(-1) Zn2+, and the trehalose content increased. The glucose and starch content increased at higher Zn2+ concentrations. The fecundity and trehalose content of N. lugens decreased after feeding on zinc-stressed rice, and the glucose content in the high Zn2+ group was significantly higher than that in the low Zn2+ group. In addition, the soluble trehalase activity of N. lugens significantly decreased under the 125 mg center dot kg(-1) treatment, while the activity of membrane-bound trehalase significantly increased under the 150 mg center dot kg(-1) treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated significantly lower expressions of NlTre1-1, NlTre2, and NITps after Zn treatment. In conclusion, Zn2+ treatment significantly altered the sugar content in rice plants; it also decreased the fecundity of N. lugens, which may be mediated by alterations in trehalose metabolism.

AB  - Hundreds of ant-nest bare-mineral-soil mounds, as well as ant plant litter 'thatch' mounds, are distributed across the sagebrush-steppe rangeland on Goodale's Cutoff along the Oregon Trail near Arco, Idaho, adjacent to the northern boundary of Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve. US Natural Resources Conservation Service personnel and local landowners wanted to determine if these ants were exotic invasive pests that could damage rangeland pasture and grazing habitat or impact historic anthropogenic artifacts. Four species of native ants, Pogonomyrmex salinus, Formica limata, F. obscuripes, and F. ravida, which are common on the Snake River Plain of Idaho, were collected from different mounds. Another native ant, Solenopsis molesta, was foraging around the perimeter of one thatch mound. Additionally, a subterranean termite, Reticulitermes tibialis, common in the western United States and widespread within Idaho rangelands and mountains, was found foraging within both types of ant mounds. This study provides insight into ant and subterranean termite activity on the Snake River Plain.

AB  - Simple Summary: Climate change presents significant nutritional challenges to animal breeding, demanding resilience and efficiency for survival and productivity. In this study, we investigated the effects of body reserves dynamics (mobilization and accretion) on the production and reproduction parameters of fat-tailed Barbarine and thin-tailed Queue Fine de l'Ouest ewes over two production cycles under semi-intensive conditions. The results show that all reproductive traits were similar among breeds; however, they depend on ewes' body reserves. Similarly, lambs' growth parameters depend on ewes' body condition scores (BCSs) at lambing and weaning, with higher growth for ewes with BCS > 2 at lambing. In conclusion, regardless of the breed, ewes have evolved adaptive mechanisms by mobilizing body reserves to effectively cope with environmental challenges and successfully rear their offspring. Additionally, to sustain a high growth rate in offspring, it is advisable to carefully plan the flock nutritional needs during the suckling period. Under climate change, animal breeding faces severe nutritional challenges, exhibiting their resilience and efficiency to survive and produce. The animals' robustness can be evaluated through the use and reconstitution of body reserves (BR). This study investigated the dynamics of ewes' BR, measured through body weight (BW) and the body condition score (BCS), and their effect on production performances of 480 ewes belonging to fat-tailed Barbarine (BB) and thin-tailed Queue Fine de l'Ouest (QFO) ewes over two consecutive years. The BW and BCS were recorded across physiological stages. Reproductive parameters and lambs' growth were calculated. For both years and breeds, the decrease in the BCS between mating and lambing showed BR mobilization to balance nutritional restrictions, which continues until suckling; after weaning, a BR accretion was noted. The lambs' birth weight was similar regardless of the dams' BCS at lambing, though it was lower in the second year (3.5 vs. 4 kg). Lambs' growth parameters depended on ewes' BCS at lambing and weaning. Fertility rates changed with BCS changes and the higher values (80%) were recorded for ewes with BCSs between 2 and 2.5. However, prolificacy was similar for both breeds and years (p > 0.05). In conclusion, ewes have developed adaptative capacities through BR mobilization to cope with environmental challenges and successfully rear their offspring. To maintain a high offspring growth rate, it is recommended to plan correct flock nutrition during suckling.

AB  - Golden Camellia species are highly specific to certain soil environments. Most species are only native to calcareous soils in karst regions, except for a few that grow only in acidic soils. Our aim is to elucidate the adaptation mechanisms of the species of calcareous-soil golden Camellia (CSC) and acidic-soil golden Camellia (ASC) to habitat soils through plant-soil nutrient characteristics and their relationships. We investigated 30 indices for soils and plants. Compared with ASC, CSC had more fertile soil, while their plant tissues exhibited stronger Ca, P, and Mn and weaker K storage, which may be important mechanisms for adapting to habitat soils. However, ASC showed a higher biological absorption coefficient (BAC) for nutrients, which may contribute to the adaptation of ASC to relatively barren acidic soils. Both CSC and ASC showed much higher BAC and accumulation of Ca than other nutrients. We also found that the concentrations of nutrients in the different tissues varied considerably between species. Correlation analysis revealed 135 significant relationships between the 30 indices, with the soil pH and soil Ca levels being the most important factors influencing the nutrient uptake network. This information helps in understanding the adaptation mechanisms of karst plants to habitat soils.

AB  - Robust segmentation of large and complex conjoined tree structures in 3-D is a major challenge in computer vision. This is particularly true in computational biology, where we often encounter large data structures in size, but few in number, which poses a hard problem for learning algorithms. We show that merging multiscale opening with geodesic path propagation, can shed new light on this classic machine vision challenge, while circumventing the learning issue by developing an unsupervised visual geometry approach (digital topology/morphometry). The novelty of the proposed MSO-GP method comes from the geodesic path propagation being guided by a skeletonization of the conjoined structure that helps to achieve robust segmentation results in a particularly challenging task in this area, that of artery-vein separation from non- contrast pulmonary computed tomography angiograms. This is an important first step in measuring vascular geometry to then diagnose pulmonary diseases and to develop image-based phenotypes. We first present proof- of-concept results on synthetic data, and then verify the performance on pig lung and human lung data with less segmentation time and user intervention needs than those of the competing methods.

AB  - Airway inflammation in asthma is managed with anti-inflammatory steroids such as dexamethasone (DEX). However, about 20% of asthmatics do not respond to this therapy and are classified as steroid-resistant. Currently, no effective therapy is available for steroid-resistant asthma. This work therefore evaluated the effect of a plant sterol, stigmasterol (STIG), and stigmasterol-dexamethasone combination (STIG+DEX) in LPS-ovalbumin-induced steroid-resistant asthma in Guinea pigs. To do this, the effect of drugs on inflammatory features such as airway hyperreactivity and histopathology of lung tissue was evaluated. Additionally, the possible pathway of drug action was assessed by measuring events such neutrophil levels, oxidative and nitrative stress, and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) levels. STIG alone did not affect inflammatory features, although it caused some changes in the molecular events associated with steroid-resistant asthma. However, STIG+DEX caused significant modulation of inflammatory features by protecting against destruction of lung tissue. The modulation of inflammatory features was associated with significant inhibition of neutrophilia and oxidative and nitrative stress, decrease in HDAC2, and increase in IL-17 levels that are usually associated with steroid-resistant asthma. Our findings show that although STIG and DEX individually do not protect against steroid-resistant asthma, their coadministration results in significant modulation of inflammatory features and the associated molecular events that lead to steroid-resistant asthma.

AB  - This study proposes a novel method for the rapid detection of compost moisture content. The effects of the test frequency (1 to 100 kHz), compost moisture content (5% to 35%), temperature (25 to 65 degrees C), and bulk density (665.6 to 874.3 kg/m3) on the dielectric properties (the dielectric constant e' and the loss factor epsilon'' ) in the compost consisting of fresh sheep and manure corn were investigated. The mechanism for the change in dielectric properties was analyzed. The feature variables of dielectric parameters (epsilon', epsilon'' , and the combination of epsilon' and epsilon'' ) were selected using principal component analysis (PCA), and the selected characteristic variables and the full-frequency variables were used to perform support vector machine regression (SVR) modeling. The results revealed that the increase in both temperature and bulk density in the frequency band from 1 to 100 kHz increased epsilon' and epsilon'' . The PCA-SVR model with both epsilon' and epsilon'' combined variables achieved the best results, with a prediction set coefficient of determination of 0.9877 and a root mean square error of 0.0026. In conclusion, the method of predicting the moisture content based on the dielectric properties of compost is feasible.

AB  - Damage to the margin and surface of fossil leaves has been used to identify the likely insect groups involved and to track potential changes in insect communities through evolutionary time. The Anglesea fossil site in Victoria, Australia, has a rich array of fossil leaves preserved in clay and clay-sand through six fossil lenses dated at late middle Eocene, similar to 40 Ma. Examination of a large number of fossil leaves and comparison to Northern Hemisphere fossils and modern damage has resulted in 12 with unique margin excisions postulated to be caused by megachilid leaf-cutter bees. Such findings precede the current dated megachilid phylogeny by similar to 24 million years. This study aims to draw attention to this discrepancy which may have implications for the understanding of megachilid dispersal events into Australia.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent forms of mental illness also affecting older adults. Recent evidence suggests a relationship between MDD and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson?s disease (PD). Individuals with PD have a predisposition to developing MDD, and both neurobiological conditions are associated with oxidative stress. Thus, we conducted this study to investigate depressive-like behavior and oxidative stress parameters using both animal models of PD and stress. Adult Wistar rats were subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol by 40 days and then it was used 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) as a model of PD, into the striatum. The experimental groups were: Control + Sham, Stress + Sham, Control+6-OHDA, and Stress+6-OHDA. Depressive like-behavior was evaluated by the forced swimming test (FST) and spontaneous locomotor activity by open-field test. Oxidative stress parameters were measured in the striatum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The results showed effects to increase immobility and decrease climbing times in the FST in Stress + Sham, Control+6-OHDA, and Stress+6-OHDA groups. The number of crossings and rearings were decreased in the Stress+6-OHDA group. The lipid peroxidation was increased in the PFC of Stress + Sham, and the hippocampus and striatum of Stress + Sham and Control+6-OHDA groups. Carbonyl protein levels increased in the PFC of Stress + Sham and striatum in Control+6-OHDA. Nitrite/Nitrate concentration was elevated in the PFC of Stress + Sham, in the hippocampus of Control+6-OHDA, the striatum of Stress + Sham, and Control+6-OHDA groups. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was increased in the PFC and hippocampus of Stress + Sham and Control+6-OHDA groups. The activity of catalase decreased in the PFC of the Stress + Sham group. The activity of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) was decreased in the PFC of the Stress + Sham group, in the hippocampus of Stress + Sham and Control+6-OHDA groups, and the striatum of Control+6-OHDA group. These findings suggest that both stress and 6-OHDA induce depressive-like behavior and oxidative stress in the brain. The joining models have little evidence of the effects. Thus these findings suggest that other pathways are involved in the common point of the pathophysiology of PD and MDD.

AB  - Squalene is the major unsaponifiable component of virgin olive oil, the fat source of the Mediterranean diet. To evaluate its effect on the hepatic transcriptome, RNA sequencing was carried out in two groups of male Large White x Landrace pigs developing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis by feeding them a high fat/cholesterol/fructose and methionine and choline-deficient steatotic diet or the same diet with 0.5% squalene. Hepatic lipids, squalene content, steatosis, activity (ballooning + inflammation), and SAF (steatosis + activity + fibrosis) scores were analyzed. Pigs receiving the latter diet showed hepatic squalene accumulation and twelve significantly differentially expressed hepatic genes (log2 fold change < 1.5 or <1.5) correlating in a gene network. These pigs also had lower hepatic triglycerides and lipid droplet areas and higher cellular ballooning. Glutamyl aminopeptidase (ENPEP) was correlated with triglyceride content, while alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), neutralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 3 (NEURL3), 20-50-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein (OASL), and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 1B (PPP1R1B) were correlated with activity reflecting inflammation and ballooning, and NEURL3 with the SAF score. AFP, ENPEP, and PPP1R1B exhibited a remarkably strong discriminant power compared to those pathological parameters in both experimental groups. Moreover, the expression of PPP1R1B, TMEM45B, AFP, and ENPEP followed the same pattern in vitro using human hepatoma (HEPG2) and mouse liver 12 (AML12) cell lines incubated with squalene, indicating a direct effect of squalene on these expressions. These findings suggest that squalene accumulated in the liver is able to modulate gene expression changes that may influence the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

AB  - Skeletal muscle is the major tissue for metabolic activity in the body and performs a variety of physiological functions. Among these, muscle fiber types are decisive in muscle function and meat quality. Numerous studies have shown that natural products can affect the development of skeletal muscle, regulate the formation of muscle fibers, and impact muscle function under physiological or pathological conditions. Baicalin, a natural flavonoid compound mainly derived from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis, has been reported to affect glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. However, the role of baicalin in the conversion of skeletal muscle fiber types and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of baicalin on skeletal muscle fiber conversion in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiment used C2C12 cells as a model, with a baicalin treatment concentration of 125 mu M; the in vivo experiment used C57BL/6J mice and weaned piglets as the models. The results showed that baicalin could participate in the remodeling of skeletal muscle fibers, promoting the conversion from glycolytic fibers to oxidative fibers in mice and pigs. This was evidenced by increased protein and mRNA expression levels of genes related to oxidative fibers, upregulated SDH enzyme activity, and mitochondrial complex expression in vivo and in vitro, while the protein and mRNA expression levels of genes related to glycolytic fibers were decreased, and LDH enzyme activity was downregulated. Mechanistic studies revealed that baicalin, as a small molecule, could target and bind to the p38 MAPK protein, increase its expression and phosphorylation levels, and activate the p38 MAPK/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway. Collectively, these data showed that baicalin induced a shift in skeletal muscle fiber composition from glycolytic to oxidative myofibers by activating the p38 MAPK/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway, thereby affecting the meat quality.

AB  - Northern Shaanxi is important in understanding the ancient use and northward spread of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum). Nonetheless, due to the lack of millet remains, AMS radiocarbon data, and environmental background, the emergence, crop structure, and environmental factors of millet use in northern Shaanxi remain ambiguous. To address this knowledge gap, a systematic survey was conducted along the Beiluo River. Forty-two relic units at 19 Neolithic sites were selected for analysis through phytolith, AMS radiocarbon dating, and spatio-temporal approaches. Phytolith and AMS radiocarbon dating analyses traced the utilization of millets in the Beiluo River to 6280 cal. BP. In addition, broomcorn millet was more prevalent than foxtail millet during the Neolithic period, although the prevalence of the latter increased during the late Longshan period. Spatio-temporal analysis demonstrated that millets initially appeared in the Beiluo River during the Yangshao period, gradually moving away during the Longshan period, which was probably first related to the nearest rivers and then the spread of cattle and sheep. However, the millet cultivation altitude remained at 1400 m throughout the Yangshao and Longshan periods. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for the use and northward spread of millets in northwest China.

AB  - Obesity is a growing public health concern that significantly impacts cognitive functions, including memory. This research explores how a high-fat diet affects short-term memory, employing the novel object recognition (NOR) test and NMR-based metabolomics to elucidate metabolic alterations in the brain and adipose tissue. The zebrafish were divided into two groups: one receiving a standard diet (SD) and the other a high-fat diet (HFD). Body mass index (BMI) was assessed every two weeks for a period of eight weeks. The NOR test was used to determine the discrimination index (DI) for evaluating the short-term memory of the SD and HFD groups. NMR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the metabolites in brain and adipose tissues, and multivariate data analysis was conducted to discover significant metabolic alterations. The high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in a significant increase in body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.0001) compared to the standard diet (SD) group from week 4 to week 8. A significant reduction in the discrimination index (24.95 %) in the HFD group against the SD group suggests a decline in memory performance among HFD subjects. NMR-based metabolomics of adipose tissue revealed that linoleic acid and caprylic acid were consistently found to exhibit increased levels in the HFD group across all assessments, whereas lauric acid, ALA, EPA, and DHA were consistently present at elevated levels in the adipose tissue of the SD group. NMR-based metabolomics of the brain identified GABA, taurine, and histamine as the key metabolites distinguishing the HFD from the SD group in female zebrafish. For male zebrafish brains, taurine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan were identified as the most significant metabolites for differentiating between HFD and SD. These metabolites demonstrated a notable decrease in the HFD group relative to the SD group. The results of this study align with those of previously reported studies in rodents and humans, indicating that memory impairment associated with obesity may stem from neuroinflammation and changes in synaptic plasticity. This research provides insights into the molecular changes in adipose tissue and the brain that occur when individuals receive a high-fat diet (HFD), which may enhance our understanding of the link between obesity and memory impairment, ultimately leading to a better comprehension of the disease.

AB  - The impact of kinase inhibitors on the phosphoproteome has been rarely investigated at a whole-organism level. Here, we performed a phosphoproteomic analysis in embryonic zebrafish to identify the signaling pathways perturbed by ErbB receptor tyrosine-protein kinase inhibitors gefitinib, lapatinib, and AG1478 at the organism level. The phosphorylation of proteins associated with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Notch, Hippo/Yap, and beta-catenin signaling pathways was differentially regulated by the ErbB inhibitors. Gene set enrichment analyses indicated differential neurological and myocardial phenotypes of different ErbB inhibitors. To assess the neurological and myocardial effects, motility and ventricle growth assays were performed with inhibitor-treated embryos. The treatment with the inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK, and Notch signaling pathways, along with the ErbB inhibitors AG1478 and lapatinib, perturbed the overall movement and ventricle wall growth of zebrafish embryos. Taken together, these results indicate that inhibitors with overlapping primary targets can affect different signaling pathways while eliciting similar physiological phenotypes.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as competing endogenous RNAs and play significant roles in porcine embryo development. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the uterine fluid (UF) can target and deliver maternal endometrial signalling molecules to embryonic trophoblast cells, exerting crucial regulatory effects during embryo implantation. However, the specific roles of lncRNAs carried by UF-EVs during the embryo implantation period have not been thoroughly reported in the literature. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing and biological tools were applied to analyse lncRNAs in UF-EVs on days 9, 12, and 15 of pregnancy to identify key regulatory lncRNAs in UF-EVs during the porcine embryonic implantation period and to explore their expression patterns and functional roles. A total of 30,203 lncRNAs were identified and 7879 differentially expressed lncRNAs were screened, and qRT-PCR was used to verify the sequencing data. Days 9-12 of pregnancy represent a critical stage of embryo implantation characterised by substantial morphological changes in porcine embryos. During this period, we identified a total of 4348 differentially expressed lncRNAs. Through screening and validation, we discovered that LNC_026212 was highly expressed on day 12 of pregnancy and can promote the proliferation and migration of porcine trophoblast cells (PTr cells). These novel findings contribute to our understanding of the impact of lncRNAs on porcine reproductive processes, offering new research directions to improve the success rate of embryo implantation in pigs.

AB  - The aim of this research was to investigate the influence of dietary humic substances on growth efficiency, faeces indicators, and the bacteriological composition of faeces in piglets. Twenty-four crossbred young pigs (Slovakian White x Landrace) in total were allotted into two groups: the experimental and the control groups. They were fed a diet with humic substances supplemented at 0.5% in the experimental group. In this study, there were no significant differences in the monitored production indicators of piglets. The addition of humic substances increased the dry matter of faeces in the experimental group (P < 0.001). Other indicators in the faeces samples were not significantly affected by dietary treatment. We observed a significant decrease in the counts of coliform bacteria in the faeces (P < 0.05) of the experimental group. The results also showed a tendency to increase the counts of the lactic acid bacteria and a decrease in the counts of the Enterobacteriaceae in the piglets' experimental group compared to the control group. A decrease in coliform bacteria counts in the faeces of experimental animals showed a positive effect on the microbiota in the intestine. It was concluded that the addition of humic substances to the diet of piglets could have a positive impact on gut flora without having a negative effect on production performance or other fecal characteristics.

AB  - Simple Summary The increase in waste in the environment due to anthropogenic activities has a strong negative effect on the health of the Earth. Heavy metals are the most important cause of environmental pollution, and they enter into the food chain with a severe negative impact on human and animal health. The presence of heavy metals in milk probably indicates the chronic exposure of animals to these elements, suggesting the usefulness of this biological matrix as an indicator of heavy metal contamination. Therefore, the evaluation of heavy metal concentrations in milk can be a useful tool to monitor the exposure to environmental pollutions and to safeguard the security of both human and animal health status and welfare. Background: Heavy metals are toxic, non-biodegradable substances able to enter the food chain of cows and then transfer to their milk. This study investigated the relationship between the heavy metal concentrations in serum and milk and the environmental pollutants exposure at two different farms in Ragusa, Italy. Methods: To evaluate the concentrations of aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb), milk and serum samples were collected from 40 Friesian dairy cows from farm 1 at about 3.7 km from an industrial area (group 1) and 40 Friesian dairy cows from farm 2 at about 400 mt from a greenhouse and 6.0 km from a chemical fertilizer factory (group 2). Results: The concentrations of heavy metals measured in serum and milk showed no statistically significant differences between group 1 and group 2. No significant correlation between heavy metals in serum and milk in group 1 was observed. A positive correlation between Zn concentrations measured in milk and serum samples was observed in group 2 (r = 0.35, p = 0.03). Conclusions: The determination of heavy metals in serum and milk can be an important tool to detect the exposure to environmental pollutants and in monitoring the hygienic state of the environment in which milk is produced.

AB  - Uniparental incubating birds must resolve the trade-off between self-maintenance and incubation. This balance manifests through diverse incubation behaviours that vary significantly among species and geographic regions. However, limited research has examined the variability of incubation behaviours across species and regions. Using Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models, we investigated how three incubation behaviours (off-bout frequency, off-bout duration and incubation constancy) vary with latitude across 201 uniparental incubating bird species. Our findings reveal distinct incubation strategies adopted by uniparental birds across latitudes. Species at lower latitudes exhibit fewer off-bouts and, meanwhile, have longer off-bout durations. Conversely, those at higher latitudes exhibit more frequent but shorter off-bouts. Notably, a clear latitude-dependent pattern emerges in incubation constancy, with higher latitudes showing greater incubation constancy. Additionally, smaller-bodied birds tend to take more frequent off-bouts. Significant variations in off-bout frequency were observed across different habitats. Herbivorous species, in particular, show higher incubation constancy compared to omnivorous and carnivorous birds. These findings offer valuable insights into the association of latitudinal variation with the evolutionary dynamics of life histories in uniparental incubating birds.

AB  - Simple Summary Culicoides biting midges are small biting flies that can spread diseases to livestock. Understanding which animal species midges feed on in nature is important for assessing the risk of disease spread. In this study, we used molecular methods to determine host associations for five midge species. Midges were found to feed heavily on either birds or mammals, with a small degree of crossover for all species. The size of the bloodmeal was found to make a bigger difference in successfully detecting the host than did the digestion stage. These results indicate that species that were found to feed heavily on birds are unlikely to be vectors of mammalian diseases and provide further evidence of the vector status of the mammalian-feeding midge species. Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are hematophagous flies that transmit several viruses of veterinary concern to livestock. Understanding blood feeding behaviors is integral towards identification of putative vector species and preventing the transmission of these pathogens. PCR-based blood meal analysis was conducted on 440 blood-engorged Culicoides midges collected in northeastern Kansas, with 316 (71.8%) returning non-human vertebrate identifications at the & GE;95% identity match level. Broadly, Culicoides sonorensis, Culicoides stellifer, and Culicoides variipennis were found to feed heavily on mammalian hosts, while Culicoides crepuscularis and Culicoides haematopotus fed on avian hosts. The blood meals in all specimens were graded prior to DNA extraction to determine whether blood meal size or digestion status significantly impacted the likelihood of a quality host match. Size had a significant impact on the likelihood of a quality match at grades 3-5, whereas digestion only significantly impacted outcomes at the most extreme grade. These vector-host dynamics have not previously been studied in Culicoides collected in Kansas, which represents a unique tallgrass prairie biome within the United States that is heavily interspersed with livestock operations. Based on these data, the highly abundant species C. crepuscularis and C. haematopotus are unlikely to be major vectors of mammalian viruses.

AB  - Many wildlife species suffer from human-wildlife conflict, especially crop-raiding. Long-term analyses of mortality patterns are needed to assess the efficacy of management strategies that address this issue. We report mortality patterns from necropsies of 498 Asian elephants from 2009-2018 in an area of northwestern Sri Lanka. Deaths were lowest in July and highest in October, a period of peak crop availability. Most (about 70%) deaths were human-related, and males were killed in these incidents more frequently than females. As gunshot deaths decreased, other forms of human-related deaths increased. Additionally, causes of death differed between districts, with more intentional human-related mortality observed in the district with the highest percent of protected land. These results highlight the importance of understanding the long-term spatial and temporal variation in wildlife mortality to effectively address human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - Many zoos use browse and other roughage as feed ingredients and enrichment tools for elephants. Amongst these are bamboo species (e.g. Pleioblastus spp.), which belong to the family of grasses. Bamboo is used in zoos worldwide as a dietary item for many herbivores. The fibrous attributes of bamboo are potentially beneficial in reducing diet digestibility and overnutrition in captive elephants. This study aimed to determine the effect of feeding bamboo on nutritional intake, digestibility and blood condition in Asian elephants Elephas maximus. Four Asian elephants aged 4 to 8 years, fed in two groups of two animals, received a conventional diet (CON) or a diet with bamboo (BAM; 4.5 kg bamboo/animal as fed). In CON, animals were fed sudangrass and timothy hay, rice straw, fresh Italian ryegrass, zoo pellets, carrots, sweet potatoes, steamed potatoes and apples. In BAM, a part of the sudangrass hay, accounting for approximately 20% of the diet on a dry matter basis, was replaced with bamboo Pleioblastus spp. Dry matter, crude protein, and neutral and acid detergent fibre digestibility were similar between the treatments. The concentrations of serum components, including total cholesterol, albumin, glucose, Ca and P, did not differ between the treatments and were almost within the range of previously reported values. These results suggest that feeding bamboo has no negative impacts on the nutritional status and health of captive Asian elephants.

AB  - In mammals, exposure to low temperatures induces white adipose tissue (WAT) browning and alters lipid metabolism to promote thermogenesis, thereby maintaining body temperature. However, this response varies across different adipose depots. In this study, Hezuo pigs were exposed to either room temperature (23 +/- 2 degrees C) or low temperature (-15 +/- 2 degrees C) for periods of 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 5 d, 10 d, and 15 d. Inguinal fat (IF) and perirenal fat (PF) were collected and analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, transmission electron microscopy, RT-qPCR, and RNA-seq. Following cryoexposure, our results demonstrated a significant increase in adipocyte number and a corresponding decrease in cross-sectional area in both IF and PF groups from 24 h to 10 d. While adipocyte numbers were elevated at 12 h and 15 d, these changes were not statistically significant. Moreover, lipid droplets and mitochondria were more abundant, and the mRNA expression levels of thermogenic genes UCP3 and PGC-1 alpha were significantly higher compared to the control group during the 24 h-10 d cold exposure period. No significant changes were observed in the other groups. RNA-seq data indicated that the lipid metabolism of IF and PF peaked on day 5 of low-temperature treatment. In IF tissue, lipid metabolism is mainly regulated by genes such as FABP4, WNT10B, PCK1, PLIN1, LEPR, and ADIPOQ. These genes are involved in the classical lipid metabolism pathway and provide energy for cold adaptation. In contrast, in PF tissue, genes like ATP5F1A, ATP5PO, SDHB, NDUFS8, SDHA, and COX5A play roles within the neurodegenerative disease pathway, and PF tissue has a positive impact on the process related to degenerative diseases. Further investigation is needed to clarify the functions of these candidate genes in lipid metabolism in Hezuo pigs and to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying the cold-resistance traits in local pig populations.

AB  - Regulated insertion and removal of postsynaptic AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. In Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid (A beta) oligomers may impair learning and memory by altering AMPAR trafficking and LTP/LTD balance. Importantly, Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) assembled from GluA1 subunits are excluded from hippocampal synapses basally but can be recruited rapidly during LTP and LTD to modify synaptic strength and signaling. By employing mouse knockin mutations that disrupt anchoring of the kinase PKA or phosphatase Calcineurin (CaN) to the postsynaptic scaffold protein AKAP150, we find that local AKAP-PKA signaling is required for CP-AMPAR recruitment, which can facilitate LTP but also, paradoxically, prime synapses for A beta impairment of LTP mediated by local AKAP-CaN LTD signaling that promotes subsequent CP-AMPAR removal. These findings highlight the importance of PKA/CaN signaling balance and CP-AMPARs in normal plasticity and aberrant plasticity linked to disease.

AB  - Simple Summary This study attempts to analyse the technical and economic data of Iberian-breed pig farms that operate using two differentiated production models, i.e., the cebo or indoor fodder-fed pig production system where the animals are reared indoors, and the cebo campo or outdoor fodder-fed pig production system where the animals are reared outdoors with access to outdoor areas also during the fattening stage. The paper shows the study of three farms from each system with three batches per farm, where the data are obtained by way of a survey directly carried out with the farmers. Despite the conversion ratios being higher in the outdoor system, they do not translate into a significant increase in feed costs. However, labour costs are higher in the outdoor than in the indoor system. Gross margins are higher in the outdoor than in the indoor system, mainly due to the difference in incomes. Such incomes can vary temporarily subject to market prices. The outbreak of COVID-19 meant a sudden decrease in the gross profit, as the incomes went down and the costs remained at the same level. Crisis situations usually cause a reduction of the retail prices and a decrease in the profits. The current Quality Standard regulating the Iberian pig provides for various differentiated farming systems subject to the type of management implemented and the breed of the pigs. This study attempts to analyse the differences between two of these production systems, i.e., the outdoor and the indoor rearing systems by comparing the main technical and economic factors of six farms, three operating under each system, in order to ascertain the most profitable production system. This analysis is based on the information provided by the farm owners. It also evaluates the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak had on profitability. The results show that both systems spend the same resources on animal feed, which represents nearly 60% of the expense, with the price of purchase of piglets representing 30-32% of the total; however, there are differences in the cost of labour, which is higher in the outdoor variant. In economic terms, outdoor farms obtained a higher gross margin than indoor farms did. Although their production costs are higher, these are offset with larger incomes due to the higher market price of the pigs at the time of slaughter. Lastly, all the farms under study reveal large financial losses on account of COVID-19, given that there was a general decrease in the revenues due to the decrease in the selling price of the pigs, which seems to be the most determinant factor for the economic profits made by these kinds of farms.

AB  - A preliminary checklist of 39 species of lappet moths (Lasiocampidae) is provided for Maputo Special Reserve in southern Mozambique of which three are new to science, Diapalpus smithi sp. n. , Eutricha giustii sp. n. and Rhinobombyx maputoensis sp. n. , and a further ten are new country records. Several taxonomic changes are implemented in this paper: the synonymy of Sena prompta plusioides (Walker, 1862) syn. rev. with Sena prompta (Walker, 1855) is revived, Bombycopsis (Bufoidia) pallida Joannou & Kr & uuml;ger, 2009 syn. n. is synonymised with B. (B.) nigrovittata Aurivillius, 1927, and Lebeda mustelina Distant, 1899 is transferred to Leipoxais Holland, 1893 comb. n. Additionally, it is shown that the neotype designation by Zolotuhin & Gurkovich (2009) for Lebeda morosa Walker, 1865 is invalid although a new neotype is not selected as the original type may still be extant. All species, forms and both sexes where present are figured, as are the genitalia in the case of the new species and the comparative material examined.

AB  - The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is involved in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system. In previous work, we showed that mice lacking constitutive levels of TNF exhibit a reduction in spine density and changes in spine head size distribution of dentate granule cells. Here, we investigated which TNF-receptor pathway is responsible for this phenotype and analyzed granule cell spine morphology in TNF-R1-, TNF-R2-, and TNF-R1/R2-deficient mice. Single granule cells were filled with Alexa568 in fixed hippocampal brain slices and immunostained for the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP), a marker for strong and stable spines. An investigator blind to genotype investigated dendritic spines using deconvolved confocal image stacks. Similar to TNF-deficient mice, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 mutants showed a decrease in the size of small spines (SP-negative) with TNF-R1/R2-KO mice exhibiting an additive effect. TNF-R1 mutants also showed an increase in the size of large spines (SP-positive), mirroring the situation in TNF-deficient mice. Unlike the TNF-deficient mouse, none of the TNF-R mutants exhibited a reduction in their granule cell spine densities. Since TNF tunes the excitability of networks, lack of constitutive TNF reduces network excitation. This may explain why we observed alterations in spine head size distributions in TNF- and TNF-R-deficient granule cells. The changes in spine density observed in the TNF-deficient mouse could not be linked to canonical TNF-R-signaling. Instead, noncanonical pathways or unknown developmental functions of TNF may cause this phenomenon.

AB  - The aim of the present work is the scientific evaluation of an Algerian endemic taxa (Hypochaeris laevigata var. hipponensis Maire) widely used in folk medicine. For this objective, the active compounds, mineral element composition and antioxidant effects of three different extracts prepared from leaves were determined. Essays were started by a phytochemical screening, followed by mineral elements determination and leaf extract preparation using three organic solvents. The concentration of polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, flavanols and orthodiphenols was determined in each extract as well as the radical scavenging activities and the total antioxidant properties. Correlation between bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities was also evaluated. Ethyl acetate extract showed the highest levels of polyphenols while the lowest one was found in raw extract, which contains the most important tannins. However, the lowest rate in anthocyanin was noted in butanol extract. Our data indicated that antioxidant properties varied according to extract type and radical scavenging used assay, indeed the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value ranged between 0.71 +/- 0.02 and 7.00 +/- 0.62 mg/g extract. Several positive correlations between secondary metabolite contents and antioxidant activities were registered. The obtained results support the influence of solvent extracts on bioactive compounds. These phytochemical constituents as well as mineral elements provide substantial antioxidant activities and explain the effectiveness of the studied species as traditional remedy.

AB  - Heat stress is a significant environmental problem that has a detrimental impact on animal welfare and production efficiency in swine farms. The current study was conducted to assess the effect of low-intensity showers, provided during critical high-temperature hours daily, on body external temperature, feeding pattern, and carcass and meat quality characteristics in fattening pigs. A total of 400 animals (200 barrows and 200 gilts) were randomly allotted in 40 pens. A shower nozzle was installed over 20 pens (half barrows and half gilts) where pigs received a low-intensity shower for 2 min in 30 min intervals from 12 to 19 h (SHO group). Another group without showers was also considered (CON). Feeder occupancy measurement, thermographic measures, and carcass and meat quality parameters were studied. In the periods with higher environmental temperatures, SHO animals showed an increase in the feeder occupancy rate compared to the CON group. A decrease in temperature was observed after the shower, regardless of the anatomical location (p < 0.005). The treatment with showers led to higher values than in the CON group of 4.72%, 3.87%, 11.8%, and 15.1% for hot carcass weight, lean meat yield, and fat thickness in Longissimus Dorsi (LD) and Gluteus Medius muscles, respectively (p < 0.01). Pork from CON showed a 14.9% higher value of drip loss, and 18.9% higher malondialdehyde concentration than SHO (p < 0.01); meanwhile, intramuscular fat content was 22.8% higher in SHO than in CON (p < 0.01). On the other hand, the CON group exhibited higher L* (2.13%) and lower a* and b* values (15.8% and 8.97%) compared to the SHO group. However, the pH(20h) of the CON group was significantly lower than that of the SHO group (p < 0.001), indicating a softer pH decrease. Related to fatty acids in subcutaneous outer and inner layers and intramuscular fat, the CON group showed higher Sigma SFA and lower Sigma MUFA and Delta(9)-desaturase indexes than SHO (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the amelioration of heat stress through showers at critical times should be considered an interesting tool that improves both carcass and meat quality, as well as animal welfare.

AB  - The first molecular-assisted assessment of shark and batoid taxonomy in the waters of south-easternArabia was undertaken almost a decade ago, at a time when many species lineages lacked clear resolution. Consequently, only tentative identifications could be offered in some cases. There has been a considerable amount of focus on elasmobranch taxonomy since then, and this has resulted in numerous revisions to species identities and distributions. Therefore, in light of these more recent findings, mitochondrial NADH2 sequences from the original south-eastern Arabia study were re-assessed and taxonomically updated. This resulted in the recovery of 28 distinct shark lineages, of which all but one could be attributed to currently-recognised species. The remaining lineage most likely represents an undescribed Echinorhinus sp., which has been flagged in previous studies. Twenty-eight batoid lineages were also recovered, 13 of which have undergone taxonomic revision since the original study. Although most of these could be attributed to currently-recognised species, certain lineages remain problematic. Consequently, further work is required to provide a comprehensive assessment of elasmobranch taxonomy in the region.

AB  - Galloylated catechins in tea leaves, primarily epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG), possess prominent biological activities. It is well established that EGCG and ECG are abundantly present in tender leaves but are less prevalent in mature leaves. However, the fundamental regulatory mechanisms underlying this distribution remain unknown. In this study, we integrated transcriptome data and catechin component levels in tea leaves from six leaf positions using weighted gene co-expression network analysis. This analysis revealed a positive correlation between variations in CsWRKY12 expression and EGCG and ECG levels. Further investigation using yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays, as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assay, demonstrated that CsWRKY12 activated the transcription of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5, which encode enzymes responsible for galloylated catechins biosynthesis, by directly binding to W-box elements in their promoters. Overexpression of CsWRKY12 in tea leaves promoted the expression of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5, leading to an increase in EGCG and ECG content. Moreover, we found that a VQ motif-containing protein, CsVQ4L, interacted with CsWRKY12 and facilitated its transcriptional function by regulating the expression of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5. Collectively, our findings suggest that the interaction between CsWRKY12 and CsVQ4L contributes to the accumulation of galloylated catechins in tender leaves of tea plants.

AB  - Based on an integrative approach, this study describes a new species of Urocleidoides infesting Schizodon nasutus in the Paranapanema River basin, Brazil. The new species can be distinguished from its congeners by specific morphological features, including the shape of the male copulatory organ and accessory piece, the ventral bar shape, and the shape and size of the hooks. Molecular analyses, particularly of the 28S rDNA gene, suggest a close relationship between the new species and Urocleidoides paradoxus. The phylogenetic and taxonomic arrangement of Urocleidoides is discussed, as the analyses of the 28S rDNA and COI mtDNA resolved the genus as non-monophyletic, with Diaphorocleidus, Rhinoxenus, and Cacatuocotyle nested within it. Additional morphological and molecular data of other congeneric species are required to investigate the phylogenetic position and classification of Urocleidoides. This study underscores the significance of using integrative approaches in understanding host-parasite associations and phylogenetic relationships, contributing to the description of the freshwater fish parasite biodiversity in South America, particularly in the Paranapanema river basin.

AB  - This study explored the relationships between sperm quality and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD, and glutathione peroxidase, GPx) in sperm (S) and seminal plasma (SP) of Asian elephants, as well as the potential protective role of glutamine in semen extenders during chilled storage. In experiment 1, twenty ejaculates from 11 bulls were analyzed for percentages (%) of sperm motility (%MOT), viability (%VIA), and activities of SOD and GPx. A significant negative correlation was found between %VIA and SP-SOD (r = - 0.71), and positive correlations between %MOT and both S-GPx (r = 0.49) and SP-GPx (r = 0.57). Following these findings, glutamine, a precursor of glutathione and semen antioxidant was introduced in Experiment 2. Each ejaculate (in a total of 8 ejaculates obtained from four bulls) was diluted in Tris-fructose(EYT) and Tris-glucose-egg yolk extender (TCG), respectively, supplemented with 0 (control), 20 and 40 mM glutamine and stored at 4 degrees C. Sperm parameters including %MOT, %VIA, functional membrane integrity (% sHOST), and DNA integrity (%DNA) were assessed after 24 and 48 h of storage. Results demonstrated that glutamine did not significantly affect %VIA or %DNA. A significant reduction in %MOT was observed at 24 h, but 20 mM glutamine added in extenders reversed this decline at 48 h. A 40 mM addition of glutamine in TCG markedly reduced %sHOST at 24 h. In conclusion, SOD and GPx activities in the sperm and seminal plasma are indicative of sperm quality. During chilling, using a higher level of glutamine may damage the spermatozoa of Asian elephants.

AB  - Among pinnipeds, southern elephant seals (SESs, Mirounga leonina) are extreme divers that dive deeply and continuously along foraging trips to restore their body stores after fasting on land during breeding or moulting. Their replenishment of body stores influences their energy expenditure during dives and their oxygen (O2) reserves (via muscular mass), yet how they manage their O2 stores during their dives is not fully understood. In this study, 63 female SESs from Kerguelen Island were equipped with accelerometers and time-depth recorders to investigate changes in diving parameters through their foraging trips. Two categories of dive behaviour were identified and related to the body size of individuals, with smaller SESs performing shallower and shorter dives requiring greater mean stroke amplitude compared with larger individuals. In relation to body size, the larger seals had lower estimated oxygen consumption levels for a given buoyancy (i.e. body density) compared with smaller individuals. However, both groups were estimated to have the same oxygen consumption of 0.079 & PLUSMN;0.001 ml O2 stroke-1 kg-1 for a given dive duration and at neutral buoyancy when the cost of transport was minimal. Based on these relationships, we built two models that estimate changes in oxygen consumption according to dive duration and body density. The study highlights that replenishing body stores improves SES foraging efficiency, as indicated by increased time spent at the bottom of the ocean. Thus, prey-capture attempts increase as SES buoyancy approaches the neutral buoyancy point.

AB  - Regular physical activity (PA) is beneficial for cognitive health, and cathepsin B (CTSB) - a protease released by skeletal muscle during PA - acts as a potential molecular mediator of this association. PA-induced metabolic and mechanical stress appears to increase plasma/serum CTSB levels. CTSB facilitates neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in brain regions (e.g., hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) that support performance in specific cognitive domains including memory, learning, and executive function. However, the evidence regarding the role of PA-induced changes in CTSB as a mediator of PA-induced cognitive health in humans is mixed. To guide future research, this article identifies key factors that may explain the observed heterogeneity in the findings from human studies and proposes a PA-CTSB-cognition model.

AB  - The livestock sector contributes significantly to the resource-use and pollution from food systems. Therefore, assessing the current and future environmental impacts of livestock production under different systems in different countries, has become an important area of solution-oriented research in sustainability science. We performed a cradle-to-farm-gate life cycle analysis to quantify biomass consumption (edible and non-edible for humans), land occupation (including cropland), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the use of fossil energy, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides related to beef, chicken, pork, milk and egg production in Argentina, a major producer and consumer of animal foods. We found that in 2016 the livestock sector consumed a total of 157 Mt of biomass (87% non edible for humans), required 66.2 Mha of land, of which 7.01 Mha were cropland, and emitted 157 Mt CO2-eq to the atmosphere (46 Mt CO2-eq from land-use change). In addition, 83 PJ of fossil energy were used, including that for the manufacture of 534 kt of N-P-S synthetic fertilizers and 59.6 kt of active ingredients of synthetic pesticides. However, the relative participation of each livestock group on the total environmental footprints was different, being beef the dominant one for all the indicators. When footprints per unit of protein weight were analyzed, all products had similar values regarding edible-biomass consumption, fossil energy use and pesticide use. However, delivering proteins from beef required between 12 and 28 times more land, and emits 6-34 more GHGs than the rest of the livestock products. The options for reducing such impacts are briefly discussed, emphasizing that solutions have to be tailored based on the management traditions and associated with the country's high ecological heterogeneity.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is the main central nervous system complication of diabetes, affecting the quality of life of patients. Herba Cistanche is a homologous plant widely used as a health food and therapeutic drug. Verbascoside, a signature component of Herba Cistanche, has anti-diabetic and neuroprotective effects. However, it is quickly metabolized by the gut microbiota, and the mechanism of its neuroprotection and improvement of learning and memory remains unclear. We investigated the effectiveness and potential mechanisms of verbascoside on cognitive dysfunction in db/db mice using a 16S rRNA microbiome and serum metabolomics approach. We found that 12-week treatment with verbascoside significantly inhibited insulin resistance, reduced blood glucose and lipids, and improved cognitive deficits. In addition, verbascoside increased the gut microbiota diversity, improved intestinal dysbiosis, attenuated intestinal barrier disruption, reduced the levels of inflammatory factors, regulated the expression of the metabolites associated with cognitive function, and enhanced the central insulin sensitivity and hippocampal synaptogenesis signaling. We revealed that verbascoside induced the enrichment of Alistipes, Roseburia, and Intestinimonas in the gut, suppressed the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella, increased the serum levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, l-glutamic acid, and l-lysine, and decreased taurine expression. Finally, a strong association between gut microbes, serum metabolites, and cognitive performance affected by verbascoside was observed. Our research suggests that alterations in gut microbes/metabolites are involved in the development of diabetic cognitive dysfunction, which is alleviated by verbascoside in the db/db mice through restructuring the gut microbiota composition, ameliorating diabetic metabolic disorders, and attenuating pathological brain damage.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is an environmental metal with toxic effects primarily targeting the central nervous system (CNS). Early-life exposure is linked to long-term behavioral and cognitive impairments. This study aims to evaluate the behavioral effects of Pb exposure during gestation and lactation and investigate the neuroprotective effect of the aqueous extract of Ononis natrix (AEON), a medicinal plant recognized for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, selected for its potential to counteract Pb-induced neurological damage. Pregnant mice were assigned to four groups: control, Pb-exposed (1 g/L in drinking water), and two groups receiving AEON (100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg) by oral gavage alongside Pb from the first day of gestation until the end of lactation. Reproductive parameters were measured, such as fertility rate, gestation period, and offspring viability. Sensorimotor development was assessed using negative geotaxis, surface righting reflex, cliff avoidance, and suspension test. In adulthood, neurobehavioral functions such as anxiety-related behavior, locomotion, memory, depression-like behavior, and motor performance were assessed. We also measured markers of oxidative stress, notably catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA), in the whole brain, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Our results showed that Pb exposure led to a significant reduction in gestation period in pregnant females and considerably disrupted sensorimotor development in the offspring. In adulthood, Pb-exposed mice exhibited pronounced anxiety-like behavior and depressive-like symptoms, along with hyperactivity and impaired motor coordination. These dysfunctions were correlated with increased CAT activity and MDA levels in different brain regions. However, co-administration of AEON improved reproductive parameters, enhanced sensorimotor functions, normalized neurobehavioral performance in adulthood, and restored disrupted oxidative stress markers. These findings provide the first evidence of AEON's efficacy in mitigating developmental Pb-induced neurotoxicity, highlighting its potential as a novel neuroprotective agent and paving the way for future therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Diosmetin (DIOS), a natural flavonoid monomer derived from lemons and present in various plants such as spearmint and spider moss, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiaging properties. Nonetheless, its impact on early embryonic development in pigs remains unexplored. This study aimed to determine the influence of DIOS supplementation in an in vitro culture (IVC) medium on porcine embryo development and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Findings revealed that embryos cultured in IVC medium with 0.1 mu M DIOS demonstrated an increased blastocyst formation rate, higher total cell number, reduced LC3B and CASPASE3 levels, elevated Nrf2 levels, decreased ROS, and enhanced GSH and mitochondrial membrane potential at the 4-cell embryonic stage. Additionally, the expression of proapoptotic genes (CAS3, CAS8, and BAX) and autophagy-related genes (BECLIN1, ATG5, LC3B, and P62) was downregulated, whereas the expression of embryonic development-related genes (CDK1 and CDK2), antioxidant-related genes (SOD1 and SOD2), and mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes (NRF2) was upregulated. These findings suggest that DIOS promotes early embryonic development in pigs by mitigating oxidative stress and enhancing mitochondrial function, thereby reducing autophagy and apoptosis levels.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study investigated how different fish species are distributed in the sea based on where they are relative to the oceanic current region and how deep the water is. Researchers collected fish samples over four seasons from May 2018 to March 2019 along the coasts of the East Sea in Korea. They used special commercial gill nets to catch the fish at different depths, ranging from shallow to deeper waters. Overall, they found 73 different fish species and collected over 6000 specimens. Depending on the oceanic current region, they found different fish species in each study site. For example, in one area called Ayajin, they mostly found fish like blackfin flounder (Glyptocephalus stelleri), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and mailclad sculpin (Icelus cataphractus). In another area called Hupo, different fish species were more common, such as blackfin flounder, Sohachi flounder (Cleisthenes pinetorum), and flathead flounder (Hippoglossoides dubius). The researchers also noticed that the types of fish varied depending on how deep the water was. This study helps us understand how fish populations change in different parts of the sea based on the oceanic current region and at different depths.
   This study assessed variations in demersal fish assemblages with respect to the study site and water depth. Seasonal samplings from May 2018 to March 2019 were conducted along the northern (Ayajin, Goseong) and southern (Hupo, Uljin) sites of the East Sea off the Korean coast, using commercial gill nets. Samples were collected at depths of similar to 50, similar to 80, similar to 150 m across the study sites, with concurrent monitoring of water column structures. A total of 73 species and 6250 specimens were collected. Distinctive fish species compositions were observed according to the study site and depth. Although Glyptocephalus stelleri was the most abundant fish species in both Ayajin and Hupo, Gadus macrocephalus, Icelus cataphractus, and Alcichthys elongatus were most predominant in Ayajin, whereas Cleisthenes pinetorum, Hippoglossoides dubius, and Gymnocanthus herzensteini were more prevalent in Hupo. In terms of depth layer, in Ayajin, G. stelleri dominated in both intermediate and deeper layers, with Hemilepidotus gilberti, A. elongatus, Enophrys diceraus common in shallower depths. Conversely, in Hupo, G. stelleri, C. pinetorum, and A. nadeshnyi dominated across all depth layers, whereas Dasycottus setiger and G. herzensteini dominated in deeper and shallower depths, respectively. Significant influences of the study site and water depth on fish assemblage structures were observed due to variations in water temperature at the seasonal thermocline boundary.

AB  - This study aimed to clarify the therapeutic effect and regenerative potential of the novel, amino acids-enriched acellular biocement (CAL) based on calcium phosphate on osteochondral defects in sheep. Eighteen sheep were divided into three groups, the treated group (osteochondral defects filled with a CAL biomaterial), the treated group with a biocement without amino acids (C cement), and the untreated group (spontaneous healing). Cartilages of all three groups were compared with natural cartilage (negative control). After six months, sheep were evaluated by gross appearance, histological staining, immunohistochemical staining, histological scores, X-ray, micro-CT, and MRI. Treatment of osteochondral defects by CAL resulted in efficient articular cartilage regeneration, with a predominant structural and histological characteristic of hyaline cartilage, contrary to fibrocartilage, fibrous tissue or disordered mixed tissue on untreated defect (p < 0.001, modified O'Driscoll score). MRI results of treated defects showed well-integrated and regenerated cartilage with similar signal intensity, regularity of the articular surface, and cartilage thickness with respect to adjacent native cartilage. We have demonstrated that the use of new biocement represents an effective solution for the successful treatment of osteochondral defects in a sheep animal model, can induce an endogenous regeneration of cartilage in situ, and provides several benefits for the design of future therapies supporting osteochondral defect healing.

AB  - Plants and insects coevolved as an evolutionarily successful and enduring association. The molecular arms race led to evolutionary novelties regarding unique mechanisms of defence and detoxification in plants and insects. While insects adopt mechanisms to conquer host defence, trees develop well-orchestrated and species-specific defence strategies against insect herbivory. However, current knowledge on the molecular underpinnings of fine-tuned tree defence responses against different herbivore insects is still restricted. In the current study, using a multi-omics approach, we unveiled the defence response of Populus tremula against aphids (Chaitophorus populialbae) and spongy moths (Lymantria dispar) herbivory. Comparative differential gene expression (DGE) analyses revealed that around 272 and 1203 transcripts were differentially regulated in P. tremula after moth and aphid herbivory compared to uninfested controls. Interestingly, 5716 transcripts were differentially regulated in P. tremula between aphids and moth infestation. Further investigation showed that defence-related stress hormones and their lipid precursors, transcription factors, and signalling molecules were over-expressed, whereas the growth-related counterparts were suppressed in P. tremula after aphid and moth herbivory. Metabolomics analysis documented that around 37% of all significantly abundant metabolites were associated with biochemical pathways related to tree growth and defence. However, the metabolic profiles of aphid and moth-fed trees were quite distinct, indicating species-specific response optimization. After identifying the suitable reference genes in P. tremula, the omics data were further validated using RT-qPCR. Nevertheless, our findings documented species-specific fine-tuning of the defence response of P. tremula, showing conservation on resource allocation for defence overgrowth under aphid and moth herbivory. Such findings can be exploited to enhance our current understanding of molecular orchestration of tree responses against herbivory and aid in developing insect pest resistance P. tremula varieties.

AB  - Simple Summary Research on the products of local pig breeds is quite challenging as the populations are small, breeders are less educated and it is often difficult to design systematic research in various and usually different breeding conditions, compared to commercial breeds. In this study, we have analysed dry cured bacons, produced from the local Black Slavonian and modern breeds on the small home-made scale, and compared their physico-chemical properties and fatty acid profiles. Results have showed significant differences in chemical composition and fatty acid profiles between analysed pig breeds. The objective of this study was to compare the psysico-chemical composition and fatty acid (FFA) profile of traditional dry cured bacon Slavonska slanina, produced from the authentic Black Slavonian Pig (BP) and modern pigs (MP), using traditional homemade principles. The samples of Slavonska slanina produced from BP had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher fat content (78.32%) than the samples produced from MP (46.47%), while the samples produced from MP showed significantly higher (p < 0.05) protein and moisture content. The samples produced from BP also showed lower a(w) and salt content but higher pH. Determination of fatty acid composition was performed at the end of the production process. The composition of fatty acids with respect to the groups of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids was determined, as well as the ratios n-6/n-3 and PUFA/SFA. The results of fatty acid composition determination of Slavonska slanina produced from BP and MP show that oleic acid (C18: 1n9) is the most dominant fatty acid from the MUFA group (47.02 and 46.25%), the most common SFA acid was palmitic acid (C16: 0) (23.44 and 24.96%), and PUFA linoleic acid (C18: 2n-6c) (10.76 and 9.74%). The genotype had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on the SFA and USFA composition of Slavonska slanina. The ratios PUFA/SFA (0.34-0.28) and n-6/n-3 (31.84-27.34) for samples of Slavonska slanina produced from BP and MP are in concordance with previously published data for different dry cured meat products, and do not comply with the nutritionally recommended values of international health organizations (PUFA/SFA > 0.4 and n-6/n-3 < 4).

AB  - P. multocida B: 2 is a Gram-negative, small, non-flagellated, pleomorphic coccobacillus. It does possess different types of outer membrane proteins (OMP's) which assist in interaction with host cells. The outer membrane protein H (OmpH) of Pasteurella multocida B:2 is a major transmembrane porin that can be used as a subunit vaccine and development of diagnostic kit against hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) because of its immunogenic nature. Pasteurella multocida has economic importance because of endemic and epizootic diseases in domestic and wild animals. This bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen of upper respiratory tracts of wild and domestic animals and birds as well as in livestock . The ompH gene was amplified with in-house designed primers, the amplified gene (1002 bp) was cloned into pET 40-b (+) vector and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells using heat shock transformation method to get expression. The product size was confirmed by restriction digestion. The rOmpH protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography by using His-Ni resins to get desired protein and characterized qualitatively by SDS-PAGE by using His antibodies and western blotting. Once purified the immunogenicity of rOmpH was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The expression of recombinant OmpH protein (rOmpH) resulted in its accumulation in cytosol. The purified rOmpH protein had a molecular weight of 36 kDa and concentration around 0.973 mg/mL. The BALB/c mice group injected with 100 ng of purified rOmpH exhibited significant protection (80%) when challenged with LD50 of P. multocida B:2. From the obtained results it is evident that rOmpH can be used as subunit vaccine against P. multocida B:2 and the purified rOmpH can also be further used to develop diagnostic test i.e., ELISA to screen and assess the immune response of cattle and buffaloes against P. multocida B:2 in developing countries like Pakistan.

AB  - Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), caused by Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), is an emerging and severe livestock disease. Recent incursion and distribution of EHDV in Europe have outlined the emerging character of EHD. Despite its worldwide impact, numerous knowledge gaps exist. A range of inconveniences restricts utilization of natural hosts of EHDV. Here, we show that adult mice deficient in type I IFN receptor (IFNAR(-/-)) are highly susceptible to EHDV-6 and EHDV-8 infection when the virus is administered subcutaneously. Disease was characterized by ruffled hair, reluctance to move, dehydration and conjunctivitis, with viraemia detected from day 5 post-infection. A deeper characterization of EHDV-8 infection showed viral replication in the lung, liver, spleen, kidney, testis and ovaries. Importantly, increased expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6 and CXCL2 were observed in spleen after EHDV-8 infection. Furthermore, IFNAR(-/-) adult mice immunized with a EHDV-8 inactivated vaccine elicited neutralizing antibodies specific of EHDV-8 and full protection against challenge with a lethal dose of this virus. This study also explores the possibilities of this animal model for study of BTV and EHDV coinfection. In summary, the IFNAR(-/-) mouse model faithfully recapitulates EHD and can be applied for vaccine testing, which can facilitate progress in addressing the animal health challenge posed by this virus.

AB  - The psychoendocrine evaluation of lamb development has demonstrated that maternal deprivation and milk replacement alters health, behavior, and endocrine profiles. While lambs are able to discriminate familiar and non-familiar conspecifics (mother or lamb), only lambs reared with their mother develop such clear social discrimination or preference. Lambs reared without mother display no preference for a specific lamb from its own group. Differences in exploratory and emotional behaviors between mother-reared and mother-deprived lambs have also been reported. As these behavioural abilities are supported by the brain, we hypothesize that rearing with maternal deprivation and milk replacement leads to altered brain development and maturation. To test this hypothesis, we examined brain morphometric and microstructural variables extracted from in vivo T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images acquired longitudinally (1 week, 1.5 months, and 4.5 months of age) in mother-reared and mother-deprived lambs. From the morphometric variables the caudate nuclei volume was found to be smaller for mother-deprived than for mother-reared lambs. T1-weighted signal intensity and radial diffusivity were higher for mother-deprived than for mother-reared lambs in both the white and gray matters. The fractional anisotropy of the white matter was lower for mother-deprived than for mother-reared lambs. Based on these morphometric and microstructural characteristics we conclude that maternal deprivation delays and affects lamb brain growth and maturation.

AB  - Therapies involving the use of stem Leydig cells (SLCs), as testicular mesenchymal stromal cells, have shown great promise in the treatment of Leydig cell (LC) dysfunction in aging males. However, the outcomes of these therapies are not satisfactory. In this study, it is demonstrated that the aging microenvironment of the testicular interstitium impairs the function of SLCs, leading to poor regeneration of LCs and, consequently, inefficient functional restoration. The study develops a decellularized testicular extracellular matrix (dTECM) hydrogel from young pigs and evaluates its safety and feasibility as a supportive niche for the expansion and differentiation of SLCs. dTECM hydrogel facilitates the steroidogenic differentiation of SLCs into LCs, the primary producers of testosterone. The combination of SLCs with a dTECM hydrogel leads to a significant and sustained increase in testosterone levels, which promotes the restoration of spermatogenesis and fertility in an LC-deficient and aged mouse model. Mechanistically, collagen 1 within the dTECM is identified as a key factor contributing to these effects. Notably, symptoms associated with testosterone deficiency syndrome are significantly alleviated in aged mice. These findings may aid the design of therapeutic interventions for patients with testosterone deficiency in the clinic.

AB  - Annona purpurea is a species of the Annonaceae family that biosynthesizes more than 50 alkaloids, most of them with benzylisoquinoline structure. Some alkaloids perform defense functions and can be grouped from the ecological perspective as constitutive and induced metabolites. Induced metabolites are expressed in response to changes in abiotic or biotic conditions that trigger plant stress. Few studies have been conducted on alkaloid production as a function of biotic stress. In this work, the response of the alkaloid metabolism of A. purpurea seedlings to infection with fungi Curvularia lunata and Rhizopus stolonifer was analyzed. To determine the alkaloid profile, methanolic extracts were obtained from leaves, stems and roots of control and infected seedlings, which were analyzed by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry. Chemical diversity was determined by the presence and organ-specific abundance and by means of the adapted ecological indices of Margalef, Shannon and Simpson. In addition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), PERMANOVA and paired PERMANOVA were performed. Induced responses with C. lunata and especially with R. stolonifer were found. Results indicate that seedlings have an arsenal of available alkaloids, some of which respond according to the infecting phytopathogen.

AB  - Iron is an important trace element that affects the growth and development of animals and regulates oxygen transport, hematopoiesis, and hypoxia adaptations. Wujin pig has unique hypoxic adaptability and iron homeostasis; however, the specific regulatory mechanisms have rarely been reported. This study randomly divided 18 healthy Wujin piglets into three groups: the control group, supplemented with 100 mg/kg iron (as iron glycinate); the low-iron group, no iron supplementation; and the high-iron group, supplemented with 200 mg/kg iron (as iron glycinate). The pre-feeding period was 5 days, and the formal period was 30 days. Serum was collected from empty stomachs before slaughter and at slaughter to detect changes in the serum iron metabolism parameters. Gene expression in the liver was analyzed via transcriptome analysis to determine the effects of low- and high-iron diets on transcriptome levels. Correlation analysis was performed for apparent serum parameters, and transcriptome sequencing was performed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis to reveal the key pathways underlying hypoxia regulation and iron metabolism. The main results are as follows. (1) Except for the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) content (between the low- and high-iron groups), significant differences were not observed among the serum iron metabolic parameters. The serum HIF-1 content of the low-iron group was significantly higher than that of the high-iron group (p < 0.05). (2) Sequencing analysis of the liver transcriptome revealed 155 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the low-iron and control groups, 229 DEGs between the high-iron and control groups, and 279 DEGs between the low- and high-iron groups. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the HIF-1 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathways were the key pathways for hypoxia regulation and iron metabolism. Four genes were selected for qPCR validation, and the results were consistent with the transcriptome sequencing data. In summary, the serum iron metabolism parameter results showed that under the influence of low- and high-iron diets, Wujin piglets maintain a steady state of physiological and biochemical indices via complex metabolic regulation of the body, which reflects their stress resistance and adaptability. The transcriptome results revealed the effects of low-iron and high-iron diets on the gene expression level in the liver and showed that the HIF-1 and TGF-beta signaling pathways were key for regulating hypoxia adaptability and iron metabolism homeostasis under low-iron and high-iron diets. Moreover, HIF-1 alpha and HEPC were the key genes. The findings provide a theoretical foundation for exploring the regulatory pathways and characteristics of iron metabolism in Wujin pigs.<br />

AB  - Increasing global reports of fluoride (F-) and nitrate (NO3-) contamination in groundwater highlight the urgency of identifying pollution hotspots to safeguard public health. This study investigates groundwater quality in two agricultural regions of Ghana's Birimian province, filling a vital research gap. This study utilized a diverse set of tools, including physicochemical analyses, violin plot visualizations, the Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG), the Water Pollution Index (WPI), health risk assessments, Pearson's correlation analysis, and artificial neural network modeling. These approaches evaluated the key factors affecting groundwater quality, identified contamination sources and hotspots, and assessed associated human health risks. Results revealed predominantly alkaline groundwater (pH 7-9), with F- ranging from 0.0 to 1.5 mg/L and NO3- exceeding 500 mg/L in some areas. The PIG and WPI rated 81.94-94.44% of samples suitable for consumption, with mean scores of 0.54 and 0.51, respectively, highlighting NO3-, pH, and K+ as primary quality influencers. Violin plots showed multimodal distributions in TDS, NO3-, Ca2+, and Mg2+, suggesting complex hydrogeochemical dynamics. Health risk assessments indicated oral exposure risks ranging from low to very high, with NO3- posing a sixfold greater threat than F-. Spatial analysis tied F- contamination in central and southern areas to geological formations, while higher NO3- in the northern part aligned with agricultural activities. Correlation analysis and neural network modeling confirmed the geogenic origin of F- whereas the mixed sources of NO3- strongly tied to anthropogenic inputs. These insights urge targeted remediation and offer a scalable framework for global groundwater challenges.

AB  - Age-related deficits in pattern separation have been postulated to bias the output of hippocampal memory processing toward pattern completion, which can cause deficits in accurate memory retrieval. Although the CA3 region of the hippocampus is often conceptualized as a homogeneous network involved in pattern completion, growing evidence demonstrates a functional gradient in CA3 along the transverse axis, as pattern-separated outputs (dominant in the more proximal CA3) transition to pattern-completed outputs (dominant in the more distal CA3). We examined the neural representations along the CA3 transverse axis in young (Y), aged memory-unimpaired (AU), and aged memory-impaired (AI) rats when different changes were made to the environment. Functional heterogeneity in CA3 was observed in Y and AU rats when the environmental similarity was high (altered cues or altered environment shapes in the same room), with more orthogonalized representations in proximal CA3 than in distal CA3. In contrast, AI rats showed reduced orthogonalization in proximal CA3 but showed normal (i.e., generalized) representations in distal CA3, with little evidence of a functional gradient. Under experimental conditions when the environmental similarity was low (different rooms), representations in proximal and distal CA3 remapped in all rats, showing that CA3 of AI rats is able to encode distinctive representations for inputs with greater dissimilarity. These experiments support the hypotheses that the age-related bias toward hippocampal pattern completion is due to the loss in AI rats of the normal transition from pattern separation to pattern completion along the CA3 transverse axis.

AB  - Ethnoornithology is a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on human-bird relationships and humans' knowledge of the Earth's avifauna. Falconry (the use of trained birds of prey-usually eagles, falcons, and hawks-to hunt wild animals) is one type of human-bird relationship, with its origins obscured in poorly understood prehistoric times. We hypothesized that falconry would have been memorable enough to prehistoric peoples to be the subject of rock art, and that evidence of prehistoric falconry could be found in the petroglyphs of the Persian Plateau. To assess this hypothesis, we visited 13 major rock art sites in the Persian Plateau, and searched for petroglyphs depicting a person bearing a bird on the forearm. We found, identified, and photographed 11 petroglyphs depicting falconry. Most (n = 10) occurred in the archaeological region of Teymareh, most (n = 7) showed a falconer mounted on horseback or elephant, and many (n = 6) included an accompanying trained canid or cheetah. These tableaus suggest that falconry was but one aspect of a suite of human-animal associations developed and maintained by the prehistoric peoples of the Persian Plateau. Based on previous surveys of the petroglyphs of Teymareh, along with other evidence, we assume that most of the petroglyphs we discovered were inscribed approximately 4000 years ago, likely making them some of the oldest remaining evidence of falconry in the world. We suggest that our work indicates that future research on petroglyphs may be useful in further exploring and understanding the relationship between prehistoric mankind and wildlife.

AB  - Multiple physiological processes are involved in the interactions between the herbivore Dioryctria abietella and Pinaceae plants, with a key adaptation being the metabolic detoxification of host plant defensive substances. Moreover, the synthetic insecticides applied to control this coneworm are also shaping genes related to detoxification, such as the uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the resistance of D. abietella to toxic compounds remain unknown. In this study, we present an important UGT gene family involved in the detoxification mechanisms of D. abietella. Combining bioinformatic and transcriptomic approaches, a total of 37 UGT-coding genes were identified from the transcriptome of D. abietella, with 20 full-length sequences that shared high homology with UGTs found in other pyralid moths. These DabiUGTs were phylogenetically clustered into 12 subfamilies, with the three small clusters in the UGT33 and UGT40 clades mainly contributing to the size of the UGT gene repertoire in D. abietella. Expression profiles obtained from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) revealed that over half of DabiUGTs had a broad tissue expression profile, with 28, 28, 31 and 35 genes detected separately in antennae, legs, abdomens and reproductive tissues. Notably, DabiUGT20, DabiUGT25, DabiUGT28 and DabiUGT34 were all significantly enriched in the antennae. Several DabiUGTs had significant expression levels in reproductive tissues, including DabiUGT6, DabiUGT9, DabiUGT24, DabiUGT26 and DabiUGT32 in female accessory glands, DabiUGT15 in male accessory glands and DabiUGT25 in male testes. Altogether, our results identify candidate DabiUGTs for mediating olfaction and reproduction in D. abietella, warranting further investigation into the roles of DabiUGTs in pesticide resistance, odorant detection and reproduction.

AB  - In complex construction projects, technical specifications have to be reviewed in a short period of time. Even experienced engineers find it difficult to review every detail of technical specifications. In addition, it is not easy to transfer experienced knowledge to junior engineers. With the technological innovation of large language models such as ChatGPT, a fine-tuned language model is proposed as an effective solution for the automatic review of technical specification documents. Against this backdrop, this study examines the in-house technical specification documents that are not publicly available. Then, two fine-tuned large language models, GPT-3 and LLaMA2, are trained to answer questions related to technical specification documents. The results show that the fine-tuned LLaMA2 model generally outperforms the fine-tuned GPT-3 model in terms of accuracy, reliability, and conciseness of responses. In particular, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 model suppressed hallucinogenic effects better than the fine-tuned GPT-3 model. Based on the results, this study discussed the applicability and limitations of a fine-tuned large language model for in-house knowledge management. The results of this study are expected to assist practitioners in developing a domain-specific knowledge management solution by fine-tuning an open-source large language model with private datasets.

AB  - Indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Previous studies in airway smooth muscle demonstrated that chronic exposure to testosterone (TES, 40 nM) enhances the relaxation induced by salbutamol and theophylline due to K+ channel increment, without modifying cyclooxygenase expression. This study examines how indomethacin, ibuprofen, and ASA affect K+ currents and the relaxation response to these bronchodilators. In organ baths, tracheas from young male guinea pigs chronically (48 h) treated with 40 nM TES showed increased relaxation to salbutamol and theophylline, which was completely abolished by indomethacin. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that TES increased salbutamol- and theophylline-induced K+ currents, and only indomethacin fully inhibited this potentiation; ibuprofen and ASA had partial effects. The involved currents included voltage-dependent K+ (KV) and high-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. Our results demonstrate that indomethacin exerts a dual action, inhibiting K+ channel activity and PG synthesis, unlike ibuprofen and ASA. This dual mechanism explains its stronger inhibitory effect on TES-enhanced ASM relaxation. These findings suggest that indomethacin may counteract the protective effects of TES, which promotes anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle-relaxing states. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution when prescribing indomethacin to young males with asthma, as the protective role of TES may diminish, potentially resulting in an exacerbation of asthma symptoms.

AB  - The present experiments investigated the effects of repeated amphetamine exposure on neural networks mediating different forms of learning and memory. Different components of these networks were assessed using various functional assays. The hypothesis was that abnormal dendritic changes in nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus mediated by repeated amphetamine exposure would produce impairments on forms of learning and memory dependent on neural circuits relying on these brain systems, and have little or no effect on other forms of learning not dependent on these networks. Surprisingly, the results showed that many of the dendritic changes normally found in the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus following repeated amphetamine exposure were reversed back to control levels following extensive multi-domain cognitive training. Learning and memory functions associated with different neural networks also appeared normal except in one case. A neural network that includes, but is not limited to, the basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens was dysfunctional in rats repeatedly exposed to amphetamine despite the reversal of the majority of dendritic changes in the nucleus accumbens following cognitive training. Importantly, an increase in spine density that normally occurs in these brain regions following repeated amphetamine exposure remained following extensive cognitive training, particularly in the nucleus accumbens.

AB  - The effects of application of calcium-containing natural fertilizer on the functional state of the tea plant were studied. Application of calcium resulted weakening of the negative effects of high temperatures and water deficiency due to an increase in its heat resistance (on average by 30 - 40%), an increase in catalase activity (on average 5 - 10 %), as well as adaptive rearrangement of pigment ratio to increasing the content of carotenoids, chlorophylls and the their functional activity. In general, the more efficient functioning of the signaling intracellular network due to the calcium application provided better adaptability of plants to extreme conditions and more efficient recovery after subsequent rehydration, which in a whole contributed to an increase in shoot growth activity (on average 20%) and an increase in yield by an average of 27 - 33%.

AB  - Trophoblast plays a crucial role in gestation maintenance and embryo implantation, partly due to the synthesis of progesterone. It has been demonstrated that hypoxia regulates invasion, proliferation, and differentiation of trophoblast cells. Additionally, human trophoblasts display rhythmic expression of circadian clock genes. However, it remains unclear if the circadian clock system is present in goat trophoblast cells (GTCs), and its involvement in hypoxia regulation of steroid hormone synthesis remains elusive. In this study, immunofluorescence staining revealed that both BMAL1 and NR1D1 (two circadian clock components) were highly expressed in GTCs. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that several circadian clock genes were rhythmically expressed in forskolin-synchronized GTCs. To mimic hypoxia, GTCs were treated with hypoxia-inducing reagents (CoCl2 or DMOG). Quantitative real-time PCR results demonstrated that hypoxia perturbed the mRNA expression of circadian clock genes and StAR. Notably, the increased expression of NR1D1 and the reduction of StAR expression in hypoxic GTCs were also detected by western blotting. In addition, progesterone secretion exhibited a notable decline in hypoxic GTCs. SR9009, an NR1D1 agonist, significantly decreased StAR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and markedly inhibited progesterone secretion in GTCs. Moreover, SR8278, an NR1D1 antagonist, partially reversed the inhibitory effect of CoCl2 on mRNA and protein expression levels of StAR and progesterone synthesis in GTCs. Our results demonstrate that hypoxia reduces StAR expression via the activation of NR1D1 signaling in GTCs, thus inhibiting progesterone synthesis. These findings provide new insights into the NR1D1 regulation of progesterone synthesis in GTCs under hypoxic conditions.

AB  - (1) Background: Pediatric emergency department (PED) settings are opportune venues in which to recruit parental smokers into tobacco cessation interventions. However, the barriers associated with parents' participation in PED-based cessation trials are unknown. The objective was to explore parents' reasons for non-participation in a PED-based tobacco cessation trial. (2) Methods: We employed the framework method and conducted a qualitative data analysis of parental smokers who were eligible to participate in a PED-based tobacco cessation trial and did not choose to participate (n = 371). (3) Results: Two main themes emerged about reasons for non-participation: (a) Not interested in participating in a research study, and (b) concerns specific to the study. Parents had various reasons for not participating in the cessation trial including not being interested in quitting, parents' health and well-being, parents' beliefs about research, and time required for the study and follow-up visits. (4) Conclusion: General disinterest and specific study-related concerns were touted as reasons for non-participation in a PED-based tobacco cessation trial. Given the potential reductions in tobacco-related morbidity to both parents and children that tobacco control interventions can facilitate, future tobacco interventions should consider alterations in study design and recruitment strategies to encourage all eligible parental smokers to participate.

AB  - Hard carbon is the most attractive anode material for electrochemical sodium/potassium-ion storage. The preparation of hard carbon spheres directly from the broad sources of biomass is of great interest but barely reported. Herein, we developed a simple two-step hydrothermal method to construct porous carbon microspheres directly from the original waste biomass of camellia shells. The porous carbon microspheres have high specific capacities of 250 mAh g(-1) and 264.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) for sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries, respectively. And it has excellent cycle stability for sodium ions and potassium ions outperforming most reported hard carbons, which is mainly attributed to the microporous structure and spherical morphology. The work paves a way to prepare porous hard carbon spheres directly from biomass for alkali metal-ion batteries.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict situations continue to be a growing conservation issue. Conflict situations typically arise as the result of elephants traversing places with infrastructure where they become disruptive to human activities. Developing passive options for managing elephant movement and reducing human-elephant conflict situations is a conservation priority. In this paper, we report elephant responses to a synthetic honey bee alarm pheromone blend, and the relationship between strength and frequency of deterrence responses from elephants. We show that a blend of isoamyl acetate, 2-heptanol, and 2-nonanol, volatile chemicals known to stimulate honey bee vigilance, defence, and mass attack, produced stronger repellence than isoamyl acetate alone, or blended with 2-heptanol. Subadult elephants, irrespective of sex, were the demographic group most likely to show deterrence responses to the alarm blends. In some cases, entire herds of elephants were repelled from alarm pheromone treatments placed at waterholes, suggesting that the method has potential for manipulation of elephant movements on a landscape. Integration of synthetic honey bee alarm pheromones with other elephant behavioral management tools is discussed.

AB  - Based on his analyses of lynx and brown bear teeth, Bj & ouml;rn Kurt & eacute;n coined the concept of 'realisation threshold', the smallest size at which a tooth can form and erupt properly. Kurt & eacute;n found the smallest sizes of the studied lynx and bear teeth to be 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm, respectively, much greater than for example the smallest rodent teeth known to readily erupt. A recent study comparing developing teeth from shrews to elephants suggested a relatively unchanged theoretical minimum tooth size for mammalian teeth. Together, these studies have left open the question of whether realisation thresholds of teeth are larger in larger mammals than in small ones. Here, we followed Kurt & eacute;n's line of thought and compared the sizes of teeth that are variably present in dentitions, and therefore likely cross the realisation threshold only occasionally. First, we show using published reports that variably present teeth are relatively small in large mammals, but larger than the previously suggested theoretical minimum tooth size. Next, we examine the canines of mares, which are known to be variably present. We report one canine that, compared with information found in the literature, is by far the smallest compared to the body size. In conclusion, whereas the variably present teeth tend to be larger in large mammals, there may be overlooked potential for large mammals to develop very small teeth. This information can be helpful in extrapolating findings from common small model organisms, such as mice, to larger mammals, including humans.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hemerocallis citrina Baroni (H. citrina), referred to as 'Forgetting Sadness Grass,' is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) known for its antidepressant effects. Fermentation is an ancient processing method for TCM. Whether fermentation affects the antidepressant effect of H. citrina is unknown. Aim: In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of fermented and unfermented H. citrina on chronic restraint stress-induced depression and the underlying mechanism. Materials and methods: H. citrina was co-fermented with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains LZU-J-TSL-6 and LZU-J-LZ1-1 to produce fermented H. citrina (FH). Both H. citrina and FH were evaluated for effects on depression and anxiety in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice. Results: Fermentation increased flavonoids and phenols while reducing terpenoids. Both H. citrina and FH exhibited antidepressant effects, with FH showing superior efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms. Specifically, FH effectively alleviated weight loss, behavioral abnormalities, and hippocampal pathological damage caused by CRS, while significantly reducing serum levels of cortisol and inflammatory factors, and increasing hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) level. Moreover, FH can restore CRS-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis by promoting the colonization of beneficial microbes, such as Lactobacillus, and inhibiting the growth of harmful microbes, like Bacteroides_H. Importantly, we discovered that the antidepressant effects of FH are closely associated with substances such as L-theanine and myo-inositol, as well as with the metabolic pathways of alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that fermentation alters the composition of active ingredients in H. citrina and enhance its role in depression. It highlights the potential therapeutic application of FH in treating depression.

AB  - An understanding of biological characteristics, such as growth patterns, condition, and energy reserves, is important for better understanding the environmental constraints exerted on fish populations. This is especially true for exploited fish stocks in the current context of climate change. Using biological data collected from 2006 to 2009 during bottom trawl research surveys by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in the estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) as well as data from 2000 to 2018 in the northwest Atlantic, we sought to improve our knowledge on the seasonal condition of Greenland Halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides juveniles and to better understand the divergence in some life history traits between juveniles captured in these two regions. We validated the use of the Le Cren condition index and evaluated its relationship with energetic status in juvenile (20-32-cm TL) Greenland Halibut. In the EGSL, juvenile condition was higher in winter and spring compared to summer and fall. Such variations may result from this species' pelagic predation activity and prey availability. Juveniles captured in the EGSL during 2016-2017 were larger but had a lower condition index than those captured in the northwest Atlantic, but we found no indication of earlier sexual maturation in the EGSL that could explain the sex ratio differences we observed in catches from these two areas.

AB  - Chemerin, belonging to the adipokine family, exhibits pleiotropic activity. We hypothesised that the adipokine could be involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis in the porcine endometrium. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of chemerin on the key steroidogenic enzyme proteins' abundance (Western blot), as well as on P-4 and E-2 secretion (radioimmunoassay) by the porcine endometrium during early pregnancy and the mid-luteal phase of the oestrous cycle. Moreover, we investigated the hormone impact on Erk and Akt signalling pathway activation (Western blot). Chemerin stimulated E-2 production on days 10 to 11 of pregnancy. On days 10 to 11 and 15 to 16 of gestation, and on days 10 to 11 of the cycle, chemerin enhanced the expression of StAR and all steroidogenic enzyme proteins. On days 12 to 13 of pregnancy, chemerin decreased StAR and most of the steroidogenic enzyme proteins' abundance, whereas the P450(C17) abundance was increased. On days 27 to 28 of pregnancy, chemerin increased StAR and P450(C17) protein contents and decreased 3 beta HSD protein amounts. It was noted that the adipokine inhibited Erk1/2 and stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The obtained results indicate that chemerin affected P-4 and E-2 synthesis through the Erk1/2 and Akt signalling pathways.

AB  - Sparassis crispa, known as the "Cauliflower mushroom", is an edible medicinal fungus found in Asia, Europe, and North America. Its fruiting bodies contain active biological and pharmacological ingredients with antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of various Sparassis crispa extract against glutamate-induced toxicity and oxidative stress in hippocampal HT22 cells. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) analyses served to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Sparassis crispa ethanol extract (SCE) and their fractions partitioned with ethyl acetate (EtOAc; SCE-E) and water (SCE-W) in HT22 cells. SCE and SCE-E treatment reduced glutamate-induced cell death and ROS generation. SCE-E reduced apoptosis and ROS levels by regulating anti-apoptotic proteins. Under glutamate treatment, SCE-E activated nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT signals at late stages. SCE-E increased the protein expression of cAMP response element binding (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and decreased the Nrf2 protein expression. Moreover, co-treatment of SCE-E and wortmannin did not activate Nrf2 expression. Thus, the neuroprotective effect of SCE-E is likely due to Nrf2 and CREB activation through AKT and ERK phosphorylation, which effectively suppress glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells. Accordingly, a daily supplement of SCE-E could become a potential treatment for oxidative-stress-related neurological diseases.

AB  - Empoasca onukii Matsuda is a primary pest of the tea plant Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze that severely influences the production and quality of tea products. Gustatory receptors (GRs) are an indispensable part of the E. onukii chemosensory machinery as members of the G-protein coupled receptor family. Insect odor and gustatory receptors are consumingly sensitive and selective sensory receptors to search for foraging, mates, and spawning sites. In this study, the gustatory receptor EonuGR1 was cloned and analyzed bioinformatically, and the expression levels of EonuGR1 in diverse tissues of E. onukii were tested via qRT-PCR. The behavioral response of E. onukii to volatile compounds was determined via RNA interference and Y-tube olfactometer assays to investigate the role of EonuGR1 in the olfactory recognition of E. onukii. The coding sequence length of EonuGR1 was 1062 bp, and the length of the protein encoded by EonuGR1 was 40.52 kD. The highest interference efficiency was observed after 3 h of dsEonuGR1 treatment via root soak treatment. Moreover, the response rates to phenylacetaldehyde at concentrations of 10 and 0.1 mu L/mL were significantly downregulated in E. onukii. The responses to phenylacetaldehyde at concentrations of 10 and 100 mu L/mL showed a significant decrease after dsEonuGR1 treatment for 12 h in E. onukii. In conclusion, EonuGR1 was highly expressed in the abdomen and functioned in olfactory recognition of the tea plant volatile phenylacetaldehyde by E. onukii. Overall, EonuGR1 has the potential as a gene target for the design of effective control strategies against E. onukii.

AB  - Protozoa comprise a major fraction of the microbial biomass in the rumen microbiome, of which the entodiniomorphs (order: Entodiniomorphida) and holotrichs (order: Vestibuliferida) are consistently observed to be dominant across a diverse genetic and geographical range of ruminant hosts. Despite the apparent core role that protozoal species exert, their major biological and metabolic contributions to rumen function remain largely undescribed in vivo. Here, we have leveraged (meta)genome-centric metaproteomes from rumen fluid samples originating from both cattle and goats fed diets with varying inclusion levels of lipids and starch, to detail the specific metabolic niches that protozoa occupy in the context of their microbial co-habitants. Initial proteome estimations via total protein counts and label-free quantification highlight that entodiniomorph species Entodinium and Epidinium as well as the holotrichs Dasytricha and Isotricha comprise an extensive fraction of the total rumen metaproteome. Proteomic detection of protozoal metabolism such as hydrogenases (Dasytricha, Isotricha, Epidinium, Enoploplastron), carbohydrate-active enzymes (Epidinium, Diplodinium, Enoploplastron, Polyplastron), microbial predation (Entodinium) and volatile fatty acid production (Entodinium and Epidinium) was observed at increased levels in high methane-emitting animals. Despite certain protozoal species having well-established reputations for digesting starch, they were unexpectedly less detectable in low methane emitting-animals fed high starch diets, which were instead dominated by propionate/succinate-producing bacterial populations suspected of being resistant to predation irrespective of host. Finally, we reaffirmed our abovementioned observations in geographically independent datasets, thus illuminating the substantial metabolic influence that under-explored eukaryotic populations have in the rumen, with greater implications for both digestion and methane metabolism.

AB  - Conservation strategies for apex predators, like the snow leopard (Panthera uncia), depend on a robust understanding of their dietary preferences, prey abundance, and adaptability to changing ecological conditions. To address these critical conservation concerns, this study presents a comprehensive evidence on prey availability and preferences for snow leopards in the Lapchi Valley in the Nepal Himalayas from November 2021 to March 2023. Field data were collected through the installation of twenty-six camera traps at 16 strategically chosen locations, resulting in the recording of 1228 events of 19 mammalian species, including domesticated livestock. Simultaneously, the collection of twenty snow leopard scat samples over 3800 m above sea level allowed for a detailed dietary analysis. Photo capture rate index and biomass composition analysis were carried out and seasonal prey availability and consumption were statistically analyzed. A total of 16 potential prey species for the snow leopard were documented during the study period. Himalayan musk deer (Moschus leucogaster) was the most abundant prey species, but infrequent in the diet suggesting that are not the best bet prey for the snow leopards. Snow leopards were found to exhibit a diverse diet, consuming eleven prey species, with blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) being their most consumed wild prey and horses as their preferred livestock. The Pianka's index of dietary niche overlap between the summer and winter seasons were 0.576, suggesting a pronounced seasonal variation in food preference corroborating with the prey availability. The scarcity of larger preys in winter is compensated by small and meso-mammals in the diet, highlighting the snow leopard's capacity for dietary plasticity in response to the variation in resource availability. This research suggests for the utilization of genetic tools to further explore snow leopard diet composition. Additionally, understanding transboundary movements and conducting population assessments will be imperative for the formulation of effective conservation strategies.

AB  - There are limited biosecurity measures directed at preventing airborne transmission of viruses in swine. The effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies such as oil sprinkling, to decrease risk of airborne virus transmission are unknown. Metagenomics and qPCR for common fecal viruses were used to hunt for a ubiquitous virus to serve as a proxy when evaluating the efficiency of mitigation strategies against airborne viral infectious agents. Air particles were collected from swine buildings using high -volume air samplers. Extracted DNA and RNA were used to perform specific RT-qPCR and qPCR and analyzed by highthroughput sequencing. Porcine astroviruses group 2 were common (from 102 to 105 genomic copies per cubic meter of air or gc/m3, 93% positivity) while no norovirus genogroup II was recovered from air samples. Porcine torque teno sus virus were detected by qPCR in low concentrations (from 101 to 102 gc/m3, 47% positivity). Among the identified viral families by metagenomics analysis, Herelleviridae, Microviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae were dominant. The phage vB_AviM_AVP of Aerococcus was present in all air samples and a newly designed qPCR revealed between 101 and 105 gc/m3 among the samples taken for the present study (97% positivity) and banked samples from 5- and 15 -year old studies (89% positivity). According to the present study, both the porcine astrovirus group 2 and the phage vB_AviM_AVP of Aerococcus could be proxy for airborne viruses of swine buildings.

AB  - In recent years, the incidence of obesity has gradually increased due to high calorie diets and lack of exercise. Reducing energy intake or increasing energy expenditure is the most effective way to promote weight loss and reduce lipid levels. Activated beige adipocytes can increase energy consumption in the body, and inducing conversion of white adipocytes to brown can prevent and treat obesity. Taraxacum mongolicum polysaccharide (TMP) is a plant polysaccharide that has been widely used for its anti-tumour and antioxidant properties. However, little is known about the role of TMP in the browning of sheep white adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to explore the potential mechanism of TMP and miR-134-3p in regulating the browning of sheep white adipocytes, as well as the regulatory relationship between TMP and miR-134-3p. Our results showed that TMP had a positive regulatory effect on the proliferation and browning of sheep white adipocytes. In addition, miR134-3p significantly inhibited browning activity and AKT/GSK-3 beta signalling. Importantly, we found that TMP function required miR-134-3p mediation in the browning of sheep white adipocytes. Overall, our results suggested that TMP recruited beige adipocytes by regulating AKT/GSK-3 beta signalling via miR-134-3p.

AB  - Prompted by our previous findings of several subtle but distinct differences in some anatomical aspects of the Saimaa (Pusa hispida saimensis) and Baltic ringed seals (Pusa hispida botnica), particularly in the head region, we investigated the osteological and arterial architecture of the nasal conchae and the ophthalmic rete of through computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, arterial silicone injections, dissection, histological examination, and comparison of skull specimens. The conchal and ophthalmic retia, involved in the thermoregulation of mammals, were similar in their anatomical structure to those reported from other pinnipeds and did not differ between the ringed seal subspecies. The endangered status of the Saimaa ringed seal prevented invasive investigation methods helpful for linking anatomical findings to functional properties. However, with silicone models, we were able to confirm the existence of delicate structures such as a separate vibrissal arterial circulation and the lateral and medial posterior ciliary arteries.

AB  - Background The cultivated Camellia sasanqua forms a divergent double flower pattern, and the stamen petaloid is a vital factor in the phenomenon. However, the regulation mechanism remains largely unclear. Results Here, a comprehensive comparative transcriptome analysis of the wild-type, "semi-double", "peony double", and "rose double" was performed. The cluster analysis of global gene expression level showed petal and stamen difficulty separable in double flower. The crucial pathway and genes related to double flower patterns regulation were identified by pairwise comparisons and weighted gene coexpression network (WGCNA). Divergent genes expression, such as AUX1 and AHP, are involved in plant hormone signaling and photosynthesis, and secondary metabolites play an important role. Notably, the diversity of a petal-specific model exhibits a similar molecular signature to the stamen, containing extensin protein and PSBO1, supporting the stamen petaloid point. Moreover, the expansion of class A gene activity influenced the double flower formation, showing that the key function of gene expression was probably demolished. Conclusions Overall, this work confirmed the ABCE model and provided new insights for elucidating the molecular signature of double formation.

AB  - Animal sociality emerges from individual decisions on how to balance the costs and benefits of being sociable. Novel pathogens introduced into wildlife populations should increase the costs of sociality, selecting against gregariousness. Using an individual-based model that captures essential features of pathogen transmission among social hosts, we show how novel pathogen introduction provokes the rapid evolutionary emergence and coexistence of distinct social movement strategies. These strategies differ in how they trade the benefits of social information against the risk of infection. Overall, pathogen-risk-adapted populations move more and have fewer associations with other individuals than their pathogen-risk-naive ancestors, reducing disease spread. Host evolution to be less social can be sufficient to cause a pathogen to be eliminated from a population, which is followed by a rapid recovery in social tendency. Our conceptual model is broadly applicable to a wide range of potential host-pathogen introductions and offers initial predictions for the eco-evolutionary consequences of wildlife pathogen spillover scenarios and a template for the development of theory in the ecology and evolution of animals' movement decisions.

AB  - Melatonin (MT), an endogenous hormone secreted by pineal gland, has the sedative, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions. However, there are few studies on whether MT affects the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes. The present study investigated the influences of MT on the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes, explored its regulation on runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), NOTCH1 and sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, and elucidated their interplays. The results showed that MT promoted the proliferation of antler chondrocytes and induced the differentiation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes as evidenced by the significant increase of collagen type X (COL X), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) expression and ALP activity, the well-established markers for hypertrophic chondrocytes, but this effectiveness was neutralized by the addition of MT receptor antagonist. Further analysis indicated that MT activated the NOTCH1 and SHH signaling whose blockage abrogated the inducement of MT on the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes. SHH was identified as a downstream target of recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ), a transcription factor of NOTCH1 signaling. Meanwhile, MT stimulated the expression of RUNX2 through activating the SHH signaling whose downstream transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) directly controlled the transcription of RUNX2 through binding to its promoter region. Moreover, repression of GLI1 counteracted the proliferative effect of MT on antler chondrocytes and attenuated the advancement of MT on chondrocyte differentiation, while supplementation of recombinant RUNX2 protein recued above effects. Collectively, MT induced the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes via RUNX2 dependent on the interaction between NOTCH1 and SHH signaling pathways.

AB  - Pneumonic pathologies are clinically important in alpaca breeding; however, there is little information about pneumonic types and bacterial causes. The objective is to characterize pneumonias and bacteria causing pneumonias in neonates of dead alpacas in high Andean communities of Huancavelica, Peru. We sampled 365 dead alpaca pups under 45 days of age, from 10 communities, 216 of them were taken tracheal swabs for microbiological studies with peptone buffer because they were cases of pneumonia. Macroscopic identification of pneumonias was done by photo documentation test. Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica were grown on Colombia agar enriched with alpaca blood; Streptococcus pneumoniae on Brain Heart Infusion agar supplemented with alpaca blood and identified by morphological and microscopic characterization, biochemical reactions and optokine. It was found 59.8% of mortality due to pneumonia and 40.2% by other causes, characterizing pneumonia by inflammation 55.1%, 44.9% by lesion and subtypes: Exudative 9.5%, Suppurative 3.8%, Proliferative 42.3%, Lobar 17.8%, Interstitial 26.6%, isolating strains Streptococcus pneumoniae 43.7%, Mannheimia haemolytica 14.9%, Pasteurella multocida 20.9%, predominant associates Streptococcus pneumoniae-Pasteurella multocida 10.7%. High frequency of types and subtypes of pneumonia associated to Gram (+) bacteria were observed as causal of pneumonia in alpaca pups, with predominance in three high Andean communities of Huancavelica, Peru.

AB  - The increasing world population with improved living conditions has increased the demand for food protein. This has intensified the search for sustainable alternative plant-derived high-quality protein sources for human nutrition. To study the effect of plant and milk proteins on growth in weaned pigs as a model for humans, 96 weaned pigs were divided into 48 pens and fed one of 4 different diets for 3 weeks. The dietary protein originated from either 50% rice + 50% 00-rapeseed protein (RICE + RAPE), 50% milk protein (MPC) + 50% 00-rapeseed protein (MPC + RAPE), 50% milk + 50% rice protein (MPC + RICE), or 100% MPC, and were supplemented with crystalline amino acids to meet the amino acid requirements. Weekly feed intake and body weights were recorded and after 3 weeks, a blood sample was taken 1 hour after a fixed meal, while organ weights were measured, and liver- and muscle tissue, and bone samples were collected at euthanasia. All pigs had a high daily gain and a low feed-to-gain ratio (F : G, feed intake per kg weight gain), but feed intake and daily gain was lowest and F : G highest in the RICE + RAPE diet. Metacarpal bones were longer and heavier in MPC + RICE and MPC fed pigs compared to pigs fed diet RICE + RAPE (P < 0.05), and intermediate in MPC + RAPE fed pigs, with no differences in bone thickness (P > 0.05). Plasma levels of all essential amino acids except Cys and Lys decreased markedly when fed a diet containing only plant protein. The differences were not associated with differences in plasma insulin or IGF-1, nor in the abundance of mRNA related to growth in liver and longissimus dorsi muscle. In conclusion, the growth of piglets fed a combination of milk and rice protein did not differ from the pure dairy-based diet, whereas the pure plant-based diet consisting of rice and rapeseed protein led to reduced growth. This was most likely caused by a lower feed intake and a lower than expected amino acid digestibility of the 00-rapeseed protein. There were no indications that the milk protein, beyond a favourable amino acid composition and high digestibility, specifically stimulated growth factors or other biomarkers of growth via the IGF-1 and insulin signalling pathways.

AB  - Ghrelin (Gr) is an orexigenic peptide that acts via its specific receptor, GHSR-1a distributed throughout the brain, being mainly enriched in pituitary, cortex and hippocampus (Hp) modulating a variety of brain functions. Behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical evidence indicated that Gr modulates the excitability and the synaptic plasticity in Hp. The present experiments were designed in order to extend the knowledge about the Gr effect upon structural synaptic plasticity since morphological and quantitative changes in spine density after Gr administration were analyzed ?in vitro? and ?in vivo?. The results show that Gr administered to hippocampal cultures or stereotactically injected in vivo to Thy-1 mice increases the density of dendritic spines (DS) being the mushroom type highly increased in secondary and tertiary extensions. Spines classified as thin type were increased particularly in primary extensions. Furthermore, we show that Gr enhances selectively the expression of BDNF-mRNA species.

AB  - The global pig industry and food safety are seriously threatened by outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF). To permit early diagnosis of African swine fever virus (ASFV), prevent its spread, and limit its outbreaks, a highly sensitive diagnostic method that can be performed at pig farms is required. Herein, we established DNA extraction-free real-time PCR (qPCR), visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and fluorescent LAMP assays, which were compared with the results of World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) qPCR to assess ASFV-infected clinical samples. Based on plasmid DNA, the limit of detection for the three assays and OIE qPCR were 5.8 copies/mu L. All four assays had good ASFV specificity and showed no cross-reactivity with other tested viruses. These assays were used to diagnose 100 clinical samples. The assays showed good diagnostic consistency, with kappa values of 1.0, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively. Compared with OIE qPCR, the diagnostic specificity/sensitivity of DNA extraction-free qPCR, visual LAMP, and fluorescent LAMP assays were 100%/100%, 100%/87.1%, and 100%/90.32%, respectively. The assays eliminated the need for DNA extraction and are more suitable for ASF diagnosis by inexperienced farmers in low-resource environments, making them a good choice for on-site monitoring of pig farms.

AB  - In Africa, the current harmful maize pest is Spodoptera frugiperda. Its attack can be severe and cause total economic losses. Spodoptera eridania is another species of the same genus, detected a few months after S. frugiperda's outbreaks in West and Central Africa. Though both species share a range of host plants, socioeconomic studies are yet to provide specific figures on the potential impacts of S. eridania. The high and inappropriate application of insecticides to control Spodoptera species has negative effects on the environmental elements' health. Semiochemical tools are increasingly exploited to design alternative pest management strategies. We hypothesize that host plants release components used by the pests and a shared parasitoid to locate the host. To verify that hypothesis, we conducted behavioral assays and GC-MS analyses to identify the potential chemical signals involved in the communications of the moths and their shared parasitoid C. icipe. The results showed that healthy and herbivory-induced maize and amaranth produced some chemical compounds including alpha-pinene, limonene, isopentyl acetate, (Z)-beta-farnesene, and methyl dodecanoate, which prospects their potential use in alternative pest management strategies for recruiting C. icipe to control these pests. Further work will focus on field validation to develop an alternative control strategy for the moths.

   Hyaluronic acid, also known as hyaluronan, is essential for the expansion of cumulus cells, the maturation of oocytes, and further embryo development. This study aimed to examine the effects of treatment with glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which are components of hyaluronic acid, during porcine oocyte in vitro maturation and embryonic development after parthenogenetic activation and somatic cell nuclear transfer. We measured the diameter of mature oocytes, the thickness of the perivitelline space, the intracellular reactive oxygen species level, and the expression of cumulus cell expansion genes and reactive oxygen species-related genes and examined the cortical granule reaction of oocytes after electrical activation. In conclusion, the addition of 0.05 mM glucuronic acid and 0.05 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and during the initial 22 h of in vitro maturation in pig oocytes has beneficial effects on cumulus expansion, perivitelline space thickness, cytoplasmic maturation, reactive oxygen species level, cortical granule exocytosis, and early embryonic development after parthenogenesis and somatic cell nuclear transfer. Glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine can be applied to in vitro production technology and can be used as ingredients to produce high-quality porcine blastocysts.
   This study aimed to examine the effects of treatment with glucuronic acid (GA) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (AG), which are components of hyaluronic acid (HA), during porcine oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM). We measured the diameter of the oocyte, the thickness of the perivitelline space (PVS), the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and the expression of cumulus cell expansion and ROS-related genes and examined the cortical granule (CG) reaction of oocytes. The addition of 0.05 mM GA and 0.05 mM AG during the first 22 h of oocyte IVM significantly increased oocyte diameter and PVS size compared with the control (non-treatment). The addition of GA and AG reduced the intra-oocyte ROS content and improved the CG of the oocyte. GA and AG treatment increased the expression of CD44 and CX43 in cumulus cells and PRDX1 and TXN2 in oocytes. In both the chemically defined and the complex medium (Medium-199 + porcine follicular fluid), oocytes derived from the GA and AG treatments presented significantly higher blastocyst rates than the control after parthenogenesis (PA) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In conclusion, the addition of GA and AG during IVM in pig oocytes has beneficial effects on oocyte IVM and early embryonic development after PA and SCNT.

AB  - Background: Pork lard (PL) is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory agent. We propose to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory properties of PL, and elucidate which compounds could be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects. Methods: The anti-inflammatory effects of PL were tested in a rat model of zymosan-induced hind paw inflammation. Further, the hydroalcoholic extract from PL was obtained, the composition analyzed, and the anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts and isolated components assayed using immune cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: Applying the ointment on the inflamed rat feet reduced the foot diameter, foot weight, and activities of antioxidant enzymes and inflammatory markers of circulating neutrophils. The main components of the hydroalcoholic extract were 5-dodecanolide, oleamide, hexadecanoic acid, 9-octadecenoic acid, hexadecanamide, and resolvin D1. Conclusions: PL reduces the immune response in an animal model stimulated with zymosan. Hydroalcoholic PL extract and its components (5-Dodecanolide, Oleamide, and Resolvin D1) exerted an anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-stimulated neutrophils and peripheral mononuclear cells reducing the capability to produce TNF alpha, as well as the activities of antioxidant and pro-inflammatory enzymes. These effects are attributable to 5-dodecanolide, although the effects of this compound alone do not reach the magnitude of the anti-inflammatory effects observed by the complete hydroalcoholic extract.

AB  - Identifying high-quality habitat (i.e., areas with resources and conditions suitable to support long-term species persistence) is a priority for conservation, but estimating habitat quality is expensive and time consuming. Instead managers often rely on occurrence data or models of habitat suitability, but these data are only proximally related to individual and population persistence on the landscape. In most habitat suitability modeling studies, researchers treat the model as a hypothesis and the occurrence data as the truth. But occurrence does not always correlate with habitat as expected; therefore, occurrence data may be unreliable. We propose that suitability models and occurrence data be given equal weight to highlight areas of disagreement for future demographic study. To highlight this approach, we used the giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens) as a case study because their distinct burrow mounds allow for remote monitoring of short-term presence and long-term persistence. We conducted trapping, manned aerial surveys, and aerial imagery surveys in the San Joaquin Desert in California, USA, between 2001 and 2017 and compared the results to an existing habitat suitability model to provide estimates of long-term persistence based on the presence of burrow mounds made by giant kangaroo rats. We treated areas of positive agreement as priorities for habitat conservation and areas of negative agreement as areas managers could ignore. Remaining areas should be prioritized for additional occupancy and demographic studies. From an initial area of 17,385 km(2), we identified 668 km(2) of currently occupied high-quality habitat. Of this, just 135 km(2) was on private land and therefore requiring protection. We classified 1,498 km(2) (8.6%) for additional research. Of that area, 744 km(2) was flagged for additional occupancy surveys. Our 3 data sets disagreed over 754 km(2), suggesting a need for further demographic studies to reveal important population-habitat relationships for the species in those areas. This approach can be useful as part of any habitat conservation exercise for prioritizing protection or targeting future demographic studies. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The focal "hot spot" neuropathologies in COVID-19 infection are revealing footprints of a hidden underlying collapse of a novel ultrafast ultradian Piezo2 signaling system within the nervous system. Paradoxically, the same initiating pathophysiology may underpin the systemic findings in COVID-19 infection, namely the multiorgan SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vascular pathologies and brain-body-wide systemic pro-inflammatory signaling, depending on the concentration and exposure to infecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This common initiating microdamage is suggested to be the primary damage or the acquired channelopathy of the Piezo2 ion channel, leading to a principal gateway to pathophysiology. This Piezo2 channelopathy-induced neural switch could not only explain the initiation of disrupted cell-cell interactions, metabolic failure, microglial dysfunction, mitochondrial injury, glutamatergic synapse loss, inflammation and neurological states with the central involvement of the hippocampus and the medulla, but also the initiating pathophysiology without SARS-CoV-2 viral intracellular entry into neurons as well. Therefore, the impairment of the proposed Piezo2-induced quantum mechanical free-energy-stimulated ultrafast proton-coupled tunneling seems to be the principal and critical underlying COVID-19 infection-induced primary damage along the brain axes, depending on the loci of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and intracellular entry. Moreover, this initiating Piezo2 channelopathy may also explain resultant autonomic dysregulation involving the medulla, hippocampus and heart rate regulation, not to mention sleep disturbance with altered rapid eye movement sleep and cognitive deficit in the short term, and even as a consequence of long COVID. The current opinion piece aims to promote future angles of science and research in order to further elucidate the not entirely known initiating pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in livestock fecundity, and many lncRNAs that affect follicular development and reproductive diseases have been identified in the ovary. However, only a few of them have been functionally annotated and mechanistically validated. In this study, we identified a new lncRNA (lncGSAR) and investigated its effects on the proliferation and steroidogenesis of ovine granulosa cells (GCs). High concentrations of glucose (add 33.6 mM glucose) caused high expression of lncGSAR in GCs by regulating its stability, and lncGSAR overexpression promoted GCs proliferation, estrogen secretion, and inhibited progesterone secretion, whereas interference with lncGASR had the opposite effect. Next, we found that the RNA molecules of lncGSAR act on MiR-125b as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), and SREBP-cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) was verified as a target of MiR-125b. LncGASR overexpression increased the expression of SCAP, SREBP, and steroid hormone-related proteins, which can be attenuated by MiR-125b. Our results demonstrated that lncGSAR can act as a ceRNA to activate SCAP/SREBP signaling by sponging MiR-125b to regulate steroid hormone secretion in GCs. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of nutrient-regulated follicle development in ewes.

AB  - Because intrauterine environment differs between twins and singletons, twin-born lambs are often studied when effects of fetal programming are evaluated. In sheep, fetal programming might have effects on reproductive physiology and behavior after sexual maturation. The aim of this study was to compare sperm output and sexual behavior in developing singleton- or twin-born lambs of similar body weight. Singleton lambs (n = 12) and twin (n = 9) male-male lambs were used. From 5.4 until 9.1 months of age, body weight, scrotal circumference (every 3-4 weeks), sexual behavior (every 14 days) and semen characteristics (every 28 days) were evaluated. In the third ejaculate, singleton lambs ejaculated a larger volume of semen than twins (P = 0.03). Considering a pool of the three ejaculates, twin lambs ejaculated semen with a greater sperm concentration than singleton lambs (P = 0.015). There was an interaction between group and time to the onset of courtship behavior (P = 0.02) and a tendency for an interaction in the number of mount attempts (P = 0.052). Singleton-born lambs, during the first evaluation period began courtship behavior earlier than twin-born lambs (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, there were only slight differences in semen and sexual behavior between male ram lambs born as singletons or twins with similar weight. Male ram lambs born as singletons initiated the courtship behavior earlier than twins during the first sexual behavioral evaluation period, ejaculated a larger volume of semen in the third consecutive ejaculate, and there was a lesser sperm concentration in the three ejaculates.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms which is treated with antipsychotics. However, these drugs present several side effects and, some schizophrenia symptoms, like cognitive, are difficult to treat. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma (PPAR-gamma) are expressed in dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain participating in the modulation of dopamine-mediated behavior . We investigated the effects of pioglitazone, an agonist of PPAR-gamma, on the behavioral alterations induced by ketamine and, whether alterations in monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), PPAR-gamma or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in brain tissues are involved in these effects. Male mice received ketamine (30 mg/kg), intraperitoneally, for 14 consecutive days, and pioglitazone (3 or 9 mg/kg), by gavage (day 8 up to day 14). Ketamine decreased nail-biting increasing the time exploring the center of the open field on day 8 and the number of rearing evaluated 30 min after its administration on day 14. Furthermore, ketamine decreased the percentage of investigation in the NOR test and the immunoreactivity of GAD67 in the hippocampus. No significant changes were found in other behavioral and biochemical tests. Pioglitazone attenuated the effects of ketamine on rearing and GAD67 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus, recovering the ketamine effects on NOR test. At a dose of 9 mg/kg, pioglitazone alone reduced the immunoreactivity of GAD67 in the hippocampus. Pioglitazone at both doses recovered the cognitive symptoms induced by ketamine an effect that seems to involve the modulation of GAD67 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. In conclusion, pioglitazone improved the effects of ketamine on the NOR test which was, at least in part, associated with the modulation of GAD67 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus suggesting its beneficial role in cognitive symptoms.

AB  - GNAQ, a member of the alpha subunit encoding the q-like G protein, is a critical gene in cell signaling, and multiple studies have shown that upregulation of GNAQ gene expression ultimately inhibits the proliferation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and GnRH secretion, and ultimately affects mammalian reproduction. Photoperiod is a key inducer which plays an important role in gene expression regulation by affecting epigenetic modification. However, fewer studies have confirmed how photoperiod induces epigenetic modifications of the GNAQ gene. In this study, we examined the expression and epigenetic changes of GNAQ in the hypothalamus in ovariectomized and estradiol-treated (OVX+E2) sheep under three photoperiod treatments (short photoperiod treatment for 42 days, SP42; long photoperiod treatment for 42 days, LP42; 42 days of short photoperiod followed by 42 days of long photoperiod, SP-LP42). The results showed that the expression of GNAQ was significantly higher in SP-LP42 than in SP42 and LP42 (p < 0.05). Whole genome methylation sequencing (WGBS) results showed that there are multiple differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and loci between different groups of GNAQ. Among them, the DNA methylation level of DMRs at the CpG1 locus in SP42 was significantly higher than that of SP-LP42 (p < 0.01). Subsequently, we confirmed that the core promoter region of the GNAQ gene was located with 1100 to 1500 bp upstream, and the DNA methylation level of all eight CpG sites in SP42 was significantly higher than those in LP42 (p < 0.01), and significantly higher than those in SP-LP42 (p < 0.01), except site 2 and site 4 in the first sequencing fragment (p < 0.05) in the core promoter region. The expression of acetylated GNAQ histone H3 was significantly higher than that of the control group under three different photoperiods (p < 0.01); the acetylation level of sheep hypothalamic GNAQ genomic protein H3 was significantly lower under SP42 than under SP-LP42 (p < 0.05). This suggests that acetylated histone H3 binds to the core promoter region of the GNAQ gene, implying that GNAQ is epigenetically regulated by photoperiod through histone acetylation. In summary, the results suggest that photoperiod can induce DNA methylation in the core promoter region and histone acetylation in the promoter region of the GNAQ gene, and hypothesize that the two may be key factors in regulating the differential expression of GNAQ under different photoperiods, thus regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) through the seasonal estrus in sheep. The results of this study will provide some new information to understand the function of epigenetic modifications in reproduction in sheep.

AB  - Aging is associated with cognitive deficits, with spatial memory being very susceptible to decline. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is important for processing spatial information in the brain and is particularly vulnerable to aging, yet its sparse activity has led to difficulties in assessing changes in this area. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we compared DG neuronal activity and representations of space in young and aged mice walking on an unfamiliar treadmill. We found that calcium activity was significantly higher and less tuned to location in aged mice, resulting in decreased spatial information encoded in the DG. However, with repeated exposure to the same treadmill, both spatial tuning and information levels in aged mice became similar to young mice, while activity remained elevated. Our results show that spatial representations of novel environments are impaired in the aged hippocampus and gradually improve with increased familiarity. Moreover, while the aged DG is hyperexcitable, this does not disrupt neural representations of familiar environments.

AB  - The contemporary strategy for spinal cord injury (SCI) therapy aims to combine multiple approaches to control pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegeneration and stimulate neuroregeneration. In this study, a novel regenerative approach using an autologous leucoconcentrate enriched with transgenes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) combined with supra- and sub-lesional epidural electrical stimulation (EES) was tested on mini-pigs similar in morpho-physiological scale to humans. The complex analysis of the spinal cord recovery after a moderate contusion injury in treated mini-pigs compared to control animals revealed: better performance in behavioural and joint kinematics, restoration of electromyography characteristics, and improvement in selected immunohistology features related to cell survivability, synaptic protein expression, and glial reorganization above and below the injury. These results for the first time demonstrate the positive effect of intravenous infusion of autologous genetically-enriched leucoconcentrate producing recombinant molecules stimulating neuroregeneration combined with neuromodulation by translesional multisite EES on the restoration of the post-traumatic spinal cord in mini-pigs and suggest the high translational potential of this novel regenerative therapy for SCI patients.

AB  - T-2 toxin, classified as a mycotoxin, harms immune and cognitive systems. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on the neurotoxic effects of T-2 toxin. However, there is still a need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the protective effect of resveratrol (Res) supplementation against T-2 toxin-induced spatial learning and memory impairment and to investigate the communication mechanisms between the gut and the brain. Mice received a single intraperitoneal dose of T-2 toxin (4 mg/kg) followed by Res (100 mg/kg) administered via the same route. The Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests demonstrated that T-2 toxin had a profound negative impact on spatial learning and memory in mice. However, the administration of Res successfully mitigated the cognitive impairments caused by T-2 toxin and notably enhanced the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptophysin I (SYN1), and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). Moreover, Res demonstrated a protective effect against T-2 toxin-induced damage to hippocampal tissue. Simultaneously, it played a pivotal role in restoring gut microbiota equilibrium and maintaining the integrity of intestinal tight junctions, effectively curbing both localized and systemic inflammation triggered by T-2 toxin exposure. In conclusion, our findings suggest that resveratrol may alleviate T-2 toxin-induced spatial learning and memory deficits, possibly via gut-brain axis modulation.

AB  - Background Drug seeking behavior occurs in response to environmental contexts and drug-associated cues. The presence of these pervasive stimuli impedes abstinence success. beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) have a long-standing historical implication in driving processes associated with contextual memories, including drug-associated memories in substance use disorders. However, sex differences in the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in drug memories remain unknown.Hypothesis Prior reports indicate a selective role for beta 2-ARs in retrieval and retention of contextual drug memories in males, and substantial sex differences exist in the expression of beta-ARs of male and female rats. Therefore, we hypothesized that there are sex differences in selective recruitment of beta-ARs during different stages of memory encoding and retrieval.Methods The role of beta-ARs in driving retrieval and learning of contextual cocaine memories was investigated using cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) in adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were infused directly to the dorsal hippocampus with Propranolol (beta 1 and beta 2) or ICI-118,551 (beta 1) and/or Betaxolol (beta 2), immediately prior to testing (retrieval), or paired to each cocaine (10 mg/kp, IP) conditioning session (learning).Results In males, administration of either beta 1, beta 2, or combined beta 1 and beta 2-ARs before the initial CPP testing reduced the expression of a CPP compared to vehicle administration. In females, beta 2-ARs transiently decreased CPP memories, whereas beta 1 had long lasting but not immediate effects to decrease CPP memories. Additionally, beta 1 and combined beta 1 and beta 2-ARs had immediate and persistent effects to decrease CPP memory expression. DG Fos + neurons predicted cocaine CPP expression in males, whereas CA1 and CA3 Fos + neurons predicted cocaine CPP expression in females.Conclusion There are significant sex differences in the role of dorsal hippocampus beta-ARs in the encoding and expression of cocaine conditioned place preference. Furthermore, sub regions of the dorsal hippocampus appear to activate differently between male and female rats during CPP. Therefore DG, CA3, and CA1 may have separate region- and sex-specific impacts on driving drug- associated, or context-associated cues.

AB  - The etiology of fetal growth restriction (FGR) is multifactorial, although many cases often involve placental insufficiency. Placental insufficiency is associated with inadequate trophoblast invasion, resulting in high resistance to blood flow, decreased availability of nutrients, and increased hypoxia. We have developed a nonviral, polymer-based nanoparticle that facilitates delivery and transient gene expression of human insulin-like 1 growth factor (hIGF1) in placental trophoblast for the treatment of placenta insufficiency and FGR. Using the established guinea pig maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) model of placental insufficiency and FGR, the aim of the study was to identify novel pathways in the subplacenta/decidua that provide insight into the underlying mechanism driving placental insufficiency and may be corrected with hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment. Pregnant guinea pigs underwent ultrasound-guided sham or hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment at midpregnancy, and subplacenta/decidua tissue was collected 5 days later. Transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA Sequencing on the Illumina platform. The MNR subplacenta/decidua demonstrated fewer maternal spiral arteries lined by trophoblast, shallower trophoblast invasion, and downregulation of genelists involved in the regulation of cell migration. hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment resulted in marked changes to transporter activity in the MNR + hIGF1 subplacenta/decidua when compared with sham MNR. Under normal growth conditions however, hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment decreased genelists enriched for kinase signaling pathways and increased genelists enriched for proteolysis, indicative of homeostasis. Overall, this study identified changes to the subplacenta/decidua transcriptome that likely result in inadequate trophoblast invasion and increases our understanding of pathways that hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment acts on to restore or maintain appropriate placenta function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Placental insufficiency at midpregnancy, established through moderate maternal nutrient restriction, is characterized with fewer maternal spiral arteries lined by trophoblast, shallower trophoblast invasion, and downregulation of genelists involved in the regulation of cell migration. Treatment of placenta insufficiency with a hIGF1 nanoparticle results in marked changes to transporter activity and increases our mechanistic understanding of how therapies designed to improve fetal growth may impact the placenta.

AB  - Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by the neuronal absence of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). UBE3A promotes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and functions as a transcriptional coregulator of nuclear hormone receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Previous studies showed anxiety-like behavior and hippocampal-dependent memory disturbances in AS mouse models. Hippocampal GR is an important regulator of the stress response and memory formation, and we therefore investigated whether the absence of UBE3A in AS mice disrupted GR signaling in the hippocampus. We first established a strong cortisol-dependent interaction between the GR ligand binding domain and a UBE3A nuclear receptor box in a high-throughput interaction screen. In vivo, we found that UBE3A-deficient AS mice displayed significantly more variation in circulating corticosterone levels throughout the day compared to wildtypes (WT), with low to undetectable levels of corticosterone at the trough of the circadian cycle. Additionally, we observed an enhanced transcriptomic response in the AS hippocampus following acute corticosterone treatment. Surprisingly, chronic corticosterone treatment showed less contrast between AS and WT mice in the hippocampus and liver transcriptomic responses. This suggests that UBE3A limits the acute stimulation of GR signaling, likely as a member of the GR transcriptional complex. Altogether, these data indicate that AS mice are more sensitive to acute glucocorticoid exposure in the brain compared to WT mice. This suggests that stress responsiveness is altered in AS which could lead to anxiety symptoms.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic metal pollutant that can endanger the life and health of animals. Toll-like re-ceptor 4 (TLR4) can result in testicular cell damage by positively regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway. Meanwhile, Testosterone (T) synthesis disorder can affect sexual behavior. However, the harmful influence of Cd on animal sexual behavior during its growth and development and the role of TLR4/MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in testicular cell damage and testosterone production remained poorly understood. Forty-two-day-old male piglets were fed with diets that contained CdCl2 (20 mg Cd/kg) for 40 days to explore the toxic effects of Cd on sexual behavior. The results showed that Cd activated TLR4, promoted MAPK (p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38)/NF-kappa B expression, induced apoptosis (Caspase-3, Cleaved Caspase3, Bax, Cyt-c, and Caspase-9 expression increased, but Bcl-2 expression decreased) and nec-roptosis (MLKL, RIPK1, and RIPK3 expression increased) in piglet testis. In addition, Cd exposure decreased mRNA expression of STAR, CYP11A1, 3 beta-HSD, CYP17A1, and 17 beta-HSD of testis and the concentrations of T and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Both the mRNA and protein expression levels of the major genes in TLR4/ MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway, apoptosis signaling pathway, and necroptosis signaling pathway increased significantly and the expression levels of testosterone decreased gradually in pig Leydig cells cultured in vitro after being treated with different concentrations of Cd. Moreover, Cd reduced sexual behavior (the parameters of sniffing, chin resting, and mounting decreased) in piglets. In conclusion, Cd induced testicular cell damage via TLR4/MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway leading to testosterone synthesis disorder and sexual behavior reduction in piglets.

AB  - Systena frontalis (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), also known as the red-headed flea beetle, is a defoliating pest of a variety of crop systems, such as ornamentals and food crops. Leaf consumption by this beetle renders ornamental nursery plants, such as hydrangeas (Hydrangea paniculata Siebold, Hydrangeaceae), unsaleable. In Virginia, this insect has become a major pest at commercial nurseries, and their feeding potential on affected crops has not been quantified. In this study, the extent of their damage to individual leaves and host preference between leaf ages were determined. The rate of defoliation on mature and young hydrangea leaves was measured over 24 and 48 h and between different numbers of adults. A single adult caused up to 10% damage to a young leaf or 5% to a whole mature leaf in 24 h. Without choice, there was a higher percent damage to young leaves. When the size of leaves was controlled by cut-out mature leaves, the area damaged was still higher in young leaves when compared with mature leaves. Adult feeding between mature or young leaves was further investigated by choice assays on a caged plant and within a containerized system. In these choice assays, adults inflicted higher percent damage on mature leaves in both caged plant assays and containerized direct choice assays. The choice assays were more similar to field conditions than the nonchoice assays. This demonstrates that S. frontalis showed a preference for mature leaves over young leaves within hydrangeas.

AB  - Although milk and plant-based drinks are widely consumed foodstuffs with high nutritional value, their consumption may also mean intake of non-essential/toxic elements becoming a risk for human health. This study was aimed at determining the concentrations of essential (Ca, Co, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni and P) and non-essential/toxic (Hg, Pb, U and V) elements in milks (cow and goat), plant-based drinks (soy, almond, rice and oat) and infant formulas from organic and conventional production systems. Lactose-free, fresh and ultra-high-temperature (UHT) milks were also included. Chemical analyses were performed by means of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The content of the elements hereby assessed did not depend on the production system and the presence of lactose. However, significant differences were found in the concentrations of multiple elements when comparing sterilization methods, source (animal vs. plant-based) and animal species. Non-essential elements were not detected in milks and plant-based drinks, excepting Pb, which was detected in three samples. While the consumption of goat milk is recommended, considering the global intake of essential elements and the absence of non-essential elements, further studies should be conducted to confirm the absence of non-target toxic elements at very low trace levels. On the other hand, the best plant-based drinks are those made up with almonds (intake of Ca) and soy (K and Mg). The current results should be useful to help the population to balance the benefits and risks from milks and plant-based drinks consumption, as well as to adapt their dietary habits.

AB  - Wrinkling is prominent manifestation of aging skin. A mutant phenotype characterized by systemic wrinkles and thickened skin was discovered in Xiang pig populations with incidence about 1-3%. The feature in histological structure was epidermal hyperplasia and thickening, collagen fibers disorder. To uncover genetic mechanisms for the mutant phenotype of Xiang pigs with systemic wrinkle (WXP), a genome-wide of structural variations (SVs) in WXP was described by next generation resequencing, taking Xiang pigs (XP) and European pigs (EUP) as compares. Total of 32,308 SVs were detected from three pig groups and 965 SVs were identified specifically from WXP, involving 481 protein-coding genes. These genes were mainly enriched in nuclear structure, ECM components and immunomodulatory pathways. According to gene function and enrichment analysis, we found that 65 candidate SVs in 59 protein genes were probably related with the systemic wrinkle of WXP. Of these, several genes are reported to be associate with aging, such as EIF4G2, NOLC1, XYLT1, FUT8, MDM2 and so on. The insertion/deletion and duplication variations of SVs in these genes resulted in the loss of stop-codon or frameshift mutation, and aberrant alternative splicing of transcripts. These genes are involved in cell lamin filament, intermediate filament cytoskeleton, supramolecular complex, cell differentiation and regulation of macromolecule metabolic process etc. Our study suggested that the loss of function or aberrant expression of these genes lead to structural disorder of nuclear and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in skin cells, which probably was the genetic mechanisms for the mutant phenotype of systemic skin wrinkle of Xiang pig.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (subsequently referred to as diabetes), a non-communicable and chronic metabolic disorder, remains a global epidemic with a high burden of morbidity. Traditional healers in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province of South Africa traditionally use medicinal plants in treating diabetes. The aim of this study was to document medicinal plants used by traditional healers in this district to treat diabetes. Sixty traditional healers made up of fifteen traditional healers from each of the four local municipalities (Thulamela, Makhado, Musina and Collins Chabane) in the Vhembe district were interviewed, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Ethnobotanical data including the local names of the plants, plant parts used, method of preparation, and dosages of the remedies were documented. Sixty-three medicinal plant species from 37 families were documented for treating diabetes. The top cited medicinal plants include Elephantorrhiza elephantina (Burch.) Skeels, Elaeodendron trasvaalense (Burtt Davy) R.H.Archer, Brackenridgea zanguebarica Oliv., Moringa oleifera Lam., Securidaca longipedunculata Fresen, Cassia abbreviata Oliv., Tabernaemontana elegans Stapf., Capparis tomentosa Lam., Dichrostachys cinerea (L.) Wight and Arn, and Anthocleista grandiflora Gilg. Twentysix species were recorded for the first time in the folkloric treatment of diabetes, including the two species (Aloe grandidentata Salm-Dyck. and Grewia retinervis Burret.) with no prior record of being used as a traditional remedy for any specific ailment. Many of the plants are used in combinations. The most frequently used plant parts were roots (47%), followed by stems (23%), and leaves (17%). Majority of the plant materials (62%) were sourced from the wild. Decoctions (68%) and infusions (25%) were the leading methods of preparation. The documentation of these plants highlights the value of further ethnobotanical studies to curb the erosion of important traditional knowledge systems for the benefit of both the present and future generations.

AB  - Critical source areas (CSAs) can act as a source of phosphorus (P) in surface waters by releasing soil P to porewater during frequent rainfall events. The extent of P release under short-term, frequent submergence has not been systematically studied in CSAs in New Zealand. A study was conducted to explore the potential of three contrasting dairy and sheep/beef farm soils (Recent, Pallic and Allophanic soils) to release P to porewater and pondwater under short-term and frequent submergence. Five undisturbed soil blocks (20 x 20 x 15 cm) were sampled from each soil. Porewater samplers and half-cell platinum electrodes for in-situ redox potential measurements were installed at 2 and 10 cm depths from the soil surface. Six submerged events were created by maintaining a 5 cm waterhead. Porewater and pondwater samples were collected immediately and three days after each submergence event. After three days of submergence, the soil blocks were drained and maintained at 70% of water holding capacity for 10 days before the next submergence event. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), pH, dissolved organic carbon, cations, anions, and alkalinity of the water samples were measured. Soil chemical P fractions were assessed in initial soils and soils in the middle and end of the experiment. Thermodynamic modelling was used to infer dissolution and formation of P and P-associated minerals. The Recent soil released P to porewater at both depths and to pondwater. The Pallic soil released P to porewater at both depths but did not change pondwater DRP. Allophanic soil sorbed P and did not increase DRP either in porewater or pondwater. The average pondwater DRP of the three soils during submergence were 17 to 65-fold higher than the New Zealand lowland river target DRP concentration (0.01 mg/L). The mechanisms of P release from the Recent and Pallic soils were desorption and reductive dissolution of Mn(II) minerals. Reductive dissolution of Fe(II) minerals was not supported by fractionation or modelling results. Decreases in labile, moderately labile and stable P fractions contributed to P release in the Recent soil, while increases in the labile and moderately labile P fractions contributed to P retention in the Pallic and Allophanic soils. This study highlighted that the Recent soil is riskier than the other two soils in releasing P upon short-term submergence and the potential use of Allophanic soil as a P sorbing material in CSAs to mitigate P loss.

AB  - Introduction: Cognitive Map Theory predicts that the hippocampus (HPC) plays a specialized, time -invariant role in supporting allocentric spatial memory, while Standard Consolidation Theory makes the competing prediction that the HPC plays a time -limited role, with more remote memories gaining independence of HPC function. These theories, however, are largely informed by the results of laboratory -based tests that are unlikely to simulate the demands of representing real -world environments in humans. Validation of these theories is further limited by an overall focus on spatial memory of newly encountered environments and on individuals with extensive lesions to the HPC and to surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions. The current study incorporates naturalistic tests of spatial memory based on recently and remotely encountered environments navigated by individuals with lesions to the HPC/MTL or that are limited to the HPC's major output, the fornix. Methods: Four participants with bilateral HPC/MTL and/or fornix lesions drew sketch maps of recently and remotely experienced neighbourhoods and houses. Tests of the appearance, distances, and routes between landmarks from the same real -world environments were also administered. Performance on the tasks was compared to that of control participants closely matched in terms of exposure to the same neighbourhoods and home environments as well as to actual maps. Results: The performance of individuals with fornix/MTL lesions was found to be largely comparable to that of controls on objective tests of spatial memory, other than one case who was impaired on remote and recent conditions for several tasks. The nature of deficits in recent and remote spatial memory were further revealed on house floorplan drawings, which contained spatial distortions, room/structure transpositions, and omissions, and on neighbourhood sketch maps, which were intact in terms of overall layout but sparse in details such as landmarks. Conclusion: Lab -based tests of spatial memory of newly learned environments are unlikely to fully capture patterns of spared and impaired representations of real -world environments (e.g., peripheral features, configurations). Naturalistic tasks, including generative drawing tasks, indicate that contrary to Cognitive Map Theory, neither HPC nor MTL are critical for allocentric gross representations of large-scale environments. Conversely, the HPC appears critical for representing detailed spatial information of local naturalistic environments and environmental objects regardless of the age of the memory, contrary to Standard Consolidation Theory.

AB  - The search behavior and parasitism of trichogrammatids can be affected by volatile compounds emitted by plants under herbivory and/or oviposition. Our aim was to evaluate the chemotactic behavior and parasitism rates of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) females against two varieties of corn and one of rice that underwent herbivory or oviposition by Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). In a glass Y-tube olfactometer, the parasitoids were given the choice between plants damaged by either herbivory or oviposition, with and without sentinel eggs, against those without damage. We also evaluated the average of parasitized eggs and the parasitoid emergence in sentinel eggs, which were next to plants that underwent herbivory contrasted with eggs next to undamaged plants. Trichogramma pretiosum was more attracted to rice and corn plants evaluated 24 h after herbivory compared to undamaged plants. Parasitoids preferred oviposited rice plants over control plants. Oviposited corn plants after 48 h were more attractive than non-oviposited plants without sentinel eggs. In the presence of sentinel eggs on the olfactometer tests, there was no difference in oviposition preference in corn. Parasitism was higher in sentinel eggs located near plants damaged by herbivory. This suggested that the egg parasitoid T. pretiosum not only uses chemical clues from rice and corn plants, damaged by herbivory, but also uses them as a strategy to search and increase parasitism in S. frugiperda eggs. However, the results of oviposition tests showed that plants of different species and varieties might respond differently to this type of damage.

AB  - In this work, we studied the impact of chronic iron exposure, in the form of iron sulfate (FeSo4), on affective and cognitive disorders and oxidative stress in the male Wistar rat. The treatment was carried out for 8 weeks, the rats received an intraperitoneal injection of iron at different doses: 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg. Affective and cognitive disorders are assessed in open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), forced swimming test (FST), Morris water maze (MWM), and Y-maze. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of each animal were taken for biochemical examination. Our results show that iron exerts anxiogenic and depressogenic effects, which were observed first at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg and continued in a dose-dependent manner up to the maximum tested dose of 1 mg/kg. According to results from the MWM and Y-maze tests, continuous exposure to iron induces cognitive disorders that are defined by the disturbance of working memory and influences spatial learning performance causing a deficit of spatial memory retention. We noted that chronic exposure to iron can be associated with the appearance of a state of oxidative stress in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex demonstrated by an increase in lipid peroxidation, an increase in nitric oxide, and also by disturbances in the antioxidant defense systems following a determination of the concentrations of catalase. In conclusion, we can deduce from this work that chronic iron exposure can be related to the induction of cognitive and affective disorders and oxidative stress.

AB  - Breath and diet samples were collected from 29 taxa of animals at the Zurich and Basel Zoos to characterize the carbon isotope enrichment between breath and diet. Diet samples were measured for delta C-13 and breath samples for CH4/CO2 ratios and for the respired component of delta C-13 using the Keeling plot approach. Different digestive physiologies included coprophagous and non-coprophagous hindgut fermenters, and non-ruminant and ruminant foregut fermenters. Isotope enrichments from diet to breath were 0.8 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand, 3.5 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand, 2.3 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand, and 4.1 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand, respectively. CH4/CO2 ratios were strongly correlated with isotope enrichments for both hindgut and foregut digestive strategies, although CH4 production was not the sole reason for isotope enrichment. Average CH4/CO2 ratios per taxon ranged over several orders of magnitude from 10(-5) to 10(-1). The isotope enrichment values for diet-breath can be used to further estimate the isotope enrichment from diet-enamel because Passey et al. (2005b) found a nearly constant isotope enrichment for breath-enamel for diverse mammalian taxa. The understanding of isotope enrichment factors from diet to breath and diet to enamel will have important applications in the field of animal physiology, and possibly also for wildlife ecology and paleontology.

AB  - Simple Summary Around birth and during lactation, sows are often confined to narrow farrowing crates in order to restrict their movements to prevent piglet crushing by sows. Since these housing systems are increasingly questioned for sow welfare reasons, more research is being carried out on alternatives such as loose-housing farrowing systems. As one central aspect of sows' maternal behaviour, nursing behaviour impacts the mortality rate and growth performance of the piglets. Since maternal behaviour is, in turn, affected by the housing environment, this study aimed to compare a farrowing pen without sow confinement to one with a crate regarding the nursing behaviour of sows. The study results underline that sows' nursing behaviour was influenced by the housing system and, furthermore, that the nursing behaviour of loose-housed sows was more similar to that of sows in semi-natural conditions. Unconfined sows terminated more nursing bouts and nursed piglets for a shorter period. The nursing frequency decreased in the course of lactation in both systems, whereas the proportion of sow-terminated nursing bouts increased in the four-week examination period. These might be the first steps in the natural weaning of piglets. Sows confined to farrowing crates are restricted in performing natural behaviour such as maternal behaviour. Loose-housing farrowing pens (LH) and farrowing pens with crates (FC) were compared regarding sows' nursing behaviour via video analyses over four weeks per batch (one day per week). Nursing frequency was similar in LH and FC pens (1.25 +/- 0.82 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.75 nursings/sow/hour; p > 0.05). However, nursing duration differed between the two systems (LH: 5.7 +/- 4.6 min vs. FC: 7.0 +/- 5.0 min; odds ratio (OR) 1.168, p = 0.011). In LH pens, more nursing bouts were sow-terminated than in FC pens (OR 0.427, p = 0.001). The probability of sow-terminated nursing occurring increased from week 1 to week 4 (OR 3.479, adjusted p (p(adj)) < 0.001), while that of observing unnursed piglets decreased from week 1 to week 4 (OR 0.301, p(adj) < 0.001) and rose with increasing litter size (OR 1.174, p = 0.010). We conclude that nursing behaviour was affected by the farrowing system, with shorter nursing duration and more nursing terminations by the sow in LH than in FC pens. Since this corresponds to the nursing behaviour of sows in semi-natural conditions, it can be assumed that sows in LH pens are more likely to exhibit natural nursing behaviour.

AB  - Piglets afflicted with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) experience severe diarrhea and elevated death rates, leading to substantial financial losses in the pig farming sector. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of saponins on PEDV within Vero cells by utilizing different methodologies to evaluate their anti-PEDV effect. By producing 40 saponins, we have discovered that No. 29, No. 31, No. 35, and No. 38 exhibit properties that make them effective against PEDV, serving as potential drugs. The findings showed that in a clear dose-dependent manner, the mRNA levels of PEDV were significantly inhibited in the high, middle, and low-dose groups of No. 29, No. 31, No. 35, and No. 38, when compared to the PEDV control. The four tested saponins significantly inhibited the levels of PEDV N contents and viral titers. Furthermore, concentration of cytotoxicity 50% (CC50) values for No. 29, No. 31, No. 35, and No. 38 saponins were 37.13 mu M, 52.86 mu M, 44.98 mu M, and 43.81 mu M, respectively, demonstrating the safety of these medications in clinical environments. Collectively, these findings indicate that the four examined saponins could efficiently modulate the immune response against PEDV and hold promise for utilization in antiviral treatments.

AB  - Although bees and wasps are well known as aposematically coloured insects, the role of their aposematic patterns has not been studied to the same extent as other animal and insect groups, i.e., butterflies or beetles. We focused on the fauna of Central Europe, a region with a high diversity of bees and wasps, with more than 1200 species recorded. For each species, we recorded whether aposematic colouration was present as well as which of the main four colouration combinations was present, for both males and females. The same was studied for the three main groups of mimics: clearwing moths, hoverflies, and longhorn beetles. We found that more than 73% of bees and wasps were aposematically coloured, with the black-yellow combination being the most common, recorded in more than half of all aposematically coloured species. The proportions of the main colour combinations varied among the studied groups of bees and wasps. All Chrysididae were metallic. Pompilidae were dominantly black-red, while most Mutillidae exhibited a black-red white colouration. Parasitic species were more often aposematic (more than 95%) than nesting predators and nesting herbivores were. Regarding the mimics, clearwing moths were nearly all aposematic, and they used Batesian mimicry as their main defence against predators. In contrast, only approximately half of the longhorn beetles were aposematic, whereas the rest of the species used crypsis. All groups of mimics were most commonly coloured black-yellow, but several species in all three groups also possessed the other three colour combinations. Aposematic coloration, along with both Batesian and M & uuml;llerian mimicry, functions as a warning signal to vertebrate predators but can also deter insect predators and parasites. However, these interactions remain understudied and deserve further investigation.

AB  - The diet of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L. 1758) was studied in the years 1990-1993, 1996-2000, and 2005-2013 in Bol'shekhekhtsirskii State Nature Reserve (southern part of the Amur River region). The range of foods consumed by the red fox in the nature reserve is pretty broad, but small mammals, including voles, are the main component of its ration (occurrence frequency (OF) = 71.0%, nutritive ratio (NR) = 64.5%). Birds and wild plants (fruits) are additional food sources for the red fox. Reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects play a supplementary role in its diet. However, during the warm season (April-October), fruits of wild plants and insects can locally constitute a significant part of the ration. Within the nature reserve, anthropogenic foods (domestic animals and their corpses, cultivated plants, and food waste) do not play an important role in the nutrition of the red fox. But in areas adjacent to human settlements, domestic animals and their carcasses (cats, dogs, ungulates, and chicken) constitute a significant part of the red fox's ration in the warm season (OF = 38.2%, NR = 29.6%). In agricultural landscapes south of the nature reserve, mice (OF = 33.3%, NR = 24.8%) and voles (OF = 45.4%, K = 33.9%) are the primary food sources for the red fox among mammals during the cold season; inside the nature reserve, the values of these parameters are significantly different. Red foxes often consume fruits of cultivated plants, especially soybeans (OF = 39.4%, NR = 14.1%). In the vicinity of human settlements in the southern part of Primorskii krai, domestic animals and their corpses are frequently consumed by red foxes during the warm season (OF = 24.0%, NR = 19.8%). In the southern part of the Amur River region, anthropogenic foods locally constitute an integral part of the red fox's ration playing a supplementary role in its nutrition; however, in some situations, the significance of such foods can increase substantially. The share of anthropogenic foods in the red fox's diet decreases as the distance between its habitats and human settlements increases. Apparently, the consumption of anthropogenic foods by the red fox is typical for developed regions in the southern part of the Russian Far East.

AB  - Plants defend against chewing herbivores by up-regulating jasmonic acid (JA) signaling, which activates downstream signaling cascades and produces numerous secondary metabolites that act as defense molecules against the herbivores. Although secondary metabolism always remains a focus of research, primary metabolism is also reported to be realigned upon herbivory. However, JA signaling-mediated modulation of primary metabolites and their metabolic pathways in plants are mostly unexplored. Here, we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics aided with computational statistical frameworks on wild type Arabidopsis, mutants of active JA receptor (i.e., CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1, COI1-1) and downstream transcription factor (i.e., MYC2) to navigate the JA signaling-mediated primary metabolism alterations during herbivory. Pathway and metabolite's chemical class enrichment analysis revealed JA signaling is crucial for constitutive as well as herbivore-induced primary metabolism and topology of their interaction networks. JA signaling majorly modulated alterations of sugars, amino acids and related metabolites. Herbivory-mediated sugar depletion and induction of methionine for aliphatic glucosinolates are also dependent on JA signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate trails of JA signaling-mediated primary metabolic alterations associated with herbivory.

AB  - Nicotiana benthamiana, a widely acknowledged laboratory model plant for molecular studies, exhibits lethality to certain insect pests and can serve as a dead-end trap plant for pest control in the field. However, the underlying mechanism of N. benthamiana's resistance against insects remains unknown. Here, we elucidate that the lethal effect of N. benthamiana on the whitefly Bemisia tabaci arises from the toxic glandular trichome exudates. By comparing the metabolite profiles of trichome exudates, we found that 51 metabolites, including five O-acyl sugars (O-AS) with medium-chain acyl moieties, were highly accumulated in N. benthamiana. Silencing of two O-AS biosynthesis genes, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) and Isopropyl malate synthase-C (IPMS-C), significantly reduced the O-AS levels in N. benthamiana and its resistance against whiteflies. Additionally, we demonstrated that the higher expression levels of BCKD and IPMS-C in the trichomes of N. benthamiana contribute to O-AS synthesis and consequently enhance whitefly resistance. Furthermore, overexpression of NbBCKD and NbIPMS-C genes in the cultivated tobacco Nicotiana tabacum enhanced its resistance to whiteflies. Our study revealed the metabolic and molecular mechanisms underlying the lethal effect of N. benthamiana on whiteflies and presents a promising avenue for improving whitefly resistance.

AB  - The present study, regarding the orexin receptors having a pivotal role in reward-related psychostimulant use disorder (PUD), aimed to investigate the role of orexin-2 (OX2) receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (HPC) in the extinction and reinstatement of methamphetamine (METH)-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). In the first set of investigations, to determine the role of OX2 receptors in the extinction of METH-induced CPP, rats were daily given (during the extinction) bilaterally intra-CA1 region different doses of TCS OX2 29 (1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol/0.5 mu l 12% DMSO) as the selective OX2 receptor antagonist. Then, to demonstrate the role of OX2 receptors in the reinstatement of METH-induced CPP after the extinction was established, each rat bilat-erally received TCS OX2 29 at the same doses in the CA1 region before injection of the sub-threshold (priming) dose of METH (0.25 mg/kg, sc) on the reinstatement day. The data revealed that the administration of TCS OX2 29 in the CA1 region reduces the mean extinction latency and suppresses the reinstatement of METH-seeking behavior in extinguished rats. Additionally, the potency of TCS OX2 29 to inhibit the reinstatement phase was higher compared to the potency of this drug to modulate the extinction phase of METH-induced CPP. Accord-ingly, it could be concluded that the blockade of the OX2 receptors in this area might be an essential application and potential therapeutics in treating METH use disorder.

AB  - The rapid evolution of pest resistance threatens the sustainable utilization of bioinsecticides such as abamectin, and so deciphering the molecular mechanisms affecting toxicity and resistance is essential for their long-term application. Historical studies of abamectin resistance in arthropods have mainly focused on mechanisms involving the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) targets, with the role of metabolic processes less clear. The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, is a generalist herbivore notorious for rapidly developing resistance to pesticides worldwide, and abamectin has been widely used for its control in the field. After reanalyzing previous transcriptome and RNA-seq data, we here identified an ABC transporter subfamily C gene in T. urticae named multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (TuMRP1), whose expression differed between susceptible and resistant populations. Synergism bioassays with the inhibitor MK-571, the existence of a genetic association between TuMRP1 expression and susceptibility to abamectin, and the effect of RNA interference mediated silencing of TuMRP1 were all consistent with a direct role of this transporter protein in the toxicity of abamectin. Although ABC transporters are often involved in removing insecticidal compounds from cells, our data suggest either an alternative role for these proteins in the mechanism of action of abamectin or highlight an indirect association between their expression and abamectin toxicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND The utilization of chemical fertilizers is a key measure for maintaining tea yield and quality, but excessive use has negative environmental impacts. The substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer has been promoted to sustain crop yield and soil quality. However, knowledge gaps regarding the effects of organic substitution on soil quality and tea yield in tea plantations still exist. RESULTS A field experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of organic substitution treatments (i.e. 25% partial substitution: biogas slurry + green manure + formula fertilizer, BFG; sheep manure + formula fertilizer, OFF; 100% complete substitution: sheep manure + green manure, OG) on the soil quality, tea yield and quality, and nitrogen utilization efficiency in southwestern China. Results showed that all organic substitution treatments slightly increased soil pH, and significantly increased soil organic matter by 13.22-14.88% compared to conventional fertilization (CF). The BFG treatment was the most effective in enhancing the soil quality index, showing increases of 16.80%, 8.37% and 24.87% higher than the CF, OFF and OG treatments, respectively. Tea yield significantly increased under the BFG, OFF and OG treatments by 11.97%, 13.58% and 5.90% compared to CF, respectively. The BFG treatment increased the amino acid content by 7.78% and decreased the tea polyphenol/amino acid ratio by 6.87%. Additionally, the BFG, OFF and OG treatments greatly increased the nitrogen utilization efficiency of young sprouts by 70.71%, 82.54% and 34.28%, respectively. CONCLUSION Overall, partial organic substitution could effectively improve soil quality while maintaining tea yield. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Prion diseases are chronic and fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of disease-specific prion protein (PrPSc), spongiform changes, neuronal loss, and gliosis. Growing evidence shows that the neuroinflammatory response is a key component of prion diseases and contributes to neurodegeneration. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been proposed as important mediators of innate immune responses triggered in the central nervous system in other human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, little is known about the role of TLRs in prion diseases, and their involvement in the neuropathology of natural scrapie has not been studied. We assessed the gene expression of ovine TLRs in four anatomically distinct brain regions in natural scrapie-infected sheep and evaluated the possible correlations between gene expression and the pathological hallmarks of prion disease. We observed significant changes in TLR expression in scrapie-infected sheep that correlate with the degree of spongiosis, PrPSc deposition, and gliosis in each of the regions studied. Remarkably, TLR4 was the only gene upregulated in all regions, regardless of the severity of neuropathology. In the hippocampus, we observed milder neuropathology associated with a distinct TLR gene expression profile and the presence of a peculiar microglial morphology, called rod microglia, described here for the first time in the brain of scrapie-infected sheep. The concurrence of these features suggests partial neuroprotection of the hippocampus. Finally, a comparison of the findings in naturallyinfected sheep versus an ovinized mouse model (tg338 mice) revealed distinct patterns of TLRgene expression.

AB  - Quantifying the intensity of leaf herbivory pressure is crucial for understanding the interaction between plants and herbivores in both applied and basic science. Visual estimates and digital analysis have been commonly used to estimate leaf herbivore damage but are time-consuming which limits the amount of data that can be collected and prevent answering big picture questions that require large-scale sampling of herbivory pressure. Recent developments in deep learning have provided a potential tool for automatic collection of ecological data from various sources. However, most applications have focused on identification and counting, and there is a lack of deep learning tools for quantitative estimation of leaf herbivore damage. Here, we trained generative adversarial networks (GANs) to predict the intact status of damaged leaves and applied image processing technique to estimate the area and percentage of leaf damage. We first described procedures for collecting leaf images, training GAN models, predicting intact leaves and calculating leaf area, with a Python package provided to enable hands-on application of these procedures. Then, we collected a large leaf data set to train a universal deep learning model and developed an online app HerbiEstim to allow direct use of pretrained models to estimate herbivory damage of leaves. We tested these methods using both simulated and real leaf damage data. The procedures provided in our study greatly improved the efficiency of leaf herbivore damage estimation. Our test demonstrated that the reconstruction of damaged leaf image resembled the ground-truth image with a similarity of 98.8%. The estimation of leaf herbivore damage exhibited a high accuracy with an averaged root mean square error of 1.6% and had a general applicability to different plant taxa and leaf shapes. Overall, our work demonstrated the feasibility of applying deep learning techniques to quantify leaf herbivory intensity. The use of GANs allows automatic estimation of leaf damage, representing a major advantage of the method. The Python package and the online app with pre-trained models will facilitate the use of our method for the analysis of large data sets of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Introduction Early brain injury (EBI) plays a key role in the devastating outcomes after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Autophagy and apoptosis may share a common molecular inducer that regulates the process of cell death. FoxO1, as a key regulator of neuronal autophagy which is involved in apoptosis, has not been reported in SAH rats. This work was to investigate the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of FoxO1 on EBI after SAH by regulating autophagy. Methods In this study, we constructed the SAH model. In experiment I, low dose (50 mu l of 1 x 10(8) IU/ml) or high dose (50 mu l of 1 x 10(10) IU/ml) of FoxO1 gene overexpressed adenovirus vector was injected into the lateral ventricle of rats before SAH. In experiment II, we reported the effect of FoxO1 overexpress on nerve function recovery, oedema, BBB leakage, neuronal death in rats after SAH through autophagy regulation. Post-SAH evaluation included neurological function score, brain water content, evans blue exosmosis, pathological changes, inflammatory response and apoptosis. Results The experiment I showed that either low or high dose of ad-FoxO1 could significantly improve nerve function, reduce cerebral water content and reduce blood-brain barrier (BBB) destruction in rats, indicating that ad-FoxO1 had a protective effect on brain injury in rats EBI after SAH. In addition, ad-FoxO1 promoted autophagy in rat hippocampal tissue, as evidenced by accumulation of LC3II/I and Beclin-1 and degradation of p62. Furthermore, ad-FoxO1 inhibited the inflammatory response and apoptosis of rat hippocampal neurons after SAH. The experiment II showed that both ad-FoxO1 and rapamycin attenuated the injury of nerve function in rats after SAH, and this synergistic effect further reduced cerebral edema and evansblue extravasation, decreased hippocampus neuronal cell apoptosis, and declined inflammatory response. However, this was contrary to the results of chloroquine. These findings suggested that FoxO1 regulated the neural function of EBI after SAH through the autophagy pathway. Conclusions The findings in this study was beneficial for identifying the novel therapeutic target for the treatment of SAH.

AB  - The astroglial glutamate transporter in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is critically involved in chronic pain-induced cognitive and psychiatric abnormalities. We have previously reported that LDN-212320, a glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) activator, attenuates complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced acute and chronic nociceptive pain. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying GLT-1 modulation in the hippocampus and ACC during chronic pain-induced cognitive deficit-like and anxiety-like behaviors remain unknown. Here, we have investigated the effects of LDN-212320 on CFA-induced chronic pain associated with cognitive deficit-like and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. We have evaluated the effects of LDN212320 on CFA-induced impaired spatial, working, and recognition memory using Y-maze and object-place recognition tests. In addition, we have determined the effects of LDN-21230 on chronic pain-induced anxiety- like behaviors using elevated plus maze and marble burying test. We have also examined the effects of LDN212320 on cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protein kinase A (PKA), and Ca2 + /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) expression in the hippocampus and ACC during CFA-induced cognitive deficit-like and anxiety-like behaviors using the Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. Pretreatment with LDN-212320 (20 mg/kg) significantly attenuated CFA- induced impaired spatial, working, and recognition memory. Furthermore, LDN-212320 (20 mg/kg) significantly reduced CFA-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, LDN-212320 (20 mg/kg) significantly reversed CFA-induced decreased pCREB, BDNF, PKA and CaMKII expression in the hippocampus and ACC. Overall, these results suggest that the LDN-212320 prevents CFA-induced cognitive deficit-like and anxiety-like behaviors by activating CaMKII/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway in the hippocampus and ACC. Therefore, LDN-212320 could be a potential treatment for chronic pain associated with cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behaviors.

AB  - Background: The purpose of the research was to investigate the effect of mulberry leaf powder (MP) of varying levels on growth performance, immuno-antioxidant status, meat quality and intestinal health. A total of 120 healthy finishing pigs (Duroc x [Landrace x Yorkshire], 72.2 +/- 4.8 kg) were selected for this experiment and divided into four treatments, according to randomized complete block design, with three replicates of 10 pigs each (barrow:gilt = 1:1). The dietary treatments were as follows: (1) Ctrl, corn-soybean meal basal diet; (2) MP_6: basal diet with 6% MP. (3) MP_9: basal diet with 9% MP; (4) MP_12, basal diet with 12% MP. The whole experiment lasted for 33 days. Results: Compared to the Ctrl, dietary supplementation of 9% MP had no negative effects on growth performance, antioxidative capacity, intestinal digestive enzyme activities and inflammatory factors, carcass trait, the lipid profile and amino acid of muscle or related mRNA expression. MP_6 and MP_12 showed detrimental effects on average daily gain (p < 0.05) and digestibility (p < 0.05) of dry matter, crude protein and gross energy. Furthermore, MP_9 could improve (p < 0.05) the level of serum immunoglobulin M, enhance (p < 0.05) the a*(24h) of meat, up-regulate (p < 0.05) the mRNA expression of occludin and Mucin-2, increase (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and decrease (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of Campylobacter in the hindgut. Conclusion: Summarizing our study, dietary supplementation of 9% MP had no negative effects on growth performance, antioxidative capacity, intestinal digestive enzyme activities and inflammatory factors, carcass trait, the lipid profile and amino acid of muscle, or related mRNA expression. Furthermore, MP_9 could improve serum immunity, enhance meat quality, up-regulate the mRNA expression related to the mechanical and chemical barriers and enrich the beneficial microbiota of the hindgut. Hence, dietary supplementation of 9% MP in finishing pigs may be advisable.

AB  - This study explores the under-researched domain of long-term stimulant treatment in children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The necessity for extended treatment duration, often accompanied by safety concerns and side effects leading to treatment discontinuation, underscores the significance of this investigation. Concurrently, comparative studies have revealed adverse impacts on vulnerable regions within the hippocampal formation, accompanied by behavioral perturbations. We employed computerized tests and virtual reality to assess spatial memory, pattern separation, and object recognition memory in a cohort of children diagnosed with ADHD receiving stimulant treatment. We compared their performance to a group of neurotypical peers. Our findings indicate that the ADHD group exhibited a lower performance in spatial memory, pattern separation, and object recognition memory than ND group. Intriguingly, a positive relationship emerged between the duration of stimulant treatment and performance in these variables. Notably, this improvement was not immediate to MPH treatment but becomes significant after 24 months of treatment. In contrast to previous comparative investigations, our study did not reveal a detrimental impact on spatial navigation, object recognition memory, or pattern separation, despite the known interplay of these cognitive processes with the hippocampal formation. These results shed new light on the nuanced effects of stimulant treatment in ADHD, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive understanding of long-term treatment outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary With the rapid progress of laser technology and its expanding applications, there is a growing need for detailed information regarding its effects on living tissue and the treatment of skin damage caused by this kind of radiation. Both collagen levels and apoptosis-related protein expressions were quantitatively and comparatively analyzed in porcine skin injuries induced by laser exposure. The findings revealed skin injuries primarily manifested as white spots and burnt spots. There was a progressive increase in the size and depth of skin damage as the laser dosage was elevated. Laser-induced apoptotic cells in porcine skin injuries were significantly increased in the late stages of healing. Subjection to a 1064 nm laser led to a decline in skin healing efficiency as the radiation dosage escalated, leading to disrupted collagen arrangement and inadequate collagen content. Heightened Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 protein expressions in healing skin tissues were directly linked to escalated cell apoptosis.Abstract To investigate the associated factors concerning collagen and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in porcine skin injuries induced by laser exposure, live pig skin was irradiated at multiple spots one time, using a grid-array method with a 1064 nm laser at different power outputs. The healing process of the laser-treated areas, alterations in collagen structure, and changes in apoptosis were continuously observed and analyzed from 6 h to 28 days post-irradiation. On the 28th day following exposure, wound contraction and recovery were notably sluggish in the medium-high dose group, displaying more premature and delicate type III collagen within the newly regenerated tissues. The collagen density in these groups was roughly 37-58% of that in the normal group. Between days 14 and 28 after irradiation, there was a substantial rise in apoptotic cell count in the forming epidermis and granulation tissue of the medium-high dose group, in contrast to the normal group. Notably, the expression of proapoptotic proteins Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 surged significantly 14 days after irradiation in the medium-high dose group and persisted at elevated levels on the 28th day. During the later stage of wound healing, augmented apoptotic cell population and insufficient collagen generation in the newly generated skin tissue of the medium-high dose group were closely associated with delayed wound recovery.

AB  - Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky 1853) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), the Asian Longhorned Beetle, is native to temperate and subtropical areas of China and the Korean peninsula. Due to its wide range of host plants, it is considered among the most economically important invasive plant pests. The morphological identification of A. glabripennis larvae can be confirmed by DNA barcoding, but obtaining the specimens from infested trees can be a demanding and challenging task. Therefore, non-invasive diagnostic tools based on DNA extracted from frass samples can be of key importance in phytosanitary surveys. In this study, an in silico generated real-time quantitative PCR test was developed for the detection of A. glabripennis DNA from frass material, which is naturally extruded from larval tunnels through cracks in the bark. Specificity was confirmed against a wide range of other wood-boring insect species frequently encountered during phytosanitary surveys and inclusivity was demonstrated for different populations of A. glabripennis from all main European outbreak areas. The test proved sensitive and reliable in detecting A. glabripennis DNA extracted from woody frass material of Acer saccharinum and Aesculus hippocastanum at least up to the 100-fold dilution. Furthermore, the test allowed the molecular identification of any life stage of the insect, including eggs and young larvae, whose morphological identification is impossible or very challenging. This study provides a reliable and sensitive molecular tool to detect A. glabripennis DNA in woody frass material, thus allowing a non-invasive sampling approach.

In order to enforce legal emission limit values that aim to reduce these adverse effects, reliable methods for the quantification of odor emissions are needed. The standard EN 13725 describes a method to quantify odor concentration, which is based on the use of human assessors as sensors. Previously published work that studied the performance characteristics of this method indicates that the variability of results between different laboratories is higher than expected and that the uncertainty associated with this method may be underestimated. We analyze here a unique data set, which contains the response of 368 assessors that participated in 21 odor proficiency tests performed in 2016 -2022. By investigating the response of the smallest unit of an odor measurement by EN 13725, namely the individual assessor, as opposed to the panel, we gain unprecedented insight into the sources of inter -laboratory variations in odor measurements. Our results indicate that the assessor sensitivity to n -butanol is not transferable to other odorants and odor mixtures, which is contrary to the assumption made in EN 13725. By Monte -Carlo simulation coupled with our data set, we investigate how the responses of individual assessors transfer to panel responses, focusing on the influence of panel size, panel selection strategy and number of rounds. We find that for the laboratories investigated, larger panels only modestly reduce the inter -laboratory variability and we attribute this effect to non-random selection of assessors for the panels of these laboratories. The present work provides new insight into the sources of inter -laboratory variability in odor emission monitoring and is expected to be useful in the further development of reliable methods for odor concentration measurements and odor abatement technology.

AB  - Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common sensory deficit worldwide. Due to the heterogeneity of causes for SNHL, effective treatment options remain scarce, creating an unmet need for novel drugs in the field of otology. Cochlear implantation (CI) currently is the only established method to restore hearing function in profound SNHL and deaf patients. The cochlear implant bypasses the non-functioning sensory hair cells (HCs) and electrically stimulates the neurons of the cochlear nerve. CI also benefits patients with residual hearing by combined electrical and auditory stimulation. However, the insertion of an electrode array into the cochlea induces an inflammatory response, characterized by the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis and necrosis of HCs, putting residual hearing at risk. Here, we characterize the small molecule AC102, a pyridoindole, for its protective effects on residual hearing in CI. In a gerbil animal model of CI, AC102 significantly improves the recovery of hearing thresholds across multiple frequencies and confines the cochlear trauma to the directly mechanically injured area. In addition, AC102 significantly preserves auditory nerve fibers and inner HC synapses throughout the whole cochlea. In vitro experiments in an ethanol challenged HT22 cell-line revealed significant and dose-responsive anti-apoptotic effects following the treatment of with AC102. Further, AC102 treatment resulted in significant downregulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in an organotypic ex vivo model of electrode insertion trauma (EIT). These results suggest that AC102's effects are likely elicited during the inflammatory phase of EIT and mediated by anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties, highlighting AC102 as a promising compound for hearing preservation during CI. Moreover, since the inflammatory response in CI shares similarities to that in other etiologies of SNHL, AC102 may be inferred as a potential general treatment option for various inner ear conditions.

AB  - Design: guidelines require an adequate overlap length for reinforcing bars, especially in extended spans of elements constructed from Reinforced Concrete (RC). Insufficient overlap can have adverse effects on key characteristics like bending strength and deformability of RC beams. The potential danger of failure in such elements is a significant concern as is considered a potential threat, and this study addresses it through experimental identification and numerical analysis to be mitigated carefully in this study to enhance the safety and sustain- ability of buildings to mitigate the risk of failure. The current investigation is centered on investigating the structural behavior of cantilevered RC beams exhibiting inadequate overlap between reinforcing bars in the hogging moment region. These beams have been strengthened through the application of ferrocement layers of Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC). The experimental study consisted of eleven beams, which were categorized into four groups and subjected to bending loads until they reached failure. The research assessed various factors, such as the casting method (whether cast-in-situ or precast), the installation technique (involving the use of epoxy, or epoxy with anchors), and the length of the ECC layer. This layer was configured to have a length of 30 & Oslash;, & Oslash;, 40 & Oslash;, & Oslash;, and 50 & Oslash;, & Oslash;, with & Oslash; representing the diameter of the reinforcing bars along the zone subjected to hogging moments. According to findings, strengthening of specimens exhibiting insufficient steel overlap through an ferrocement ECC layer exhibited an improved overall structural behavior compared to the defective control beam. The most significant enhancement in both failure mode and load-deflection behavior was observed in beams strengthened through the incorporation of a cast-in-situ ECC layer with anchor bolts. Additionally, augmenting the strengthening length not only increased the initial stiffness of the reinforced beams but also enhanced their energy absorption capacity. Furthermore, the study involved the construction of a numerical simulation employing the Finite Element Method (FEM) simulating the observed behavior in experimentally tested beams. The model's precision was validated through a comparison of its results with the experimental data, revealing a satisfactory level of accuracy.

AB  - The accurate estimation of basal endogenous losses (BEL) of amino acids at the ileum is indispensable to improve nutrient utilization efficiency. This study used a quantitative proteomic approach to identify variations in BEL in the ileal digesta of growing pigs fed a nitrogen-free diet (NFD) or a casein diet (CAS). Eight barrow pigs (39.8 +/- 6.3 kg initial body weight (BW)) were randomly assigned to a 2 x 2 crossover design. A total of 348 proteins were identified and quantified in both treatments, of which 101 showed a significant differential abundance between the treatments (p < 0.05). Functional and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the endogenous proteins were associated with intestinal metabolic function. Furthermore, differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in the digesta of pigs fed the NFD enriched terms and pathways that suggest intestinal inflammation, the activation of innate antimicrobial host defense, an increase in cellular autophagy and epithelial turnover, and reduced synthesis of pancreatic and intestinal secretions. These findings suggest that casein diets may provide a more accurate estimation of BEL because they promote normal gastrointestinal secretions. Overall, proteomic and bioinformatic analyses provided valuable insights into the composition of endogenous proteins in the ileal digesta and their relationship with the functions, processes, and pathways modified by diet composition.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the physiological characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of porcine intramuscular fat (IMF), subcutaneous fat (take back fat (BF), for example), and visceral fat (take perienteric fat (PF), for example) to address the challenge of optimizing meat quality without excessive fat deposition. Many improved breed pigs have fast growth rates, high lean meat rates, and low subcutaneous fat deposits, but they also have low IMF content, resulting in poor meat quality. There is usually a positive correlation between intramuscular fat and subcutaneous fat deposits. This study selected eight-month-old female Tibetan pigs as experimental subjects. After slaughter, fat samples were collected. Histological differences in adipocyte morphology were observed via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of tissue sections, and phenotypic characteristics of different adipose tissues were analyzed through fatty acid composition determination. Transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were employed to perform pairwise comparisons between different fatty tissues to identify differentially expressed genes and metabolites. A siRNA interference model was constructed and combined with Oil Red O staining and lipid droplet optical density measurement to investigate the regulatory role of WNT16 in adipocyte differentiation. Comparative analysis of phenotypic and fatty acid composition differences in adipocytes from different locations revealed that IMF adipocytes have significantly smaller areas and diameters compared to other fat depots and contain higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses identified differential expression of WNT16 and L-tyrosine, both of which are involved in the melanogenesis pathway. Functional validation showed that inhibiting WNT16 in porcine preadipocytes downregulated adipogenic regulators and reduced lipid droplet accumulation. This cross-level regulatory mechanism of "phenotype detection-multi-omics analysis-gene function research" highlighted WNT16 as a potential key regulator of site-specific fat deposition, providing new molecular targets for optimizing meat quality through nutritional regulation and genetic modification.

AB  - Intestinal symbionts live in insects' digestive systems and help with food digestion, nitrogen cycling, and energy use. Numerous symbionts, including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, colonize the posterior gut of termites. Intestinal microbiota affects the Toll or Imd pathways during viral or entomopathogenic fungus infection in mosquitoes, but the role of intestinal symbionts in individual termite immunity is unclear. In the present research, Odontotermes formosanus and Metarhizium robertsii were selected to investigate the potential mechanism of the intestinal bacteria influencing termite innate immune while encountering an entomopathogen using metagenome sequencing and meta-transcriptome sequencing. We found that termite mortality declined within 48 hours under high spore infections and reached semi-lethal status within 72 hours. We sequenced the control and infestation termite and found that the dominant phyla changed below low-abundance flora during infestation. According to function annotation, the functions of spirochetes are significantly different from those of the rest of the phyla, which are mainly enriched in metabolism and cellular processes. There are 261 upregulated and 459 down-regulated DEGs derived from bacteria after infestation. We identified the glutamate-cysteine ligase gene, gshA, which is significantly upregulated in the infected group, and the GSH content in the regular infected group was higher than the 5% kanamycin-infected group. We speculated on a potential mechanism that one or more bacteria belonging to Spirochetes that upregulated gshA gene expression and increased GSH content in the hindgut to integrate with metarhizium toxins and then excrete out of the intestine.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep are seasonal polyestrus breeders, and applying intensive breeding systems requires effective estrus induction protocols. Commonly, progesterone-equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) protocols are used to induce estrus and ovulation in anestrous sheep. However, eCG is an essential element in such protocols, and it has many disadvantages such as the formation of antibodies against the hormone and aspects related to animal welfare (specifically pregnant mares). Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) can be a possible eCG alternative, but variable ovarian responses and sexual behaviors were observed, and these were mainly due to the ability of GnRH to induce a precocious LH surge. Hence, optimizing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GnRH may meet the ovarian and behavioral requirements of ewes during the follicular phase. In this study, we compare the effects of two doses of GnRH-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles as a new delivery system, with eCG in a progesterone-based estrus induction protocol, on ovarian response, progesterone concentrations, and pregnancy outcomes. The results indicate that, despite the fact that the high dose of nanoencapsulated GnRH shortened the duration of estrus, it improved progesterone concentrations during early pregnancy and lambing and fecundity rates compared with low nanoencapsulated GnRH and eCG treatments. Thus, a high dose of nanoencapsulated GnRH can be used as an eCG alternative in progesterone-based protocols in seasonally anestrous ewes. This study is aimed at determining the reproductive performance of anestrous ewes treated with nanoencapsulated GnRH after a progesterone-based protocol for estrus induction was proposed as a way of replacing eCG. A total of sixty anestrous, multiparous, non-lactating Barki ewes were randomly allocated into three homogenous groups and subjected to a CIDR-based estrus induction protocol. The first group (eCG) received an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 350 IU of eCG at CIDR removal. The second (LNGnRH) and third (HLNGnR) groups received either 25 mu g or 50 mu g of encapsulated GnRH nanoparticles by the i.m. route in the form of spherical GnRH-encapsulated chitosan-TPP nanoparticles (which were 490.8 nm and had a 13.6 mV positive charge) 48 h after CIDR removal. Follicular dynamics, estrous behavior, luteal activity, and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated. Three days after CIDR removal, the number of large follicles increased by similar amounts in the LNGnRH and eCG groups and were significantly higher in both groups than in the HNGnRH group. However, no differences were observed in the numbers and diameters of CLs among the experimental groups and, on the other hand, treatment with HNGnRH significantly increased blood serum progesterone levels compared with eCG and LNGnRH. Treatment with HNGnRH increased conception, lambing, and fecundity rates (p < 0.05), with the trend of a higher litter size (p = 0.081) compared with eCG, whereas LNGnRH resulted in intermediate values. In conclusion, a dose of 50 mu g of GnRH encapsulated in chitosan-TPP nanoparticles can be used as an alternative to eCG in progesterone-based estrus induction protocols in sheep.

AB  - We demonstrate that Ha-Ras(V12) overexpression induces the nuclear translocation of Hippo effector Yes-associated protein (YAP) in MDCK cells via the hippo-independent pathway at the confluent stage. Ha-Ras(V12) overexpression leads to the downregulation of Caveolin-1 (Cav1) and the disruption of junction integrity. It has been shown that the disruption of actin belt integrity causes YAP nuclear translocation in epithelial cells at high density. Therefore, we hypothesized that Ha-Ras(V12) -decreased Cav1 leads to the disruption of cell junction integrity, which subsequently facilitates YAP nuclear retention. We revealed that Ha-Ras(V12) downregulated Cav1 through the ERK pathway. Furthermore, the distribution and expression of Cav1 mediated the cell junction integrity and YAP nuclear localization. This suggests that the downregulation of Cav1 induced by Ha-Ras(V12) disrupted the cell junction integrity and promoted YAP nuclear translocation. We further indicated the consequence of Ha-Ras(V12)-induced YAP activation. Surprisingly, the activation of YAP is not required for Ha-Ras(V12)-induced multilayer cellular aggregates. Instead, Ha-Ras(V12) triggered the ERK-Rac pathway to promote cellular aggregate formation. Moreover, the overexpression of constitutively active Rac is sufficient to trigger cellular aggregation in MDCK cells at the confluent stage. This highlights that Rac activity is essential for cellular aggregates.

AB  - Conductive hydrogels possessing conductivity, flexibility, and biocompatibility have garnered considerable attention in recent years for their applications in flexible wearable devices. However, most reported conductive hydrogels are mainly elastic hydrogel substrates with chemically cross-linked networks, poor shape adaptability, and irreversible electromechanical properties after molding, thereby limiting their prospective utility in flexible electronics. In this study, we fabricate multifunctional lignin-gelatin-polypyrrole (LGP) hydrogels with plasticity, recyclability, strong adhesion, and biocompatibility via a straightforward methodology employing gelatin, polypyrrole, and sodium lignosulfonate. The resultant LGP hydrogel is interlinked by dynamic noncovalent bonds, yielding remarkable plasticity and recyclability, and could be manipulated by hand to fashion diverse shapes. Additionally, the LGP hydrogel displays substantial adhesion (23.88 kPa to pig skin) and maintains strong adhesion to wide substrates. The LGP hydrogel strain sensor demonstrates high sensitivity (GF = 6.08) and rapid response (107 ms), providing a stable resistive signal output for both large (25-200%) and small (1-5%) strains across diverse operating conditions. Moreover, the LGP hydrogel can be seamlessly integrated as a flexible, wearable strain sensor to facilitate real-time monitoring of human physiological activities.

AB  - Simple Summary Automatic detection of births allows timely assistance, protecting offspring and mothers, without requiring continuous human surveillance. A mechanism based on Machine Learning was developed using wearable inertial sensors, enabled with real-time communication. This mechanism runs on a minicomputer housed in livestock facilities and uses inertial data classification to detect and notify the human operator of goat kidding events. Preliminary results demonstrate behavior changes four hours before kidding and allow for the identification of the kidding hour with an accuracy of 61%.Abstract The autonomous identification of animal births has a significant added value, since it enables for a prompt timely human intervention in the process, protecting the young and the mothers' health, without requiring continuous human surveillance. Wearable inertial sensors have been employed for a variety of animal monitoring applications, thanks to their low cost and the fact that they allow less invasive monitoring process. Alarms triggered by the occurrence of events must be generated close to the events to avoid delays caused by communication latency, which is why this type of mechanism is typically implemented at the network's edge and integrated with existing auxiliary mechanisms on the Internet. Although the detection of births in cattle has been carried out commercially for some years, there is no solution for small ruminants, especially goats, where the literature does not even report any attempts. The current work consisted of a first attempt at developing an automatic birth monitor using inertial sensing, as well as detection techniques based on Machine Learning, implemented in a network edge device to assure real-time alarm triggering. Thus, two concept drift detection techniques and seven kidding detection mechanisms were developed using data classification models. The work also includes the testing and comparison of learning results, both in terms of accuracy and of computational costs of the detection module, for algorithms implemented. The results revealed that, despite their simplicity, concept drift algorithms do not allow kidding detection, whereas classification-algorithm-based static learning models do, despite the unbalanced character of the dataset and its reduced size. The learning findings are quite promising in terms of computational cost and its suitability for deployment on edge devices. The algorithm demonstrates behavior changes four hours before kidding and allows for the identification of the kidding hour with an accuracy of 61%, as well as the capacity to improve the overall learning process with a larger dataset.

AB  - The common leopard (Panthera pardus) is known to have a wide dietary spectrum and plays a significant role in maintaining the balance within an ecological community. The present study on dietary composition was conducted in Kazinag National Park (KNP) of Kashmir Himalayas for two seasons (summer and winter) of the two consecutive years (2019 and 2020) to augment the existing literature and investigate the role of leopard as an apex predator in KNP which is home to several threatened wild ungulates. We used the scat analysis method for which a total of 134 scats (summer, n = 73; winter, n = 61) were collected within 21 sampling trails in the park. In summer livestock was more frequent in the diet (47.38%) than wild ungulates (16.47%). However, in the winter diet, a higher proportion of wild ungulates (58.89%) was represented than domestic livestock (9.01%). Meso-mammals including monkey, red fox and domestic dog formed more or less similar proportions in the summer and winter diet of the leopard. Himalayan goral had a higher frequency of occurrence (63.43) in winter scats, whereas domestic goat had a higher frequency of occurrence (64.17) in summer scats. Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences in proportions of livestock (p < 0.05) and wild ungulates (p < 0.05) between summer and winter diet, however, insignificant difference was recorded for meso mammals. This livestock depredation would always keep leopard at a higher risk of being killed in conflict with humans. Therefore, special management efforts are needed to initiate conservation action for management of the leopard population in the national park.

AB  - The milieu of male germline stem cells (mGSCs) is characterized as a low-oxygen (O-2) environment, whereas, their in-vitro expansion is typically performed under normoxia (20-21% O-2). The comparative information about the effects of low and normal O-2 levels on the growth and differentiation of caprine mGSCs (cmGSCs) is lacking. Thus, we aimed to investigate the functional and multilineage differentiation characteristics of enriched cmGSCs, when grown under hypoxia and normoxia. After enrichment of cmGSCs through multiple methods (differential platting and Percoll-density gradient centrifugation), the growth characteristics of cells [population-doubling time (PDT), viability, proliferation, and senescence], and expression of key-markers of adhesion (beta-integrin and E-Cadherin) and stemness (OCT-4, THY-1 and UCHL-1) were evaluated under hypoxia (5% O-2) and normoxia (21% O-2). Furthermore, the extent of multilineage differentiation (neurogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation) under different culture conditions was assessed. The survival, viability, and proliferation were significantly (p < 0.05) improved, thus, yielding a significantly (p < 0.05) higher number of viable cells with larger colonies under hypoxia. Furthermore, the expression of stemness and adhesion markers were distinctly upregulated under lowered O-2 conditions. Conversely, the differentiated regions and expression of differentiation-specific genes [C/EBP alpha (adipogenic), nestin and beta-tubulin (neurogenic), and COL2A1 (chondrogenic)] were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced under hypoxia. Overall, the results demonstrate that culturing cmGSCs under hypoxia augments the growth characteristics and stemness but not the multilineage differentiation of cmGSCs, as compared with normoxia. These data are important to develop robust methodologies for ex-vivo expansion and lineage-committed differentiation of cmGSCs for clinical applications.

AB  - Culture can shape memory, but little research has investigated age effects. The present study examined the neural correlates of memory retrieval for old, new, and similar lures in younger and older Americans and Taiwanese. A total of 207 participants encoded pictures of objects and, during fMRI scanning, completed a surprise object recognition task testing discrimination of similar and new from old items. Results show that age and culture impact discrimination of old from new items. Taiwanese performed worse than Americans, with age effects more pronounced for Taiwanese. The cultural differences in the engagement of left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in younger adults (i.e., greater activity for old [for Taiwanese] or new items [for Americans]) were eliminated with age. The results are interpreted as reflecting cultural differences in orientation to novelty versus familiarity for younger, but not older, adults, with the LIFG supporting interference resolution at retrieval. Support is not as strong for cultural differences in pattern separation processes. Although Americans had higher levels of memory discrimination than Taiwanese, neither cultural nor age differences were found in hippocampal activity, which is surprising given the region's role in pattern separation. The findings suggest ways in which cultural life experiences and concomitant information processing strategies can contribute to consistent effects of age across cultures or contribute to different trajectories with age in terms of memory.

AB  - Main conclusionInsect herbivores of different feeding guilds induced sorghum defenses through differential mechanisms, regardless of the order of herbivore arrival on sorghum plants.Sorghum, one of the world's most important cereal crops, suffers severe yield losses due to attack by insects of different feeding guilds. In most instances, the emergence of these pests are not secluded incidents and are followed by another or can also co-infest host plants. Sugarcane aphid (SCA) and fall armyworm (FAW) are the two most important destructive pests of sorghum, which belongs to sap-sucking and chewing feeding guilds, respectively. While the order of the herbivore arriving on the plants has been found to alter the defense response to subsequent herbivores, this is seldom studied with herbivores from different feeding guilds. In this study, we investigated the effects of sequential herbivory of FAW and SCA on sorghum defense responses and their underlying mechanism(s). Sequential feeding on the sorghum RTx430 genotype by either FAW primed-SCA or SCA primed-FAW were monitored to unravel the mechanisms underlying defense priming, and its mode of action. Regardless of the order of herbivore arrival on sorghum RTx430 plants, significant defense induction was observed in the primed state compared to the non-primed condition, irrespective of their feeding guild. Additionally, gene expression and secondary metabolite analysis revealed differential modulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway upon insect attack by different feeding guilds. Our findings suggest that priming in sorghum plants upon sequential herbivory induces defense by the accumulation of the total flavonoids and lignin/salicylic acid in FAW primed-SCA and SCA primed-FAW interaction, respectively.

AB  - Food security as a national strategy, closely links to China's economic progress, people's livelihoods and social harmony. The balance between feed grain security and meat security remains a key unresolved issue that significantly impacts China's integral food security goal. In this study, we first apply food security index to demonstrate the efficacy of the self-sufficiency rate as an indicator for evaluating the food security situation, and then evaluate meat security and feed grain security with self-sufficiency rate, as well as explore their production challenges and successful long-term development experiences based on related agricultural data. We find that the burgeoning meat consumption has made feed grains a "rigid demand", among which pork and soybean are critical parts. Pork consumption accounts for over 65% of total meat consumption in 2020, but its self-sufficient rate is waning. Moreover, the self-sufficiency rate of soybean is as low as 0.15, and a great unit yield gap between China and the United States. However, the current production patterns have already reached their attainable potential in production efficiency due to the declining growth rate of unit yield, which also pose challenges for improving production efficiency and domestic supply of soybean. According to the projection by FAO-OECD, the growth rate of unit yield of soybean will remain stagnant from 2020 to 2030. Furthermore, the percentage of medium-scale and large-scale pig farms is remarkably low, accounting for only 0.578% and 0.013%, respectively. Further analysis indicates that large-scale production in soybean and pig industry offers notable advantages in improving production efficiency and reducing feed consumption. Finally, based on factors such as soybean sowing area, regions with high pig slaughter and scale farms, farm size and the pig regional development planning, we propose the integration of soybean-pig in large-scale production in selected possible provinces, which has the potential to improve the production efficiency of soybean and pig, to strike a balance between feed grain security and meat security. This study has practical significance in optimizing the production space of feed grains and livestock products, to improve production capability and ensure China's food security.

AB  - Concern for pollinator health often focuses on social bees and their agricultural importance at the expense of other pollinators and their ecosystem services. When pollinating herbivores use the same plants as nectar sources and larval hosts, ecological conflicts emerge for both parties, as the pollinator's services are mitigated by herbivory and its larvae are harmed by plant defences. We tracked individual-level metrics of pollinator health-growth, survivorship, fecundity-across the life cycle of a pollinating herbivore, the common hawkmoth, Hyles lineata, interacting with a rare plant, Oenothera harringtonii, that is polymorphic for the common floral volatile (R)-(-)-linalool. Linalool had no impact on floral attraction, but its experimental addition suppressed oviposition on plants lacking linalool. Plants showed robust resistance against herbivory from leaf-disc to whole-plant scales, through poor larval growth and survivorship. Higher larval performance on other Oenothera species indicates that constitutive herbivore resistance by O. harringtonii is not a genus-wide trait. Leaf volatiles differed among populations of O. harringtonii but were not induced by larval herbivory. Similarly, elagitannins and other phenolics varied among plant tissues but were not herbivore-induced. Our findings highlight asymmetric plant-pollinator interactions and the importance of third parties, including alternative larval host plants, in maintaining pollinator health.This article is part of the theme issue 'Natural processes influencing pollinator health: from chemistry to landscapes'.

AB  - The administration of the adrenal hormone corticosterone by injection or subcutaneous implantation of its modified-release dosage forms is often used to model situations associated with the effects of various stressors on the brain. The present methodological study investigated the possibility of using Alzet osmotic pumps (OPs) with a capacity of 200 mu L and a release rate of 1 mu L/h, loaded with corticosterone solutions of 25, 50 and 100 mg/mL or a vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide/polyethylene glycol-400). The objective was to determine the optimal concentration of corticosterone solution loaded into osmotic pumps to create an increased level of the hormone in the rat blood and brain regions. An increase in blood corticosterone levels was only observed on mg/mL (OP-100). Corticosterone accumulation in the frontal cortex, neocortex and hippocampus increased significantly by day 3 after implantation in the OP-100 group. Thus, OPs with a corticosterone solution in DMSO/PEG-400, at a hormone concentration of 100 mg/mL and release rate of 1 mu L/h, can be used to create elevated corticosterone levels in the blood and brain regions of rats.

AB  - A new method is proposed for the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) under the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs), which applies the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to the dynamic window approach (DWA) to reduce the optimal trajectory finding the time and improve the timeliness of obstacle avoidance. Meanwhile, a fuzzy control algorithm is designed to dynamically adjust the weight coefficients of the velocity and obstacle distance terms in the cost function of the DWA algorithm to adapt to the changes in the environment. The proposed dynamic obstacle avoidance method is experimentally validated, in which proposed PSO combined with the DWA algorithm (PSO-CCDWA) results in a 42.1%, 11.2% and 28.0% reduction in the navigation time of the USVs in three encounter-situations of COLREGs than that of the classical DWA algorithm (CCDWA) conforming to the conventional COLREGs, respectively. The fuzzy control combined with the DWA algorithm (FUZZY-CCDWA) reduces the distance traveled by 15.8%, 0.9% and 2.8%, respectively, over the CCDWA algorithm in the three encounter scenarios. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic obstacle avoidance method is further verified in a practical navigation experiment of a USV named "Buffalo".

AB  - The goal of this paper is to examine the use of pig blood in the industrial mass production of platelet dry powder and to transform platelet dry powder into a low-cost and mass-produced material. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) contain multiple types of growth factors (GFs) and can be widely used in medical applications. However, neither can be mass-produced, due to the complexity of the PRP preparation process and the lack of anticoagulants in the PRF preparation process, increasing the risk of coagulation during mass production. Another obstacle is the insufficient supply of autologous PRP and autologous PRF. In this study, platelet dry powder was mass-produced from pig blood through the indirect addition of calcium chloride solution. Furthermore, the results showed that different concentrations and percentages of calcium chloride solution had significant effects on concentrations of TGF-beta 1 and PDGF-BB in the platelet dry powder. The platelet dry powder mass-produced from pig blood demonstrated high concentrations of GFs and long-term shelf stability, increasing the supply to industries that use it in product development.

AB  - Despite notable efforts and significant therapeutical advances, age-related macular degeneration remains the single most common reason for vision loss. Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) are considered promising candidates for cellular treatments that repair and restore vision. In this allogenic study, the phenotypic profile of pig and human RPCs derived using similar manufacturing processes is compared. The long-term (12-week) survival of green fluorescent protein-pig retinal progenitor cells GFP-pRPC after subretinal transplantation into normal miniature pig (mini-pig) retina is investigated. Human eyes are both anatomically and physiologically mimicked by pig eyes, so the pig is an ideal model to show an equivalent way of delivering cells, immunological response and dosage. The phenotypic equivalency of porcine and clinically intended human RPCs was established. Thirty-nine mini-pigs are used in this study, and vehicle-injected eyes and non-injected eyes serve as controls. Six groups are given different dosages of pRPCs, and the cells are found to survive well in all groups. At 12 weeks, strong evidence of integration is indicated by the location of the grafted cells within the neuro-retina, extension of processes to the plexiform layers and expression of key retinal markers such as recoverin, rhodopsin and synaptophysin. No immunosuppression is used, and no immune response is found in any of the groups. No pRPC-related histopathology findings are reported in the major organs investigated. An initial dose of 250 k cells in 100 mu l of buffer is established as an appropriate initial dose for future human clinical trials.

AB  - Deficiencies in maternal nutrition have long-term consequences affecting brain development of the progeny and its behavior. In the present work, female mice were exposed to a normal-protein or a low-protein diet during gestation and lactation. We analyzed behavioral and molecular consequences of malnutrition in dams and how it affects female offspring at weaning. We have observed that a low-protein diet during pregnancy and lactation leads to anxiety-like behavior and anhedonia in dams. Protein malnutrition during the perinatal period delays physical and neurological development of female pups. Glucocorticoid levels increased in the plasma of malnourished female offspring but not in dams when compared to the control group. Interestingly, the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was reduced in hippocampus and amygdala on both malnourished dams and female pups. In addition, malnourished pups exhibited a significant increase in the expression of Dnmt3b, Gadd45b, and Fkbp5 and a reduction in Bdnf VI variant mRNA in hippocampus. In contrast, a reduction on Dnmt3b has been observed on the amygdala of weaned mice. No changes have been observed on global methylation levels (5-methylcytosine) in hippocampal genomic DNA neither in dams nor female offspring. In conclusion, deregulated behaviors observed in malnourished dams might be mediated by a low expression of GR in brain regions associated with emotive behaviors. Additionally, low-protein diet differentially deregulates the expression of genes involved in DNA methylation/demethylation machinery in female offspring but not in dams, providing an insight into regional- and age-specific mechanisms due to protein malnutrition.

AB  - Hypotheses based on allocation theory and herbivore selection offer opposite predictions about how defence levels against herbivores change as the plant tissue grows. The growth differentiation balance hypothesis (GDBH) assumes that defences will be resource-limited in immature tissues and predict that defence levels increase as the plant tissue grows. Conversely, the optimal defence hypothesis (ODH) proposes that plants would have the highest level of defences in the parts that have the highest value in terms of fitness and/or are more frequently attacked by herbivores, such as young tissues. We examine whether spinescence in the shrub Rubus adenotrichos (blackberry) change as the leaf grows, and if this change is consistent with the GDBH or the ODH. We compare the petiole area occupied by prickles, the prickles density and the individual prickle area in mature versus young petioles from Rubus adenotrichos. Our results show that, in R. adenotrichos, young tissues are more protected than mature tissues. Prickles density and the petiole area occupied by prickles were up to 25% higher in young petioles than in mature ones. These results support the ODH, reinforcing the idea that extrinsic factors such as herbivores pressure might drive the change of structural defences level across leaf ontogeny.

AB  - It has been shown that the jejunum represents the most important site for the nutrient's absorption in several species. However, in pigs, this information seems to be controversial and limited information are available about differences in intestinal physiology between female and castrated male pigs. The trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the active uptake of L-glutamate (L-Glu), L-arginine (L-Arg), L-methionine (L-Met) and D-glucose (D-Glu) in the jejunum and ileum of female (n = 5) and castrated male (n = 7) pigs fed a protein-restricted grower and finisher diet (128 and 112 g of crude protein/kg dry matter) were investigated. The intestine segments were collected at slaughter and mounted in Ussing chambers. Results were further investigated by protein expression analysis of the D-Glu transporter Sodium-dependent Glucose Transporter 1 (SGLT1) and using serum creatinine, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and serum glucose concentrations measurements as indicators of muscle mass deposition and metabolic status of the animals. A linear mixed-effects regression (Lme4) model was used for data analysis. Independent of sex, the uptake of both L-Met and D-Glu was higher (p < 0.001) in the ileum than in the jejunum (2.1- and 3.6-fold increases, respectively). The L-Arg uptake was higher (p = 0.001) in females compared to castrates (1.9-fold increase). No significant differences were observed between the segments in the SGLT1 protein expression, regardless of sex. Serum measurements were also not significantly different between the female and castrates. This study suggests that the ileum has an important role in the active uptake of amino acids and D-Glu uptake and differences exist between female and castrated finishing pigs.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is the second most consumed drink in the world. Rapid industrialization has caused various impacts on nature and increased pollution by heavy metals. However, the molecular mechanisms of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) tolerance and accumulation in tea plants are poorly understood. The present study focused on the effects of heavy metals Cd and As on tea plants. Transcriptomic regulation of tea roots after Cd and As exposure was analyzed to explore the candidate genes involved in Cd and As tolerance and accumulation. In total, 2087, 1029, 1707, and 366 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained in Cd1 (with Cd treatment for 10 days) vs. CK (without Cd treatment), Cd2 (with Cd treatment for 15 days) vs. CK, As1 (with As treatment for 10 days) vs. CK (without Cd treatment), and As2 (with As treatment for 15 days) vs. CK, respectively. Analysis of DEGs showed that a total of 45 DEGs with the same expression patterns were identified in four pairwise comparison groups. One ERF transcription factor (CSS0000647) and six structural genes (CSS0033791, CSS0050491, CSS0001107, CSS0019367, CSS0006162, and CSS0035212) were only increased at 15 d of Cd and As treatments. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed that the transcription factor (CSS0000647) was positively correlated with five structural genes (CSS0001107, CSS0019367, CSS0006162, CSS0033791, and CSS0035212). Moreover, one gene (CSS0004428) was significantly upregulated in both Cd and As treatments, suggesting that these genes might play important roles in enhancing the tolerance to Cd and As stresses. These results provide candidate genes to enhance multi-metal tolerance through the genetic engineering technology.

AB  - Background Crocin has a good prospect in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective effects remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of Crocin and its underlying mechanisms in AD. Methods AD mice were set up by injecting A beta(25-35) solution into the hippocampus. Then, the AD mice were injected intraperitoneally with 40 mg/kg/day of Crocin for 14 days. Following the completion of Crocin treatment, an open-field test, Y-maze test and Morris water maze test were conducted to evaluate the impact of Crocin on spatial learning and memory deficiency in mice. The effects of Crocin on hippocampal neuron injury, proinflammatory cytokine expressions (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha), and PI3K/AKT signaling-related protein expressions were measured using hematoxylin and eosin staining, Western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments, respectively. Results Crocin attenuated A beta(25-35)-induced spatial learning and memory deficiency and hippocampal neuron injury. Furthermore, the Western blot and qRT-PCR results showed that Crocin effectively suppressed inflammation and activated the PI3K/AKT pathway in A beta(25-35)-induced mice. Conclusion Crocin restrained neuroinflammation via the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby ameliorating the cognitive dysfunction of AD mice.

AB  - Simple Summary The Sanmartinero creole bovine (SM) is found in the department of Meta (Colombian Orinoquia) and derives from the bullfighting cattle introduced by the Spanish in the 15th century. Its adaptation process has allowed it to develop adaptive characteristics to live in extreme climatic environments. Although there are studies on its reproductive and productive characteristics, little is known about possible asymmetries in some biological structures. Fluctuating asymmetry allows us to detect a possible developmental instability that may be caused by stressful conditions. The aim of our study was to present the current state of developmental instability in two bilateral cephalic characters of the SM creole bovine. The results showed a fluctuating asymmetry biased to the left for ear and horn length, and to the right for ear width and horn perimeter. We consider that the environment in which it lives may have an impact on the development of cephalic structures, creating stress in the animal, which causes the detected asymmetry. However, the authors are not aware of any studies on this topic.Abstract Asymmetric studies can indicate disturbances in the developmental process. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is considered an indicator of stress. The Sanmartinero (SM) creole bovine is native to the department of Meta (Colombian Orinoquia) and its adaptation process has allowed it to live in extreme tropical environments. The aim of this cross-sectional and descriptive study was to present the current state of the knowledge of asymmetries in some cephalic characters of the SM creole bovine. A total of 94 animals were studied (18 uncastrated males and 76 females) from three different farms, with an age range of 0.5-10 years. For each animal, two measurements of the ear (width and length) and two measurements of the horn (perimeter and length) were obtained in vivo. The degree of asymmetry was calculated as (R - L)/(R + L). Bilateral differences pointed towards a fluctuating asymmetry (e.g., a random variation in the trait that is expected to be perfectly symmetrical) biased towards right for ear width and horn perimeter, and towards left for ear and horn length. Since the development of these structures-ears and horns-is under the control of the same set of genes, the fluctuating asymmetry could constitute a reflection of a normal condition.

AB  - Background Mesenteric traction syndrome is commonly observed in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery and is associated with severe postoperative complications. A triad of hypotension, tachycardia, and facial flushing seems provoked by prostacyclin (PGI(2)) release from the gut in response to mesenteric traction. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibits PGI(2) release, stabilizing the hemodynamic response. Here, we examined the effect of mesenteric traction on splanchnic blood flow in pigs randomized to NSAID or placebo treatment.
   Materials and Methods Twenty pigs were allocated to either ketorolac or placebo treatment. Five minutes of manual mesenteric traction was applied. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1(alpha), a stable metabolite of PGI(2), hemodynamic variables, and regional blood flow (laser speckle contrast imaging) to the liver, stomach, small intestine, upper lip, and snout (laser Doppler flowmetry) were recorded prior to traction and 5 and 30 minutes thereafter.
   Results Both groups of pigs presented a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (P = .01), mean arterial blood pressure (P = .001), and blood flow in the gastric antrum (P = .002). Plasma 6-keto-PGF1(alpha) did not increase in either group (P = .195), and cardiac output, heart rate, central venous pressure, and blood flow to the liver, small intestine, upper lip, and snout remained unchanged.
   Conclusion Mesenteric traction resulted in cardiovascular depression, including reduced blood flow in the gastric antrum. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1(alpha) did not increase, and ketorolac administration did not alter the response to mesenteric traction. Furthers studies are needed to identify which substance is responsible for eliciting the cardiovascular response to mesenteric traction in pigs.

AB  - Inspired by animal blood as a biowaste rich in biological enzymes with molecular Fe-N centers, Fe doped gC3N4 (FCN) photocatalyst was successfully prepared by one-step thermal polymerization with pig blood and melamine to produce an efficient photocatalyst with Fe-N active sites for photo-Fenton degradation of tetracycline (TC) under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic TC degradation results exhibited that FCN-1 sample possesses optimal photocatalytic degradation activity for TC (50 mg/L) in the presence of H2O2 system and a broad range over pH adaptation. The optimum photo-Fenton degradation activities of TC (50 mg/L) under visible-light irradiation for FCN-1/H2O2 system reach to 84.9% and 0.034 min-1 within 120 min under acidic conditions (pH = 3.1) and to 85% and 0.093 min-1 (first 20 min) in alkaline environment. Enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the positive roles of Fe-N bonds in FCN during the photo-Fenton process as follows: (i) improving the absorbance and separation efficiency in electron-hole pairs; (ii) accelerating the catalytic cycles between Fe2+/Fe3+ to produce more center dot OH in acidic condition; (iii) serving as active sites to boost the production of more photon-generated carriers in alkaline environment. Our work overcame the defect of low photocatalytic activity in photo-Fenton process under alkaline conditions, and provided a simple design idea for the low-cost synthesis of visible-light-driven photocatalyst with high efficiency applied to photo-Fenton reaction.

AB  - Transmission of Echinococcus spp. in life cycles that involve mainly wildlife is well recognized for those species with small mammals as intermediate hosts (e. g. E. multilocularis), as well as for E. felidis and the 'northern' genotypes of E. canadensis (G8 and G10). In contrast, the remaining taxa of E. granulosus sensu lato are best known for their domestic life cycles, and the numerous wild mammal species (mainly ungulates) that have been recorded with cystic echinococcosis in the past were mainly considered a result of spill-over from the dog-livestock transmission system. This view was challenged with the advent of molecular characterization, allowing discrimination of the metacestodes, although the contribution of wild mammals to various Echinococcus life cycles has remained uncertain for scarcity of wildlife studies. Numerous records of cysts in wild ungulates date back to the 20th century, but cannot with certainty be allocated to the Echinococcus species and genotypes that are recognized today. This means that our current knowledge is largely restricted to studies of the past two decades that kept adding gradually to our concepts of transmission in various geographic regions. In particular, new insights were gathered in the past years on E. granulosus s.l. in wildlife of sub-Saharan Africa, but also on transmission patterns of E. multilocularis in previously neglected regions, e. g. North America. Here, an update is provided on the current state of knowledge on wild mammals as hosts for all Echinococcus species, listing >150 species of wild hosts with references, as well as estimates on their epidemiological impact and our current gaps of knowledge.

AB  - BackgroundBeetle rearing for food or feed is a growing area of agriculture that produces considerable wastes. This frass is a putative soil amendment anecdotally applied directly as fertilizer. To determine if beetle waste can be used as a soil amendment without pre-treatment, a series of chemical, physical, microbiological, and plant-growth assays were performed on waste from the coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), fed cocopeat. Beetle diet and frass NPK levels, C:N ratio, and particle size were measured. Microbiota was identified with metabarcoding, and functional profile analysis done to identify pathways associated with wood digestion or plant growth. Cultivation tests were done with Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicales: Brassicaceae) and frass incorporation into potting soil at 0, 20, or 40%, followed by elemental concentration measurement of the soil, frass, and plant matter.ResultsDigestion of plant polysaccharides in the gut, primarily by microbial depolymerizers, produces frass of uniform particle size and NPK 1.8-0.13-1.2 that can be used directly as a mature fertilizer without pre-composting, or even as a growth substrate. Plants with higher proportions of frass in the soil grew significantly faster and larger compared to a nutrient-rich potting soil. Frass is high in useful elements and has beneficial chitinolytic microbes.ConclusionsBeetle frass can thus be used directly as a soil amendment without composting or pretreatment, with positive effects on plant growth even compared to rich soils. Valorizing frass in this way generates income for beetle farmers and recycles nutrients to soil as part of circular agriculture.

AB  - ObjectiveSmall angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis is a sensitive way of determining the ultrastructure of collagen in tissues. Little is known about how parameters measured by SAXS are affected by preservatives commonly used to prevent autolysis. We determined the effects of formalin, glutaraldehyde, Triton X and saline on measurements of fibril diameter, fibril diameter distribution, and D-spacing of corneal collagen using SAXS analysis.ResultsCompared to sections of sheep and cats' corneas stored frozen as controls, those preserved in 5% glutaraldehyde and 10% formalin had significantly larger mean collagen fibril diameters, increased fibril diameter distribution and decreased D-spacing. Sections of corneas preserved in Triton X had significantly increased collagen fibril diameters and decreased fibril diameter distribution. Those preserved in 0.9% saline had significantly increased mean collagen fibril diameters and decreased diameter distributions. Subjectively, the corneas preserved in 5% glutaraldehyde and 10% formalin maintained their transparency but those in Triton X and 0.9% saline became opaque. Subjective morphological assessment of transmission electron microscope images of corneas supported the SAXS data. Workers using SAXS analysis to characterize collagen should be alerted to changes that can be introduced by common preservatives in which their samples may have been stored.

AB  - Seahorses are one of the most amazing ovoviviparous fishes in the ocean because males, and not females, have evolved a brood pouch for incubating embryos. During male pregnancy, paternal seahorses need to develop effective immune protection for embryos in the brood pouch from potential infection by pathogens. Lysozymes (Lyz) are a group of antibacterial enzymes of the innate immune system that play an important role in resisting pathogen invasion. However, the immune function of lysozymes in the brood pouch of the pregnancy-lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) remains unknown. In this study, we found three different lysozymes in the lined seahorse: HeLyzC, HeLyzG1, and HeLyzG2. Synteny analysis revealed that HeLyzG1 and HeLyzG2 were generated by species-specific expansion rather than tandem duplication. Tissue expression patterns showed that the highest mRNA expression levels of the three lysozymes occurred in the brood pouches. Immunostimulationinduced expression analysis showed that all three HeLyzs in the brood pouches up-regulated their mRNA expression levels after Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, but only the HeLyzG2 was upregulated after Poly(I:C) injection. Similarly, except for HeLyzC, upregulated expressions of HeLyzG1 and HeLyzG2 were found quickly in brood pouches injected with LPS. The upregulated levels of HeLyzC and HeLyzG2 in brood pouches during pregnancy were significantly higher than those in non-pregnancy, implying that seahorse lysozymes might function in the immune defense in brood pouches during pregnancy. In addition, the expression levels of HeLyzs were low in embryos in the brood pouch but significantly increased in neonates. This implies that embryos in the brood pouch might not necessarily express more lysozymes by themselves due to paternal immune protection. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that HeLyzs play an important role in immune protection during male seahorse gestation, and the synergistic effect of multiple HeLyzs may contribute to improved neonatal survival.

AB  - Estrogens exert effects on cognition by acting on estrogen receptors (ER) including ER alpha. Activation of nuclear ER alpha results in classical genomic signaling leading to transcriptional changes that occur over hours to days. In contrast, activation of ER alpha localized to the membrane results in rapid signaling with effects occurring in seconds to minutes. The goal of the current study was to determine the role of membrane ER alpha in spatial memory. Female wildtype (WT) and transgenic mice that lack membrane ER alpha and express nuclear only ER alpha (NOER) were trained on an eight-arm radial-maze task. Following training, mice were tested on delay trials, in which delays ranging from 30 min to 5 h were inserted between the 4th and 5th arm choices. Performance was measured by number of proactive and retroactive errors. Proactive errors are short-term working memory errors defined by reentries into arms previously visited during the post-delay period or errors made during the pre-delay period. Retroactive errors are delay-dependent memory errors, defined as reentries into arms during the post-delay that were previously visited during the pre-delay. Consistent with a role for membrane ER alpha in rapid signaling, NOER mice made more proactive errors than WTs across all delays. NOER mice made more retroactive errors than WTs only after the 5-h delay. WT and NOER mice performed similarly on elevated plus maze and open field tests indicating no effects of membrane ER alpha on anxiety-related behavior or locomotor activity. Results reveal that membrane ER alpha plays important roles in both short-term and longer-term delay-dependent memory either directly or potentially indirectly through a role in the regulation of estradiol levels via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites are well known for their biological functions in defending against pathogenic microorganisms. Tea saponin (TS), one type of secondary metabolite of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis), has been shown to be a valuable botanical pesticide. However, its antifungal activity in controlling the fungi Valsa mali, Botryosphaeria dothidea, and Alternaria alternata, which induce major diseases in apple (Malus domestica), has not been determined. In this study, we first determined that TS has higher inhibitory activity than catechins against the three types of fungi. We further utilized in vitro and in vivo assays to confirm that TS showed high antifungal activity against the three types of fungi, especially for V. mali and B. dothidea. In the in vivo assay, application of a 0.5% TS solution was able to restrain the fungus-induced necrotic area in detached apple leaves efficiently. Moreover, a greenhouse infection assay also confirmed that TS treatment significantly inhibited V. mali infection in leaves of apple seedlings. In addition, TS treatment activated plant immune responses by decreasing accumulation of reactive oxygen species and promoting the activity of pathogenesis-related proteins, including chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase. This indicated that TS might serve as a plant defense inducer to activate innate immunity to fight against fungal pathogen invasion. Therefore, our data indicated that TS might restrain fungal infection in two ways, by directly inhibiting the growth of fungi and by activating plant innate defense responses as a plant defense inducer.

AB  - The current study examined the effect on milk traits and composition of the replacement of barley grain with carob pulp as a supplement for grazing ewes with different genotypes at the beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) locus. Forty-six Valle del Belice lactating ewes were chosen for the feeding trial and split into control and carob groups based on the BLG p.Tyr38His polymorphism. The carob group received a supplement of 250 g/d of carob pulp, whereas the control group received 250 g/g of a barley whole grain-based concentrate. There were no milk yield or gross composition variations related to the BLG genotype. Nevertheless, milk fatty acid composition was influenced by the BLG polymorphism. Compared to the AB genotype, milk from BB sheep had higher concentrations of linoleic, linolenic acids, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids. The addition of carob pulp did not significantly modify fat and protein-corrected milk, whereas reduced protein and urea concentration, increased the fat content but worsened the milk quality in terms of fatty acid composition, increasing saturated and medium chain fatty acids. The genotype x feed interaction had no appreciable effect on milk composition or quality.

AB  - Osseodensification is a technique that involves compressing bone using specialized drilling instruments to increase bone-implant contact. The present study aimed to evaluate the structure of a xenograft bone (XB) wall created within an implantation site and how it affects the initial stability of dental implants. Six segments of pig ribs, representing low-density bone, were used in the experiment. Four different drilling conditions were created for each section using a tapered bur system associated with bovine xenograft bone: clockwise (cutting mode-CW) or counterclockwise (densification mode-CCW). The bone samples were then placed individually in microtomography equipment to define a volume of interest (VOI) 50% larger than the osteotomy. Mathematical calculations of bone volume, trabecular thickness and separation, and total porosity were performed. An implant with a diameter of 4.0 mm and a length of 11.5 mm was then inserted into each osteotomy. The final insertion torque (IT) and resonance frequency analysis/implant stability quotient (ISQ) values were recorded. The groups were compared using ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test. The results show that the use of xenograft bone produced densification at the apex region, with higher bone volume and trabecular thickness, and reduced trabecular separation compared with the CW group (p < 0.05). The CW + XB group demonstrated a similar porosity to the CCW group and similar values of IT and ISQ (p > 0.05). Compared with the other groups, CCW + XB exhibited the lowest percentual porosity and the highest values of IT and ISQ (p < 0.05). We concluded that the use of a xenograft bone wall before implant placement can improve the primary stability of dental implants.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa) is an annual oilseed plant that is gaining momentum as a biofuel cover crop. Understanding gene regulatory networks is essential to deciphering plant metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism. Here, we take advantage of a growing collection of gene expression datasets to predict transcription factors (TFs) associated with the control of Camelina lipid metabolism. We identified approximately 350 TFs highly co-expressed with lipid-related genes (LRGs). These TFs are highly represented in the MYB, AP2/ERF, bZIP, and bHLH families, including a significant number of homologs of well-known Arabidopsis lipid and seed developmental regulators. After prioritizing the top 22 TFs for further validation, we identified DNA-binding sites and predicted target genes for 16 out of the 22 TFs tested using DNA affinity purification followed by sequencing (DAP-seq). Enrichment analyses of targets supported the co-expression prediction for most TF candidates, and the comparison to Arabidopsis revealed some common themes, but also aspects unique to Camelina. Within the top potential lipid regulators, we identified CsaMYB1, CsaABI3AVP1-2, CsaHB1, CsaNAC2, CsaMYB3, and CsaNAC1 as likely involved in the control of seed fatty acid elongation and CsaABI3AVP1-2 and CsabZIP1 as potential regulators of the synthesis and degradation of triacylglycerols (TAGs), respectively. Altogether, the integration of co-expression data and DNA-binding assays permitted us to generate a high-confidence and short list of Camelina TFs involved in the control of lipid metabolism during seed development.

AB  - The stick tea thrip (Dendrothrips minowai) is one of the most serious sucking pests of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) in China, North Korea, and Japan. Plant volatile lures are widely used for both monitoring and mass trapping. Previously, we demonstrated that sticky traps baited with p-anisaldehyde, eugenol, farnesene, or 3-methyl butanal captured significantly more D. minowai in tea plantations, with p-anisaldehyde notably capturing the most. In this study, we showed that D. minowai adults exhibited significantly higher attraction to mixtures of p-anisaldehyde, eugenol, and farnesene compared to an equivalent dose of p-anisaldehyde alone in H-tube olfactometer assays under laboratory conditions. Moreover, in field experiments conducted in 2022, rubber septa impregnated with a ternary blend of p-anisaldehyde, eugenol, and farnesene (at 3-4.5 mg and a ratio of 3:1:1) captured the highest number of adults on sticky traps, outperforming traps bailed with individual components or a solvent control over two weeks. Significantly, the mass trapping strategy employing these lures achieved control efficacies ranging from 62.8% to 70.7% when compared to traps without attractant, which achieved control efficacies of only 14.2% to 35.4% across three test sites in 2023. These results indicate that the combination of p-anisaldehyde, eugenol, and farnesene exhibits an additive or synergistic effect on D. minowai. In conclusion, our findings establish a theoretical framework and provide practical technological support for integrating attractant-based strategies into comprehensive thrips management strategies.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) threaten the productivity and health of sheep worldwide, prompting the need for genetic selection to reduce GIN susceptibility. Fecal egg count (FEC), packed-cell volume (PCV), and various production traits were examined in parasitized Rambouillet sheep and compared to sire FEC estimated breeding value (EBV). Rambouillet lambs (n = 77) were inoculated with 10,000 H. contortus L3 larvae. Subsequently, FEC, PCV, and body weight (BW) were captured at seven-day intervals for six weeks. Lambs were sired by one of two rams with post-weaning FEC EBV of -9% or +9%. Mean FEC differed (p = 0.0132) with lambs from the lower EBV sire ("Sire L") being reduced, versus those from the higher EBV sire ("Sire H"), being 2135 +/- 211 vs. 2912 +/- 207 eggs per gram, respectively. Males and females did not differ for FEC, but females exhibited a higher mean PCV than males, (33.74 vs. 29.65%, p < 0.0001). Lambs were shorn similar to 120 d post artificial infection and wool measurements were captured. A negative correlation between FEC and grease fleece weight was observed. Our results describe the response of Rambouillet lambs to artificial H. contortus infection and suggest FEC EBV can reduce susceptibility to GIN in this breed.

AB  - Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a promising cell source for elucidating disease pathology and therapy. The mass supply of hiPSC-derived cells is technically feasible. Carriers that can contain a large number of hiPSC-derived cells and evaluate their functions in vivo-like environments will become increasingly important for understanding disease pathogenesis or treating end-stage organ failure. hiPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells (hiPSC-HLCs; 5 x 10(8)) were seeded into decellularized organ-derived scaffolds under circumfusion culture. The scaffolds were implanted into immunodeficient microminiature pigs to examine their applicability in vivo. The seeded hiPSC-HLCs demonstrated increased albumin secretion and up-regulated cytochrome P450 activities compared with those in standard two-dimensional culture conditions. Moreover, they showed long-term survival accompanied by neovascularization in vivo. The decellularized organ-derived scaffold is a promising carrier for hiPSC-derived cells for ex vivo and in vivo use and is an essential platform for regenerative medicine and research.

AB  - Almost three decades after its seminal discovery, our understanding of the remarkable TOR pathway continues to expand. As a TOR complex, TORC2 lies at the nexus of many signaling pathways and directs a diverse array of fundamental processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism by integrating environmental and intracellular cues. The dysregulation of TORC2 activity disrupts cellular homeostasis and leads to many pathophysiological conditions. With continued efforts at mapping the signaling landscape, the pace of discovery in TORC2 regulation has been accelerated in recent years. Consequently, emerging evidence has expanded the repertoire of upstream regulators and has revealed unexpected diversity in the modes of TORC2 regulation. Multiple environmental cues and plasma membrane proteins that fine-tune TORC2 activity are unfolding. Furthermore, TORC2 signaling is intricately intertwined with other major signaling pathways. Therefore, feedback and crosstalk regulation also extensively modulate TORC2. In this context, we provide a comprehensive overview of revolutionary concepts regarding emerging regulators of TORC2 and discuss evidence of feedback and crosstalk regulation that shed new light on TORC2 biology.

AB  - The formation and glucosylation of a highly reactive aldoxime are part of the plant defense system against herbivores and pathogens.
   Aldoximes are well-known metabolic precursors for plant defense compounds such as cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates, and volatile nitriles. They are also defenses themselves produced in response to herbivory; however, it is unclear whether aldoximes can be stored over a longer term as defense compounds and how plants protect themselves against the potential autotoxic effects of aldoximes. Here, we show that the Neotropical myrmecophyte tococa (Tococa quadrialata, recently renamed Miconia microphysca) accumulates phenylacetaldoxime glucoside (PAOx-Glc) in response to leaf herbivory. Sequence comparison, transcriptomic analysis, and heterologous expression revealed that 2 cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP79A206 and CYP79A207, and the UDP-glucosyltransferase UGT85A123 are involved in the formation of PAOx-Glc in tococa. Another P450, CYP71E76, was shown to convert PAOx to the volatile defense compound benzyl cyanide. The formation of PAOx-Glc and PAOx in leaves is a very local response to herbivory but does not appear to be regulated by jasmonic acid signaling. In contrast to PAOx, which was only detectable during herbivory, PAOx-Glc levels remained high for at least 3 d after insect feeding. This, together with the fact that gut protein extracts of 3 insect herbivore species exhibited hydrolytic activity toward PAOx-Glc, suggests that the glucoside is a stable storage form of a defense compound that may provide rapid protection against future herbivory. Moreover, the finding that herbivory or pathogen elicitor treatment also led to the accumulation of PAOx-Glc in 3 other phylogenetically distant plant species suggests that the formation and storage of aldoxime glucosides may represent a widespread plant defense response.

AB  - Foraging parasitoids rely on infochemicals, derived from the habitat, host plant and/or host insect itself. Here, we studied the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major pest in olive agroecosystem and its larval parasitoid, Psyttalia concolor (Szepligeti) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a well-established and abundant wasp in Crete. To improve parasitoid's efficiency as biological control agent, more knowledge on its host location behavior is required. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of oviposition- (OIPVs) and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) emitted by olive trees upon infestation by B. oleae as well as cues emitted by B. oleae, e.g., pheromones, therein. We conducted two-choice bioassays to test the preference of P. concolor to different olfactory stimuli. Moreover, we collected headspace volatiles from olive fruits and branches to investigate whether egg or larval infestation changes volatile emissions locally or/and systemically. We found that P. concolor wasps showed a strong preference to volatiles of B. oleae larval-infested fruits (HIPVs) compared to clean air, non-infested, egg-infested, and mechanical-damaged fruits. But they were not able to discriminate between volatiles of non-infested and larval-infested branches. In addition, the wasps were attracted to cues emitted from the virgin and mated B. oleae females. They were neither attracted to cues emitted by the virgin and mated males nor to the olive fruits with or without the cues of the oviposition marking of the B. oleae. We found important qualitative differences in volatile profiles of egg- and larval-infested fruits: nineteen volatile compounds were only detected in infested fruits, such as the terpenoids (E)-& beta;-ocimene and (E,E)-& alpha;-farnesene. Moreover, volatile analysis showed that olives change volatile emissions locally and systemically in response to larval infestation. Our results suggest that both HIPVs and host cues play an important role to P. concolor during host location. Further knowledge on the chemical compounds utilized by the parasitoid to locate infested fruits could help application in olive orchards and to improve the control of the olive fruit fly by natural enemies.

AB  - At a time of climate change, farmers face difficulties in providing food for a growing population. This results in the overuse of water and fertilisers. The aim of the research was to test the possibility of introducing waste sheep wool fibres into a hydrogel to obtain a stable material that could improve water retention and could serve as a fertiliser material matrix. Wool fibres and hydrogel were chosen because of their ability to store water and their degradability. An evaluation of the swelling degree of different alginate-based hydrogel matrices was performed to select the matrix. The stability and water bonding of hydrogels with different wool fibre content were analysed and evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The microstructure and the effect of fibres on the uniformity of the hydrogel were assessed using SEM and optical microscopy. The degree of water retention in the soil was also evaluated. The results showed that it is possible to incorporate wool fibres into the hydrogel matrix and the wool fibres make the composite porous, which allows water penetration into the material much more easily. This research has shown the possibility of using waste wool fibres as an active ingredient in sustainable fertiliser materials.

AB  - Medicating large production animals, such as sows, individually can be challenging, especially when repeated treatments are needed. Intramuscular (i.m.) injections have been shown to be aversive, and an increased reaction could be expected over consecutive days of injections. The aim of this pilot study was to assess if daily repeated i.m. injections cause sows to react differently with time and if injection stress is reflected in increased stress- and pain-related saliva biomarkers. Additionally, the aim was to assess if oxytocin was related to the behaviour reaction of sows during injections. In total 37 sows were allocated randomly into four treatment groups: 1. Sham-injected (SHAM: 9 sows), 2. Control (CON: 11 sows), 3. Penicillin (PEN: 9 sows) and 4. Tetracyclin (TET: 8 sows). The reaction of the sows to injections over three days was subjectively assessed by two observers. Further, SHAM and TET sows were saliva sampled for stress-related biomarkers before and after injections. Treatment (p < 0.001) influenced the medication reaction. Pairwise comparisons showed that the reaction to SHAM treatment was less compared to CON (p = 0.002) and PEN treatments (p < 0.001), while reactions to SHAM did not differ from TET (p > 0.1). Reaction to PEN was higher than that to TET (p = 0.01), while PEN and CON did not differ from each other (p > 0.1). Day tended to affect medication reaction (p = 0.08). The reaction to all other treatments decreased numerically from day 1 to day 3, while this was not the case for the TET treatment. Changes in biomarkers were subtle. Oxytocin tended to increase after TET injection on day 3 (p = 0.05). For the SHAM treatment, some of the biomarkers (chromogranin A, alpha-amylase activity and total esterase activity) showed significant or numerically decreasing trends in POST vs PRE-treatment samples on both days. The oxytocin level before injections was higher in sows that did not react to the medication at all than in sows that showed any kind of reaction (p = 0.008). In conclusion, sows appeared to habituate to the handling and injection, depending on the level of discomfort caused by the injectable substance. Further, the results suggest a potential role of oxytocin in decreasing aversive reactions in sows to human handling.

AB  - There is limited investigation of the alpaca microbiome on a global scale, with no previous research conducted in Australia characterising the faecal microbiome. The microbiome composition in other ruminants has been shown to impact feed efficiency, average daily gain and methane production. This study aimed to characterise the faecal microbiome of alpacas raised in south-eastern Australia and identify variation across geographic regions. Faecal samples were collected from 59 healthy adult female alpacas, aged between 15 months and 17 years in NSW, Australia. Firmicutes were identified as the dominant phyla, accounting for 57.78% of the cumulative abundance, followed by Bacteroidota (29.12%). These two phyla accounted for 90% of the taxa, with the cumulative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteriodota significantly differing (p < 0.05) across locations. There was no effect of age on the frequency of microbes identified at either phyla or class levels. The alpaca's production status only significantly affected the abundance of Firmicutes Clostridia Oscillospirales (p = 0.0026). The breakdown of the alpaca faecal microbiome identified here is consistent with previous ruminant and camelid studies. This study provides a valuable baseline for the microbiome characterisation of alpacas in south-eastern Australia and can be used as a baseline for further microbiome studies.

AB  - Increasing the average grain size of fuel pellets by doping them with chromium oxide is one strategy to improve oxide nuclear fuels performance. The promoted fission gas retention is thought to improve the performance of the fuel at high burnup. In this work, we review models for the solubility of chromium in UO2, 2 , and the evolution of the chromium phases in the fuel matrix during irradiation. These models are implemented in SCIANTIX, an open- source mesoscale code describing inert gas behaviour in nuclear fuel. We adjusted the chromium solubility model keeping each parameter within its range of compatibility with experimental data, targeting a better representation of available electron probe microanalysis data of chromium content in fuel after irradiation. As for fission gas behaviour, we considered a physics-based description of the chromium impact on the fission gas diffusivity in fuel grains. The expression for the fission gas diffusivity in standard non-doped uranium oxide has been extended by introducing the impact of the concentration of defects introduced by interstitial oxygen excess representing the effect of chromium content in the fuel itself. A preliminary integral assessment of the proposed models has been carried out against the available experimental data.

AB  - Telecommunications industries are rapidly deploying the fifth generation (5G) spectrum and there is public concern about the safety and health impacts of this type of Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR), in part because of the lack of comparable scientific evidence. In this study we have used a validated commercially available setting producing a uniform field to expose zebrafish embryos (ZFe) to unmodulated 700 and 3500 MHz frequencies. We have combined a battery of toxicity, developmental and behavioral assays to further explore potential RFR effects. Our neurobehavioral profiles include a tail coiling assay, a light/dark activity assay, two thigmotaxis anxiety assays (auditory and visual stimuli), and a startle response - habituation assay in response to auditory stimuli. ZFe were exposed for 1 and 4 h during the blastula period of development and endpoints evaluated up to 120 hours post fertilization (hpf). Our results show no effects on mortality, hatching or body length. However, we have demonstrated specific organ morphological effects, and behavioral effects in activity, anxiety -like behavior, and habituation that lasted in larvae exposed during the early embryonic period. A decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity was also observed and could explain some of the observed behavioral alterations. Interestingly, effects were more pronounced in ZFe exposed to the 700 MHz frequency, and especially for the 4 h exposure period. In addition, we have demonstrated that our exposure setup is robust, flexible with regard to frequency and power testing, and highly comparable. Future work will include exposure of ZFe to 5G modulated signals for different time periods to better understand the potential health effects of novel 5G RFR.

AB  - Simple Summary In aquaculture, due to the high stocking density, undiversified food, and monotonous environment, the decline in the immune function of cultured animals is a common issue. Therefore, some immunostimulants are usually used to improve the immunity and disease resistance of cultured animals. Astragalus polysaccharides (APSs) have been used as immunostimulants in aquaculture for more than 20 years, and their immune-promoting effects have been well-verified in a large number of cultured animals. Seahorses are widely cultivated in China, and recently also face the issue of decline in immune capacity. Up until now, there has been no report of APS application in this animal. In order to test whether APSs would also have immune-promoting effects on seahorses, we conducted several investigations in this study. The results showed that dietary APSs could significantly improve the growth, survivorship, plasma immune levels, and intestinal microbiota diversity of seahorse juveniles as well as the reproductive performance of seahorse broodstocks. These results are valuable for the healthy breeding of seahorses.Abstract Seahorse (Hippocampus spp.) is popular in the markets of traditional Chinese medicine, aquarium, and curio. In order to protect wild stocks and still meet the market demand, China attempted the large-scale cultivation of seahorses in the early 21st century and achieved it in the 2010s. However, in recent years, two new issues have gradually emerged in Chinese seahorse cultivation. One is that the juveniles are prone to disease during diet conversion, and the other is that the reproductive performance of broodstocks is significantly reduced. With the aim to provide some measures that can alleviate these issues, in the present study, we used lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus, a species widely cultured in China) as the experimental subject and Astragalus polysaccharides (APSs) as the immunostimulant to test whether APSs could improve the immune-health status and reproductive performance of seahorses. The measured indices for reproductive performance included ovarian lipid content, assessment time required before mating for paired male and female seahorses, mating success rate, brood size, and newborn body height. The results showed that for juveniles during diet conversion, their body weight, survival rate, plasma immunocytokine contents (interleukin-2, interferon-alpha, and immunoglobulin M), and alpha diversity indices (Simpson and Pielou's-e) of the intestinal microbiota were significantly higher than those of the control group after dietary APSs. For broodstocks, compared with the control group, the expression of lipid substances in the ovary was significantly upregulated, the assessment time was significantly shortened, and the body height of their newborns was significantly increased in the APS group. These results demonstrate that APSs could indeed improve the immune-health status and reproductive performance of seahorses, providing guidance for addressing existing issues in seahorse cultivation.

AB  - The high water content and low nutrient concentration of digestate complicate its storage, transportation, and utilization. Subsequent digestate processing can effectively remove water and influence nutrient partitioning among digestate fractions and final products. The current study was carried out to evaluate the performance of two typical digestate processing chains, solid and liquid ones, respectively, and to give practical recommendations for optimization. Two fully operating biogas plants with advanced heat utilization were considered as data sources. The digestate mass flow balance of dry matter (DM), water, total N (TN), and ammonium-N mass flows was performed and the efficiency of the examined processing units was calculated. It was found that solid-liquid separation of raw digestate shifted 73-87% of TN and 60-93% of NH4-N to the liquid phase. Subsequent drying of separated solid fraction removed about 6% of the initial water and required 84% less thermal energy per kg N recovered than the processing of separated liquid. The final product, pellets, contained 14% of initial TN, but only 2% of initial NH4-N as a result of microbial conversion of inorganic N during drying. Vacuum evaporation of separated liquid fraction removed 34% of the initial water and left a DM-rich concentrate. At the same time, an ammonium sulfate solution (ASS) containing 21% of initial TN and 34% of initial NH4-N was produced. Both evaluated processing chains showed specific advantages and challenges. Solid products were characterized by a high share of recalcitrant organic compounds and could serve as a soil improver. Liquid processing concentrated plant-available N in ASS, which could be used as valuable inorganic fertilizer.

AB  - Fishmeal, as one of the main protein sources, has become scarce and expensive. This conventional protein source is no longer considered sustainable. As an alternative, black soldier fly (BSF) is a popular non-conventional protein source that has been tested in the formulation of aquafeed to replace fishmeal due to its nutritional value, reasonably low price, and large abundance. Nevertheless, evidence on the BSF supplementation varied among species. This meta-analysis examined the influence of replacing fishmeal with BSF on the performance of fish species by using 47 published papers targeting 23 different species. The results revealed that, overall, BSF inclusion had no significant effect on survival rate (SR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The magnitude effect on specific growth rate (SGR) and weight gain (WG) was species-dependent; it increased SGR and WG of omnivores but decreased (P<0.01) when fed to carnivores and herbivores. Meta-regression analysis indicated a negative linear relationship of FCR on carnivore (P<0.05; R-2=0.61) and omnivore (P<0.05; R-2=0.15). In addition, principal component analysis confirmed that although most species showed an increasing trend in response to dietary BSF, FCR decreased on a few species (Anabas testudineus and Acipenser baerii) which belong to omnivores. In conclusion, BSF meal can be a partial substitute for fishmeal in the formulation of only some specific species no more than 30%. Special notice should be considered on carnivore and herbivore species because utilisation of BSF in species might compromise their performance.

AB  - Despite tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] is one of the top non-alcoholic beverages consumed around the world; its genetic and phenotypic diversity is less understood compared to other plantation crops. The study's aims were to undertake phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Sri Lankan and Indian tea germplasm and to identify diverse accessions to accelerate tea breeding programmes in both countries. A total of 171 tea accessions, comprising 94 Sri Lankan and 77 Indian accessions were used. All the accessions were subjected to phenotyping and genotyping using 28 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Based on 16 morphological characters, the first three principal components explained 57.61% and 58.43% of the total variability of Sri Lankan and Indian accessions, respectively. Young shoot pubescence, young shoot pigmentation, serration of leaf margin, and mature leaf colour contributed positively to the grouping of accessions. Based on Neighbor-joining analysis, all Sri Lankan accessions grouped in a single cluster, whereas Indian accessions grouped in two distinct clusters. The Gower's distance method was the most appropriate than other methods for developing core subsets. Among 21 Sri Lankan core accessions selected, 11 accessions belong to introductions, five TRI-developed cultivars and five estate selections. Among 18 Indian core accessions selected, 11 belong to China types, two Assam types and five Indian recommended cultivars. The current study is the first study to compare tea germplasm of both countries and the results are useful for tea crop improvement programme, conservation and utilization of tea germplasm in India and Sri Lanka in the future.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of GnRH at insemination on pregnancy and lambing in seven ewe populations during the breeding season. Estrus was synchronized in 1560 adult ewes using an intravaginal sponge impregnated with flurogestone acetate. The sponge was left in the vagina for 12 days followed by an injection of 330 IU of eCG at sponge removal. Each ewe was inseminated twice at 48 h and 60 h after sponge removal. The treatment group was intramuscularly injected at the first insemination with a dose of 16 mu g GnRH and the control group with saline solution in each ewe population. The results showed that GnRH administration significantly decreased the pregnancy rate in three ewe populations, but had no effects in four ewe populations. Additionally, the litter size tended to increase in the treatment group compared to the control group in all seven ewe populations, but the difference was not significant. In conclusion, GnRH administration at insemination was not recommended for ewes undergoing a timed artificial insemination during the breeding season. The breed/population may be a critical determinant of the potential for exploiting GnRH application in sheep breeding programs.

AB  - Introduction: Among cultivated tea plants (Camellia sinensis), only four mitogenomes for C. sinensis var. assamica (CSA) have been reported so far but none for C. sinensis var. sinensis (CSS). Here, two mitogenomes of CSS (CSSDHP and CSSRG) have been sequenced and assembled. Methods: Using a combination of Illumina and Nanopore data for the first time. Comparison between CSS and CSA mitogenomes revealed a huge heterogeneity. Results: The number of the repetitive sequences was proportional to the mitogenome size and the repetitive sequences dominated the intracellular gene transfer segments (accounting for 88.7%- 92.8% of the total length). Predictive RNA editing analysis revealed that there might be significant editing in NADH dehydrogenase subunit transcripts. Codon preference analysis showed a tendency to favor A/T bases and T was used more frequently at the third base of the codon. ENc plots analysis showed that the natural selection play an important role in shaping the codon usage bias, and Ka/Ks ratios analysis indicated Nad1 and Sdh3 genes may have undergone positive selection. Further, phylogenetic analysis shows that six C. sinensis clustered together, with the CSA and CSS forming two distinct branches, suggesting two different evolutionary pathway. Discussion: Altogether, this investigation provided an insight into evolution and phylogeny relationship of C. sinensis mitogenome, thereby enhancing comprehension of the evolutionary patterns within C. sinensis species.

AB  - The spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) into agricultural soils, products, and foods severely limits the use of organic fertilizers in agriculture. In order to help designing agricultural practices that minimize the spread of ARG, we fertilized, sown, and harvested lettuces and radish plants in experimental land plots for two consecutive agricul-tural cycles using four types of fertilizers: mineral fertilization, sewage sludge, pig slurry, or composted organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The analysis of the relative abundances of more than 200,000 ASV (Amplicon Sequence Var-iants) identified a small, but significant overlap (<10%) between soil's and fertilizer microbiomes. Clinically relevant ARG were found in higher loads (up to 100 fold) in fertilized soils than in the initial soil, particularly in those treated with organic fertilizers, and their loads grossly correlated to the amount of antibiotic residues found in the correspond-ing fertilizer. Similarly, low, but measurable ARG loads were found in lettuce (tetM,sul1) and radish (sul1), correspond-ing the lowest values to samples collected from minerally fertilized fields. Comparison of soil samples collected along the total period of the experiment indicated a relatively year-round stability of soil microbiomes in amended soils, whereas ARG loads appeared as unstable and transient. The results indicate that ARG loads in soils and foodstuffs were likely linked to the contribution of bacteria from organic fertilizer to the soil microbiomes, suggesting that an ad-equate waste management and good pharmacological and veterinarian practices may significantly reduce the presence of these ARGs in agricultural soils and plant products.

AB  - This study characterized nitrogen removal and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from lab-scale anoxic/aerobic sequencing batch reactor (AOSBR) and intermittent aeration sequencing batch reactor (IASBR), respectively, for treating synthetic municipal wastewater. The N2O emission was evaluated in a simulated cycle, and batch conditions of aerobic nitrification, simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND), and aerobic denitrification. The results show that nitrogen removal was enhanced in IASBR compared to AOSBR, with 94.2% and 67.9% of total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency in IASBR and AOSBR, respectively. In the simulated cycle, the emission factors (of oxidized ammonium) were 4.9% and 0.6% in AOSBR and IASBR, respectively. Under batch conditions, the N2O emission factors during SND were obviously higher than that during aerobic nitrification and denitrification. The N2O emission factors during SND ranging 0.68-11.68% in AOSBR and 1.25-5.13% in IASBR. Furthermore, N2O emission under batch conditions was affected by the aeration ratios. Moderate and high aeration ratios used in this study stimulated the N2O emission from SND. The N2O emission was enhanced with the nitrite accumulation during aerobic nitrification when the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria was inhibited by a chemical inhibitor. Aerobic denitrification via nitrite could be the main pathway of N2O generation from SND processes. The findings from our study can help further understand N2O emission mechanisms and guide the optimization of the current wastewater treatment process for minimizing N2O emission.

AB  - Few flower buds in a high-yield year are the main factors restricting the yield of Camellia oleifera in the next year. However, there are no relevant reports on the regulation mechanism of flower bud formation. In this study, hormones, mRNAs, and miRNAs were tested during flower bud formation in MY3 ("Min Yu 3," with stable yield in different years) and QY2 ("Qian Yu 2," with less flower bud formation in a high-yield year) cultivars. The results showed that except for IAA, the hormone contents of GA(3), ABA, tZ, JA, and SA in the buds were higher than those in the fruit, and the contents of all hormones in the buds were higher than those in the adjacent tissues. This excluded the effect of hormones produced from the fruit on flower bud formation. The difference in hormones showed that 21-30 April was the critical period for flower bud formation in C. oleifera; the JA content in MY3 was higher than that in QY2, but a lower concentration of GA(3) contributed to the formation of the C. oleifera flower bud. JA and GA(3) might have different effects on flower bud formation. Comprehensive analysis of the RNA-seq data showed that differentially expressed genes were notably enriched in hormone signal transduction and the circadian system. Flower bud formation in MY3 was induced through the plant hormone receptor TIR1 (transport inhibitor response 1) of the IAA signaling pathway, the miR535-GID1c module of the GA signaling pathway, and the miR395-JAZ module of the JA signaling pathway. In addition, the expression of core clock components GI (GIGANTEA) and CO (CONSTANS) in MY3 increased 2.3-fold and 1.8-fold over that in QY2, respectively, indicating that the circadian system also played a role in promoting flower bud formation in MY3. Finally, the hormone signaling pathway and circadian system transmitted flowering signals to the floral meristem characteristic genes LFY (LEAFY) and AP1 (APETALA 1) via FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T) and SOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1) to regulate flower bud formation. These data will provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of flower bud alternate formation and formulating high yield regulation measures for C. oleifera.

AB  - To optimize the clinical approach to non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), it is essential to gain insight into its long-term effects on cognition and behaviors. Here, we investigated limbic NCSE-induced hippocampal injury and behavioral deficits in peri-adolescent rats. NCSE was induced in P43 Sprague Dawley rats with intrahippocampal subconvulsive doses of kainic acid (NCSE group, n = 14) under continuous epidural cortical electroencephalography (EEG). Controls received volume-matched saline (n = 18). Following one month of continuous EEG monitoring, rats were sequentially subjected (P73-91) to the open field, the Morris water maze (MWM), and the modified two-way active avoidance (MAAV). Rats were sacrificed at P91 to histologically assess hippocampal injury with NeuN (neuronal nuclei) staining, levels of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and synaptophysin (Syp). Following kainic acid administration, the NCSE group experienced electroclinical seizures characterized by behavioral arrest and oromotor automatisms without tonic-clonic activity (latency: 15.93 +/- 4.70 min, duration: 68.35 +/- 17.97 min). There were no seizure recurrences in the rest of the long-term recordings. Compared to controls, NCSE rats had impaired place learning in the MWM, and lower rates of contextcued shock avoidance in the MAAV (p < 0.05). The NCSE and control groups had comparable hippocampal neuronal densities and GFAP levels, but NCSE rats had significantly lower hilar Syp levels. One episode of limbic NCSE during peri-adolescence results in later life hippocampal synaptic dysfunction and contextual learning deficits. These data suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE should be prompt.

AB  - Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an important cash crop with extensive adaptability in the world. However, complex environmental factors force a large variation of tea quality-related components. Caffeine is essential for the formation of bitter and fresh flavors in tea, and is the main compound of tea that improves human alertness. Continuous strong light stimulation was observed to cause caffeine reduction in tea leaves, but the mechanism is not clear. In this study, the response of tea plant to light intensity was analysed mainly by multi-omics association, antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (asODN) silencing technique, and in vitro enzyme activity assay. The results revealed multiple strategies for light intensity adaptation in tea plant, among which the regulation of chloroplasts, photosynthesis, porphyrin metabolism, and resistance to oxidative stress were prominent. Caffeine catabolism was enhanced in continuous strong light, which may be a light-adapted strategy due to strict regulation by xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). asODN silencing and enzymatic activity assays confirmed that CsXDH1 is a protein induced by light intensity to catalyze the substrate xanthine. CsXDH1 asODN silencing resulted in significant up-regulation of both caffeine and theobromine in in vitro enzyme activity assay, but not in vivo. CsXDH1 may act as a coordinator in light intensity adaptation, thus disrupting this balance of caffeine catabolism.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning (that is, removal from the sow) and the following two months are the riskiest periods in a pig's life, especially for pig's gastrointestinal health. The change in diet due to the suspension of the mother's milk, accompanied by an acceleration of both morphological and enzymatic maturation of the intestinal mucosa of the piglets, can worsen digestion and absorption. In this context, the protein requirement of piglets, which are in a phase of rapid growth, may be greater than the intestine's ability to digest proteins. Undigested proteins are the best pabulum for the proliferation of the pathogenic bacterial flora that causes diarrhea. Since these problems can no longer be resolved with prophylactic use of antibiotics, the best balance between intestinal health and growth performance must be found. A diet low in crude protein and supplemented with synthetic amino acids can help achieve this goal. The aim of this research has been to assess the effect of the dietary protein level on piglet growth and post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) incidence. Piglet fecal microbiota and feces composition were also assessed. The experiment was carried out on 144 weaned piglets (Duroc x Large White; 72 piglets per treatment) and lasted from weaning (at 25 days of age) until the end of the post-weaning phase (at 95 days). Two dietary protein levels were compared: high (HP; 17.5% crude protein on average, during the experiment) and low (LP; 15.5% on average). Lower (p < 0.01) average daily gain and feed conversion ratio were observed in LP piglets in the first growth phase. However, at the end of the post-weaning period, the growth parameters were not significantly different in the two diets. Diarrhea scores were lower in piglets fed LP diets than in piglets fed HP diets (28.6% of the total vs. 71.4% in the HP piglets). Fibrobacteres, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes were more abundant in the feces of the piglets fed LP diets. Feces nitrogen content was lower in piglets fed LP diets. In conclusion, low protein levels in the diet can reduce the incidence of PWD while only marginally affecting growth parameters.

AB  - Groundwater is a valuable source of drinking water worldwide, recognized as an improved drinking water source. However, on-site sanitation systems may put groundwater at risk of fecal contamination. In the present study, two approaches were used to ascertain the sources of fecal contamination in groundwater used by communities of the Vhembe District Municipality. Overall, 87.5% of boreholes (n = 70) in the wet and 72.5% in the dry season were contaminated with Escherichia coli, and septic tank (n = 18) wastewaters displayed up to 10(4 )cfu/mL E. coli. Host-specific Bacteroidales quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays established the presence of human (BacHum and HF183) and animal (Cytb, BacCan, and Pig-2Bac) genetic markers in groundwater from 15.7% of boreholes (wet) and 10% of boreholes (dry). No strong associations were founded between culturable E. coli counts and the presence/absence of marker genes for all the markers except for Cytb marker, which showed a weak significant correlation (r = 0.217; p = <0.01) between E. coli and the Cytb marker under dry seasonal conditions. Human markers and Cytb were present in the household septic tank wastewater samples. Significant differences in marker genes distribution in wastewater were observed using the Chi-squared test: HF183 (p = <0.001) and BacHum (p = <0.001). Overall, no association was recorded between markers in groundwater and in wastewater for 18 households' septic tanks. A combined culturable E. coli and host-specific Bacteroidales qPCR assays remain an appropriate approach for the identification of fecal contamination of groundwater.Practitioner Points Households primarily used private boreholes for drinking water, as a primary source. Most households used on-site sanitation systems, including ventilated improved pit latrines and flush toilets connected to septic tanks. Escherichia coli was detected in groundwater, and the sources of fecal contamination were humans and animals (pigs, dogs, and chickens). The presence of human and animal markers in groundwater suggests that humans and animals are liable for fecal contamination. Fecal contamination in drinking water sources poses a significant concern due to pathogenic microorganisms posing potential human health risks.

AB  - A large body of research has been dedicated to understanding the factors that modulate spatial cognition and attributes of the hippocampus, a highly plastic brain region that underlies spatial processing abilities. Variation in gonadal hormones impacts spatial memory and hippocampal attributes in vertebrates, although the direction of the effect has not been entirely consistent. To add complexity, individuals in the field must optimize fitness by coordinating activities with the appropriate environmental cues, and many of these behaviors are correlated tightly with seasonal variation in gonadal hormone release. As such, it remains unclear if the relationship among systemic gonadal hormones, spatial cognition, and the hippocampus also exhibits seasonal variation. This review presents an overview of the relationship among gonadal hormones, the hippocampus, and spatial cognition, and how the seasonal release of gonadal hormones correlates with seasonal variation in spatial cognition and hippocampal attributes. Additionally, this review presents other neuroendocrine mechanisms that may be involved in modulating the relationship among seasonality, gonadal hormone release, and the hippocampus and spatial cognition, including seasonal rhythms of steroid hormone binding globulins, neurosteroids, sex steroid hormone receptor expression, and hormone interactions. Here, endocrinology, ecology, and behavioral neuroscience are brought together to present an overview of the research demonstrating the mechanistic effects of systemic gonadal hormones on spatial cognition and the hippocampus, while, at a functional level, superimposing seasonal effects to examine ecologically-relevant circannual changes in gonadal hormones and spatial behaviors.

AB  - Simple Summary Many human diseases are not yet fully understood. Tests in animals can support the evaluation of new techniques meant to be applied in humans. Such animal experiments can only be justified with continuous improvements of the analgesic protocols during and after surgery. This study was designed to test the efficacy and feasibility of a technique aiming to desensitize the large nerves of one hind limb in experimental sheep undergoing invasive surgery on one hind limb. This technique was compared to epidural analgesia, a technique known to be effective in alleviating pain but leading to stress due to an inability to move both hind limbs in the early post-operative phase. Nerve blocks of peripheral nerves are widely used in human and veterinary medicine and can improve peri-operative pain therapy. The following study demonstrated that peripheral nerve block provided comparable analgesia to epidural anesthesia. Peripheral nerve blocks of the sciatic and femoral nerves can be used as an alternative to epidural analgesia in experimental sheep. Peripheral nerve blocks are commonly used in human and veterinary medicine. The aim of the study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of a combined block of the femoral and sciatic nerves with an epidural injection of ropivacaine in experimental sheep undergoing orthopaedic hind limb surgery. Twenty-five sheep were assigned to two groups (peripheral nerve block; sciatic and femoral nerves (P); epidural analgesia (E)). In group P 10 mL ropivacaine 0.5% was injected around the sciatic and the femoral nerves under sonographic guidance and 10 mL NaCl 0.9% into the epidural space while in group E 10 mL ropivacaine 0.5% was injected into the epidural space and 10 mL NaCl 0.9% to the sciatic and the femoral nerves. During surgery, heart rate, respiratory rate and mean blood pressure were used as indicators of nociception. In the postoperative phase, nociception was evaluated every hour by use of a purposefully adapted pain score until the animal showed painful sensation at the surgical site. The mean duration of analgesia at the surgical wound was 6 h in group P and 8 h in group E. Mean time to standing was 4 h in group P and 7 h in group E. In conclusion time to standing was significantly shorter in group P while the duration of nociception was comparable in both groups. The peripheral nerve block can be used as an alternative to epidural analgesia in experimental sheep.

AB  - Cyphostemma hypoleucum (Harv.) Desc. ex Wild & R.B. Drumm is a perennial climber, indigenous to Southern Africa, and belongs to the Vitaceae. Although there have been many studies of Vitaceae micromorphology, only a few taxa have been described in detail. This study aimed to characterize the micro-morphology of the leaf indumentum and determining its possible functions. Stereo microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to produce images. Micrographs of stereomicroscopy and SEM showed the presence of non-glandular trichomes. In addition, pearl glands were observed on the abaxial surface using a stereo microscope and SEM. These were characterized by a short stalk and a spherical- shaped head. The density of trichomes decreased on both surfaces of leaves as the leaf expanded. Idioblasts that contained raphide crystals were also detected in tissues. The results obtained from various microscopy techniques confirmed that non-glandular trichomes serve as the main external appendages of the leaves. Additionally, their functions may include serving as a mechanical barrier against environmental factors such as low humidity, intense light, elevated temperatures, as well as herbivory and insect oviposition. Our results may also be added to the existing body of knowledge with regard to microscopic research and taxonomic applications.

AB  - Phoebe is a well-known timber tree species that contains abundant metabolites characterized by flavonoids that are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, temporospatial flavonoid metabolism variations substantially impact the Phoebe industry. Thus, a metabolomics analysis was carried out and identified 465 metabolites (102 flavonoids) in P. bournei, revealing distinct distribution patterns among five studied organs, and most of the flavonoids were dominant in the leaves. Furthermore, three kaempferol glycoside derivatives were significantly accumulated in the leaves and showed higher contents in young leaves than in mature leaves and differences between spring and autumn. For instance, greater accumulation of kaempferol-7-O-rhamnoside was detected in spring, whereas higher contents of kaempferol-3-O-arabinofuranoside and kaempferol-3-Orhamnoside were found in autumn. Integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics identified 20 transcription factors (TFs) and 12 structural genes that participate in kaempferol derivative synthesis and elucidated a potential regulatory mechanism in P. bournei. Of the identified genes, PbMYB211 might contribute significantly to the kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside content by regulating the target structural gene PbUGT139, as revealed by transient overexpression analysis. Overall, this study illuminated the temporospatial accumulation of flavonoids among different organs, seasons, and developmental stages in P. bournei and elucidated a potential regulatory pathway of kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside. The results provide important insights into harvest techniques and a theoretical basis for the comprehensive utilization of P. bournei.

AB  - Trichomes are key functional traits that protect plants against abiotic stresses, herbivores and pathogens. In addition to their ecological roles, trichomes show high morphological variability in many lineages, providing useful characters for species characterization and taxon delimitation. Here, we focus on trichomes in Croton, a megadiverse genus (c. 1200 spp.) of Euphorbiaceae, in which these structures are ubiquitous and exhibit significant variation in form, location on the plant body, density and function. Owing to their functional and taxonomic relevance and the current need for further standardization of their terminology and classification, we revised previous trichome classifications used in the genus. We also provide new trichome data by expanding taxon sampling and using different methodological approaches in plant anatomy to improve understanding of the structural patterns of the trichome types present in the genus. On the basis of our results and literature review, we propose a new classification for trichomes in Croton based on well-defined parameters; this clarifies existing redundancies, is consistent with anatomical evidence and can be easily updated as new types are revealed in future surveys. This contribution will improve communication among taxonomists and promote more meaningful morphological comparability across systematics studies, including those focusing on morphological evolution and functional traits.

AB  - N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most prevalent modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), plays a key role in various developmental processes in mammals. Three proteins that affect RNA m(6)A modification have been identified: methyltransferases, demethylases, and m(6)A-binding proteins, known as "writer," "eraser," and "reader" proteins, respectively. However, changes in the m(6)A modification when early porcine embryos are exposed to stress remain unclear. In this study, we exposed porcine oocytes to a high temperature (HT, 41 degrees C) for 10 h, after which the mature oocytes were parthenogenetically activated and cultured for 7 days to the blastocyst stage. HT significantly decreased the rates of the first polar body extrusion and blastocyst formation. Further detection of m(6)A modification found that HT can lead to increased expression levels of "reader," YTHDF2, and "writer," METTL3, and decreased expression levels of "eraser," FTO, resulting in an increased level of m(6)A modification in the embryos. Additionally, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is upregulated under HT conditions. Our study demonstrated that HT exposure alters m(6)A modification levels, which further affects early porcine embryonic development.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the effects of the incremental injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on liver histopathology, inflammation, oxidative status, and mitochondrial function in piglets. Forty healthy Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire castrated boars (21 +/- 2 days old, weight 6.84 +/- 0.11 kg) were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 8) and then slaughtered on days 0 (group 0, without LPS injection), 1 (group 1), 5 (group 5), 9 (group 9), and 15 (group 15) of LPS injection, respectively. The results showed that, compared to the piglets without LPS injection, LPS injection caused liver injury in the early phase, as manifested by the increased activities of serum liver injury-related parameters (aspartate amino transferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase, and total bile acid) on day 1, and impaired liver morphology (disordered hepatic cell cord arrangement, dissolved and vacuolized hepatocytes, karyopycnosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration and congestion) on days 1 and 5. Meanwhile, LPS injection caused liver inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction on days 1 and 5, as reflected by the upregulated mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kappa B; increased MPO and MDA content; and impaired mitochondrial morphology. However, these parameters were ameliorated in the later phase (days 9 similar to 15). Taken together, our data indicate that the incremental injection of the LPS-induced liver injury of piglets could be self-repaired.

AB  - (1) Introduction: Simultaneous ECMO and IABP therapy is frequently used. Haemodynamic changes responsible for the success of the concomitant mechanical circulatory support system approach are rarely investigated. In a large-animal model, we analysed haemodynamic parameters before and during ECMO therapy, comparing central and peripheral ECMO circulation with and without simultaneous IABP support. (2) Methods: Thirty-three female pigs were divided into five groups: (1) SHAM, (2) (peripheral)ECMO(-)IABP, (3) (p)ECMO(+)IABP, (4) (central)ECMO(-)IABP, and (5) (c)ECMO(+)IABP. Pigs were cannulated in accordance with the group and supported with ECMO (+/- IABP) for 10 h. Systemic haemodynamics, cardiac index (CI), and coronary and carotid artery blood flow were determined before, directly after, and at five and ten hours on extracorporeal support. Systemic inflammation (IL-6; IL-10; TNF alpha; IFN gamma), immune response (NETs; cf-DNA), and endothelial injury (ET-1) were also measured. (3) Results: IABP support during antegrade ECMO circulation led to a significant reduction of left ventricular pressure in comparison to retrograde flow in (p)ECMO(-)IABP and (p)ECMO(+)IABP. Blood flow in the left anterior coronary and carotid artery was not affected by extracorporeal circulation. (4) Conclusions: Concomitant central ECMO and IABP therapy leads to significant reduction of intracavitary cardiac pressure, reduces cardiac work, and might therefore contribute to improved recovery in ECMO patients.

AB  - Research disciplines in science have historically developed in silos but are increasingly multidisciplinary. Here, we assessed how the insect ecology literature published in ecological and entomological journals has developed over the last 20 years and which topics have crossed discipline boundaries. We used structural topic modelling to assess research trends from 34 304 articles published in six ecology journals and six entomology journals between 2000 and 2020. We then identified and compared topics that emerged from the entire body of literature, or corpus, with topics that emerged from a subsection of articles that focused only on insects (insect corpus). We found that, within the entire corpus, topics on 'Community ecology', 'Traits, life history & physiology' and 'Ecological methods & theory' became more prevalent over time (hot topics), whereas 'Population modelling', 'Insect development', 'Reproduction & ontogeny' and 'Plant growth' declined in prevalence over the 20 years we surveyed (cold topics). In the insect corpus, we found that hot topics included 'Thermal tolerance' and 'Disease vectors', whereas cold topics included 'Herbivore phenology', 'Insect-plant interactions' and 'Parasitoids and parasites'. 'Landscape ecology' was a growth topic area for both corpora. Our findings suggest that insect-related research is a major component of the broader ecological discipline, and there are topics in ecology where insect research aligns with general ecological trends. However, specific topics unique to the insect corpora - such as insect taxonomy - are fundamental to both insect and ecology research.

FX  - We thank the Ecological Society of Australia for providing the funding and resource to enable the workshop to develop the manuscripts initial ideas. The Ecological Society of Australia, Insect Ecology Research Chapter runs a series of workshops to bring insect ecologists together throughout the year. A key driver of these workshops is articulating the need for ecological research to mobilise at a national scale, as well as integrate between other taxa and ecological disciplines to develop a broader ecological perspective. This study's initial impetus was an insect ecology-focussed workshop on the 30th November 2018, as part of the Ecological Society of Australia annual conference in Brisbane, Australia. Workshop participants identified the critical lack of understanding of how insect-related literature fits into the broader ecological landscape and how resolving this knowledge gap might help identify future insect ecology research priorities.

AB  - Mineral imbalances in sheep can have significant health and economic consequences, yet regional assessments of trace mineral and toxic element status are limited. Oregon is an endemically selenium (Se)-deficient region, but a statewide evaluation has not been conducted. This study assessed whole blood concentrations of 18 elements in 370 clinically normal ewes from 56 farms across Oregon to determine the prevalence of deficiencies and potential toxic exposures. A deficiency threshold of <120 ng Se/mL whole blood was used. We found that 28% of animals were Se-deficient, and 27% of farms had an average whole blood Se below this threshold. No animals reportedly showed overt clinical signs of deficiency or toxicity, and no excessive exposure to toxic elements such as arsenic, lead, or cadmium was found. We also compared mineral concentrations in blood collected using standard EDTA tubes versus mineral-free EDTA tubes, and in whole blood versus plasma, to assess alternative sampling strategies. Strong correlations (r > 0.9) for Se, cobalt (Co), and molybdenum (Mo) between plasma and whole blood allowed for the derivation of conversion equations. These findings provide updated insights into the mineral status of Oregon sheep, contribute to whole blood reference data, and support practical alternatives to improve trace mineral testing in field conditions.

AB  - In liver surgery, biliary obstruction can lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis, a life-threatening disease with liver transplantation as the only curative treatment option. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been shown to improve liver function in both acute and chronic liver disease models. This study evaluated the effect of allogenic MSC transplantation in a large animal model of repeated biliary obstruction followed by partial hepatectomy. MSC transplantation supported the growth of regenerated liver tissue after 14 days (MSC group, n = 10: from 1087 +/- 108 (0 h) to 1243 +/- 92 mL (14 days); control group, n = 11: from 1080 +/- 95 (0 h) to 1100 +/- 105 mL (14 days), p = 0.016), with a lower volume fraction of hepatocytes in regenerated liver tissue compared to resected liver tissue (59.5 +/- 10.2% vs. 70.2 +/- 5.6%, p < 0.05). Volume fraction of connective tissue, blood vessels and bile vessels in regenerated liver tissue, serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP and GGT) and liver metabolites (albumin, bilirubin, urea and creatinine), as well as plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta, were not affected by MSC transplantation. In our novel, large animal (pig) model of repeated biliary obstruction followed by partial hepatectomy, MSC transplantation promoted growth of liver tissue without any effect on liver function. This study underscores the importance of translating results between small and large animal models as well as the careful translation of results from animal model into human medicine.

AB  - BackgroundWhile prior studies have identified regional reduction in gray matter (GM) volume in schizophrenia, it remains unclear whether these alterations are concentrated in specific brain functional areas and how they relate to genetic factors. This study aimed to identify Brodmann's areas (BAs) with affected GM volume in individuals with schizophrenia, explore associated genetic variants through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), and investigate the potential roles of these genes during cortical development. MethodsThe study recruited 194 individuals with schizophrenia and 330 healthy controls from the Taiwan Aging Mental Illness cohort. T1-weighted MRI scans were processed to assess GM volume changes, and the cerebral cortex was parcellated into BAs for detailed analysis. GWAS was conducted to identify schizophrenia-associated genetic variants, followed by functional mapping, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of developing human cortical cells, and in situ hybridization analysis in the developing mouse neocortex. ResultsSignificant reductions in GM volume were found in specific BAs, particularly in the ventral frontal cortex, anterior temporal lobe, and cingulate cortex, with BA13, BA23, BA24, BA25, BA27, BA28, BA31, BA34, BA35, and BA38 showing the most pronounced changes. GWAS identified multiple genetic variants associated with these affected BAs. Further, single-cell RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization analyses revealed dynamic expression patterns of the schizophrenia-associated genes during cortical development, suggesting their potential roles in the structural abnormalities observed in schizophrenia. ConclusionsThe findings support the hypothesis that specific BAs are more vulnerable to GM volume reduction in schizophrenia, potentially driven by distinct genetic factors.

AB  - Craniomaxillofacial bone defects represent a clinical challenge in the fields of maxillofacial surgery and (implant) dentistry. Regeneration of these bone defects requires the application of bone graft materials that facilitate new bone formation in a safe, reliable, and predictive manner. In addition to autologous bone graft, several types of (synthetic) bone substitute materials have become clinically available, and still major efforts are focused on improving such bone substitute materials by optimizing their properties. Given the regulatory necessity to evaluate the performance of new bone substitute materials for craniomaxillofacial bone regeneration in a large animal model with similarity to human bone before clinical application, we here describe a mini-pig mandibular bone defect model that allows for the creation of multiple (critical-size) bone defects within the mandibular body of a single animal. As examples of bone substitute materials, we utilize both the clinically used BioOss granules and an experimental calcium phosphate cement for filling the created defects. Regarding the latter, its advantages are the injectable application within the defect site, in which the material rapidly sets, and the tailorable degradation properties via the inclusion of hydrolytically degrading polymeric particles. For both bone substitute materials, we show the suitability of the bone defect model to assess bone regeneration via histology and micro-computed tomography. Impact statementGiven the regulatory necessity to evaluate the performance of new bone substitute materials for craniomaxillofacial bone regeneration in a large animal model with similarity to the human bone before clinical application, we here describe a mini-pig mandibular bone defect model that allows for the creation of multiple (critical-size) bone defects within the mandibular body of a single animal that can be used for the evaluation of the bone regenerative capacity of new bone grafting materials as well as tissue-engineered products for alveolar bone regeneration.

AB  - Experience-dependent plasticity is a key feature of brain synapses for which neuronal N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a major role, from developmental circuit refinement to learning and memory. Astrocytes also express NMDARs, although their exact function has remained controversial. Here, we identify in mouse hippocampus, a circuit function for GluN2C NMDAR, a subtype highly expressed in astrocytes, in layer-specific tuning of synaptic strengths in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Interfering with astrocyte NMDAR or GluN2C NMDAR activity reduces the range of presynaptic strength distribution specifically in the stratum radiatum inputs without an appreciable change in the mean presynaptic strength. Mathematical modeling shows that narrowing of the width of presynaptic release probability distribution compromises the expression of long-term synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest a novel feedback signaling system that uses astrocyte GluN2C NMDARs to adjust basal synaptic weight distribution of Schaffer collateral inputs, which in turn impacts computations performed by the CA1 pyramidal neuron.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the alterations in selected indicators of immune responses and oxidative stress of broilers fed with nano-manganese. One hundred sixty 1-day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned into four groups with three replicates. Birds were fed the same basal diet supplemented with nano-manganese oxide, as 0.00 (control group), 50.00, 100, or 150 mg kg(-1) of diet. The birds were vaccinated against avian influenza (AI), Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bronchitis (IB) and infectious bursal disease (IBD) as the standard vaccination schedule. Blood sample was taken from the brachial vein of birds on 42th day. A significant decrease in antibody titer against sheep RBC was revealed in the nano manganese 100 and 150 groups compared to the control group. In addition, the antibody titers against IB and ND were significantly lower in the all nano-manganese groups compared to the control group. No significant difference was observed for the antibody titer against AI and oxidative stress indices among the experimental groups. The findings in the present study suggested that nano-manganese at 50.00, 100 and 150 mg kg(-1) levels might suppress humoral immune response in broilers which should be taken into consideration in supplementation.

AB  - Whether the nonthermal effects of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) exist and how nonthermal RFR acts on the nervous system are unknown. An animal model of spatial memory impairment is established by exposing mice to 2856-MHz RFR in the range of thermal noise (<= 1 degrees C). Glutamate release in the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) CA1 region is not significantly changed after radiofrequency exposure, whereas dopamine release is reduced. Importantly, RFR enhances glutamatergic CA1 pyramidal neuron calcium activity by nonthermal mechanisms, which recover to the basal level with RFR termination. Furthermore, suppressed dHPC dopamine release induced by radiofrequency exposure is due to decreased density of dopaminergic projections from the locus coeruleus to dHPC, and artificial activation of dopamine axon terminals or D1 receptors in dHPC CA1 improve memory damage in mice exposed to RFR. These findings indicate that nonthermal radiofrequency stimulation modulates ongoing neuronal activity and affects nervous system function at the neural circuit level.

AB  - Arthropod herbivory poses a serious threat to crop yield, prompting plants to employ intricate defense mechanisms against pest feeding. The generalist pest 2-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) inflicts rapid damage and remains challenging due to its broad target range. In this study, we explored the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) response to T. urticae infestation, revealing the induction of abscisic acid (ABA), a hormone typically associated with abiotic stress adaptation, and stomatal closure during water stress. Leveraging a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based ABA biosensor (nlsABACUS2-400n), we observed elevated ABA levels in various leaf cell types postmite feeding. While ABA's role in pest resistance or susceptibility has been debated, an ABA-deficient mutant exhibited increased mite infestation alongside intact canonical biotic stress signaling, indicating an independent function of ABA in mite defense. We established that ABA-triggered stomatal closure effectively hinders mite feeding and minimizes leaf cell damage through genetic and pharmacological interventions targeting ABA levels, ABA signaling, stomatal aperture, and density. This study underscores the critical interplay between biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, highlighting how the vulnerability to mite infestation arising from open stomata, crucial for transpiration and photosynthesis, reinforces the intricate relationship between these stress types.
   Arabidopsis thaliana employs abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure as an effective defense mechanism against Tetranychus urticae infestation.

AB  - A feature of the camel is its tolerance to osmotic stress. However, few studies of osmotic stress in vivo or comparative analyses between different tissues of the camel have been performed. Here, we report the roles of Kruppel-associated box domain containing zinc-finger repressor proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) in transcriptional networks under osmotic stress in camels by analyzing transcriptomes of four different tissues under various osmotic conditions. We found that 273 of 278 KRAB-ZFPs were expressed in our data set, being involved in all of the 65 identified networks and exhibiting their extensive functional diversity. We also found that 110 KRAB-ZFPs were hub genes involved in more than half of the networks. We demonstrated that the osmotic stress response is involved in network shifts and that KRAB-ZFPs mediate this process. Finally, we presented the diverse mechanisms of osmotic stress responses in different tissues. These results revealed the genetic architecture of systematic physiological response in vivo to osmotic stress in camels. Our work will lead to new directions for studying the mechanism of osmotic stress response in anti-arid mammals.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) induces oxidative damage in porcine endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), which is a critical factor affecting the growth and reproduction of female pigs. We hypothesize that rutin, a flavonoid antioxidant, can alleviate ZEA-induced cellular damage through the p53 signaling pathway. In this experiment, porcine ESCs were used as a research model. After transfection with siRNA to silence the p53 gene, rutin and ZEA were added to the cocultured porcine ESCs. Rutin notably reduced the ZEA-induced apoptosis rate, ROS, MDA, and 4-HNE levels via the p53 pathway; lowered the expression of LC3, Beclin-1, p62, Bax, and CHOP; and significantly improved cell viability, GSH-Px, T-SOD enzyme activity, and Bcl-2 expression. It also inhibited both apoptosis and autophagy. These findings suggested a novel antioxidant mechanism by which rutin mitigated the toxic effects of ZEA, highlighting the role of the p53 gene knockdown in this process.

AB  - Myelomeningocele (MMC) is a congenital defect of the spine characterised by meningeal and spinal cord protrusion through the open vertebral arches. This defect causes progressive prenatal damage of the spinal cord, leading to lifelong handicap. Although mid-trimester surgical repair may reduce part of the handicap, an earlier and less invasive approach would further improve the prognosis, possibly minimising maternal and foetal risks. Several studies have proposed an alternative approach to surgical repair by covering the defect with a patch and protecting the exposed neural tissue. Our study aims to elaborate on a waterproof and biodegradable bioactive patch for MMC prenatal foetal repair. We developed a double-layer patch that can provide a waterproof coverage for the spinal cord, with a bioactive side, conducive to cell proliferation, and an antiadhesive side to avoid its attachment to the medulla.

AB  - The way in which brain morphology and proteome are remodeled during embryonal development, and how they are linked to the cellular metabolism, could be a key for elucidating the pathological mechanisms of certain neurodevelopmental disorders. Cerebral organoids derived from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients were generated to capture critical time-points in the neuronal development, and metabolism and protein expression were investigated. The early stages of development, when neurogenesis commences (day in vitro 39), appeared to be a critical timepoint in pathogenesis. In the first month of development, increased size in ASD-derived organoids were detected in comparison to the controls. The size of the organoids correlates with the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67 positive cells). A significant difference in energy metabolism and proteome phenotype was also observed in ASD organoids at this time point, specifically, prevalence of glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, decreased ATP production and mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, differently expressed cell adhesion proteins, cell cycle (spindle formation), cytoskeleton, and several transcription factors. Finally, ASD patients and controls derived organoids were clustered based on a differential expression of ten proteins-heat shock protein 27 (hsp27) phospho Ser 15, Pyk (FAK2), Elk-1, Rac1/cdc42, S6 ribosomal protein phospho Ser 240/Ser 244, Ha-ras, mTOR (FRAP) phospho Ser 2448, PKC alpha, FoxO3a, Src family phospho Tyr 416-at day 39 which could be defined as potential biomarkers and further investigated for potential drug development.

AB  - Zirconium hydride is a promising candidate material for nuclear microreactor applications as a solid-state moderator component, owing to its favorable neutronics properties and good thermal stability over other metal hydrides. In the present work, the crystal structure, thermal expansion, and elastic properties of the hydrogen-rich epsilon phase hydride were measured at elevated temperatures in the range 300-900 K. Samples were prepared by direct hydriding Zircaloy-4 metal - a nuclear-grade zirconium alloy. Room-temperature lattice parameters agree well with those reported from literature for unalloyed zirconium hydride and fall within an observed quadratic H-content dependence. The coefficients of thermal expansion, determined from lattice expansion and dilatometry, agree well within our work but were about 30 % lower than those reported by others for unalloyed hydrides. Density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulations were used to compare with thermal expansion and elasticity measurements. Results showed lattice parameter temperature dependence and slope of thermal expansion align with those from measurements. Based on diffraction scans at select temperatures, epsilon phase remained stable in air up to at least 770 K. Likewise, dilatometry showed smooth thermal expansion up to the thermal decomposition temperature around 950 K. The precise decomposition temperature was not determined via diffraction due to sparse scanning. The complete elastic property measurements were gathered for epsilon-phase Ziracloy-4 hydride for the first time. Young's modulus was lower compared to the metal and delta hydride phases. High-temperature elasticity measurements were limited to <350 K due to acoustic dissipation effects.

AB  - The transition from farrowing crates to farrowing pens aims to improve animal welfare by enabling the expression of maternal behavioural profiles. This study examines the spontaneous farrowing process in both farrowing crates and pens for modern German Landrace (GL) and traditional German Saddleback (GS) pigs - two breeds with different breeding histories and adaptations to housing systems. The goal is to investigate whether, and how, both breeds benefit equally from farrowing pens. From the birth of the first piglet until 1 h after the last delivery (intrapartum; ip), half-hourly blood samples were collected from catheterized sows in addition to blood samples retrieved from antepartum (ap) and postpartum (pp) periods. After spontaneous, non- induced farrowing, the traditional GS breed exhibited a significantly shorter gestation length, smaller litter weight, and a lower incidence of labour dystocia compared to modern GL sows. Breed effects were observed for profiles of heart rate (ip: GL > GS), cortisol (ap: GL < GS; ip: GL < GS), adrenaline (ap: GL < GS), noradrenaline (ip: GL < GS), non-esterified fatty acids (ap: GL < GS; ip: GL < GS), glucose (ap: GL > GS), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (ap: GL < GS) at distinct peripartum periods. Effects due to housing appeared for heart rate (ap: crate > pen) as well as respiratory rate (crate < pen) and adrenaline (crate > pen) at distinct time points. Taken together, breed- specific endocrine control and energy-related metabolic properties might suggest a need for tailored housing conditions during parturition for modern and traditional sows.

AB  - The passage of food through the digestive tract in an herbivorous rodent with a single-chamber semiglandular stomach, the fat sand rat Psammomys obesus, was studied by multiple marking of the food with inert plastic markers. The total mean retention time of markers in the digestive tract (DT), as well as in the stomach and caecum separately, was determined. The peculiarities of the digesta kinetics depending on the morphology of the digestive tract, diet, and the time of marker intake were clarified. The total time for removal of markers from the DT in the fat sand rat reaches 36 h. The mean retention time of markers in the DT was determined as a whole (17-18 h), as well as separately in the forestomach (7-9 h) and caecum (7-12 h). The uneven passage of feed has been revealed, which is considered as an important mechanism for maximizing the extraction of nutrients from plants, including microbial fermentation of structural carbohydrates of the food.

AB  - This paper investigates the physical and mechanical properties of bighorns of Deccani breed sheep native from Karnataka, India. The exhaustive work comprises two cases. First, rehydrated (wet) and ambient (dry) conditions, and second, the horn coupons were selected for longitudinal and lateral (transverse) directions. More than seventy-two samples were subjected to a test for physical and mechanical property extraction. Further, twenty-four samples were subjected to physical property testing, which included density and moisture absorption tests. At the same time, mechanical testing included analysis of the stress state dependence with the horn keratin tested under tension, compression, and flexural loading. The mechanical properties include the elastic modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, failure strain, compressive strength, flexural strength, flexural modulus, and hardness. The results showed anisotropy and depended highly on the presence of water content more than coupon orientation. Wet conditioned specimens had a significant loss in mechanical properties compared with dry specimens. The observed outcomes were shown at par with results for yield strength of 53.5 +/- 6.5 MPa (which is better than its peers) and a maximum compressive stress of 557.7 +/- 5 MPa (highest among peers). Young's modulus 6.5 +/- 0.5 GPa and a density equivalent to a biopolymer of 1.2 g/cc are expected to be the lightest among its peers; flexural strength 168.75 MPa, with lowest failure strain percentage of 6.5 +/- 0.5 and Rockwell hardness value of 60 HRB, seem best in the class of this category. Simulation study identified a suitable application area based on impact and fatigue analysis. Overall, the exhaustive experimental work provided many opportunities to use this new material in various diversified applications in the future.

AB  - To explore the relationship between intestinal mucin 2 (MUC2) and weaning-induced diarrhoea in piglets, we analysed Min and Landrace piglets. The piglets were divided into a healthy weaned group, a weaned diarrhoea group, and a healthy unweaned control group. Intestinal tissues were collected, and goblet cell numbers, sizes, and degrees of intestinal injury were observed and recorded. Intestinal tissue MUC2 mRNA and protein expression were analysed via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Min pigs presented significantly lower diarrhoea rates and intestinal injury scores than Landrace pigs (p < 0.01). The intestinal injury scores in the weaned diarrhoea group were significantly greater than those in the unweaned groups (p < 0.05), with Min pigs consistently exhibiting lower injury scores than Landrace pigs. Specifically, unweaned Min pigs presented significantly greater duodenal MUC2 mRNA (p < 0.05), and weaned healthy Min pigs presented notably greater expression in both the duodenum and jejunum (p < 0.01). These findings reveal enhanced intestinal protection against weaning stress and diarrhoea in Min pigs, with elevated MUC2 levels likely contributing to lower injury scores and milder symptoms, thus highlighting the influence of genetic differences.

AB  - Understanding cesium (Cs) transport in TRistructural ISOtropic (TRISO) particle fuel is crucial for predicting fission product release in high-temperature reactors. However, current challenges include significant scatter in diffusivity data and unexplained temperature-dependent diffusion regimes in the silicon carbide layer. This study addresses these challenges by developing a multiscale, mechanistic Cs transport model integrating atomistic simulations and phase field modeling. Our model quantifies temperature and grain size effects on Cs diffusivity, attributing experimentally observed regimes to a transition from bulk-dominated diffusivity at high temperatures to grain boundary-dominated diffusivity at lower temperatures. The model, validated against diffusion measurements and advanced gas reactor (AGR)-1 and AGR-2 post-irradiation fission product release data, enhances the predictive capability of the BISON fuel performance code. This study advances our understanding of Cs release from TRISO particles and its dependence on temperature and silicon carbide grain size, with implications for the safety and efficiency of high-temperature nuclear reactors.

AB  - The 2-oxoglutarate and Fe (II)-dependent dioxygenase (2ODD-C) family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases potentially participates in the biosynthesis of various metabolites under various abiotic stresses. However, there is scarce information on the expression profiles and roles of 2ODD-C genes in Camellia sinensis. We identified 153 Cs2ODD-C genes from C. sinensis, and they were distributed unevenly on 15 chromosomes. According to the phylogenetic tree topology, these genes were divided into 21 groups distinguished by conserved motifs and an intron/exon structure. Gene-duplication analyses revealed that 75 Cs2ODD-C genes were expanded and retained after WGD/segmental and tandem duplications. The expression profiles of Cs2ODD-C genes were explored under methyl jasmonate (MeJA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and salt (NaCl) stress treatments. The expression analysis showed that 14, 13, and 49 Cs2ODD-C genes displayed the same expression pattern under MeJA and PEG treatments, MeJA and NaCl treatments, and PEG and NaCl treatments, respectively. A further analysis showed that two genes, Cs2ODD-C36 and Cs2ODD-C21, were significantly upregulated and downregulated after MeJA, PEG, and NaCl treatments, indicating that these two genes played positive and negative roles in enhancing the multi-stress tolerance. These results provide candidate genes for the use of genetic engineering technology to modify plants by enhancing multi-stress tolerance to promote phytoremediation efficiency.

AB  - Tracing compositional changes of fatty acids (FAs) is frequently used as a means of moni-toring metabolic alterations in perturbed biological states. Given that more than half of FAs in the mammalian lipidome are unsaturated, quantitation of FAs at a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) loca-tion level is necessary. The use of 2-acetylpiridine (2-acpy) as the charge-tagging PB reagent led to a limit of identification in the subnanomolar range for mono-and polyunsaturated as well as conjugated FAs. Conjugated free FAs of low abundance such as FA 18:2 (n-7, n-9) and FA 18:2 (n-6, n-8) were quanti-fied at concentrations of 0.61 +/- 0.05 and 0.05 +/- 0.01 mg per 100 g in yak milk powder, respectively. This workflow also enabled deep profiling of eight satu-rated and 37 unsaturated total FAs across a span of four orders of magnitude in concentration, including ten groups of C=C location isomers in pooled human plasma. A pilot survey on total FAs in plasma from patients with type 2 diabetes revealed that the rela-tive compositions of FA 16:1 (n-10) and FA 18:1 (n-10) were significantly elevated compared with that of normal controls. In this work, we have developed a workflow for global quantitation of FAs, including C=C location isomers, via charge-tagging Patern`o-Buchi (PB) derivatization and liquid chromatog-raphy-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

AB  - Key messageIntegration of resistance indicators, metabolomes, and transcriptomes to elucidate that there is a positive correlation between disease susceptibility and cold tolerance in tea plants. The flavonoid pathway was found to be the major metabolic and transcriptional enrichment pathway. A key domain NB-ARC was identified through joint analysis, along with analysis of key domains within the NB-ARC protein.AbstractTea is a healthy beverage and the tea plant is a woody plant rich in secondary metabolites. In the face of abnormal climate change year by year, it is important to investigate the mechanisms by which tea plants resist both biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we found different tea plant cultivars were evaluated for cold and disease resistance have highly correlated. Subsequently, two cold and fungal resistant cultivars were screened from a Shuixian population that had been cold domesticated for 50 years, and transcriptome and metabolome assays were performed on the two materials under cold and anthracnose stresses, using Baiye Dancong as a control. The analyses found that differential metabolites were most enriched in the flavonoid pathway and differentially expressed genes were most enriched in the pathway related to disease course after pathogen stress and cold stress. Combined metabolome and transcriptome analyses identified 30 genes that were positively correlated with flavonoid content after pathogen stress and cold stress, of which the number of genes with NB-ARC structural domains was 11, which accounted for the largest proportion. These 11 genes with NB-ARC structural domains were analyzed by family analysis and found to be highly involved in different tissues transcriptomes of tea plants, indicating the importance of the NB-ARC structural domains in biotic and abiotic stresses, and providing a theoretical basis of analysis for the subsequent related studies. In this study, through the identification of resistance in different varieties of tea plant and the multi-omics approach, we found the genes related to the key structural domain NB-ARC, which lays the foundation for the study of biologically and abiologically important mechanisms in response to the disease in tea plant.

AB  - Pheromones have become an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional insecticides for pest control. Most current pheromone-based pest control products target lepidopteran pests of high-value crops, as today's manufacturing processes cannot yet produce pheromones at low enough costs to enable their use for lower-value crops, especially commodity crops. Camelina sativa seeds genetically modified to express (Z)-11-hexadecenoic acid, a sex pheromone precursor of several moth species, provided the oil from which the precursor was isolated, purified and transformed into the final pheromone. Trap lures containing this pheromone were then assessed for their capacity to manage moth pests in the field. Plant-derived pheromone lures proved equally effective as synthetic pheromone lures in monitoring the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, in cabbage and disrupting mating of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, in common bean fields. Our study demonstrates the biological efficacy and economic feasibility of pheromone production in plant factories by metabolic engineering of an oilseed crop.

AB  - Important precursors of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, dietary tryptophan (TRP), tyrosine, and phenylalanine (all referred to as TTP), play crucial roles in a wide range of behavioral and emotional functions. In the current study, we investigated whether diets devoid of TTP or diets deficient in TRP alone can affect body weight, behavioral characteristics, and gut microbiota, by comparing mice fed on these amino acids-depleted diets to mice fed on diets containing regular levels of amino acids. Both dietary TTP-and TRP-deprived animals showed a reduction in food intake and body weight. In behavioral analyses, the mice fed TTP-deprived diets were more active than mice fed diets containing regular levels of amino acids. The TRP-deprived group exhibited a reduction in serum TRP levels, concomitant with a decrease in serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in some regions of the brain. The TTP-deprived group showed a reduction in TTP levels in the serum, concomitant with decreases in both phenylalanine and tyrosine levels in the hippocampus, as well as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine concentrations in some regions of the brain. Regarding the effects of TRP or TTP deprivation on gut microbial ecology, the relative abundance of genus Roseburia was significantly reduced in the TTP-deprived group than in the dietary restriction control group. Interestingly, TTP was found even in the feces of mice fed TTP-and TRP-deficient diets, suggesting that TTP is produced by microbial or enzymatic digestion of the host-derived proteins. However, microbe generated TTP did not compensate for the systemic TTP deficiency induced by the lack of dietary TTP intake. Collectively, these results indicate that chronic dietary TTP deprivation induces decreased monoamines and their metabolites in a brain region-specific manner. The altered activities of the monoaminergic systems may contribute to increased locomotor activity.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) causes significant disruption to plant growth and poses a threat to human health, necessitating urgent and effective measures to mitigate its absorption and translocation in rice. This study employed a co-treatment of carbon dots (PBCDs) with Cd. The potential mechanisms underlying the alleviation of Cd toxicity in rice by PBCDs were investigated by observing changes in photosynthesis, the antioxidant system, and the content of other divalent metals in rice. The results showed that under Cd stress, PBCDs mitigated the interference of Cd in photosynthesis. Notably, treatments with 100 and 250 mg L-1 PBCDs significantly increased the rice fresh weight by 32.45% and 31.54%, and reduced Cd concentrations in rice leaves by 53.82% and 45.81%, respectively. Moreover, PBCDs effectively reduced the shoot-to-leaf translocation factor (TF) of Cd by up to 45.76%, likely due to enhanced Zn concentrations in shoots. Furthermore, PBCDs enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT) in rice, resulting in decreased levels of MDA induced by Cd stress. In conclusion, PBCDs enhanced rice antioxidant enzyme activity, photosynthetic efficiency, and biomass while mitigating cellular damage and reducing Cd concentrations in various tissues. These findings provide theoretical guidance and data support for the study of novel nanomaterials to promote crop growth under Cd stress conditions and alleviate Cd accumulation in plants.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is an important perennial cash crop and a typical subtropical plant. It is widely concerned because of its unique flavor and health benefits. In recent years, low temperatures have severely restricted the growth of tea plants and quality of tea products, especially in spring. As a common precursor for all porphyrin compounds, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is involved in photosynthesis and respiration and plays an active role in improving salt, drought and low-temperature tolerance in plants. However, it is not yet clear what affect exogenous ALA has on tea plants' tolerance under low temperature. In the present study, we collected and deciphered the transcriptome profiles from Shaancha No. 1 leaf tissues under low temperature (-4 degrees C) treatment (T-4), exogenous ALA application (T-A), pretreated ALA before low temperature (T-A-4) and untreated control (T-CK). Results showed that 4990 (2375 up- and 2615 down-regulated), 223 (103 up- and 120 down-regulated) and 92 (13 up- and 79 down-regulated) differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified at T-CK vs. T-4, T-CK vs. T-A and T-4 vs. T-A-4, respectively. Both T-4 and T-A treatments triggered a myriad of stress resistance genes up-regulated related to multiple signaling pathways by means of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. This included MAPK, a toll-like receptor that signals pathways involved in cold resistance. However, gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the DEGs in T-4 treatment were mainly enriched in the phenylpropanoid metabolic and redox processes that were relevant to membrane structure damage response. In contrast, the DEGs in T-A treatment were mainly enriched in cell recognition and amylase activity. Furthermore, in pairwise comparison of T-A-4 vs. T-4, the DEGs were enriched in ascorbate and aldarate, retionol, taurine and hypotaurine, glutathione metabolic pathways and two biosynthesis process including zeatin, diterpenoid biosynthesis, which might contribute to mitigating the damage caused by low temperature. Overall, these results indicated that exogenous ALA application may improve the biochemical attributes and enhance the tolerance to low temperature, which provides a valuable strategy to improve tea quality and cold stress.

AB  - Rotary kiln-electric furnace (RKEF) technology accounts for 95 pct of the lateritic nickel ore processing. Coal is commonly used as fuel and reducing agent in the rotary kiln to produce solid reduction product which is then melted in the electric furnace. The use of coal in the process leads to the emission of approximately 70 tons of CO2 for every 1 ton of nickel in ferronickel or nickel pig iron product. One of the possible solutions for minimizing CO2 emission in the RKEF process is through the substitution of carbon-based fuel and reducing agent with hydrogen gas. This research focuses on experimental investigation on the reduction of saprolite nickel ore under hydrogen-argon atmosphere. The research was initiated by performing a thermodynamic simulation using FactSage 8.0 to preliminary evaluate the effects of different parameters on the reduction process. Reduction experiments of saprolite nickel ore were then carried out in a horizontal tube furnace with varying temperature (500 degrees C, 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C, 800 degrees C, and 900 degrees C), hydrogen gas composition (25 and 75 pct H2 in H2-Ar gas mixture), and reaction time (0.25 to 3 hours) to simulate the process in the rotary kiln. The solid reduction products were analyzed using ICP-MS, SEM-EDS, and XRD. The overall reduction extents in all conditions were also monitored by weight measurements of the samples before and after the reduction processes. Based on the weight changes, the reduction process was found to be significantly rapid so that it reached completion in 15 minutes. Each solid reduction product was then melted in a vertical tube furnace at 1550 degrees C for 2 hours under inert, argon atmosphere to simulate the process in the electric furnace. The metal product after melting had an average composition of 80.6 pct Fe and 8.3 pct Ni which is similar to commercially produced nickel pig iron.

AB  - The large-scale excavation at the prehistoric site of Tell el-Iswid made it possible to undertake a systematic archaeobotanical study of different structures covering the Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (Lower Egyptian Cultures, i.e. Buto II (3500-3300 bc) to Naqada III Culture (3300-2900 bc)). Here we present the results of the analysis of carpological remains preserved mostly in a charred state and coming from 62 samples processed by manual flotation, with total volume of 615 L and containing a total of 9,672 identifiable and quantifiable items. A further ca. 650 wood fragments (or woody vegetative remains) were subject to anthracological analysis. Besides the aim of overall characterisation and exploration of the plant economy of the site, the macrobotanical assemblages were also considered in relation to the structures from which they were uncovered. The study revealed that the agricultural economy of both studied periods relied on emmer, barley, lentils, and pea, but from Early Dynastic times onwards barley and pulses gained more importance, along with flax (Linum usitatissimum) and condiments (like Anethum graveolens and cf. Origanum sp.), which occur first during this period at the site. Together with the cultivated fields, the surrounding wetlands were also an important part of the plant resources utilized at the site. The stems of Phragmites are the most common among the anthracological remains, together with a small proportion of Tamarix and Acacia charcoal fragments. The overall composition of the plant assemblages (charred and mineralised chaff, small weed or wild growing seeds capable of passing herbivore digestion, dung fragments, awns) suggest that the major source of the retrieved plant remains was dung fuel.

AB  - Memory storage and retrieval are shaped by past experiences. Prior learning and memory episodes have numerous impacts on brain structure from micro to macroscale. Previous experience with specific forms of learning increases the efficiency of future learning. It is less clear whether such practice effects on one type of memory might also have transferable effects to other forms of memory. Different forms of learning and memory rely on different brain-wide networks but there are many points of overlap in these networks. Enhanced structural or functional connectivity caused by one type of learning may be transferable to another type of learning due to overlap in underlying memory networks. Here, we investigated the impact of prior chronic spatial training on the task-specific functional connectivity related to subsequent contextual fear memory recall in mice. Our results show that mice exposed to prior spatial training exhibited decreased brain-wide activation compared to control mice during the retrieval of a context fear memory. With respect to functional connectivity, we observed changes in several network measures, notably an increase in global efficiency. Interestingly, we also observed an increase in network resilience based on simulated targeted node deletion. Overall, this study suggests that chronic learning has transferable effects on the functional connectivity networks of other types of learning and memory. The generalized enhancements in network efficiency and resilience suggest that learning itself may protect brain networks against deterioration.

AB  - Selenium (Se) agronomic biofortification of plants is effective for alleviating Se deficiencies in human and livestock populations. Less is known about how higher selenate amendment rates, or how foliar compared with granular selenate amendments affect forage Se concentrations. Therefore, we compared the effects of a higher sodium selenate foliar amendment rate (900 vs. 90 g Se ha(-1)), and two selenate amendment methods (liquid foliar sodium selenate vs. granular slow-release Selcote Ultra((R)) at 0, 45, and 90 g Se ha(-1)) on Se concentrations and Se species in forages across Oregon. The 10 x amendment rate (900 g Se ha(-1)) resulted in 6.4 x higher forage Se concentrations in the first cut (49.19 vs. 7.61 mg Se kg(-1) plant DM, respectively) compared with the 90 g ha(-1) amendment rate, indicating that forages can tolerate higher selenate amendment rates. Most Se was incorporated as SeMet (75%) in the harvested portion of the forage (37 mg Se kg(-1) forage DM of the first cut) and only a limited amount was stored in the selenate reserve pool in the leaves (similar to 5 mg Se kg(-1) forage DM). Higher application rates of selenate amendment increased forage Se concentrations in first and second cuts, but carry over in subsequent years was negligible. Application of foliar selenate vs. granular Selcote Ultra((R)) amendments, between 0 and 90 g Se ha(-1), both resulted in a linear, dose-dependent increase in forage Se concentration. Amendments differed in their Se incorporation pattern (Se%), in that, first cut forage Se concentrations were higher with foliar selenate amendment and second, third, and residual (following spring) cut forage Se concentrations were higher with granular Selcote Ultra((R)) amendment. Given the linear relationship between forage Se concentrations and whole-blood Se concentrations in livestock consuming Se-biofortified forage, we conclude that targeted grazing or other forage feeding strategies will allow producers to adapt to either selenate-amendment form.

AB  - In the CA1 hippocampus, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing interneurons (VIP-INs) play a prominent role in disinhibitory circuit motifs. However, the specific behavioral conditions that lead to circuit disinhibition remain uncertain. To investigate the behavioral relevance of VIP -IN activity, we employed wireless technologies allowing us to monitor and manipulate their function in freely behaving mice. Our findings reveal that, during spatial exploration in new environments, VIP-INs in the CA1 hippocampal region become highly active, facilitating the rapid encoding of novel spatial information. Remarkably, both VIP-INs and pyramidal neurons (PNs) exhibit increased activity when encountering novel changes in the environment, including context- and object -related alterations. Concurrently, somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory populations show an inverse relationship with VIP -IN and PN activity, revealing circuit disinhibition that occurs on a timescale of seconds. Thus, VIP -IN -mediated disinhibition may constitute a crucial element in the rapid encoding of novelty and the acquisition of recognition memory.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the efficacy of Doppler and B-mode sonography in evaluating the impact of maternal temperament on hemodynamic alterations in both the fetus and uterus during ovine gestation in addition to alteration of the angiogenic protein expression and fetal biometry. Twenty Ossimi ewes were divided into two groups, more reactive (MR: 12 sheep) and less reactive (LR: 8 sheep). Several endpoints were assessed every 2 weeks (wk) from breeding to wk 20 of pregnancy. Blood samples were taken to evaluate the expression of angiogenic proteins at parturition. The resistance (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indexes of the uterine (UtA) and fetal umbilical arteries (UMA) were measured. Biometry includes: diameter of amniotic vesicles (AVD), umbilicus (UMD), fetal thoracic diameter (FTD) and metacarpal length (MCL). The UtA-PI was higher in MR compared to LR ewes between 6-12 wks of gestation (P>0.01), while a tendency was recognized at wk 14 (P=0.054). The same was true for UtA-RI during the first 8 wk of pregnancy (P < 0.03) when MR and LR animals were compared. Similarly, UMA-RI was higher in fetuses of MR than LR ewes at wk 14 (P<0.0003) and 20 (P<0.02) of pregnancy. The differences in UMA-PI reached mRNAs for VEGF, NOS3 and HIF 1 alpha genes at time of parturition.

AB  - Molecular and genetic techniques now allow selective tagging and manipulation of the population of neurons, often referred to as "engram cells," that were active during a specific experience. One common approach to labeling these cells is to use the fos-tTA transgenic mouse (TetTag). In addition to tagging cells active during learning, it is common to examine the reactivation of these cells using immediate early gene (IEG) expression as an index of neural activity. There are currently multiple TetTag lines available. The original line, cryopreserved at MMRRC, contains only the fos-tTA transgene, while Jackson Labs provides a version of the mouse that expresses both the fos-tTA and fos-shEGFP genes. In the current experiments, we examined IEG expression in these two mouse lines. Unexpectedly, we found that Jackson fos-tTA/fos-shEGFP mice express increased levels of c-Fos in the hippocampus compared to wild type animals when examined with immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of other IEGs, such as Arc and Egr-1, was not elevated in these mice, suggesting that the overexpression of c-Fos is not the result of increased excitability or broad changes in gene expression. qPCR revealed that Jackson fos-tTA/fos-shEGFP mice express mRNA corresponding to a c-Fos-Exon1-GFP fusion molecule, which may bind to C-Fos antibodies during IHC and inflate apparent c-Fos expression. Jackson fos-tTA/fos-shEGFP mice did not differ from their wild-type counterparts in fear expression or memory, indicating no behavioral effect of the presence of a c-Fos-GFP fusion protein. These results identify a major limitation inherent in the use of Jackson fos-tTA/fos-shEGFP mice.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) produces acute changes in strain and stiffness within the infarct that can affect remote areas of the left ventricle (LV) and drive pathological remodeling. We hypothesized that intramyocardial delivery of a hydrogel within the MI region would lower wall stress and reduce adverse remodeling in Yorkshire pigs (n = 5). Tc-99m-Tetrofosmin SPECT imaging defined the location and geometry of induced MI and border regions in pigs, and in vivo and ex vivo contrast cine computed tomography (cineCT) quantified deformations of the LV myocardium. Serial in vivo cineCT imaging provided data in hearts from control pigs (n = 3) and data from pigs (n = 5) under baseline conditions before MI induction, post-MI day 3, post-MI day 7, and one hour after intramyocardial delivery of a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel with shear-thinning and self-healing properties to the central infarct area. Isolated, excised hearts underwent similar cineCT imaging using an ex vivo perfused heart preparation with cyclic LV pressurization. Deformations were evaluated using nonlinear image registration of cineCT volumes between end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES), and 3D Lagrangian strains were calculated from the displacement gradients. Post-MI day 3, radial, circumferential, maximum principal, and shear strains were reduced within the MI region (p < 0.04) but were unchanged in normal regions (p > 0.6), and LV end diastolic volume (LV EDV) increased (p = 0.004), while ejection fraction (EF) and stroke volume (SV) decreased (p < 0.02). Post-MI day 7, radial strains in MI border zones increased (p = 0.04) and dilation of LV EDV continued (p = 0.052). There was a significant negative linear correlation between regional radial and maximum principal/shear strains and percent infarcted tissue in all hearts (R-2 > 0.47, p < 0.004), indicating that cineCT strain measures could predict MI location and degree of injury. Post-hydrogel day 7 post-MI, LV EDV was significantly reduced (p = 0.009), EF increased (p = 0.048), and radial (p = 0.021), maximum principal (p = 0.051), and shear strain (p = 0.047) increased within regions bordering the infarct. A smaller strain improvement within the infarct and normal regions was also noted on average along with an improvement in SV in 4 out of 5 hearts. CineCT provides a reliable method to assess regional changes in strains post-MI and the therapeutic effects of intramyocardial hydrogel delivery.

AB  - Gossypol is a toxic sesquiterpene dimer produced by cotton plants which deters herbivory by insects and vertebrates. Two highly reactive aldehyde groups contribute to gossypol toxicity by cross-linking herbivore proteins. We identified another consequence of consuming gossypol in two insect pests of cotton: increased amounts of fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs). Eight different FACs in the feces of larval Helicoverpa armigera and Heliothis virescens increased when larvae consumed artificial diet containing gossypol, but not a gossypol derivative lacking free aldehyde groups (SB-gossypol). FACs are produced by joining plant-derived fatty acids with amino acids of insect origin in the larval midgut tissue by an unknown conjugase, and translocated into the gut lumen by an unknown transporter. FACs are hydrolyzed back into fatty acids and amino acids by an aminoacylase (L-ACY-1) in the gut lumen. The equilibrium level of FACs in the lumen is determined by a balance between conjugation and hydrolysis, which may differ among species. When heterologously expressed, L-ACY-1 of H. armigera but not H. virescens was inhibited by gossypol; consistent with the excretion of more FACs in the feces by H. armigera. FACs are known to benefit the plant host by inducing anti-herbivore defensive responses, and have been hypothesized to benefit the herbivore by acting as a surfactant and increasing nitrogen uptake efficiency. Thus in addition to its direct toxic effects, gossypol may negatively impact insect nitrogen uptake efficiency and amplify the signal used by the plant to elicit release of volatile compounds that attract parasitoids.

AB  - General transcription factor IIA subunit 1 (GTF2A1) is required for transcriptional activation from most promoters in eukaryotic transcription. Previous whole-genome association analyses articles have pre-dicted the effect of this gene on lambing in sheep. In the study, a total of nine insertion/deletion (indel) variants named L1 to L9 in the gene were selected to detect in 550 Australian White sheep (AuW) adult ewes. The polymorphisms were detected in four loci (L1, L2, L3 and L8locus) and the polymorphism information content (PIC) values were 0.270, 0.375, 0.372 and 0.314. Further, our study revealed that L1, L2 and L3 loci of GTF2A1 gene were significantly related to the first parity litter size and the poly-morphism of L8 was significantly correlated with litter size in the second parity. In details, for the first parity, individuals with the II genotype of the L1 locus had higher little size than that with the ID ge-notype, individuals with the ID and DD genotype of the L2 locus had higher little size than that with the II genotype, and individuals with the DD genotype of the L3 locus had higher little size than that with the II genotype. All four loci do not follow to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and have no linkage between them. In conclusion, the polymorphisms of GTF2A1 were confirmed and analysis results demonstrated that there are some relevance between difference genotypes and litter size, and these findings may provide new insights for accelerating sheep molecular breeding through molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS). & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It is well-regarded that young species are apt to mix their genomes through natural hybridization, whereas the hybridization of old species is rare due to acquired intrinsic reproductive isolation, and alternatively the challenges in detection. In the present study, we identified a hybrid zone of the basal taxon Hippophae tibetana mating with H. neurocarpa based on morphological and molecular evidence in Hippophae. The putative hybrid plants were first discriminated from the sympatric congeneric populations in a field survey, relying on their morphological intermediates of fruit and leaf between the putative parents. Then additivity of the biparental distinctive nucleotide signals of ITS and CHSi, as well as the intermediate features of SSR markers and cpDNA trnS-trnG detected in putative hybrid individuals subsequently, comprehensively support the natural hybridization event that historically occurred. We further estimated that H. tibetana and H. neurocarpa had diverged 26 similar to 27 MYA and hybridization occurred 0.1 similar to 0.2 MYA, far from the widely reviewed 5-10 MYA to waiting for hybrid sterility. This is the deepest hybridization event in seed plants studied so far. We speculate that both perennial woody trees and abiotic pollination mechanisms are mainly responsible for the slow evolution of reproductive incompatibility in the genus. Our findings shed light on the incomplete reproductive isolation barriers between members of Hippophae, promoting regular hybridization and hybrid speciation in the margins of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB  - Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are essential transcription factors found in many eukaryotes. In this study, the focus is on identifying and analyzing the KLF gene family members in chickens using bioinformatic tools, and comparing them with representative classes such as fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The analysis includes the structural characterization, evolutionary relationship assessment, and functional predictions. Additionally, in this study, the impact of miRNA-22 is explored, associated with lipid metabolism, on the expression of KLF genes in the liver, heart, and muscle tissues of Qingyuan partridge chickens. The results indicate that the avian KLF gene family is evolutionarily closer to that of mammals, and all chicken KLFs are non-transmembrane proteins. Moreover, the effect of miRNA-22 on KLF expression varies across different tissues. These findings provide a scientific basis for further research into the functions of KLFs in chickens. Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are a class of fundamental transcription factors that are widely present in various eukaryotes from nematodes to humans, named after their DNA binding domain which is highly homologous to the Kruppel factor in fruit flies. To investigate the composition, organization, and evolutionary trajectory of KLF gene family members in chickens, in our study, we leveraged conserved sequences of KLF genes from representative classes across fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals as foundational sequences. Bioinformatic tools were employed to perform homology alignment on the chicken genome database, ultimately identifying the KLF family members present in chickens. The gene structure, phylogenetic analysis, conserved base sequences, physicochemical properties, collinearity analysis, and protein structure were then analyzed using bioinformatic tools. Additionally, the impact of miRNA-22, related to poultry lipid metabolism, on the expression of the KLF gene family in the liver, heart, and muscle of Qingyuan partridge chickens was explored. The results showed that: (1) compared to fish, the KLF family in birds is more closely related to mammals and amphibians; (2) KLFs within the same subgroups are likely to be derived from a common ancestral gene duplication; (3) KLF3/8/12 in the same subgroup may have some similar or overlapping functions; (4) the motif 4 of KLF5 was most likely lost during evolution; (5) KLF9 may perform a similar function in chickens and pigs; (6) there are collinear relationships between certain KLF genes, indicating that there are related biomolecular functions between these KLF genes; (7) all members of the KLF family in chickens are non-transmembrane proteins; and (8) interference and overexpression of miRNA-22 in Qingyuan partridge chickens can affect the expression levels of KLF genes in liver, heart, and muscle.

AB  - Spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (White), is an invasive planthopper from China, which was first detected in Berks County, PA, in 2014 and has since spread to adjacent states including New Jersey in 2018. Lycorma delicatula is a polyphagous species that gregariously feeds on over 172 known hosts. We investigated development on key host plants Ailanthus altissima (Miller) (Sapindales: Simaroubaceae), Juglans nigra (L.) (Fagales: Juglandaceae), Acer rubrum (L.) (Sapindales: Sapindaceae), and Vitis vinifera (L.) (Vitales: Vitaceae) for each instar to elucidate potential host use throughout the season and target monitoring efforts. Our study indicated significant differences in survivorship and time spent in each nymphal life stage between host plants. We applied a host suitability index as a function of survivorship and development for each host plant and instar, which indicated A. altissima and J. nigra as suitable hosts for all 4 nymphal instars. Vitis vinifera was highly suitable for first and second instars but had low indices for the third and fourth instars, although suitability of V. vinifera may have varied based on variety and age of the vine. Lycorma delicatula nymphs had the lowest survivorship and longest development time on A. rubrum across all 4 life stages, despite this being a preferred oviposition host. Host had a significant effect on the morphometrics we measured within the first and second instars.

AB  - To determine the ecological and toxicological situation and assess the impact of various adverse factors in the aquatic environment on aquatic organisms, a morphological analysis of specific organs, which are primarily subjected to adverse effects, should be conducted. Histological and ultramicroscopic features of the liver structure in the fish of the carp family, specifically the bighead carp-Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Eschmeyer, 2003), are considered in this paper. An analysis of the microstructure of liver tissue was carried out using light microscopy and ultramicroscopic methods, which enabled us to identify the organ's key morphological and functional features. It was established that during the phylogenetic development of fish that grow in aquatic environments, specific structural rearrangements of the liver occur: adaptations to various living conditions were accompanied by changes in several parameters of liver morphology. In the bighead carp (herbivorous), the liver is trilobed. A characteristic feature of the bighead carp liver is the presence of a hepatopancreas (liver and pancreas associated as a single organ). A distinctive feature of the microscopic structure of the liver in the carp family is the poorly developed interlobular connective tissue. In contrast, the parenchyma of the liver lobule has a tubular structure consisting of polygonal, irregular, thick-walled tubules whose walls are formed by hepatocytes. These tubules are represented by sinusoidal capillaries, which ensure efficient exchange of substances between the blood and liver cells, aiding in the detoxification and processing of nutrients. Large glycogen reserves are also observed in these tubules, indicating a high level of metabolic activity and the ability of the carp liver to accumulate energy resources. The state of hepatocytes, the liver's vascular system, and structural changes resulting from various ecological and physiological factors were investigated. The main adaptive mechanisms of liver tissue, which ensure its functional activity in bighead carp, were identified. The results of this study expand and complement the knowledge of the macro-and microscopic structure of the liver concerning the species characteristics of the bighead carp, contributing to our understanding of its anatomy, histology, comparative anatomy, zoology, and more.

AB  - The exploration of edible insects, specifically Alphitobius diaperinus and Tenebrio molitor, as sustainable sources of protein for human consumption is an emerging field. However, research into their effects on intestinal health, especially in relation to inflammation and permeability, remains limited. Using ex vivo and in vivo models of intestinal health and disease, in this study we assess the impact of the above insects on intestinal function by focusing on inflammation, barrier dysfunction and morphological changes. Initially, human intestinal explants were exposed to in vitro-digested extracts of these insects, almond and beef. Immune secretome analysis showed that the inflammatory response to insect-treated samples was comparatively lower than it was for samples exposed to almond and beef. Animal studies using yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) and buffalo (Alphitobius diaperinus) flours were then used to evaluate their safety in healthy rats and LPS-induced intestinal dysfunction rats. Chronic administration of these insect-derived flours showed no adverse effects on behavior, metabolism, intestinal morphology or immune response (such as inflammation or allergy markers) in healthy Wistar rats. Notably, in rats subjected to proinflammatory LPS-induced intestinal dysfunction, T. molitor consumption did not exacerbate symptoms, nor did it increase allergic responses. These findings validate the safety of these edible insects under healthy conditions, demonstrate their innocuity in a model of intestinal dysfunction, and underscore their promise as sustainable and nutritionally valuable dietary protein sources.

AB  - Kainate receptors (KARs) are members of the glutamate receptor family that regulate synaptic function in the brain. Although they are known to be associated with psychiatric disorders, how they are involved in these disorders remains unclear. KARs are tetrameric channels assembled from a combination of GluK1-5 subunits. Among these, GluK2 and GluK5 subunits are the major heteromeric subunits in the brain. To determine the functional similarities and differences between GluK2 and GluK5 subunits, we generated GluK2 KO and GluK5 KO mice on a C57BL/6N background, a well-characterized inbred strain, and compared their behavioral phenotypes. We found that GluK2 KO and GluK5 KO mice exhibited the same phenotypes in many tests, such as reduced locomotor activity, impaired motor function, and enhanced depressive-like behavior. No change was observed in motor learning, anxiety-like behavior, or sociability. Additionally, we identified subunit-specific phenotypes, such as reduced motivation toward their environment in GluK2 KO mice and an enhancement in the contextual memory in GluK5 KO mice. These results revealed that GluK2 and GluK5 subunits not only function in a coordinated manner but also have a subunit-specific role in regulating behavior. To summarize, we demonstrated subunit-specific and common behavioral effects of GluK2 and GluK5 subunits for the first time. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the involvement of the GluK5 subunit in the expression of depressive-like behavior and contextual memory, which strongly indicates its role in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Stephanofilaria is a genus of nematodes that cause ulcerative dermal lesions in large mammals. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the molecular genetics of Stephanofilaria species infecting critically endangered rhinoceros. This study employed genetic barcoding genes to identify Stephanofilaria species and to determine its genetic diversity and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses on partial genes of the second internal transcribed spacer Ribosomal DNA (ITS-2) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (Cox-1), revealed a 77% and 93% bootstrap support at the Cox-1 and ITS-2 loci respectively to a clade containing previously identified Stephanofilaria species. Morphological examination also confirmed features diagnostic of Stephanofilaria dinniki previously known to infect rhinoceros. Gene diversity of Cox-1 was 0.931 +/- 0.030 and 0.579 +/- 0.104 for the ITS-2, whereas nucleotide diversity was 0.008 +/- 0.002 and 0.00197 +/- 0.0016 for the Cox-1 and ITS-2 genes respectively. Neutrality tests (Fu and Li's D* and Fu and Li's F*) were significantly negative (p<0.05) at all loci, whereas Tajima D and Fu's FS were each statistically significant (p<0.05) at the Cox-1 and ITS-2 loci respectively. The high gene diversity, low nucleotide diversity and negative neutrality tests are consistent with positive selection at the Cox-1 gene. Stephanofilaria infection among rhinoceros is currently restricted to highland sanctuaries compared to a widespread distribution in both lowlands and highlands in the 1960s suggesting an adaptation to vectors thriving in cooler highland temperatures. This is the first genetic identification of S. dinniki, in rhinoceros and will aid in diagnosis, treatment, studies, and rhinoceros conservation.

AB  - Many argue that the animal understanding of human referential communication is a by-product of domestication. However, the domestication hypothesis is not unanimously supported as some nondomesticated species such as sea lions, dolphins, or African elephants perform well in the understanding of human pointing gesture. There is a need to study species with different levels of domestication across different taxa to understand the emerging communicative sociocognitive skills in animals that provide them with the ability to comprehend human-given cues. We conducted a pilot study to assess the performance of eight sledging reindeer following a commonly used human-given cue (a pointing gesture associated with gaze at the target and local enhancement) in a two-way choice task. Domestic reindeer are considered semicaptive, because of their husbandry system in free-ranging conditions, with limited control of their reproduction. We observed that the willingness of the reindeer to participate in the test was age-related, with the younger individuals which lack experience with humans being reluctant to approach the experimenters. Within the more experienced working sledging reindeer, two individuals showed excellent skills and followed the human-given cues 9 out of 10 times. Reindeer show great potential in following a human indication to locate hidden food with minimal training when properly tamed. The effect of previous experience with humans requires further investigation. This is the first demonstration in cervids of an ability to make use of experimenter-given cues in an object-choice task.

AB  - With the improvement in sow prolificacy, formula feeding has been increasingly used in the pig industry. Diarrhea remains a serious health concern in formula-fed (FF) piglets. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an efficacious strategy to reshape gut microbiota and the metabolic profile for treating diarrhea. This study aims to investigate whether FMT from breast-fed piglets could alleviate diarrhea in FF piglets. The piglets were randomly assigned to the control (CON) group, FF group, and FMT group. Our results showed that FF piglets exhibited a higher diarrhea incidence, damaged colonic morphology, and disrupted barrier function. In contrast, FMT treatment normalized the morphology and barrier function. FMT suppressed the JNK/MAPK pathway and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, FF piglets had a lower abundance of the beneficial bacterial genus Bifidobacterium compared to CON piglets. Following FMT administration, Bifidobacterium was restored. Meanwhile, 5-HIAA, a metabolite of tryptophan, and AHR-responsive CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were upregulated. Importantly, integrated multiomics analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between Bifidobacterium and 5-HIAA. In vitro, 5-HIAA supplementation reversed the LPS-induced disruption of tight junctions and production of proinflammatory cytokines in IPEC-J2 cells. In conclusion, FMT reduced diarrhea incidence and improved growth performance. The alleviative effect of FMT on diarrhea was associated with Bifidobacterium and 5-HIAA.

AB  - Swine are widely used models in biomedical research due to their physiologic and anatomic similarities to humans. During transport from vendors to research facilities, pigs are subject to a number of stressors, including environmental, social, and stress as a result of deprivation from food and water. As stress can have a number of adverse psychologic and physiologic effects, an acclimation period, defined as the period of time that an animal has to adjust and stabilize in a new environment, is recommended. The literature indicates that swine should be conditioned to their new facility for 5 to 7 d prior to undergoing survival surgery; however, to date, there is no published scientific evidence to support this or any specific acclimation period for swine. To investigate whether a certain length acclimation period leads to decreased stress in swine, we measured 2 stress biomarkers, cortisol and chromogranin A (CgA), from the saliva of 12 naive Yorkshire swine (n = 6 males and 6 females) arriving at our facility for use in research protocols. Noninvasive saliva collection was performed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 after arrival from the vendor (representing different acclimation periods). We hypothesized that longer acclimation periods would result in reduced levels of both cortisol and CgA, indicating reduced stress. Our data revealed that there was no statistical difference in cortisol levels over time (P = 0.8200), nor between the sexes (P = 0.9886) or individual animals (P = 0.6280). CgA, similarly to cortisol, showed no overall effect of time (P = 0.2017) or sex (P = 0.6598). For this analyte, individual animal was significant (P < 0.0001), which suggests high interanimal variation. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease (P = 0.0077) in salivary CgA from day 1 compared with day 14, suggesting that swine may benefit from an acclimation period of at least 14 d.

AB  - The common seahorse, Hippocampus kuda, is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific region, occurring from East Africa to Hawaii, where it typically inhabits diverse ecosystems such as estuaries, lagoons, coastal zones, and seagrass beds. Despite its extensive geographic range, reports of its occurrence in the Red Sea remains limited, primarily restricted to the northern region of the Red Sea. Here, we report a new distributional record of H. kuda in Saudi Arabian waters within the south-central Red Sea. A single female specimen of H. kuda was collected through trawling conducted off the coast of Al Qunfudah at depths ranging from 15 to 20 meters. Morphological and molecular examination confirmed the identity of the specimen as H. kuda. The new record of H. kuda represents the second occurrence of this species in southcentral Red Sea and expands its known distribution range 367 kilometers further south than the first reported record off Jeddah in 1838.

AB  - This study was planned to evaluate the effect of vitamin D administration on cytotoxicity due to fluoride exposure in vitro. NaF (IC50) and vitamin D (proliferative) were applied to human osteoblast (hFOB 1.19) cells. The major genes of apoptotic, autophagic, and necrotic pathways were determined by RT-PCR. 2-Delta Delta Ct formulation was used for expression analysis. In the NaF group, caspase 3, Bax, Bad, Bak, Bclx, Atg3, Atg5, Atg6, pG2, LC3-I, LC3-II, RIP1, and RIP3 genes were increased (2.6-15 times). It was observed that the expressions of these genes approached the control when vitamin D was given together with NaF. The Bcl2 gene increased significantly (sixfold) with the effect of NaF, and was down-regulated to some extent with additional vitamin D administration, but still more than in the control. As a result, it was determined that apoptotic, necrotic, and autophagic pathways were activated as the molecular basis of the damage in the bone tissue, which was most affected by fluorine, and these genes were down-regulated and approached the control group with the addition of vitamin D. It was concluded that this is an important data to explain the molecular basis of the protective and therapeutic effect of vitamin D against fluorine toxicity.

AB  - Diabetes is known to cause cognitive impairments through various mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Humanin (HN) has been shown to have protective effects on cognitive impairments induced by factors such as A & beta;, muscarinic receptor antagonists, and aging in rodents. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of HN in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the context of diabetes are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential protective role of HN on oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in mice with diabetes. We divided the mice into four groups, including a control group (treated with saline), a humanin group (treated with 4 mg/kg of HN), a streptozotocin (STZ) group (diabetic control), and an STZ+Humanin group. The mice were administered HN daily for 15 days. Our results showed that in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of the diabetes group, oxidative stress parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis and, blood glucose levels were increased, while antioxidant and anti-inflammatory cytokines were diminished compared to the control group. However, HN treatment was able to modulate these markers, including blood glucose and the markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis may contribute to the development of diabetes-induced cognitive impairments. By regulating these changes with HN treatment, we may be able to positively contribute to the treatment of cognitive impairments induced by diabetes.

AB  - Simple Summary Giraffe numbers have been plummeting over the last 30 years by 30-40%. As such, efforts to manage in situ and ex situ populations are increasing. Assisted reproduction techniques such as sperm cryopreservation can help preserve the genetic diversity of giraffe subspecies or enhance genetic exchange between populations. However, to date, the post-thaw motility of recovered sperm has been variable. In this study, spermatozoa were collected from the epididymides of seven giraffes to investigate whether an alternative cryoprotectant could improve sperm motility following conventional cryopreservation. For this, we compared the motility and viability of sperm prior to and after freezing in three different extenders: a commercial equine extender (BotuCrio(R); Nidacon, Moedal, Schweden), a commercial bovine extender (Steridyl, Minitube, Tiefenbach, Germany), and an in-house "made" bovine egg yolk extender (TEY). Each was further supplemented with either glycerol or a mix of glycerol and methylformamide cryoprotectants. The results show that spermatozoa frozen with a mix of two cryoprotectants had significantly higher post-thaw motility compared to glycerol alone. Specifically, spermatozoa frozen in TEY and a mix of cryoprotectants achieved post-thaw sperm motility of 57 +/- 3%. These results might serve as a blueprint for an improved protocol for giraffe sperm cryopreservation. Giraffe numbers have plummeted over the last 30 years by 30-40%. Thus, their conservation status has been raised from least concern to vulnerable. Efforts to manage in situ and ex situ populations are increasing. Assisted reproduction techniques (ART) such as sperm cryopreservation could help preserve the genetic diversity of giraffe subspecies and, when used for artificial inseminations, enhance genetic exchange between isolated populations. However, to date, the post-thaw motility of recovered sperm has been low and inconsistent. In this study, epididymal sperm collected from the testes of giraffes (n = 7) was frozen in three different extenders, namely, BotuCrio, Steridyl, and test egg yolk (TEY), each supplemented with one of two different cryoprotectants (5% glycerol or a mix of 1% glycerol and 4% methylformamide) and frozen over liquid nitrogen vapor. Across all three extenders, sperm showed significantly better post-thaw results when frozen with a mix of glycerol and methylformamide compared with glycerol alone. Sperm frozen with TEY and a mix of glycerol and methylformamide achieved superior post-thaw total and progressive sperm motility of 57 +/- 3% and 45 +/- 3%, respectively. These results show the benefit of using alternative cryoprotectants for freezing giraffe spermatozoa and could aid in the application of ARTs for giraffe subspecies or the closely related endangered Okapi.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often causes severe neurological dysfunction, and facilitating neurite elongation is particularly important in its treatment. Astrocytes (AS) play an important role in the central nervous system (CNS), and their high plasticity and versatility provide a feasible entry point for relevant research. Our purpose was to explore whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) from astrocytes (AS-EVs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)preactivated astrocytes (LPAS-EVs) facilitate neurite elongation, to explore the underlying mechanism, and to verify whether these EVs promote locomotor recovery in rats. We used LPS to preactivate astrocytes and cocultured them with PC12 cells to observe neurite changes, then extracted and identified AS-EVs and LPAS-EVs and the role and mechanism of these EVs in facilitating neurite elongation was examined in vivo and vitro. We demonstrated that AS-EVs and LPAS-EVs facilitated the elongation of neurites and the recovery of rats with SCI. LPAS-EVs had a stronger effect than AS-EVs, by activating the Hippo pathway, promoting monopole spindle binding protein 1 (MOB1) expression, and reducing Yes-associated protein (YAP) levels. The data also suggest a feedback regulation between MOB1 and p-YAP/YAP. In sum, AS-EVs and LPAS-EVs can play an active role in facilitating neurite elongation by activating the Hippo pathway. These findings provide a new strategy for treating SCI and other CNS-related injuries.

AB  - Plant communication via airborne volatile organic compounds is a widespread phenomenon by which volatile organic compounds from damaged plants boost herbivore resistance in receiver plants. This phenomenon has been studied only in a handful of crop species. We tested for communication between potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants in response to herbivory by the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata. For this, we performed a greenhouse experiment with 15 potato varieties for which we caged pairs of plants (i.e., emitters and receivers) of the same variety. Half of the emitter plants were subjected to leaf damage by beetle larvae and the other half remained intact. We collected volatile organic compounds from emitter plants and estimated L. decemlineata damage on receivers. We found no evidence of quantitative (total production) or qualitative (compound composition) changes in volatile organic compound emissions due to beetle herbivory. In addition, the leaf damage treatment on emitters had no significant effect on receiver herbivore resistance, suggesting no communication between infested and non-infested potato plants in response to Colorado potato beetle damage. Overall, this study provides baseline information on airborne signalling (or the lack of thereof) in potato plants which can inform subsequent work that identifies airborne volatiles with potentially strong effects on priming or defence induction.

AB  - Cembranoids and labdanes are two important types of diterpenes in tobacco (Nicotiana genus) that are predominantly found in the leaf and flower glandular trichome secretions. This is the first systematic review of the biosynthesis, chemical structures, bioactivities, and utilisation values of cembranoid and labdane diterpenes in tobacco. A total of 131 natural cembranoid diterpenes have been reported in tobacco since 1962; these were summarised and classified according to their chemical structure characteristics as isopropyl cembranoids (1-88), seco-cembranoids (89-103), chain cembranoids (104-123), and polycyclic cembranoids (124-131). Forty natural labdane diterpenes reported since 1961 were also summarised and divided into epoxy side chain labdanes (132-150) and epoxy-free side chain labdanes (151-171). Tobacco cembranoid and labdane diterpenes are both formed via the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway and are synthesised from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Their biosynthetic pathways and the four key enzymes (cembratrienol synthase, cytochrome P450 hydroxylase, copalyl diphosphate synthase, and Z-abienol cyclase) that affect their biosynthesis have been described in detail. A systematic summary of the bioactivity and utilisation values of the cembranoid and labdane diterpenes is also provided. The agricultural bioactivities associated with cembranoid and labdane diterpenes include antimicrobial and insecticidal activities as well as induced resistance, while the medical bioactivities include cytotoxic and neuroprotective activities. Further research into the cembranoid and labdane diterpenes will help to promote their development and utilisation as plant-derived pesticides and medicines.

AB  - Users have been urged to embrace a cloud-based environment by recent technologies and advancements. Because of the dispersed nature of cloud solutions, security is a major problem. Because it is highly exposed to intruders for any kind of assault, security and privacy are major roadblocks to the on-demand service's success. A massive increase in network traffic has opened the ground for increasingly difficult and pervasive security vulnerabilities. Several intrusion detection systems (IDS) for cloud computing environments have recently been suggested. Current IDS may display over-fitting, low classification accuracy, and a high false positive rate when given with a large volume of variety of network data (FPR). We provide an effective optimal security solution for intrusion detection in a cloud computing environment using a hybrid deep learning algorithm in this study (EOS-IDS). Preprocessing is done using the improved heap optimization (IHO) technique, which assures data quality by removing unnecessary data from the dataset. Then, for optimum feature selection, we offer a chaotic red deer optimization (CRDO) technique, which is responsible for dimensionality reduction owing to large data. Then, for cloud attacks and intrusion detection and classification, a deep Kronecker neural network (DKNN) is shown. To illustrate its effectiveness, the proposed EOS-IDS strategy is evaluated against two benchmark datasets, DARPA IDS and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and the results are compared to different existing IDS strategies.

AB  - Frugivore foraging behavior is largely influenced by two key groups of chemical traits: nutrients and secondary metabolites. Many secondary metabolites function in plant defense, but their consumption can negatively impact both mutualistic and antagonistic frugivores, often due to toxic properties of the metabolites or through nutrient absorption interference. Frugivores are assumed to maximize nutrient acquisition while avoiding or minimizing toxic metabolite intake, but the relative roles of co-occurring nutrients and secondary metabolites in foraging behavior are not well understood. Here, we used a neotropical fruit bat to investigate the interactive effects of nutrients and a broadly bioactive fruit secondary metabolite, piperine, on two essential processes in nutrient acquisition, namely foraging behavior and nutrient absorption. Through the manipulation of nutrient and piperine concentrations in artificial diets, we showed that captive fruit bats prioritize nutrient concentrations regardless of the levels of piperine, even though piperine is a strong deterrent on its own. Furthermore, our findings reveal that while piperine has no detectable influence on total sugar absorption, it reduces protein absorption, which is a crucial and limited nutrient in the frugivore diet. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering the interaction between co-occurring chemical traits in fruit pulp to better understand frugivore foraging and physiology.

AB  - In recent years, the evolutionary history of rhinoceroses has been extensively developed and clarified, notably with the help of morpho-anatomical and molecular-based phylogenetic analyses. Within Rhinocerotidae, the genus Coelodonta Bronn, 1831, is one of the most representative icons of the Ice Ages, ranging from the Late Pliocene to the latest Pleistocene. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on its phylogeny and the systematic assignment of its Middle Pleistocene representatives is fervently debated. Indeed, the earliest European specimens of Coelodonta are considered as documenting either C. tologoijensis Belyaeva in Vangengejm et al., 1966), of Russian affinities, or an early subspecies of Coelodonta antiquitatis (Blumenbach, 1799), C. a. praecursor Guerin1980. Accordingly, C. antiquitatis would then first occur in the Late Pleistocene or in the Middle Pleistocene depending on the hypothesis. The current work aims to describe and identify cranio-mandibular and postcranial remains of Coelodonta from the Middle Pleistocene Les Rameaux locality, SW France, and to compare them with all Eurasian representatives of the genus, including the oldest European specimens from Bad Frankenhausen. A combination of morphometric and morpho-anatomical phylogenetic analyses strongly supports C. a. praecursor and C. a. antiquitatis as distinct and valid subspecies and allows for the refutation of the taxonomic assignment of the Bad Frankenhausen skull to C. tologoijensis. This work proposes the first comprehensive phylogeny for Coelodonta, further tracing its biogeographical history. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In response to herbivory, Capsicum annuum leaves adapt their specialized metabolome that may protect the plant against herbivore feeding either directly or indirectly through volatile metabolites acting as cues for natural enemies of the herbivore. The volatile blend of spider-mite infested leaves differs from non-challenged leaves predominantly by a higher contribution of mono- and sesquiterpenes. In addition to these terpenoids released into the headspace, the terpenoid composition of the leaves alters upon herbivory. All this suggests an important role for terpenoids and their biosynthetic machinery in the defence against herbivory. Here, we show that the C. annuum genome contains a terpene synthase (TPS) gene family of 103 putative members of which structural analysis revealed that 27 encode functional enzymes. Transcriptome analysis showed that several TPS loci were differentially expressed upon herbivory in leaves of two C. annuum genotypes, that differ in susceptibility towards spider mites. The relative expression of upstream biosynthetic genes from the mevalonate and the methylerythritol phosphate pathway also altered upon herbivory, revealing a shift in the metabolic flux through the terpene biosynthetic module. The expression of multiple genes potentially acting downstream of the TPSs, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, UDP-glucosyl transferases, and transcription factors strongly correlated with the herbivory-induced TPS genes. A selection of herbivory-induced TPS genes was functionally characterized through heterologous expression and the products that these enzymes catalysed matched with the volatile and non-volatile terpenoids induced in response to herbivory.

AB  - The entorhinal cortex (EC, A28) is linked through reciprocal pathways with nearby perirhinal and visual, auditory, and multimodal association cortices in the temporal lobe, in pathways associated with the flow of information for memory processing. The density and laminar organization of these pathways is not well understood in primates. We studied interconnections within the ventral temporal lobe in young adult rhesus monkeys of both sexes with the aid of neural tracers injected in temporal areas (Ts1, Ts2, TE1, area 36, temporal polar area TPro, and area 28) to determine the density and laminar distribution of projection neurons within the temporal lobe. These temporal areas can be categorized into three different cortical types based on their laminar architecture: the sensory association areas Ts1, Ts2, and TE1 have six layers (eulaminate); the perirhinal limbic areas TPro and area 36 have an incipient layer IV (dysgranular); and area 28 lacks layer IV (agranular). We found that (1) temporal areas that are similar in laminar architecture by cortical type are strongly interconnected, and (2) the laminar pattern of connections is dependent on the difference in cortical laminar structure between linked areas. Thus, agranular A28 is more strongly connected with other agranular/dysgranular areas than with eulaminate cortices. Further, A28 predominantly projected via feedback-like pathways that originated in the deep layers, and received feedforward-like projections from areas of greater laminar differentiation, which emanated from the upper layers. Our results are consistent with the Structural Model, which relates the density and laminar distribution of connections to the relationship of the laminar structure between the linked areas. These connections were viewed in the context of the inhibitory microenvironment of A28, which is the key recipient of pathways from the cortex and of the output of hippocampus. Our findings revealed a higher population of calretinin (CR)-expressing neurons in EC, with a significantly higher density in its lateral division. Medial EC had a higher density of CR neurons in the deep layers, particularly in layer Va. In contrast, parvalbumin (PV) neurons were more densely distributed in the deep layers of the lateral subdivisions of rostral EC, especially in layer Va, whereas the densities of calbindin (CB) neurons in the medial and lateral EC were comparable in all layers, except for layer IIIa, in which medial EC had a higher CB population than the lateral. The pattern of connections in the inhibitory microenvironment of EC, which sends and receives input from the hippocampus, may shed light on signal propagation in this network associated with diverse aspects of memory, and disruptions in neurologic and psychiatric diseases that affect this region.
   In macaques, connections are more frequent between architectonically similar ventral temporal cortices, in line with the Structural Model, which predicts density and laminar distribution of connections based on cortical type differences between linked areas. Pathways associated with memory in the entorhinal cortex are embedded in the laminar inhibitory microenvironment. image

AB  - Folic acid has been reported to exert antidepressant effects, but its ability to abrogate the depressive-like behavior and signaling pathways alterations elicited by an inflammatory model of depression remains to be established. This study examined: a) the efficacy of folic acid in a mouse model of depression induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha); b) whether the administration of subthreshold doses of folic acid and antidepressants (fluoxetine, imipramine, and bupropion), MK-801, or 7-nitroindazole cause antidepressant-like effects; c) the effects of TNF-alpha and/or folic acid on hippocampal p38MAPK, Akt, ERK, and JNK phosphorylation. Folic acid reduced the immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) in control mice (10-50 mg/kg, p.o) and abolished the depressive-like behavior elicited by TNF-alpha (0.001 fg/site, i.c.v.) in this test (1-50 mg/kg, p.o). Coadministration of subthreshold doses of folic acid (1 mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine, imipramine, bupropion, MK-801, or 7nitroindazole produced an antidepressant-like effect in mice exposed or not to TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha-treated mice presented increased p38MAPK phosphorylation and decreased Akt phosphorylation, and the later effect was prevented by folic acid (10 mg/kg, p.o.). Additionally, ERK1 phosphorylation was increased in mice treated with TNF-alpha + folic acid (1 mg/kg), but no effects on ERK2 or JNK1/2/3 phosphorylation were found in any group. The results indicate the efficacy of folic acid to counteract the depressive-like behavior induced by a proinflammatory cytokine, an effect that might be associated with the activation of monoaminergic systems, inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, as well as Akt modulation.

AB  - The escalating demand for meat, propelled by a worldwide surge in population and economic development, necessitates the implementation of sustainable approaches for animal feed production. This study investigated the impact of incorporating black soldier fly (BSF; scientific name: Hermetia illucens) meal into the diets of sows and piglets as a potential substitute for conventional protein sources on sow fertility, blood parameters, piglet growth, and intestinal tissue structure. Consuming BSF instead of animal or soybean proteins did not deteriorate sow reproductive performance. The feed conversion ratio from 28- to 35-day-old piglets was lower in BSF-fed groups despite no discernible disparities in growth; this indicated that it may be beneficial to optimize the rate of replacing animal proteins with BSF meal, preferably along with chitin removal from BSF meal to improve digestibility. Furthermore, minor variations in blood cell composition and properties were observed in 28-day-old piglets, with elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the high-BSF group, which may be attributed to the unique fatty acid composition of BSF. The escalating demand for meat, driven by global population growth, necessitates sustainable solutions for animal feed production. This study investigated the effects of substituting conventional protein resources in sow and piglet dietary regimens with black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens) meal on reproductive efficiency, blood profile, piglet growth, and intestinal tissue morphology. The results indicate that substituting animal-derived and soy proteins with BSF meal does not compromise sow reproductive performance. Although no notable disparities were observed in piglet growth, the feed conversion ratio from the 28- to 35-day age marks were lower in the BSF-fed groups. This suggests that the animal protein-BSF substitution rate may require optimization, potentially involving chitin removal from BSF meal to enhance digestibility. Minor variations in the hematological composition and properties in piglets, with elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the high BSF group at the 28-day mark, were potentially attributable to the unique fatty acid composition of BSF meal. Moreover, this study potentiates future exploration into the efficacy of complete animal protein substitution with BSF meals on piglet nutrition and physiology, particularly in fattening pigs. The practical implementation of BSF meals in animal feed production holds promise for enhancing the sustainability of the swine industry.

AB  - Simple Summary Piglet mortality is an ongoing concern for pig production worldwide. Piglets that have a low piglet birth weight (PBW), suffer from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or are born from litters with a high within-litter variation in PBW (CVPBW) have an increased risk of dying before weaning. IUGR piglets, CVPBW and a low PBW might be connected by the same risk factors, and in order to optimize fetal development in the litter, these risk factors should be identified. Free-access stall feeding, floor feeding and electronic sow feeding systems are commonly used feeding systems for gestating sows in Denmark. These systems differ in several points, including in sow competition at feeding. The nutritional status of the sow is important for fetal development, and so the feeding method during gestation is also expected to affect such development. Of the risk factors identified in this study, increasing litter size was considered the most critical. Only small differences were found between the feeding systems and these differed amongst groups. The results should inspire further investigation of those risk factors to clarify causes of the observed effects and what drives individual herd differences. This study aimed to identify risk factors affecting PBW, high CVPBW and the occurrence of IUGR piglets in 12 commercial Danish herds with hyperprolific sows using free-access stalls, floor or electronic sow feeding systems in the gestation unit. The following factors were investigated: the duration of previous lactation, the length of the interval from weaning to insemination, the length of gestation, litter size, parity, sow backfat thickness in late gestation and the type of feeding system in the gestation unit. The study included newborn piglets from 452 litters with the following production indicator averages: 21.3 piglets/L, 1235 g PBW, 22.9% CVPBW and 10.9% and 11.8% within-litter occurrence of severe and mild IUGR piglets, respectively. Increasing length of weaning-to-insemination interval decreased PBW by 25.8 g/day. For 2nd to 9th parity sows, each additional piglet in the litter increased CVPBW by 0.38%, the occurrence of severe IUGR piglets by 0.68% and mild IUGR piglets by 0.50%. Sows of 5th parity and older had a 1.39% higher CVPBW and 49.1 g lighter piglets compared with sows of 2nd to 4th parity. PBW was lower in one ESF herd, suggesting complex interactions that need to be further elucidated. The main critical risk factor observed was litter size.

AB  - Over the last decade, a growing body of research has examined the link between physical activity, fitness, and cognitive function in children and adolescents. Physical activity experimental research conducted with children and adolescents has identified selectively greater effects for tasks requiring higher order executive functions. As such, the primary aim of our chapter is to provide an overview of findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have examined the effects of physical activity on measures of executive function in child and adolescent populations. We begin our chapter with definitions of key concepts associated with physical activity, fitness and cognitive function. We then provide a synthesis of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have examined the acute and chronic effect of physical activity on EFs. Following this, we discuss the quantitative (e.g., time, intensity) and qualitative (e.g., type) characteristics of physical activity that may moderate effects. The next section focuses on the neurobiological, psychosocial and behavioral mechanisms responsible for the effect of physical activity on executive functions. We conclude by highlighting the limitations of the existing evidence base and providing recommendations for future research.

AB  - Simple Summary Exosomes play a unique role in virus infection, antigen presentation, and suppression/promotion of body immunity. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most damaging pathogens in the pig industry. Here, we used the PRRSV NADC30-like CHsx1401 strain to artificially infect 42-day-old pigs, isolate serum exosomes, and identify 33 significantly differentially expressed (DE) exosomal miRNAs between infection and control groups, and 18 DE miRNAs associated with PRRSV infection and immunity were screened as potential functional molecules involved in the regulation of PRRSV virus infection by exosomes. Exosomes are biological vesicles secreted and released by cells that act as mediators of intercellular communication and play a unique role in virus infection, antigen presentation, and suppression/promotion of body immunity. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most damaging pathogens in the pig industry and can cause reproductive disorders in sows, respiratory diseases in pigs, reduced growth performance, and other diseases leading to pig mortality. In this study, we used the PRRSV NADC30-like CHsx1401 strain to artificially infect 42-day-old pigs and isolate serum exosomes. Based on high-throughput sequencing technology, 305 miRNAs were identified in serum exosomes before and after infection, among which 33 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between groups (13 relatively upregulated and 20 relatively downregulated). Sequence conservation analysis of the CHsx1401 genome identified 8 conserved regions, of which a total of 16 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were predicted to bind to the conserved region closest to the 3 ' UTR of the CHsx1401 genome, including 5 DE miRNAs capable of binding to the CHsx1401 3 ' UTR (ssc-miR-34c, ssc-miR-375, ssc-miR-378, ssc-miR-486, ssc-miR-6529). Further analysis revealed that the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were widely involved in exosomal function-related and innate immunity-related signaling pathways, and 18 DE miRNAs (ssc-miR-4331-3p, ssc-miR-744, ssc-miR-320, ssc-miR-10b, ssc-miR-124a, ssc-miR-128, etc.) associated with PRRSV infection and immunity were screened as potential functional molecules involved in the regulation of PRRSV virus infection by exosomes.

AB  - Salicinoids are salicyl alcohol-containing phenolic glycosides with strong antiherbivore effects found only in poplars and willows. Their biosynthesis is poorly understood, but recently a UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase, UGT71L1, was shown to be required for salicinoid biosynthesis in poplar tissue cultures. UGT71L1 specifically glycosylates salicyl benzoate, a proposed salicinoid intermediate. Here, we analyzed transgenic CRISPR/Cas9-generated UGT71L1 knockout plants. Metabolomic analyses revealed substantial reductions in the major salicinoids, confirming the central role of the enzyme in salicinoid biosynthesis. Correspondingly, UGT71L1 knockouts were preferred to wild-type by white-marked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma) larvae in bioassays. Greenhouse-grown knockout plants showed substantial growth alterations, with decreased internode length and smaller serrated leaves. Reinserting a functional UGT71L1 gene in a transgenic rescue experiment demonstrated that these effects were due only to the loss of UGT71L1. The knockouts contained elevated salicylate (SA) and jasmonate (JA) concentrations, and also had enhanced expression of SA- and JA-related genes. SA is predicted to be released by UGT71L1 disruption, if salicyl salicylate is a pathway intermediate and UGT71L1 substrate. This idea was supported by showing that salicyl salicylate can be glucosylated by recombinant UGT71L1, providing a potential link of salicinoid metabolism to SA and growth impacts. Connecting this pathway with growth could imply that salicinoids are under additional evolutionary constraints beyond selective pressure by herbivores.
   Knockout of a recently discovered enzyme of salicinoid biosynthesis in poplar leads to changes in salicylic acid and jasmonic acid metabolism and has unexpected effects on growth.

AB  - Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a phytopathogenic fungus, which can cause many different diseases on different crops. The pathogen can cause leaf spot on tea plants (Camellia sinensis), which negatively affects the productivity and quality of tea leaves in tea plantations in Guizhou Province, China. Although the genome sequence of L. theobromae has been published, no data on the transcriptome or small RNA sequences of L. theobromae under in vitro conditions and the course of infection of tea leaf are available. Here, we report the high-quality transcriptome and small RNA sequences of L. theobromae in vitro conditions and the course of infection of tea leaf using the platform of Illumina HiSeq. This comprehensive expression profiling of the fungal pathogen will provide a valuable resource for future research on trait-specific genes of the pathogen, host-pathogen interactions, and disease resistance in the host.

AB  - Piglet diarrhea caused by Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type C (CpC) seriously endangers the development of the pig production industry. C. perfringens beta2 (CPB2) toxin is a virulent toxin produced by CpC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators in the immune inflammatory response to bacterial infection. Nevertheless, the functional mechanism of lncRNAs in bacterial piglet diarrhea is unclear. Herein, a novel lncRNA lnc001776 expression was confirmed to be substantially elevated in the ileum tissue of CpC-infected diarrhea piglets and in CPB2 toxin-treated porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). lnc001776 knockdown restrained CPB2 toxin-induced apoptosis, inflammatory injury, barrier dysfunction and activation of JNK/NF-kB pathway in IPEC-J2 cells. Additionally, ssc-let-7i-5p was identified as sponge for lnc001776. Overexpression of ssc-let-7i-5p repressed CPB2-induced injury in IPEC-J2 cells. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a target gene of ssc-let-7i-5p, was enhanced in CPB2 toxin-treated IPEC-J2 cells. Rescue experiments demonstrated that a ssc-let-7i-5p mimic reversed the effect of lnc001776 overexpression on CPB2 toxin-induced IPEC-J2 cell injury and JNK/NF-kB pathway, whereas IL-6 overexpression partially restored the impact of lnc001776. Overall, lnc001776 overexpression exacerbated CPB2 toxin-induced IPEC-J2 cell damage by sponging ssc-let-7i-5p to regulate IL-6 to activate JNK/NF-kB pathway, indicating that lnc001776 could be a key target for piglet resistance to CpC-induced diarrhea.

AB  - IntroductionAmenorrhea induced decrease of hormones is associated with cognitive impairment. This study aimed to evaluate hippocampal functional connectivity patterns in chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) breast cancer (BC) patients, to evaluate the relationship between the functional connectivity features and hormone levels. MethodNeuropsychological test, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and assessment of hormone levels were conducted in 21 premenopausal BC patients before chemotherapy (t(0)) and 1 week after completing chemotherapy (t(1)). Twenty matched healthy controls (HC) were also included and underwent the same assessments at similar time intervals. Mixed effect analysis and paired t-test were used to compare differences in brain functional connectivity. ResultsVoxel-based paired t-tests revealed increased functional connectivity of the right and left hippocampus with the left fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus after chemotherapy (p < .001) in CIA patients. Repeated measures analysis revealed significant group-by-time interactions in the left hippocampus with the bilateral fusiform gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left inferior occipital gyrus (p < .001). Premenopausal BC patients had no significant differences in cognitive function compared with HC at baseline. However, the CIA patients had high levels of self-rating depression scale, self-rating anxiety scale, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Further, the CIA patients showed significant differences in hormone and fasting plasma glucose levels and cognitive performances between t(0) and t(1) (p < .05). Functional connectivity changes between the left hippocampus and the left inferior occipital gyrus was negatively correlated with E2 and luteinizing hormone changes (p < .05). ConclusionThe CIA patients had cognitive dysfunction mainly in memory and visual mobility. Chemotherapy may affect hippocampal-posterior cortical circuit which mediates visual processing in CIA patients. Moreover, E2 may be involved in this process.

AB  - Air pollution is recognized as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, but the effects of acute exposure and subsequent recovery from traffic-related air pollution remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the acute and recovery effects of diesel exhaust particle (DEP) exposure on central nervous system (CNS) toxicity. Six-week-old female C57BL/6NCrl mice received oropharyngeal aspiration of either 0 (vehicle control) or 50 mu g/mouse of DEP twice a week for 3 weeks, with the acute group euthanized in week 4, and the recovery group undergoing behavioral tests in weeks 4 and 15 before being euthanized in week 16. DEP deposition in the lungs was estimated using the multiple-path particle dosimetry (MPPD) model, revealing 16.58% deposition, with 12.03% in the alveolar region, and clearance taking over 95 days. Mononuclear cell infiltration and DEP-laden macrophages were observed in lung tissues of both groups. Behavioral tests showed no significant differences between control and DEP groups in step-through latency, escape latency, quadrant area crossing time, or swimming velocity. Lipid peroxidation, indicated by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, was significantly higher in the cerebellum and hippocampus of the acute exposure group (p < 0.05). Acute DEP exposure also significantly elevated Tau and p-Tau levels in the cortex (p < 0.05), but no significant changes were observed in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Histological analysis showed no significant pathological changes in the brain regions examined. The findings underscore the need for further research into the prolonged effects of DEP exposure and highlight the importance of addressing traffic-related air pollution to protect respiratory and neurological health.

AB  - This study investigates the formation mechanisms and impact of a coastal salinity front observed in the central eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) coast, particularly off Mangalore (similar to 13 degrees N), during the peak summer monsoon in August 2018. The interplay of intense monsoon rainfall, river runoff and coastal upwelling created a dynamic frontal zone characterised by distinct physical and biogeochemical properties in the central EAS. The study revealed that observed salinity fronts are formed due to the breaking of freshwater lenses by strong upwelled waters and the subsequent offshore transport of low-salinity plumes by prevailing current and Ekman transport. The high nutrient concentrations enhanced the chlorophyll a concentration 15-20 times higher (10.12 mg/m(3)) in the frontal zone compared to the non-frontal station. The dominance of diatoms in the frontal zone indicates herbivorous control in the coastal food web. Accumulation of plastic debris and foam-like particles in the frontal zone poses ecological risks and threatens aquatic life.

AB  - Visual predators rely on fast-acting optokinetic responses to track and capture agile prey. Most toothed whales, however, rely on echolocation for hunting and have converged on biosonar clicking rates reaching 500/s during prey pursuits. If echoes are processed on a click-by-click basis, as assumed, neural responses 100x faster than those in vision are required to keep pace with this information flow. Using high-resolution biologging of wild predator-prey interactions, we show that toothed whales adjust clicking rates to track prey movement within 50-200 ms of prey escape responses. Hypothesising that these stereotyped biosonar adjustments are elicited by sudden prey accelerations, we measured echo-kinetic responses from trained harbour porpoises to a moving target and found similar latencies. High biosonar sampling rates are, therefore, not supported by extreme speeds of neural processing and muscular responses. Instead, the neurokinetic response times in echolocation are similar to those of tracking responses in vision, suggesting a common neural underpinning.
   eLife digest In the animal world, split-second decisions determine whether a predator eats, or its prey survives. There is a strong evolutionary advantage to fast reacting brains and bodies. For example, the eye muscles of hunting cheetahs must lock on to a gazelle and keep track of it, no matter how quickly or unpredictably it moves. In fact, in monkeys and primates, these muscles can react to sudden movements in as little as 50 milliseconds - faster than the blink of an eye. But what about animals that do not rely on vision to hunt? To find food at night or in the deep ocean, whales and porpoises make short ultrasonic sounds, or 'clicks', and then listen for returning echoes. As they close in on a prey, they need to click faster to get quicker updates on its location. What is unclear is how fast they react to the echoes. Just before a kill, a harbour porpoise can click over 500 times a second: if they wait for the echo from one click before making the next one, they would need responses 100 times faster than human eyes. Exploring this topic is difficult, as it requires tracking predator and prey at the same time. Vance et al. took up the challenge by building sound and movement recorders that attach to whales with suction cups. These were used on two different hunters: deep-diving beaked whales and shallow-hunting harbour porpoises. Both species adapted their click rate depending on how far they were from their prey, but their response times were similar to visual responses in monkeys and humans. This means that whales and porpoises do not act on each echo before clicking again: instead, they respond to groups of tens of clicks at a time. This suggests that their brains may be wired in much the same way as the ones of visual animals. In the ocean, increased human activity creates a dangerous noise pollution that disrupts the delicate hunting mechanism of whales and porpoises. Better understanding how these animals find their food may therefore help conservation efforts.

AB  - Females experience considerable environmental variability when breeding seasons are long. Adverse nutritional conditions can result in a reduction in mating and reproduction. However, a return to good nutrition may help animals resume high reproductive investment. I tested the silver spoon hypothesis in which females raised under poor conditions are reproductively limited compared to those raised under good conditions regardless of their adult environment. I used a specialist herbivore, Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae), that lives on seasonally changing cacti. I provided juveniles and adults with a cactus pad with fruit (good diet), without fruit (restricted diet), or an improved adult diet (no fruit as juveniles, fruit at adulthood) to simulate a seasonal change in their diets near the end of the breeding season. I found that both ovary size and egg presence were reduced for females fed the restricted diet compared to those fed the good diet. Females fed the improved diet grew large ovaries like those fed the good diet, but few produced any eggs. Interestingly, female mating behavior did not change but females were less attractive to males when fed restricted diets. My results support the silver spoon hypothesis for compensatory growth and suggest that tradeoffs may occur between early survival and future reproduction when females experience a poor early life diet.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the pathogenesis of depression in mice using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model, with a particular focus on the changes in inflammatory gene networks and inflammatory factor levels under the condition of gut microbiota dysbiosis. The results indicate that CUMS-induced mice exhibited significant depressive-like behaviors. Specifically, they displayed reduced sucrose intake in the sucrose preference test, decreased central area distance and time in the open field test, and reduced percentage of entries and time spent in the open arm in the elevated plus maze test. Molecular biological analysis indicated that CUMS treatment significantly upregulated the levels of inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IFN-gamma in the serum and hippocampus of mice. Through high-throughput sequencing and Pearson correlation analysis, it was found that the levels of inflammatory factors were significantly positively correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory pathway genes, as well as the abundance of beneficial and harmful bacteria. Furthermore, the persistent changes in inflammatory factors ultimately led to neuronal cell death. This study provides strong evidence for the role of disrupted "microbiota-gut-brain" axis homeostasis in the pathogenesis of CUMS-induced depression in mice. This finding offers a new perspective for understanding the pathological mechanisms of depression and provides strategies for future depression treatment.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with a long preclinical and prodromal phase. To enable the study of disease mechanisms, AD has been modeled in many transgenic animal lines and cognitive functioning has been tested using several widely used behavioral tasks. These tasks, however, are not always suited for repeated longitudinal testing and are often associated with acute stress such as animal transfer, handling, novelty, or stress related to the task itself. This makes it challenging to relate cognitive dysfunction in animal models to cognitive decline observed in AD patients. Here, we designed an automated figure-8-maze (F8M) to test mice in a delayed alternation task (DAT) in a longitudinal manner. Mice were rewarded when they entered alternate sides of the maze on subsequent trials. Automation as well as connection of the F8M set-up with a home cage reduces experimenter interference and minimizes acute stress, thus making it suitable for longitudinal testing and facilitating clinical translation. In the present study, we monitored cognitive functioning of 2-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice over a period of 4 months. The percentage of correct responses in the DAT did not differ between wild-type and transgenic mice from 2 to 6 months of age. However, 6-month-old mice displayed an increase in the number of consecutive incorrect responses. These results demonstrate the feasibility of longitudinal testing using an automated F8M and suggest that APP/PS1 mice are not impaired at delayed spatial alternation until 6 months of age under the current experimental conditions.

AB  - In porcine in vitro production (IVP) systems, the use of oocytes derived from prepubertal gilts, whilst being commercially attractive, remains challenging due to their poor developmental competence following in vitro maturation (IVM). Follicular fluid contains important growth factors and plays a kcy role during oocyte maturation; therefore, it is a common supplementation for porcine TVM medium. However, follicular fluid contains many poorly characterized components, is batch variable, and its use raises biosecurity concerns. In an effort to design Li defined IVM system, growth factors such as cytokines haw been previously tested. These include leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), the combination of which is termed 'FLI'. Here, using abattoir-derived oocytes in a well established porcine IVP system, we compared follicular fluid and FLI supplementation during both IVM and embryo culture to test the hypothesis that FLI can substitute for follicular fluid without compromising oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. We demonstrate that in oocytes derived from prepubertal gilts, FLI supplementation enhances oocvtc meiotic maturation and has a positive effect on the quality and developmental competence of embryos. Moreover, for the first time, we studied the effects of follicular fluid and FLI combined showing no synergistic effects.

AB  - High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity results in bone loss associated with an imbalanced gut microbiota and altered immune status. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are beneficial to the host and are important in maintaining bone health and gut homeostasis. In this study, the probiotic Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens (T3L) was isolated from traditional yak milk cheese produced in Lhasa and showed distinct acid and bile salt resistance as potential probiotics. Our data indicated that T3L not only reversed HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, as indicated by decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios but also reduced bone loss. The anti-obesity, microbiome-modulating, and bone-protective effects were transmissible via horizontal faeces transfer from T3L-treated mice to HFD-fed mice. The protective effects of T3L on bone mass were associated with regulatory T (Treg) cell-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation. Our data indicate that T3L is a regulator of the gut microbiota and bone homeostasis in an animal model.

AB  - We investigated the consequence of abrupt directional shifts in the timing of light (hence darkness) period on sleep behaviour, novel object exploration and cognitive performance in diurnal zebra finches maintained under an equinox (12:12h LD) photoperiod. To two cohorts of birds (n = 80), the timing of 12 h light-on (hence of the darkness) for a week was either advanced by 6 h by reducing the dark period or delayed by 6 h by lengthening the dark period, with controls maintained on LD cycle as before. The first cohort of birds were examined for the effects on 24 h activity and feeding behaviors, while the second cohorts of birds were examined for the effects on sleep, neophobia and cognitive performance; the latter two were tested by the novel object exploration and spatial learning, respectively. The abrupt LD cycle shifts negatively affected sleep behaviour and cognition, as evidenced by behavioral and gene expression assays. There was a significant decrease in the mRNA expression levels of gene coding for the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the regulatory enzyme of the dopamine synthesis), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus and TH alone in midbrain. These results support growing evidence of negative effects on behaviour and advanced brain functions in a diurnal species exposed to abrupt shifts in 24 h LD cycles.

AB  - Simple Summary Functional differences between the various segments of the intestine and differences in the intestines between species have been demonstrated in previous studies. Guinea pigs are commonly used model animals in intestinal-related research. As well as modeling disease states, it is important to study the intestinal tract of guinea pigs to derive basic data for the rational use of guinea pig models. Therefore, we collected six different segments of the intestinal tissue of guinea pigs and analyzed the gene expression profiles and microbial composition of each of these regions. The results revealed the functional regionalization of the intestine, with changes in functional gene expression between different intestinal segments, an association between microbial abundance and gene expression, and differences in intestinal gene expression between different species. Our study provides a reference for future intestinal-related research. The intestine is a tubular organ with multiple functions such as digestion absorption and immunity, but the functions of each intestinal segments are different. Intestinal regionalization is necessary for normal physiological function, but it also means the research results obtained at specific sites may not be applicable to other intestinal segments. In order to comprehensively describe the functional changes in the intestine, different intestinal segments and their contents (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum) of guinea pigs were collected for RNA seq and 16S rRNA seq, respectively. The results showed differential genes of each intestinal segment mainly involve mucosa, digestion, absorption, and immunity. The gene sets related to fat, bill salts, vitamins, aggregates, amino acids, and water absorption were highly expressed in the small intestine, and the gene sets related to metal ions, nucleotides, and SCFAs were highly expressed in the large intestine. In terms of immunity, the CD8(+) T, Th1, eosinophils, pDCs, and natural killer (NK) T cells in the small intestine showed higher scores than those in the large intestine, while the pattern-recognition receptor signaling pathway-related genes are highly expressed in the large intestine. In terms of microbial composition, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria are abundant in the small intestine, while Firmicutes and Spirochaete are abundant in large intestine. The correlation analysis showed a high correlation between intestinal microorganisms and gene modules related to digestion and absorption. In addition, cross-species analysis showed the SCFA metabolism gene expression trends in human and rodent intestine were different. In conclusion, we analyzed the changes in substance transport, immune and microbial composition between different intestinal segments of guinea pigs, and explored the relationship between intestinal transcriptome and microorganisms, our research will provides a reference for subsequent intestinal-related research.

AB  - Alkaline stress impairs fish productivity and performance and, therefore, is considered one of the major challenges facing aquaculture. In this work, the effects of supplementing diets with camel whey protein hydrolysates (WPH) on growth, digestion, antioxidant capacity, and gene expression were investigated in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) under alkaline stress. A total of 160 fish (16.17 +/- 0.29 g) were equally assigned into four treatments, with 10 fish in each replicate. The control (C) and WPH groups received the basal diet supplemented with 0 and 75 g/kg WPH, respectively, and were reared in freshwater with an alkalinity of 1.4 mmol NaHCO3/L. The alkaline-exposed (AK) and AK + WPH groups were subjected to alkaline water (alkalinity = 23.8 mmol NaHCO3/L) and fed basal and WPH diet, respectively. Alkaline stress depressed the growth performance, digestive enzyme activity, intestinal Lactobacillus count, intestinal morphometrics, growth hormone level, and antioxidant enzyme activity but enhanced leptin hormone level and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in Nile tilapia. Alkaline stress also downregulated the transcription of key intestinal transporter genes. Dietary supplementation with WPH significantly improved growth, digestive enzyme activity, antioxidant capacity, and the gene expression profile of Nile tilapia under alkaline stress. Based on the current results, it was concluded that WPH diet could mitigate negative effects caused by alkaline stress in Nile tilapia, which might support its application as an effective functional protein replacement candidate in aquaculture.

AB  - The number of investigations relevant to the study of geomagnetic activity, solar events, and cosmic rays, i.e., space weather phenomena, and their impact on human health has increased dramatically over the past few years. Numerous studies examine the reaction of the cardiovascular, nervous, and other functional systems to variations observed in geospace. These studies examine the behavior of human physiological parameters not only during different levels of activity of the Sun and in the interplanetary space (from no activity to remarkably intense activity) but also through geomagnetic activity storms and Forbush decreases. Here, individuals from the Hippocratio General Hospital in Athens, the cardiology clinics of Nikaia General Hospital in Piraeus, and the Heraklion University Hospital in Crete, Greece, were assessed during the time period from 2011 until 2018. The heart rate of the individuals was recorded every hour via the Holter electrocardiogram method. Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the method of superimposed epochs. The investigation covers not only the ascending but also the descending phase of the solar cycle 24 (lasting until 2019 and with its maximum in the year 2014).

AB  - Group defense in prey and hunting cooperation in predators are two important ecological phenomena and can occur concurrently. In this article, we consider cooperative hunting in generalist predators and group defense in prey under a mathematical framework to comprehend the enormous diversity the model could capture. To do so, we consider a modified Holling-Tanner model where we implement Holling type IV functional response to characterize grazing pattern of predators where prey species exhibit group defense. Additionally, we allow a modification in the attack rate of predators to quantify the hunting cooperation among them. The model admits three boundary equilibria and up to three coexistence equilibrium points. The geometry of the nontrivial prey and predator nullclines and thus the number of coexistence equilibria primarily depends on a specific threshold of the availability of alternative food for predators. We use linear stability analysis to determine the types of hyperbolic equilibrium points and characterize the non-hyperbolic equilibrium points through normal form and center manifold theory. Change in the model parameters leading to the occurrences of a series of local bifurcations from non-hyperbolic equilibrium points, namely, transcritical, saddle-node, Hopf, cusp and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation; there are also occurrences of global bifurcations such as homoclinic bifurcation and saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles. We observe two interesting closed 'bubble' form induced by global bifurcations due to change in the strength of hunting cooperation and the availability of alternative food for predators. A three dimensional bifurcation diagram, concerning the original system parameters, captures how the alternation in model formulation induces gradual changes in the bifurcation scenarios. Our model highlights the stabilizing effects of group or gregarious behaviour in both prey and predator, hence supporting the predator-herbivore regulation hypothesis. Additionally, our model highlights the occurrence of "saltatory equilibria" in ecological systems and capture the dynamics observed for lion-herbivore interactions.

AB  - At present, forage kale cultivars for feeding cattle and sheep are either open-pollinated ones from population-improvement schemes within suitable botanical varieties of Brassica oleracea or triple-cross hybrids from within or between botanical varieties, the only commercialised latter type being between marrow-stem kale and Brussels sprouts. Eight botanical varieties (15 cultivars) and 13 types of hybrids (50 hybrids) between them were produced and assessed for forage traits in SE Scotland in the early 1980s when there was government funding in Great Britain for such work (terminated in 1990). These previously unpublished results may now be of interest to a new generation of commercial forage brassica breeders. In addition to height and dry matter yield and content, quality traits, such as digestibility and antimetabolites, were assessed. The hybrids with marrow-stem kale as one parent varied in height, but combined a high-dry-matter yield with desirable quality traits for a forage crop. None was ideal and none had a superior combination of traits to the hybrids with Brussels sprouts. The hybrids between marrow-stem kale and January King cabbage were the shortest and a possible alternative to dwarf thousand-head kale. The results can be used to justify new forage brassica breeding programmes.

AB  - This study identified genomic variants and potential candidate genes associated with 11 primal cut traits (back fat, belly fat, total fat, loin fat, ham fat, picnic fat, butt fat, loin intramuscular fat content, ham side fat, shoulder dorsal fat, and belly side fat thicknesses) in Canadian commercial crossbred pigs. Genome-wide association studies using whole genome sequencing data were conducted using genotyping data from 1118 commercial crossbred pigs. This analysis revealed multiple QTLs across chromosomes SSC1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, and 17, associated with fat traits. Notably, an SNP at position 160,230,075 bp on SSC1 was significantly associated with multiple fat traits, including belly fat, butt fat, ham fat, loin fat, picnic fat, and side fat. Common genes in windows associated with multiple traits, such as MC4R, RNF152, and CDH20 were shared across these traits, suggesting pleiotropic effects. Some of the QTLs were near previously identified QTLs or candidate genes that have been reported to be linked to meat quality traits associated with backfat and intramuscular fat. Other candidate genes identified in the study include TNFRSF11A, LEPR, and genes from the SERPINB family, highlighting their roles in fat deposition and composition. Additional candidate genes were also implicated in regulation of fat metabolism, adipogenesis, and adiposity. These findings offer valuable insights into the genetic architecture of fat traits in pigs, which could inform breeding strategies aimed at improving the pork quality.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to better understand the ecological niche of the Italian hare, we evaluated the diet selection of the species in two protected areas of the Latium coastal environment. The main results emerging from our study were: the wide feeding spectrum of the Italian hare; the high incidence of grasses in dry and in wet season diets; the low number of plant species ingested at relatively high rates; the plastic feeding behaviour of this hare, as diet preferences changed with the variety and abundance of food species. These results highlighted the great adaptability of the species to different niches and the influence of the floristic composition on its feeding habits. In the Italian hare, the assessment of habitat suitability is of strategic importance for its conservation. In particular, feeding preferences of the species may lead to defining some food items as key plant species for identifying its elective habitat and, hence, planning effective re-introduction initiatives. This study was focused on the diet and feeding behaviour of Lepus corsicanus in two protected coastal areas of Latium, Castelporziano Presidential Estate (CPE) and Circeo National Park (CNP). Plant frequency was assessed by the quadrat method, while diet composition was determined by microhistological analysis of faecal samples. Over the year, the Italian hare fed on 185 of the 229 plant species identified in vegetation, with most of them ingested in low percentages (<= 1%). During the dry season (DS), in both areas, Brachypodium sylvaticum, Cynodon dactylon, and Avena fatua were among the most consumed species. In the wet season (WS) the most common plant species in diet were B. sylvaticum, Poa trivialis, and Carex distachya in CPE and Dactylis glomerata, Cynosurus echinatus, and Spartium junceum in CNP. In both sites, considering the annual selection of life forms, grasses and leguminous forbs were preferred, while non-leguminous forbs and shrubs were used less than expected according to their availability. ANOSIM analysis showed significant differences between sites in DS and WS diets. Our study evidenced that the Italian hare behaved as generalist, revealing its capability for exploiting several plant species and to adapt its diet preferences to space-time variation of food availability.

AB  - Revealing carved parts in rock art is of primary importance and remains a major challenge for archaeo-logical documentation. Computational geometry applied to 3D imaging provides a unique opportunity to document rock art. This study evaluates five algorithms and derivatives used to compute ambient occlu-sion and sky visibility on 3D models of Mongolian stelae, also known as deer stones. By contrast with the previous companion work, models are processed directly in 3D, without preliminary projection. Vol-umetric obscurance gives the best results for the identification of carved figures. The effects of model resolution and parameters specific to ambient occlusion are then evaluated. Keeping tridimensional information intact allows accurate measurement of distance, volume, and depth. Objects augmented by ambient occlusion can easily be manipulated in 3D viewers, for seamless and effortless access to the overall organization of the figures, at the scale of the entire object. Qualitatively speaking, the 2D projected outputs are equivalent to, or even better than, existing archaeological documentation. The proposed workflow should be easily applicable in many situations, particularly as the functions provided for the free R programming software are fully configurable. (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Due to its agroecological characteristics, more than 24 species of agave have been developed and cultivated in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, which have been fully exploited for the production of mezcal, an activity of economic importance. This crop is affected by the incidence of Strategus aloeus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an insect that causes damage and losses of economic importance to agave plants less than 3 years of age, for its control systemic insecticides are used; however, due to the habits of the insect, biological control is an alter-native for its management. In this study, losses and damage caused by adults of S. aloeus on Agave potatorum Zucc. and A. angustifolia Haw. were determined from field observations. In the laboratory, two entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii (formerly known as M. anisopliae), were evaluated at a concentration of 1X107 conidia/insect in vegetable oil emulsions (Persea americana, Ricinus communis, and Prunus dulcis) at two concentrations of 20 % and 40 %. The damage found for A. potatorum with a sample size of 85 plants evaluated was 79.90 %. For A. angustifolia, with the same number of plants, 65.86 % damage was found. The losses found in 85 plants of A. angustifolia with damage grades 4 and 5 were 1 794.9 and 2 227.5 g/plant and for A. potatorum with damage grades 4 and 5 were 1 631.9 and 2 119.7 g/plant. In the laboratory, 48 hours were needed for 10 0% effectiveness on S. aloeus adults with the treatments B. bassiana + P. americana 40 % and B. bassiana + P. dulcis 40 %.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of Dendrobium Officinale Polysaccharide (DOP, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 %, w/ v) on the gel characteristics of heat-induced polymerized whey protein (PWP). The potential application of the PWP-DOP gel in goat milk yogurt was also evaluated. The results indicated that the average particle size, absolute zeta potential, and viscosity of the PWP-DOP gel went up with higher DOP concentrations. The endothermic peak of PWP shifted from 81.03 degrees C to 95.89 degrees C in Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve, which suggested that DOP enhanced the thermal stability of the PWP-DOP gel. The addition of 1.5 % DOP caused a more compact, uniform, and stable network structure of PWP-DOP gel. Synchronous rheology and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR-IR) spectra traced the structural changes with new peaks at 1559.11 cm-1, 1443.85 cm-1, 1380.25 cm-1, 1242.64 cm-1, and 1155.10 cm-1 during the formation of the gel. PWP combined with DOP by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions confirmed by Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) and molecular docking. Moreover, the particle size, dehydration shrinkage, and viscosity of goat milk yogurt were enhanced by PWP-DOP. This study gives a foundation of theory for using PWP-DOP gels in the dairy industry.

AB  - This study evaluates the sustained antidepressant-like effects and neurogenic potential of a 3-day intranasal co-administration regimen of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) agonist M1145 and neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor (NPY1R) agonist [Leu31, Pro34]NPY in the ventral hippocampus of adult rats, with outcomes analyzed 3 weeks post-treatment. Utilizing the forced swimming test (FST), we found that this co-administration significantly enhances antidepressant-like behaviors, an effect neutralized by the GALR2 antagonist M871, highlighting the synergistic potential of these neuropeptides in modulating mood-related behaviors. In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) indicated a significant increase in GALR2/NPYY1R heteroreceptor complexes in the ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus, suggesting a molecular basis for the behavioral outcomes observed. Moreover, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunolabeling revealed increased cell proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, specifically in neuroblasts as evidenced by co-labeling with doublecortin (DCX), without affecting quiescent neural progenitors or astrocytes. The study also noted a significant uptick in the number of DCX-positive cells and alterations in dendritic morphology in the ventral hippocampus, indicative of enhanced neuronal differentiation and maturation. These morphological changes highlight the potential of these agonists to facilitate the functional integration of new neurons into existing neural circuits. By demonstrating the long-lasting effects of a brief, 3-day intranasal administration of GALR2 and NPY1R agonists, our findings contribute significantly to the understanding of neuropeptide-mediated neuroplasticity and herald novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of depression and related mood disorders, emphasizing the therapeutic promise of targeting neurogenesis and neuronal maturation processes.

AB  - Simple Summary Legal regulations at European and national level create the basis for the protection of animals. A certificate of competence is obligatory when animals intended for human consumption are handled or slaughtered. Within the project "eSchulTS2", e-learning training courses for employees of transport companies and abattoirs were developed to the improve animal welfare of pigs during transport and slaughter. This study was to assess the impact on the respective knowledge of employee groups with different educational level and background at one pig abattoir in Germany and to pre-evaluate the innovative and low-barrier didactical concept of the e-learning training courses. By using questions of knowledge, it was shown that more questions of knowledge were answered correctly after conducting the courses. Together with interactions shown by further statistical methods, this pre-evaluation showed that with the underlying didactical concept, an increase in knowledge was achieved.Abstract In addition to the information on the possession of a certificate of competence, there are no concrete obligations for repetitive training for personnel handling live animals at transport and slaughter. Deficiencies in the animal-welfare-friendly handling of pigs are known. The developed pilot modules "Handling of pigs" and "Electrical stunning" were tested in a pretest-posttest study in German and Romanian using questions of knowledge before and after the implementation of the modules. In this study, 45 and 46 datasets of participants could be analyzed. The mean percentages of correctly answered questions in the posttest increased by 5.6% in the module "Handling of pigs" and by 10.6% in the module "Electrical stunning". A significant interaction was found for the language match and trend categories in the module "Handling of pigs". No Romanian native speaker had a positive trend in this module. For both modules separately, participant education level significantly interacted with the language match and the presence or absence of a certificate of competence. Comparing the percentages of the correct given answers, significant interactions in the subgroups were more common in the module "Electrical stunning". One question in "Electrical stunning" was correctly answered significantly more often in the posttest. Because of the positive mean trends of knowledge within this pre-evaluation, we assume the didactical concept was suitable for our target groups. Holders of a certificate of competence also gave more correct answers in the post-test. This underlines the importance of repetitive training. Differences in the trends of knowledge gain seem to be topic and experience related.

AB  - Introduction: Prenatal infections are associated with an increased risk of the onset of schizophrenia. Rodent models of maternal immune stimulation (MIS) have been extensively used in preclinical studies. However, many of these studies only include males, omitting pathophysiological features unique to females. The aim of this study is to characterize the MIS model in female rats using positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MR), and neuroplasticiy studies.Methods: In gestational day 15, Poly I:C (or Saline) was injected into pregnant Wistar rats to induce the MIS model. Imaging studies: [F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET scans of female-offspring were acquired at post-natal day (PND) 35 and PND100. Furthermore, T2-MR brain images were acquired in adulthood. Differences in FDG uptake and morphometry between groups were assessed with SPM12 and Regions of Interest (ROI) analyses. Ex vivo study: The density of parvalbumin expressing interneurons (PV), perineuronal nets (PNN), and parvalbumin expressing interneurons surrounded by perineuronal nets (PV-PNN) were evaluated in the prelimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala using confocal microscopy. ROIs and neuroplasticity data were analyzed by 2-sample T-test and 2-way-ANOVA analyses, respectively.Results: A significant increase in brain metabolism was found in all animals at adulthood compared to adolescence. MIS hardly modified brain glucose metabolism in females, highlighting a significant hypometabolism in the thalamus at adulthood. In addition, MIS induced gray matter (GM) enlargements in the pituitary, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and cingulate cortex, and GM shrinkages in some thalamic nuclei, cerebelar areas, and brainstem. Moreover, MIS induced white matter shrinkages in the cerebellum, brainstem and corpus callosum, along with cerebrospinal fluid enlargements in the lateral and 4th ventricles. Finally, MIS reduced the density of PV, PNN, and PV-PNN in the basolateral amygdala.Conclusion: Our work showed in vivo the differential pattern of functional and morphometric affectation in the MIS model in females, as well as the deficits caused at the synaptic level according to sex. The differences obtained highlight the relevance of including both sexes in psychiatric research in order to consider their pathophysiological particularities and successfully extend the benefits obtained to the entire patient population.

AB  - Simple Summary As payment systems currently do not reflect the quality of raw milk intended for cheesemaking, the industry demands tools to estimate an economical value of milk based on its performance during the coagulation process. This study develops algorithms that aim to improve the overall efficiency of the cheese sector through a more adequate connection between the demands of the industry and the technological profiles of raw milk, as well as to establish an objective method to set prices, which particularly consider the usefulness of milk to make cheese. Taking into account that the few studies available on this topic only focus on fresh cheese yield, we also evaluated the moisture of the curd, which led to an algorithm based on dry extract, which is more suitable considering the wide range of cheeses available in the market, and thus, better adjusts to the reality of the industry. Understanding the factors that determine and regulate cheese yield would allow, through deterministic parametric efficiency models, the determination of the most appropriate milk characteristics for the industry, and the estimation of a technological value for these characteristics. The present study aims to evaluate coagulation performance of Manchega sheep milk intended for cheesemaking and explores two models to determine milk technological efficiency. For this purpose, 1200 Manchega sheep milk samples were collected, and analyses were performed for composition, milk coagulation properties (MCP), somatic cell count (SCC), and milk color values. A first model was built based on curd yield (CE) and a second one based on dry curd yield (DCE). GLM and MANCOVA analyses were used to identify the factors that determine curd yield efficiency, which mainly depended on pH, casein, and lactose content and, to a lesser extent, on the speed of coagulation and curd firmness. When comparing both models, differences were linked to the water retention capacity of the curd. Based on this, the DCE model was considered much more accurate for prediction of coagulation efficiency in a wider variety of cheeses, as it does not seem to be affected by moisture loss.

AB  - This study systematically investigated the effects of dietary tea polyphenols (TPs, major bioactive polyphenols from Camellia sinensis with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties) on the growth performance and intestinal health of hybrid crucian carp HCC2 under chronic crowding stress. A low-density control group (44.4 fish/m3, basal diet without TPs) and four high-density crowding stress groups (222.2 fish/m3) were established, one fed the basal diet without TPs (CS) and three fed basal diets supplemented with 100 (CSLTP), 200 (CSMTP), or 400 (CSHTP) mg/kg TPs. We analyzed the impacts of TPs on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, antioxidant capacity, expression of lipid metabolism-related genes, and intestinal microbiota composition. The results demonstrated that chronic crowding stress significantly suppressed the final body weight, weight gain rate, and specific growth rate of HCC2, while increasing serum lactate LDH, TG, and ALB and decreasing GLU, LDL-C, ALT, AST, and ALP levels. Dietary TPs supplementation enhanced antioxidant capacity (T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH) and alleviated lipid metabolic disorders by activating the Nrf2/Keap1 and PPAR alpha signaling pathways, thereby upregulating the expression of liver antioxidant genes (CAT and SOD) and fatty acid oxidation genes (CPT1 and acox1). Furthermore, intestinal microbiota analysis revealed that chronic crowding stress significantly increased the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased the proportion of Firmicutes compared to the low-density control. Dietary TPs intervention, particularly at higher doses, partially restored the Firmicutes abundance and reduced the enrichment of potential pathogenic bacteria associated with stress. This study is the first to comprehensively elucidate the mechanism by which TPs alleviate crowding stress through enhanced antioxidant capacity, metabolic regulation, and microbiota remodeling, providing robust theoretical support for the application of plant-based additives in aquaculture.

AB  - Thyme has strong antioxidant properties and, therefore, can reduce the intensity of oxidative processes taking place in the body. The study aimed to assess whether the addition of thyme to diets for fattening pigs containing extruded flaxseeds, a source of n-3 PUFAs, which are particularly susceptible to oxidation, would have a positive effect on redox status and lipid metabolism. The experiment was conducted using 120 weaners (WBP x Neckar crosses) of about 30 kg BW, which were kept until the end of fattening (about 110 kg BW) and divided into three groups of 40 pigs. The control group received a diet with 4% extruded flaxseed. In groups T1 and T3, 1% or 3% of thyme was added to the basal diet. The introduction of 3% thyme resulted in a decrease in the total cholesterol level in the blood and the loin muscle. Moreover, an increase in SOD and CAT activity and a decrease in FRAP and LOOH was noted. Following supplementation with 3% thyme, the n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 ratio increased, while the SFA content was significantly reduced. The results of the studies indicate that thyme has a positive effect on the redox status and lipid profile of the blood and muscles.

AB  - Plant-mediated RNA interference (RNAi), in which double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeting insect genes are expressed in plants for insect ingestion, has shown great potential for the control of herbivorous insect pests. Locusts, which are among the most destructive agricultural insect pests, appear to be resistant to orally delivered naked dsRNA. Moreover, the feasibility of using plant-mediated RNAi to suppress target gene expression in locusts remains unclear. Using the migratory locust Locusta migratoria, we report that the C-type muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR-C), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) belonging to the bioamine receptor subfamily, plays a pivotal role in chitin metabolism by regulating genes responsible for chitin synthesis and degradation. Knockdown of locust mAChR-C via injection of dsRNA caused defective nymph molting and metamorphosis, accompanied by malformation, arrested development, and impaired motility. Notably, locusts fed transgenic maize expressing locust mAChR-C dsRNAs exhibited defective phenotypes similar to those subjected to mAChR-C dsRNA injection. In contrast, ingestion of transgenic maize expressing locust mAChR-C dsRNA had no significant effects on non-target insects, including the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda, the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera, the Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis, and the oriental armyworm Mythimna separata. Our results suggest that transgenic expression of locust mAChR-C dsRNA is an effective RNAi approach for locust control and offers a promising eco-friendly strategy for locust management.

AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) is a hazardous substance that has unique neurodevelopmental toxic effects. However, its molecular alteration profile, sensitive response biomarkers, and mechanism of neuronal injury remain largely unknown. Here, the effects of intrauterine methylmercury chloride (low-, medium-and high-dose groups: 0.6 mg/kg/d, 1.2 mg/kg/d, 2.4 mg/ kg /d, respectively) exposure on learning and memory were assessed in offspring rats by behavioral tests, pathological analysis and hippocampal proteomic analysis. The results suggested that intrauterine MeHg exposure impairs spatial learning and memory and leads a significant reduction in the number and dispersion scattered arrangement in the hippocampus of offspring. Furthermore, in the tandem mass tag-based proteomics analysis, compared with the control group, a total of 74 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found in the MeHg exposure groups; specifically, 32 down-regulated and 42 up-regulated proteins were identified. In addition, the pathways enrichment analysis indicated that these DEPs are implicated in several biological processes, such as synaptic plasticity and energy metabolism, as well as various molecular functional categories. Simultaneously, MeHg reduced the postsynaptic density, diminished the active zone, amplified the synaptic cleft and changed the synaptic interface of pyramidal cells. Western blot analysis further revealed that MeHg significantly reduced the levels of Forkhead box protein (FOXP2), Synaptophysin (SYP) and Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and down-regulated the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2 A (NR2A) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B (NR2B). In general, from a functional perspective, most overlapping proteins were related to NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic signaling, which is an excitotoxicity mechanism known to influence learning and memory. These discoveries contribute to our understanding of the relationship between MeHg and cognitive deficits and provide insight into the protein mediators of this relationship and possible prospective early biomarkers.

AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) is the leading cause of death by poisoning worldwide. The aim was to explore the effects of mild and severe poisoning on blood gas parameters and metabolites. Eleven pigs were exposed to CO intoxication and had blood collected before and during poisoning. Mild CO poisoning (carboxyhaemoglobin, COHb 35.2 +/- 7.9%) was achieved at 32 +/- 13 minutes, and severe poisoning (69.3 +/- 10.2% COHb) at 64 +/- 23 minutes from baseline (2.9 +/- 0.5% COHb). Blood gas parameters and metabolites were measured on a blood gas analyser and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, respectively. Unsupervised principal component, analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation tests were applied. A P-value <= .05 was considered statistically significant. Mild poisoning resulted in a 28.4% drop in oxyhaemoglobin (OHb) and 12-fold increase in COHb, while severe poisoning in a 65% drop in OHb and 24-fold increase in COHb. Among others, metabolites implicated in regulation of metabolic acidosis (lactate, P < .0001), energy balance (pyruvate, P < .0001; 3-hydroxybutyrc acid, P = .01), respiration (citrate, P = .007; succinate, P = .0003; fumarate, P < .0001), lipid metabolism (glycerol, P = .002; choline, P = .0002) and antioxidant-oxidant balance (glutathione, P = .03; hypoxanthine, P < .0001) were altered, especially during severe poisoning. Our study adds new insights into the deranged metabolism of CO poisoning and leads the way for further investigation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The dried fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (S. chinensis) is widely used in treating central nervous system disorders. Increasing evidence has suggested that alcohol-soluble extracts and lignans from S. chinensis could significantly ameliorate depression-like behaviors in animal models, while there was little research on the potential of alcohol-insoluble polysaccharides as a candidate in the treatment of depression.Aim of the study: Our research was designed to explore both the physicochemical characteristics and antidepressant-like effects of an alcohol-insoluble polysaccharide-rich fraction named SCP from S. chinensis. Simultaneously, the underlying mechanisms were elucidated in the study.Materials and methods: The physicochemical characteristics were accomplished by colorimetric assays, CE, HPGPC, and FT-IR. Behavioral despair testing accompanied by LAT were processed to promptly assess the antidepressant-like effects of SCP in mice. Then OBX-induced mice were established to explore the impacts of chronic co-treatments with SCP. Furthermore, effects of SCP on the HPA axis, oxidant/antioxidant system, neurotrophic and synaptic factors, and gut microbiota in OBX-induced mice were detected through ELISA and 16S rDNA (V3 + V4 regions) gene sequencing.Results: SCP is a polysaccharide-rich fraction mainly comprised of xylose, glucose, rhamnose, galactose, mannose, and galacturonic acid in ratios of 0.27, 5.09, 0.24, 1.00, 0.63, and 2.86, of which the MW distribution ranges from 681 to 3232 Da. Acute pre-treatment with SCP (200 mg/kg, i.g.) remarkably reduced mice's immobility in the FST without motor stimulation. Prolonged pre-treatments effectively enhanced the effects of SCP on the behavioral despair testing in mice. Chronic co-treatments with SCP (50, 200, and 800 mg/kg, i.g.) could ameliorate the slow increase of body weight and behavioral abnormality of OBX-induced mice in systemic behavioral testing. SCP (200 mg/kg) also successfully restored hyperactivity of the HPA axis, oxidative damage in the liver, neurotrophic disturbance and abnormal synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, and dysregulation of gut microbiota in OBX-induced mice.Conclusion: SCP exerts noteworthy antidepressant-like impacts on behavioral despair mice and OBX-induced mice via multiple targets, indicating a potential therapeutic candidate in depression therapy.

AB  - When herbivores feed, plants may respond by altering the quantity of edible biomass available to future feeders through mechanisms such as compensatory regrowth of edible structures or allocation of biomass to inedible reserves. Previous work showed that some forms of compensatory regrowth can drive insect outbreaks, but this work assumed regrowth occurred without any energetic cost to the plant. While this is a useful simplifying assumption for gaining preliminary insights, plants face an inherent trade-off between allocating energy to regrowth versus storage. Therefore, we cannot truly understand the role of compensatory regrowth in driving insect outbreaks without continuing on to more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we model the interaction between insect herbivores and plants that have a trade-off between compensatory regrowth and allocation to inedible reserves in response to herbivory. We found that the plant's allocation strategy, described in our model by parameters representing the strength of the overcompensatory response and the rates at which energy is stored and mobilized for growth, strongly affects whether herbivore outbreaks occur. Additional factors, such as the strength of food limitation and herbivore interference while feeding, influence the frequency of the outbreaks. Overall, we found a possible new role of overcompensation to promote herbivore fluctuations when it co-occurs with allocation to inedible reserves. We highlight the importance of considering trade-offs between tolerance mechanisms that plants use in response to herbivory by showing that new dynamics arise when different plant allocation strategies occur simultaneously.

AB  - Fetal growth restriction (FGR) significantly contributes to neonatal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no effective treatment options for FGR during pregnancy. We have developed a nanoparticle gene therapy targeting the placenta to increase expression of human insulin-like growth factor 1 (hIGF1) to correct fetal growth trajectories. Using the maternal nutrient restriction guinea pig model of FGR, an ultrasound-guided, intraplacental injection of nonviral, polymer-based hIGF1 nanoparticle containing plasmid with the hIGF1 gene and placenta-specific Cyp19a1 promotor was administered at mid-pregnancy. Sustained hIGF1 expression was confirmed in the placenta 5 days after treatment. Whilst increased hIGF1 did not change fetal weight, circulating fetal glucose concentration were 33%-67% higher. This was associated with increased expression of glucose and amino acid transporters in the placenta. Additionally, hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment increased the fetal capillary volume density in the placenta, and reduced interhaemal distance between maternal and fetal circulation. Overall, our findings, that trophoblast-specific increased expression of hIGF1 results in changes to glucose transporter expression and increases fetal glucose concentrations within a short time period, highlights the translational potential this treatment could have in correcting impaired placental nutrient transport in human pregnancies complicated by FGR.

AB  - BackgroundThe demethylase fat mass and obesity-related associated protein (FTO) is strongly associated with depression. Aging is a risk factor for synaptic plasticity damage in the brain and leads to neurocognitive dysfunctions. FTO-dependent m6A modification plays an important role in neurodevelopment and cognitive function. However, whether FTO is associated with susceptibility to depression in different age groups remains unknown.MethodsWe subjected 3-and 12-month-old C57BL/6J male mice to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 6 weeks, of which 3 weeks were used for hippocampal injection of FTO knockdown adeno-associated virus 9 shRNA (FTO-KD AAV9). Finally, 36 male mice in each 3-month-old and 12-month-old groups were divided into three groups (n = 12): Sham, CUMS, and FTO-KD. After 6 weeks, we assessed behavioral deficits (depressive and anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment) by behavioral tests and hippocampal neuronal damage (dendritic spine density, neuronal atrophy, and expression of proteins associated with synaptic plasticity) by molecular biochemical experiments.ResultsThe results showed that 12-month-old C57BL/6J mice were more likely to develop depression-like behavior and spatial learning and memory impairment induced by CUMS than 3-month-old mice. Chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior and cognitive impairment worsened after the FTO-KD intervention. In the hippocampus of 3- and 12-month-old mice, CUMS induced the downregulation of FTO, nerve growth factor (NGF), reelin, and synaptic plasticity-related proteins. It also caused abnormal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)- the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) signaling, reduced density of dendritic spines, and an increased number of neuronal pyknotic nuclei, leading to neuronal disarray, which was more significant in 12-month-old animals. FTO deficiency accelerated neuronal damage in the hippocampus of 12-month-old CUMS mice.ConclusionsThis study provides rodent evidence that FTO deficiency may increase the susceptibility to depression in older adults by impairing hippocampal neuronal function and neuronal synaptic plasticity in an age-dependent manner. This suggests that the development of FTO activators may be an effective treatment for depression in older adults.

AB  - Genomic prediction is a crucial technique for phenotype estimation, with the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) being the most widely adopted method. Yet, GBLUP falls short in capturing the intricate nonlinear relationships between genomic data and phenotypes. Given its ability to more effectively capture nonlinear genetic effects, machine learning (ML) has become increasingly appealing in genomic prediction. However, almost GBLUP and ML methods utilize all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data for prediction, ignoring the fact that only a subset of SNPs are effective. This not only consumes computation time but also has poor prediction accuracy. So, this paper proposed a mutual information stacking method (MISM). Firstly, mutual information was introduced to select the SNPs with effect and remove the redundant SNPs. Then, we constructed a stacking model that can capture both linear and nonlinear relationships between SNPs and phenotypes to improve the prediction accuracy. To assess the effectiveness of MISM, we compared its performance on pig growth traits with GBLUP and other ML methods. The statistical analysis results indicated that MISM outperformed other ML models and GBLUP.

AB  - Phthalate exposure is linked to asthma and allergic symptoms, yet their individual and combined effects on symptoms and inflammatory biomarkers, type 2 (T2) and non-T2, remain unexplored. This study examined the association of phthalate metabolites with allergic symptoms (wheeze, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema), T2 biomarker (fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophil count, and total immunoglobulin E (IgE)), and non-T2 biomarker (absolute neutrophil count (ANC)) and also their association with oxidative stress biomarkers, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, hexanoyl-lysine, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine. Ten urinary phthalate metabolites were measured using UPLC-MS/MS in 421 children (aged 9-12 years) from The Hokkaido Cohort, Japan. Symptoms were defined using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire, and biomarkers were measured in blood. Logistic regression assessed individual metabolites, while quantile-g computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression analyzed mixture effects on binary outcomes. Individual analysis showed that MnBP (mono-n-butyl phthalate) was positively associated with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and eosinophil >= 300 cells/mu L, while & sum;DBP (dibutyl phthalate) and OH-MiNP (mono-hydroxy-isononyl phthalate) were linked with FeNO >= 35 ppb. DEHP (di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) metabolites were associated with a high prevalence of blood eosinophils >= 300 cells/mu L. We found a positive association between phthalates and oxidative stress markers, but no link was observed between oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Mixture analysis identified MnBP as a major contributor to the high FeNO level, with di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and DEHP metabolites contributing to eosinophil count >= 300 cells/mu L and ANC >= 4400 cells/mu L. These findings suggest that phthalate exposure from DnBP and DEHP is associated with immune dysregulation by triggering both T2 and non-T2 inflammatory responses.

AB  - Despite its robust proteopathic nature, the spatiotemporal signature of disrupted protein modules in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains remains poorly understood. This considered oxidative stress contributes to AD progression and early intervention with coenzyme Q10 or its reduced form, ubiquinol, delays the progression of the disease. Using MALDI-MSI and functional bioinformatic analysis, we have developed a protocol to express how deregulated protein modules arise from hippocampus and cortex in the AD mice model 3xTG-AD in an age-dependent manner. This strategy allowed us to identify which modules can be efficiently restored to a non-pathological condition by early intervention with ubiquinol. Indeed, an early deregulation of proteostasis-related protein modules, oxidative stress and metabolism has been observed in the hippocampus of 6-month mice (early AD) and the mirrored in cortical regions of 12-month mice (middle/late AD). This observation has been validated by IHC using mouse and human brain sections, suggesting that these protein modules are also affected in humans. The emergence of disrupted protein modules with AD signature can be prevented by early dietary intervention with ubiquinol in the 3xTG-AD mice model.

AB  - Simple Summary Diarrhea in newborn piglets is one of the important problems for the agricultural industry. It is believed that this disease is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome. The present work is aimed at studying the composition of the microbiome of newborn piglets with diarrhea in order to identify relevant markers of the disease. Our comprehensive microbiome study did not reveal bacterial and eukaryotic aberrations in the fecal microbiome of diarrheal piglets; at the same time, we observed higher levels of bacterial diversity, which may be associated with dysbacteriosis and inflammation. In the observation group, an increase in the abundance of Bacteroides B40-8 phage was also recorded, and in the healthy group, an increase in the abundance of Escherichia virus BP4. Thus, the results of our study show the ambiguity of the previously proposed relationship between the bacterial community of the fecal microbiome of suckling piglets and the development of diarrhea, and also indicate the need for further research in this area. Diarrhea in piglets is one of the most common diseases leading to high mortality and, as a result, to economic losses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on the DNBSEQ-G50, MGI system to study the role of the fecal microbiome in the development of diarrhea in newborn piglets. Analysis of the study data showed that the composition of the fecal microbiome at the level of bacteria and fungi did not differ in piglets with diarrhea from the healthy group. Bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria were the most abundant. However, a higher level of bacterial alpha diversity was observed in the group of piglets with diarrhea, which may be due to dysbacteriosis and inflammation. The study of the virome showed the difference between the two types of phages: Bacteroides B40-8 prevailed in diseased piglets, while Escherichia virus BP4 was found in greater numbers in healthy piglets. The results of our study suggest that the association between the fecal microbiome and susceptibility to diarrhea in suckling piglets may have been previously overestimated.

AB  - The scarcity of freshwater in many countries, the excessive production of wastewater, and the high demand for water for agriculture have been responsible for the implementation of wastewater for agricultural irrigation, thus achieving environmental benefits. The purpose of this research is to take advantage of wastewater generated in the production of microalgae and to analyze its impact on the growth and development of Pelargonium x hortorum, thus seeking to promote the reuse of resources and explore sustainable alternatives in agriculture. Two sources of wastewater were used for microalgae production (wastewater from the University of Almeria and slurry from a pig farm). The treatments used were: Control = (Tap water irrigation), Input-WW = (Irrigation with black water, inlet of the reactor) this wastewater was collected from Almeria University used at the beginning of microalgae production in the bioreactors, Outlet-WW = (Irrigation with black water, outlet of the reactor) - this is the wastewater collected after being treated with microalgae in the bioreactors, Input-WP = (Irrigation with slurry, inlet of the reactor) - this is the slurry that was used at the beginning of microalgae production in the bioreactors, Outlet-WP = (Irrigation with slurry, outlet of the reactor) are the purified slurry waters once they have been used for the production of microalgae in the bioreactors. The use of Outlet-WW has an adverse impact on plant diameter and number of flowers compared to the Control, which affected flower dry weight. The other biometric measurement parameters were not influenced. The WP wastewater showed elevated concentrations of nitrogen and potassium (N, K). On the other hand, the WW wastewater showed an elevated concentration of nitrogen, but also a high electrical conductivity (EC). This study concluded that the Outlet-WP treatment had no significant differences in dry weights compared to the Control treatment, but there was a significant reduction in the height and diameter of the plants as well as in the color of the leaves. This wastewater can be a source of nutrients for crop growth as well as a water source, but further research studies are necessary to determine the best way to apply it.

AB  - Early detection and timely intervention of isolated piglet outliers are crucial in promptly identifying potential illnesses and ensuring animal welfare. This study proposes a comprehensive framework, Multi-Object Tracking Isolated Outlier Detection (MOTIOD), to identify persistent isolated piglet outliers in complex pig farm environments. The framework consists of a multi-object tracking (MOT) module and an outlier detection module. The MOT module, employing a transformer-based TransTrack approach, develops dark region-adaptive IoU (Intersection over Union) matching strategy and piglet ID constraint allocation strategy to address common challenges in pig farms, such as variable lighting conditions and occlusions. The outlier detection module presents a novel Spatiotemporal Dynamics-Based Outlier Detection (SD-OD) algorithm, which considers the duration of isolated outlier behaviour and the spatial information of piglet interactions with their sow and littermates. Experimental results validate the MOTIOD framework demonstrates significant performance in low visibility continuous tracking, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as Yolov5s+DeepSORT and CenterTrack with a MOTA of 98.8 % and an IDF1 of 99.0 %, and effectively identifies isolated outliers with a 92.9 % precision rate in outlier detection. This research introduces a valuable approach for the early identification of potential health risks in piglets, enhancing the proactive management of livestock health, and potentially contributing to the sustainable advancement of precision livestock farming.

AB  - The development of multi-omics has increased the likelihood of further improving genomic prediction (GP) of complex traits. Gene expression data can directly reflect the genotype effect, and thus, they are widely used for GP. Generally, the gene expression data are integrated into multiple random effect models as independent data layers or used to replace genotype data for genomic prediction. In this study, we integrated pedigree, genotype, and gene expression data into the single-step method and investigated the effects of this integration on prediction accuracy. The integrated single-step method improved the genomic prediction accuracy of more than 90% of the 54 traits in the Duroc x Erhualian F2 pig population dataset. On average, the prediction accuracy of the single-step method integrating gene expression data was 20.6% and 11.8% higher than that of the pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (ABLUP) and genome-based best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) when the weighting factor (w) was set as 0, and it was 5.3% higher than that of the single-step best linear unbiased prediction (ssBLUP) under different w values. Overall, the analyses confirmed that the integration of gene expression data into a single-step method could effectively improve genomic prediction accuracy. Our findings enrich the application of multi-omics data to genomic prediction and provide a valuable reference for integrating multi-omics data into the genomic prediction model.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint condition leading to disability. The lack of effective treatment for OA creates a need for the development of new therapeutic approaches that may rely on stem cells including mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and their derivatives such as extracellular vesicles (EVs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of MSCs derived from adipose tissue (AT-MSCs) and umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) and their EVs on cartilage-bone injury in vivo, to identify the specimen with the highest regenerative potential for further clinical applications in patients with OA. Humanized pigs underwent cartilage-bone injuries followed by intraarticular administration of products containing AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, AT-MSC-EVs or UC-MSC-EVs mixed with hyaluronic acid (HA) or HA alone (for comparison). After 6-m follow-up, almost-fully-healed cartilage-bone defects were observed in the AT-MSC- and UC-MSC-treated pigs, and the defects were filled primarily with hyaline cartilage. In AT-MSC-EV- and UC-MSC-EV-treated pigs, a partial cartilage-bone tissue repair was observed, and the defects were filled primarily with fibrocartilage. The control pigs demonstrated limited regeneration capacity. The microcomputed tomography parameters of the subchondral bone indicated the ongoing progression of OA in controls, whereas in the MSC- and MSC-EV-treated pigs, the parameters indicated the cessation of OA progression. Moreover, no serious side effects were observed after the administration of products containing MSCs or MSC-EVs. The results indicate the safety and regenerative activity of MSCs on injured tissues, which favors not only the healing and improvement of bone structure but also the formation of hyaline cartilage. Superior tissue repair was observed after the administration of products containing AT-MSCs. The treatment of OA with MSC-EVs needs further standardization.

Current treatments are limited, emphasizing the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. This research explored the combined effects of intranasally co-administered galanin receptor 2 (GALR2) and neuropeptide Y1 receptor (NPY1R) agonists, recognized for their neural benefits, on spatial memory, neuronal survival, and differentiation in adult rats. After intranasal co-delivery of the GALR2 agonist M1145 and a NPY1R agonist to adult rats, spatial memory was tested with the object-in-place task 3 weeks later. We examined neuronal survival and differentiation by assessing BrdU-IR profiles and doublecortin (DCX) labeled cells, respectively. We also used the GALR2 antagonist M871 to confirm GALR2's crucial role in promoting cell growth.Background Spatial memory deficits and reduced neuronal survival contribute to cognitive decline seen in the aging process.

The positive effect of GALR2 in cell proliferation was confirmed by the nullifying effects of its antagonist. The treatment boosted DCX-labeled newborn neurons and altered dendritic morphology, increasing cells with mature dendrites.Conclusions Our results show that intranasal co-delivery of GALR2 and NPY1R agonists improves spatial memory, boosts neuronal survival, and influences neuronal differentiation in adult rats. The significant role of GALR2 is emphasized, suggesting new potential therapeutic strategies for cognitive decline.

AB  - This study represents an important contribution to the structural, histochemical and biological understanding of ducts and cavities in leaves of four species of Calophyllaceae that occur in Amazonian savannas. Samples of adult leaves were processed using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as per usual methods for plant anatomy. In paradermal sections, the lumina of ducts are elongated while those of cavities are short. Ducts occur exclusively in the central rib and are abundant in Kielmeyera rubriflora Cambess and Kielmeyera coriacea Mart. and Zucc and larger than in Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess and Caraipa densifolia Mart. In mesophyll, the type of secretory structure and distribution pattern of the ducts and cavities are distinct. In most species, the secreted metabolites are similar and consist of phenolic compounds, lipids, essential oils with oleoresins, mucilage, neutral polysaccharides, proteins and alkaloids, except in K. coriacea, which does not contain oleoresin. The secretion is probably synthesized by mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes and dictyosomes and is externalized toward the lumen by granulocrine and eccrine processes. In addition to being of diagnostic value for species identification, the attributes of the lumen shape, type of secretory structure, distribution pattern, identified metabolites and secretion mechanism are important for understanding the biological roles of ducts and cavities. The identified metabolites reveal a capacity for adaptation, resistance and protection from the action of herbivores and pathogens, and in water retention.

AB  - The South American tomato pinworm (Tuta absoluta) is a major pest of tomatoes that causes drastic yield losses. Some wild tomato genotypes are constitutively resistant to T. absoluta, whereas most commercial genotypes are susceptible. However, exogenous salicylic acid (SA) application may induce resistance to this herbivore in tomatoes. Since herbivory also reduces crop production by affecting photosynthesis, chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) represents a powerful tool for identifying potential and easily addressed resistance indicators. Therefore, we compared the ChlF patterns of two commercial genotypes (Alambra and Reden & ccedil;& atilde;o) and one wild-resistant genotype (Solanum habrochaites var. hirsutum) treated with 540 mu M SA or water (control), correlating their ChlF pattern with feeding damages caused by T. absoluta. Our results showed that SA reduced the overall plant damage in Alambra at 7, 21, and 35 days after infestation (DAI), and the consumed leaf area in Reden & ccedil;& atilde;o and hirsutum 60 DAI. The ChlF analysis showed that SA increased the electron transfer rate (ETR), the regulated energy loss of PSII (Y-(NPQ)), the non-regulated energy loss (Y-(NO)), and reduced the efficiency of open PSII reaction centers (F'(v)/F'(m)) and photochemical quantum yield (Y-II) in all genotypes. F'(o), F'(m), and F'(v) of commercial genotypes were higher than in the wild genotype. Feeding damage was positively correlated with F'(o), F'(m), and F'(v), and negatively correlated with Y-(NO) and ETR. These results indicate that ETR and Y-(NO) might be useful for indicating salicylic acid-induced resistance against T. absoluta, while F'(o), F'(m), and F'(v) might indicate constitutive resistance

AB  - Feral swine (Sus scrofa) have extensive harmed private landowners throughout the southern United States, especially in the West Gulf Region. Managing feral swine on private land is becoming increasingly critical and challenging to reduce both ecological and economic damage. To better understand private landowners' experience and preferences for various feral swine management measures, we surveyed private landowners across the West Gulf Region (WGR) including Arkansas (AR), Louisiana (LA), and East Texas (ETX) in 2021. A total of 4500 surveys were mailed across the three states, with 2000 questionnaires sent in AR, 1500 in LA, and 1000 in ETX. Using descriptive analysis and principal components analysis (PCA), we analyzed private landowners' experiences and preferences in feral swine management across this region. The tesults revealed that most private landowners (>85%) in the region were familiar with feral swine, and over 80% of them had ever seen the intrusion of feral swine onto their properties. Regarding the potential management measures, these landowners strongly supported lethal control methods such as capture and kill; in addition, they expressed a strong desire to receive education on and technical assistance with controlling feral swine. These findings provide a better understanding of private landowners' familiarity and experiences with feral swine presence on their properties and their preference and support for various feral swine control measures, aiding in developing more effective feral swine management and control policies and programs in the West Gulf Region and beyond.

AB  - Since their introduction in Colombia in the '80s for Pablo Escobar's extravagant zoo, hippos have become an ecological problem around the basin of the Magdalena River. This article proposes an ecosemiotic discourse analysis of different visions of nature enacted by stakeholders and public opinion around the management of hippos in Colombia. Concretely, we focus on three particular discourses and visions of nature: animalista, narco-cultural, and conservacionista. In this article, we present the relevant social and ecological context of Colombia, the visions of nature theory and the impact of such visions on conservation measures regarding so-called invasive species; we describe and analyze the three visions of nature we center on, and present a computational analysis of discourse dynamics and controversies in Twitter between of such visions of nature; and we reflect on possible courses of action and recommendations about addressing the close interrelation of public discourses and ecosystem conservation by proposing an alternative view, based on the biosemiotic framework of semiocide, to the concept of invasive species.

AB  - Succinate is produced by both the host and microbiota with pleiotropic functions in the modulation of intestinal inflammation and metabolic homeostasis, but the mechanisms remain elusive. This study aimed to determine whether dietary succinate influences the intestinal inflammatory response and to analyze the possible mechanisms by which succinate regulates enterohepatic metabolism. Sixteen growing barrows were randomly assigned to two groups, fed with a basal diet that consisted of a typical commercial diet or fed with a basal diet supplemented with 1% sodium succinate. Our data showed that dietary succinate activated the expression of succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1) and increased the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the intestine. Dietary succinate inhibited the expression levels of the ileal Farnesol X receptor (FXR) and its target genes, promoted hepatic bile acid secretion, and altered the bile acid metabolic profile. Then, we demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered by succinate disrupted the ability of bile acids to activate FXR and fibroblast growth factor 19. Furthermore, dietary succinate reduced the abundance of bile-salt hydrolase enriched bacteria in the ileum. Taken together, dietary succinate activated the pro-inflammatory response via SUCNR1 in the intestine, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by succinate blocked the activation of FXR and its target genes and disturbed bile acid enterohepatic circulation.

AB  - Phthalate esters (PAEs), the most widely used plasticizers, are extensively present in various environmental media, and are continuously transported from land to sea. However, PAEs have not been well characterized in multiple media in mangrove wetlands, an important land-sea interface. This study investigated the distribution and transfer of six PAEs in water, sediment, mangroves, and fish in Dongzhai Harbor. The mangrove forest in Dongzhai Harbor is the largest in China and is surrounded by shrimp ponds and villages. PAEs arc ubiquitous in the study area. The mean concentration range of Sigma(6)PAEs was 031-1.52 mu g/L in water, 450-2096 mu g/kg dry weight (dw) in sediment, 210-937 mu g/kg dw in mangrove plants, and not detected (n.d.) -205 mu g/kg in fish. Among the six PAEs, di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-ethyihexyl phthalate (DEHP) were predominant. The concentrations of the PAEs in mangrove plants tended to decrease from the river and coast to tidal gullies, which might be related to the periodic inundation of tides. A study of PAEs bioaccumulation showed that the concentration of PAEs in herbivorous fish was higher than that in carnivorous fish. In the same species, larger individuals had a lower concentration of Sigma(6)PAEs. Di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP) and DEHP tended to transfer from water to sediments, while the four less-hydrophobic PAEs, such as DBP, were more likely to be released from sediments to water. Our results can provide important information of the distribution and fate of PAEs in mangrove wetlands. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mummified piglets are among the leading causes of fertility loss and severely hamper reproductive performance in pigs. However, the contributions of genomic variation to the emergence of mummified piglets (MUM) have rarely been studied. This study aims to (1) elucidate the genetic architecture of MUM in sows of parity 1 -3 using a single-step genome-wide association study (ssGWAS). The ssGWAS involved genotyping-by-sequencing of Large White and Landrace pig breeds. (2) Explore the biological role of the candidate genes at the cellular level. A total of 185 and 48 genome-wide significant SNPs are associated with MUM in Large White and Landrace pigs, explaining 0.01-36.52% genetic variance for different significant loci, respectively. All the significant SNPs are parity-specific, and the numerous, consecutive significant loci likely generated the nine significant peaks in different parities. Multiple candidate genes (including CYP24A1, FBXO30, and ARHGEF28) are associated with fetal congenital and maternal diseases. Collectively, CYP24A1 regulation contributes to steady-state levels of embryo development genes. CYP24A1 is involved in reproduction and, immune and gestational disorders. Thus, it is associated with known newborn death traits and MUM in Large White sows. Altogether, these results improve the current understanding of the genetic architecture of MUM and expand the knowledge on genetic variations for selecting against mummified piglets in pig breeding.

AB  - With allergic rhinitis (AR) on the rise globally, there has been a growing focus on the role of environmental pollutants in the onset of AR. However, the potential mechanisms by how and which these pollutants exacerbate AR conditions remain unknown. This panel study of 49 patients diagnosed with AR over one year aimed to assess the individual and combined effects of short-term exposure to multiple ambient pollutants on oxidative stress, symptoms, and quality of life among patients with AR. All participants underwent four repeated assessments of health conditions and personal environmental exposures (PM2.5, O3, SO2, and NO2) over warm and cold seasons during 2017-2018. We evaluated two oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde [MDA], and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) via nasal lavage. We collected information on self -reported symptoms , quality of life using the Rhinitis Symptom Scale (SRS), the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) , the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) through in -person interviews. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was used to evaluate the joint effects of pollutant mixture and identify key contributors. The results revealed a significant association of the pollutant mixture when all four pollutants were at or above their median levels, with increased oxidative stress. This was evidenced by elevated MDA and reduced SOD. We found a joint detrimental effect of the pollutant mixture on AR symptoms with a strong association with increased SRS scores, but a non -significant positive association with VAS and RQLQ scores. PM 2.5 , O 3 , SO 2 presented as the potentially primary con- tributors to the adverse health effects associated with the pollutant mixture in Taiyuan city. Patients with AR exposed to short-term air pollutant mixture are more likely to have greater nasal symptoms and worse quality of life from increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant capacity. Further research is warranted to better elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Convergent evolution, the evolution of the same or similar phenotypes in phylogenetically independent lineages, is a widespread phenomenon in nature. If the genetic basis for convergent evolution is predictable to some extent, it may be possible to infer organismic phenotypes and the capability of organisms to utilize new ecological resources based on genome sequence data. While repeated amino acid changes have been studied in association with convergent evolution, relatively little is known about the potential contribution of repeated gene copy number changes. In this study, we explore whether gene copy number changes of particular gene families are linked to diet shifts in mammals and assess whether trophic ecology can be inferred from the copy numbers of a specific set of gene families. Using 86 mammalian genome sequences, we identified 24 gene families with a trend toward higher copy numbers in herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, even after phylogenetic corrections. We were able to confirm previous findings on genes such as amylase, olfactory receptors, and xenobiotic metabolism genes, and identify novel gene families whose copy numbers correlate with dietary patterns. For example, omnivores exhibited higher copy numbers of genes encoding regulators of translation. We also established a discriminant function based on the copy numbers of 13 gene families that can help predict trophic ecology to some extent. These findings highlight a possible association between convergent evolution and repeated copy number changes in specific gene families, suggesting the potential to develop a method for predicting animal ecology from genome sequence data.

AB  - Simple Summary The clinical records of all guinea pigs diagnosed with a lower urinary tract disease in a single veterinary hospital, over a period of 14 years (2004-2018), were searched in order to characterize this population and investigate the potential association between the different features relating to the animal and the clinical approach toward them. A total of 117 clinical cases were identified, corresponding to 57 animals. The formation of stones in the urinary tract (urolithiasis) was the most common diagnosis (n = 52; 44.4%), followed by bladder inflammation (cystitis) and/or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Several associations were identified, showing that female guinea pigs were more likely than the male ones to have a previous family history of urinary disease, to present abnormal micturition signs at admission, and to have recurrence. Moreover, males were more prone to urolithiasis and females to cystitis/UTI, and animals diagnosed with cystitis/UTI frequently had more clinical urinary signs and abdominal pain on palpation compared to those diagnosed with urolithiasis. Finally, the use of potassium citrate and the urethrotomy approach were associated with a better therapeutic response. Further studies are needed in larger populations of guinea pigs to confirm the present findings, especially as some of them were described for the first time. The clinical records of all guinea pigs diagnosed with a lower urinary tract disease in a single veterinary hospital, over a period of 14 years (2004-2018), were retrospectively searched in order to characterize this population and investigate the potential association between the epidemiological and clinical variables. A total of 117 clinical cases were identified, corresponding to 57 animals. Urolithiasis was the most common diagnosis (n = 52; 44.4%), followed by cystitis and/or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Several statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) were found between different variables, showing that female guinea pigs were more likely than the male ones to have a previous family history of urinary disease, to present dysuria and stranguria at admission, and to suffer recurrence. Moreover, males were more prone to urolithiasis and females to cystitis/UTI, and animals diagnosed with cystitis/UTI frequently had more clinical urinary signs and abdominal pain on palpation compared to those diagnosed with urolithiasis. Finally, the use of potassium citrate and the urethrotomy approach were associated with a better therapeutic response. Further studies are needed in larger populations of guinea pigs to confirm the present findings, especially as some of them were described for the first time.

AB  - Psychostimulant addiction is a chronic brain disorder with high relapse rates, requiring new therapeutic strategies. The orexin system is highly implicated in processing reward and addiction through connections with critical areas such as the hippocampus. This study investigated the role of orexin-1 receptors (OX1R) within the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus in the extinction and reinstatement of the methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference. After cannulae implantation, recovery, and establishing the methamphetamine place preference, 98 male Wistar rats received different doses of bilateral intra-CA1 selective OX1R antagonist, SB334867 (1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol/0.5 mu l DMSO per side) during the 10-day extinction period (daily) or after extinction phase, just on the reinstatement day (single dose) in separate experimental and control groups. The findings indicated that bilateral microinjection of SB334867 into the CA1 area during the extinction period could significantly reduce the extinction latency and maintenance of rewarding aspects of methamphetamine dose-dependently (3, 10, and 30 nmol). In another set of experiments, a single dose of bilateral intra-CA1 SB334867 administration on the reinstatement phase prevented the methamphetamine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behaviors at the high doses (10, and 30 nmol). The present study provided more evidence for the implication of hippocampal OX1R in the maintenance of rewarding and reinforcing properties of methamphetamine and its role in the relapse of methamphetamine-seeking behavior. Further investigations on the role of the orexin system, including the orexin-2 receptors in treating addiction, are needed to introduce its antagonists as effective therapeutic options for psychostimulant addiction.

AB  - IntroductionNeonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is a serious inflammatory injury. At present, the standard treatment for this disease is hypothermia therapy, and the effect of drug intervention is still limited. L-F001 is a compound of fasudil and lipoic acid. Previous in vitro experiments have confirmed that L-F001 has anti-inflammatory neuroprotective functions. However, its therapeutic effect on neonates with HIBD remains unknown. This study was aimed at exploring the therapeutic effect of L-F001 on HIBD rats.MethodsThe newborn rats were divided into three groups: Sham operation group, HIBD group, and HIBD + L-F001 group. HE staining, Nissil staining, the immunofluorescence of iNOS and COX-2, ELISA (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10), and western blotting analyses were performed to determine the therapeutic effect of L-F001. Finally, we evaluated the growth and development of each group by measuring body weight.ResultsThe hippocampal structure of HIBD rats was disordered, and the Nissil body was small and shallow. The expressions of iNOS and COX-2 in HIBD rats were increased, whereas the expressions of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in plasma were upregulated, and the expression of IL-10 was decreased. L-F001 could improve the tissue structure and reduce the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in HIBD rats. Meanwhile, L-F001 could also reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and restore the content of anti-inflammatory cytokines in plasma. We further found that the TLR4 pathway was activated after hypoxic-ischemia in neonatal rats. L-F001 could inhibit the activation of TLR4 pathway. Finally, we found that after L-F001 treatment, the body weight of HIBD rats increased significantly compared with the untreated group.ConclusionsL-F001 antagonizes the inflammatory response after hypoxic-ischemia by inhibiting the activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway, thus playing a neuroprotective role. L-F001 may be a potential therapeutic agent for neonatal HIBD.

AB  - Cystic echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, which leads to serious public health problems. Considerable phenotypic variation has been described between parasites depending on the intermediate host and genotype. Knowledge of species/genotypes present in an endemic region is clue for control programs. Although DNA sequencing is the most accurate tool for this purpose, its high cost makes it less affordable. A multivariate study of the morphometric parameters of rostellar hooks of E. granulosus sensu lato of human origin from Neuqu & eacute;n was carried out using Principal Components Analysis and classification trees. A valid classification criterion to differentiate E. granulosus species using morphometry of rostellar hooks in human hydatid cysts was determined. Seventy-six human fertile hydatid cysts (48 E. granulosus sensu stricto G1 and G3, and 28 E. canadensis G6) were included. Overall, 2,280 hooks were measured. The rostellar hooks belonging to E. granulosus sensu stricto were significantly smaller than those of E. canadensis. The Large Total Length (LTL) was sufficient to classify a new isolate into the 2 species: if LTL < 25.3 mu m, then it corresponds to E. granulosus sensu stricto, and if LTL >= 25.3 mu m to E. canadensis. This is the first multivariate study that establishes a morphometric cut-off value to discriminate between 2 species of E. granulosus sensu lato from human patients, using a significant number of cysts of both species identified by sequencing of mitochondrial genes. It constitutes a useful predictive tool in endemic areas where both human infective species overlap.

AB  - Adipokines play crucial roles in both reproductive and energy metabolic processes. This study aimed to compare the hormonal plasma profile of adiponectin, apelin, vaspin, chemerin, resistin, visfatin, and adipolin, and the expression of their receptors in the anterior pituitary (AP) between normal-weight Large White (LW) and fat Meishan (MS) pigs during different phases of the estrous cycle. We measured adipokine levels in the plasma and assessed their gene expression in the AP. We used Pearson's correlation analysis to examine potential links between adipokines levels, their receptors, and metabolic parameters (body weight; backfat thickness) and reproductive parameters (pituitary weight; age at puberty; levels of gonadotropins, steroid hormones; and gene expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor and gonadotropins in AP). The plasma levels of the evaluated adipokines fluctuated with phase and breed, except for visfatin and adipolin. Moreover, adipokine expression in AP varied significantly between breeds and estrous cycle phases, except for resistin receptor CAP1. Notably, we observed a positive correlation between plasma levels of adiponectin and its transcript in the AP only in MS pigs. Apelin gene expression correlated negatively with its receptor in MS, while we observed a breeddependent correlation between chemerin gene expression and its receptor CMKLR1. We identified significant positive or negative correlations between adipokines or their receptor levels in plasma and AP as well as metabolic or reproductive parameters, depending on the breed. In conclusion, we have demonstrated breedspecific and estrous cycle-dependent regulation of adipokines in AP, underscoring their potential impact on metabolic and reproductive processes in swine.

AB  - A study of archaeobotanical samples recovered from excavations by the German Archaeological Institute (2013-2019) in late Middle Kingdom (1750-1650 bc) house 169 on Elephantine Island (Egypt) yielded an assemblage of exceptionally well-preserved desiccated and charred plant macro-remains. In order to determine patterns within the assemblage of 208,493 plant items from 123 archaeological contexts, we applied a novel approach to multivariate statistical analyses, making use of machine learning methods. A combination of cluster analysis and evolutionary decision trees out-performed traditional correspondence analysis and principal components analysis techniques, allowing for the discovery that whilst the assemblage was generally homogeneous, it was possible to identify certain types of deposits as being locations of plant "waste" disposal. The analysis also allowed identification of possible storage of barley and flax processing in one room, and some fireplaces in which the inhabitants chose to burn specific selected materials.

AB  - Chronic pancreatitis (CP) in young individuals may lead to disease-related secondary sarcopenia (SSARC), characterized by muscle loss and systemic inflammation. In this study, CP was induced in young pigs, and serum levels of key hormones, muscle fiber diameters in various muscles, and the mRNA expression of genes related to oxidative stress and programmed cell death were assessed. A decrease in muscle fiber diameters was observed in SSARC pigs, particularly in the longissimus and diaphragm muscles. Hormonal analysis revealed alterations in dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, oxytocin, myostatin, and cortisol levels, indicating a distinct hormonal response in SSARC pigs compared to controls. Oxytocin levels in SSARC pigs were significantly lower and myostatin levels higher. Additionally, changes in the expression of catalase (CAT), caspase 8 (CASP8), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) mRNA suggested a downregulation of oxidative stress response and apoptosis regulation. A reduced BAX/BCL2 ratio in SSARC pigs implied potential caspase-independent cell death pathways. The findings highlight the complex interplay between hormonal changes and muscle degradation in SSARC, underscoring the need for further research into the apoptotic and inflammatory pathways involved in muscle changes due to chronic organ inflammation in young individuals.

AB  - There is so much interest in online purchasing within supply chain networks nowadays. After expanding the internet access and services, customers' behavior has changed. Today, a customer's shopping manner usually begins with the internet search. With this approach, we face some new trends in this field, such as online-to-offline (O2O) commerce that aims to balance online and offline sales. Regarding the supply chain management, the O2O commerce can help the managers to conduct both online and offline businesses. The tire industry is one of the applications of the O2O approach, which also directly affects the supply chain network design (SCND). Therefore, this work for the first time proposes a dual-channel, multi-product, multi-period, multi-echelon closed-loop SCND under uncertainty for the tire industry. To tackle the uncertain parameters of the problem (e.g., prices and demand), a fuzzy approach, so-called the Jimenez's method, is applied. Another main innovation of this work is two new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms with new procedures. Two recent nature-inspired algorithms (i.e., red deer algorithm (RDA) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA)) are hybridized with the genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) to strengthen the diversification and intensification phases, respectively. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the hybrid version of WOA and SA returns high-quality solutions and requires an acceptable amount of computational time. The conducted sensitivity analyses underline the importance of tire remanufacturing. Furthermore, setting the appropriate prices in different channels for the available tire types is critical for sustainable tire supply chain management.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the effect of acute caffeine (CAF) administration, which exerts a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity, on the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors in the hypothalamus and choroid plexus (ChP) during acute inflammation caused by the injection of bacterial endotoxin-lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The experiment was performed on 24 female sheep randomly divided into four groups: control; LPS treated (iv.; 400 ng/kg of body mass (bm.)); CAF treated (iv.; 30 mg/kg of bm.); and LPS and CAF treated. The animals were euthanized 3 h after the treatment. It was found that acute administration of CAF suppressed the synthesis of interleukin (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, but did not influence IL-6, in the hypothalamus during LPS-induced inflammation. The injection of CAF reduced the LPS-induced expression of TNF mRNA in the ChP. CAF lowered the gene expression of IL-6 cytokine family signal transducer (IL6ST) and TNF receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1) in the hypothalamus and IL-1 type II receptor (IL1R2) in the ChP. Our study on the sheep model suggests that CAF may attenuate the inflammatory response at the hypothalamic level and partly influence the inflammatory signal generated by the ChP cells. This suggests the potential of CAF to suppress neuroinflammatory processes induced by peripheral immune/inflammatory challenges.

AB  - Antioxidant present in sperm cells protects them from oxidative damage. However, sperm are more susceptible to peroxidative damages due to the loss of these enzymes during cryopreservation and their survival and fertility may be compromised. Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has an antioxidant effect and could maintain sperm motility. OBJECTIVE: To improve seminal parameters, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), oxidative status and DNA integrity of buck semen after freeze-thawing by fortification of goat semen diluent with various concentrations of IGF-1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty ejaculates were collected and were extended with tris- citric acid- fructose diluent with 10% egg yolk and 6% glycerol with sperm concentrations of 1x10(8) mL(-1). Post-cryopreserved sperm were assessed for motility and a range of other functional parameters. RESULTS: In post-thaw semen sperm motility, live sperm count, acrosome integrity, hypo-osmotic swelling positive spermatozoa, malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl content (PCC), TUNEL positive sperm differed significantly (P<0.05) with the various concentrations of IGF-1 used. Sperm functional parameters post-thawing were significantly (P<0.05) better in 250 ng/mL IGF-1. IGF-1 protects against lipid peroxidation by lowering MDA and PCC production, thus reducing the harmful effect of reactive oxygen species. The kidding percentage using the artificial insemination technique was significantly higher ( i.e., 40%) in the group supplemented with 250 ng/mL of IGF-1 than in the non-supplemented group (i.e., 30%). CONCLUSION: IGF-1 may be used to improve post-thaw semen quality and fertility as measured by actual kidding rate.

AB  - Background: In Aotearoa New Zealand, 90% of patients with notified leptospirosis (a zoonotic bacterial disease) have been men working in agricultural industries. However, since 2008, the epidemiology of notified cases has been gradually changing, that is, more women are affected; there are more cases associated with occupations traditionally not considered high risk in New Zealand; infecting serovars have changed; and many patients experience symptoms long after infection. We hypothesized that there is a shift in leptospirosis transmission patterns with substantial burden on affected patients and their families. Objective: In this paper, we aimed to describe the protocols used to conduct a nationwide case-control study to update leptospirosis risk factors and follow-up studies to assess the burden and sources of leptospirosis in New Zealand. Methods: This study used a mixed methods approach, comprising a case-control study and 4 substudies that involved cases only. Cases were recruited nationwide, and controls were frequency matched by sex and rurality. All participants were administered a case-control questionnaire (study 1), with cases being interviewed again at least 6 months after the initial survey (study 2). A subset of cases from two high-risk populations, that is, farmers and abattoir workers, were further engaged in a semistructured interview (study 3). Some cases with regular animal exposure had their in-contact animals (livestock for blood and urine and wildlife for kidney) and environment (soil, mud, and water) sampled (study 4). Patients from selected health clinics suspected of leptospirosis also had blood and urine samples collected (study 5). In studies 4 and 5, blood samples were tested using the microscopic agglutination test to test for antibody titers against Leptospira serovars Hardjo type bovis, Ballum, Tarassovi, Pomona, and Copenhageni. Blood, urine, and environmental samples were also tested for pathogenic Leptospira DNA using polymerase chain reaction. Results: Participants were recruited between July 22, 2019, and January 31, 2022, and data collection for the study has concluded. In total, 95 cases (July 25, 2019, to April 13, 2022) and 300 controls (October 19, 2019, to January 26, 2022) were interviewed for the case-control study; 91 cases participated in the follow-up interviews (July 9, 2020, to October 25, 2022); 13 cases participated in the semistructured interviews (January 26, 2021, to January 19, 2022); and 4 cases had their in-contact animals and environments sampled (October 28, 2020, and July 29, 2021). Data analysis for study 3 has concluded and 2 manuscripts have been drafted for review. Results of the other studies are being analyzed and the specific results of each study will be published as individual manuscripts.. Conclusions: The methods used in this study may provide a basis for future epidemiological studies of infectious diseases.

AB  - This study explores an eco-friendly method to achieve 99.98 % dechroming (reducing Cr from 7700 to 4.71 ppm) of Chrome-tanned leather shaving dust (CSD), through enzymatic hydrolysis using crude protease. The enzyme exhibited strong activity (>40 U mL-1) across a temperature range of 50 degrees C to 65 degrees C and a pH range of 5 to 11. The pH of the mixture containing CSD, water, MgO, and enzyme was maintained at 8.9 during hydrolysis. The temperature, hydrolysis time, and enzyme concentration were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Under optimal conditions of 17.57 % enzyme concentration, 62.01 degrees C, and a hydrolysis time of 7 h, the predicted collagen yield was 31.66 %. Laboratory experiments conducted with these predicted parameters resulted in a collagen recovery of 30.9 %, achieving an accuracy of 97.6 % compared to the predictions. In contrast, hydrolysis with MgO alone achieved only 87.01 % dechroming with about 2 % collagen yield, highlighting the enzyme's superior effectiveness. The enzymatic cleavage of peptide bonds in the leather matrix enhanced collagen solubilization. Characterization techniques, including FT-IR, NMR, XRD, DSC, and TGA, confirmed successful extraction and purity, with the collagen being rich in glycine and proline. Cytotoxicity results demonstrated its non-toxic nature, indicating potential applications in biomedical fields, tissue engineering, food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. The recovered chromium sulfate was reused for rechroming goat wet blue leather, with chrome content in crust leather treated with recovered basic chromium sulfate (rBCS) and fresh basic chromium sulfate (BCS) being 3.23 % and 3.35 %, respectively, both meeting industry standards for goat crust leather. Synopsis: An eco-friendly method for dechroming chrome-tanned leather shaving dust (CSD) and extracting collagen was established. The process achieved 99.98 % dechroming and 30.9 % collagen yield using crude protease enzyme. Characterization confirmed the collagen's purity, and recovered chromium sulfate was reused for rechroming goat leather, meeting industry standards.

AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPS IIIB) is a metabolic neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), which is involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate (HS). Affected patients exhibit progressive neurodegeneration, behavioral disturbances, and a shortened lifespan. Currently, there is no effective treatment for MPS IIIB. We have recently developed a new therapeutic strategy based on the use of the HS-binding protein NK1, a spliced variant of hepatocyte growth factor. Here, we demonstrate that treating Naglu-/- mice with recombinant NK1 ameliorates neuropathology by reducing HS storage, lysosomal dysfunction, autophagy imbalance, and neuroinflammation in the cortex and hippocampus of MPS IIIB mouse brains. Furthermore, we found that recombinant NK1 treatment improves cognitive behavior and motor activity in Naglu-/- mice, as assessed using open field, object recognition, and T-maze tests. Our findings suggest that recombinant NK1 is a promising candidate for the treatment of MPS IIIB and other lysosomal storage diseases associated with central nervous system dysfunction.

AB  - In utero fetal gene therapy (IUFGT) has the potential to correct severe monogenic disorders before irreversible damage occurs. Despite promising results in small and large animal models, its translation to clinical practice remains limited by technical challenges, safety concerns, and the lack of standardized protocols in relevant disease models species. We established and validated a minimally invasive, ultrasound-guided approach for systemic gene delivery in fetal pigs using a self-complementary AAV9 vector encoding GFP under a CAG promoter. Injections were performed at different gestational ages (GA 80 and GA 108) via intracardiac or umbilical venous routes. Postnatal outcomes were monitored, and transgene biodistribution and expression were assessed by qPCR, ddPCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Inflammatory response, toxicity, and maternal safety were evaluated through cytokine profiling and histological analyses. The procedure was well tolerated, with no significant maternal morbidity or adverse obstetric outcomes beyond one preterm delivery. Biodistribution analysis revealed widespread vector presence in peripheral tissues, with robust GFP expression in liver and heart. Importantly, there was no evidence of significant tissue toxicity, necrosis, or fibrosis in any of the organs analyzed. Mild increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines (GM-CSF, GRO-alpha, IFN-gamma) were observed but were not associated with histopathological changes. No anti-AAV9 capsid antibodies were detected in sera from piglets or sows, suggesting a minimal immune response to the vector. These findings demonstrate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of ultrasound-guided IUFGT in pigs, supporting its potential as a translational platform for therapeutic gene delivery in fetuses affected by severe congenital diseases. This model offers a valuable framework for further preclinical development of prenatal interventions, particularly for disorders with early onset, such as mitochondrial diseases.

AB  - Background: Drug addiction is a complex brain disorder that is characterized by craving, withdrawal, and relapse, which can be perpetuated by social stress. Stemming from an acute life event, chronic stress, or trauma in a social context, social stress has a major role in the initiation and trajectory of substance use. Preclinical literature shows that early life stress exposure and social isolation facilitate and enhance drug self-administration. Epidemiological evidence links childhood adversity to increased risk for drug use and demonstrates that cumulative stress experiences are predictive of substance use severity in a dose-dependent manner. Stress and drug use induce overlapping brain alterations leading to downregulation or deficits in brain reward circuitry, thereby resulting in greater sensitization to the rewarding properties of drugs. Though stress in the context of addiction has been studied at the neural level, a gap in our understanding of the neural underpinnings of social stress in humans remains.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of in vivo structural and functional neuroimaging studies to evaluate the neural processes associated with social stress in individuals with substance use disorder. Results were considered in relation to participants' history of social stress and with regard to the effects of social stress induced during the neuroimaging paradigm.
   Results: An exhaustive search yielded 21 studies that matched inclusion criteria. Social stress induces broad structural and functional neural effects in individuals with substance use disorder throughout their lifespan and across drug classes. A few patterns emerged across studies: (1) many of the brain regions altered in individuals who were exposed to chronic social stress and during acute stress induction have been implicated in addiction networks (including the prefrontal cortex, insula, hippocampus, and amygdala); (2) individuals with childhood maltreatment and substance use history had decreased gray matter or activation in regions of executive functioning (including the medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex), the hippocampal complex, and the supplementary motor area; and (3) during stress-induction paradigms, activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and amygdala was most commonly observed.
   Conclusions/Implications: A distinct overlap is shown between social stress-related circuitry and addiction circuitry, particularly in brain regions implicated in drug-seeking, craving, and relapse. Given the few studies that have thoroughly investigated social stress, the evidence accumulated to date needs to be replicated and extended, particularly using research designs and methods that disentangle the effects of substance use from social stress. Future clinical studies can leverage this information to evaluate the impact of exposure to trauma or adverse life events within substance use research. Expanding knowledge in this emerging field could help clarify neural mechanisms underlying addiction risk and progression to guide causal-experimental inquiry and novel prevention and treatment strategies.

AB  - Plant defense against herbivores is costly and often associated with growth repression. The phytohormone jasmonate (JA) plays a central role in prioritizing defense over growth during herbivore attack, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. When brown planthoppers (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) attack rice (Oryza sativa), growth is dramatically suppressed. BPH infestation also increases inactive gibberellin (GA) levels and transcripts of GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox) genes, 2 (GA2ox3 and GA2ox7) of which encode enzymes that catalyze the conversion of bioactive GAs to inactive GAs in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of these GA2oxs diminishes BPH-elicited growth restriction without affecting BPH resistance. Phytohormone profiling and transcriptome analyses revealed that GA2ox-mediated GA catabolism was enhanced by JA signaling. The transcript levels of GA2ox3 and GA2ox7 were significantly attenuated under BPH attack in JA biosynthesis (allene oxide cyclase [aoc]) or signaling-deficient (myc2) mutants. In contrast, GA2ox3 and GA2ox7 expression was increased in MYC2 overexpression lines. MYC2 directly binds to the G-boxes in the promoters of both GA2ox genes to regulate their expression. We conclude that JA signaling simultaneously activates defense responses and GA catabolism to rapidly optimize resource allocation in attacked plants and provides a mechanism for phytohormone crosstalk.
   Jasmonate-mediated gibberellin catabolism is partially responsible for brown planthopper-elicited growth inhibition in rice.

AB  - Low-temperature stress is an increasing problem for the cultivation of tea (Camellia sinensis), with adverse effects on plant growth and development and subsequent negative impacts on the tea industry. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), as a plant inducer, can improve the cold-stress tolerance in tea plants. R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) are considered potentially important regulators in the resistance to cold stress in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms, by which MYB TFs via the jasmonic acid pathway respond to cold stress in the tea plant, remain unknown. In this study, physiological and biochemical assays showed that exogenous MeJA application could effectively promote ROS scavenging in the tea plant under cold stress, maintaining the stability of the cell membrane. Sixteen R2R3-MYB TFs genes were identified from the tea plant genome database. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that three CsMYB genes were strongly induced under a combination of MeJA and cold-stress treatment. Subcellular localization assays suggest CsMYB45, CsMYB46, and CsMYB105 localized in the nucleus. Exogenous MeJA treatment enhanced the overexpression of CsMYB45, CsMYB46, and CsMYB105 in E. coli and improved the growth and survival rates of recombinant cells compared to an empty vector under cold stress. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments confirmed that CsMYB46 and CsMYB105 interacted with CsJAZ3, CsJAZ10, and CsJAZ11 in the nucleus. Taken together, these results highlight that CsMYB45, CsMYB46, and CsMYB105 are not only key components in the cold-stress signal response pathway but also may serve as points of confluence for cold stress and JA signaling pathways. Furthermore, our findings provide new insight into how MYB TFs influence cold tolerance via the jasmonic acid pathway in tea and provide candidate genes for future functional studies and breeding.

AB  - Pastoralists and wildlife co-exist in the Somali Regional State competing for habitat, food and water resources. A questionnaire survey conducted among 198 pastoralists, captured information on their perception of wildlife against the backdrop of wildlife population decrease, illegal wildlife trade and lack of quantitative and qualitative data in the area. The top perceived threats to livestock were drought (46%), wildlife attacks (33.8%) and diseases (20.2%). Daily encounters between wildlife and livestock were reported by 61.1% of respondents. Herbivores, including warthogs, accounted for the majority of these encounters (88.4%), whereas carnivores were rarely observed with livestock, except for jackals. The majority (92.9%) of the respondents did not think that wildlife could transmit diseases to livestock. Jackals were reported by 7.1% to transmit rabies. A strong dislike for wildlife was recorded in 99% of all respondents. All stated that wildlife should not be protected. Half of the respondents did not see any benefits in wildlife. Wildlife populations have decreased over the last 10 years, particularly lions and cheetahs. Pastoralist's attitudes and perceptions towards wildlife in the study area were negative, potentially affecting conservation efforts. There is an urgent need to improve awareness of the benefits of wildlife and to include wildlife in integrated human-livestock-environment surveillance systems.

AB  - The oil sands industries in Alberta, Canada are potential sources of particulate-bound elements in the region. This study explored the ambient concentrations and size distributions, and conducted source apportionment of 48 particulate elements, based on samples collected in 2016-2017 at four air monitoring sites in the Athabasca oil sands region: Fort McKay (AMS1), Buffalo Viewpoint (AMS4), Wapasu Creek (AMS17), and Stoney Mountain (AMS18). Element concentrations in fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 respectively) at the four sites were generally lower than their typical concentrations at other urban and industrial sites in North America. Among all elements, S was the most abundant in PM2.5 with mean concentrations ranging from 189 ng/m(3) (AMS18) to 284 ng/m(3) (AMS1). Of the trace, toxic elements in PM2.5, Zn was the most abundant with mean concentrations ranging from 3.43 ng/m(3) (AMS18) to 5.37 ng/m(3) (AMS4). Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) modeling of the element concentrations in PM2.5 was used for source apportionment for Zone1 (including AMS 1, 4, and 17, situated closer to industrial activities) and for Zone2 (including AMS18, a background site). The sources of elements for Zone1, included crustal dust, bitumen processing, haul road dust, and biomass burning that explained similar to 33%, similar to 43%, similar to 15%, and similar to 9% of the total resolved elemental mass, respectively. The sources of elements for Zone2, included Pb-rich source, biomass burning, fugitive oil sands, crustal dust, and bitumen processing explaining similar to 8%, similar to 7%, similar to 3%, similar to 22%, and similar to 60% of the total resolved elemental mass, respectively. Elemental mass concentrations of the bitumen processing source factor at Zone2 was two-thirds of that in Zone1. Overall, mass proportions of the bitumen processing source factor at all four sites were significant, suggesting that the oil sands industries played a key role in ambient element concentration levels in the region.

AB  - Anthracnose is a devastating fungal disease in tea plants caused by the pathogen Colletotrichum species. It severely affects tea yield and quality. Pathogenesis-related (PR) genes play indispensable roles in plant resistance to fungal pathogens. Our transcriptome data showed that PR10 family genes are involved in the immune response to anthracnose infection in tea plants; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified a PR10 family gene, CsPR10-9, which was highly induced by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides infection and salicylic acid (SA)/methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments. Transient silencing of CsPR10-9 substantially compromised the disease resistance of tea plants, and this was accompanied by reduced activities of the antioxidant enzymes, peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), resulting in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decreased SA content, and increased jasmonic acid (JA) content. Transient overexpression of CsPR10-9 in tobacco leaves showed that the lesion area on CsPR10-9-overexpressing leaves was significantly smaller than the control leaves, accompanied by decreased H2O2 level and increased POD and SOD activities. CsPR10-9 was negatively regulated by an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, CsMYB72, which directly bound to MYB transcription factor binding site cis-acting elements in its promoter to inhibit the expression of CsPR10-9. CsMYB72 is localised in the nucleus and participate in the response to anthracnose infection and SA/MeJA treatment. Moreover, silencing of CsMYB72 significantly enhanced disease resistance, increased POD and SOD activities, reduced ROS levels, increased SA content, and decreased JA content. Taken together, our results revealed that the CsMYB72-CsPR10-9 module regulates the SA/JA-mediated defence response of tea plants to anthracnose. This study provides new molecular targets and a theoretical foundation for breeding of disease-resistant tea germplasms.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we aimed to establish a visual, rapid, low-cost, sensitive, specific, and portable nucleic acid detection method for PCV2 through coupling LAMP with CRISPR/Cas12a. All the results of LAMP-CRISPR detection, including a low detectable limit of 1 copy/mu L, no cross-reaction with main porcine DNA or RNA viruses, and a 100% coincidence rate with qPCR detection, demonstrated that this method was reliable. It has laid the foundation for developing a PCV2 detection kit based on this LAMP-CRISPR method. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is the main pathogen of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), which can cause considerable economic loss to the pig industry. The diagnosis of PCVAD is complicated and requires a series of clinical, pathological, and virological methods. Therefore, a rapid, highly sensitive, on-site, and visual diagnostic approach would facilitate dealing with the spread of PCV2. In this study, we intended to establish a new and effective PCV2 detection method through combining the no specific equipment requirement advantage of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with the property of clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas12a system possessing the huLbCas12a collateral cleavage activity able to cleave single-stranded DNA fluorophore quencher probe sensor (designed as LAPM-CRISPR). Following a series of optimizations of its reaction conditions, this LAMP-CRISPR-based PCV2 detection could be conducted in constant temperature equipment, with the result reflected in a direct visual readout way. This established PCV2 detection approach presented fine sensitivity, rapidity, specificity, and reliability, as demonstrated by a low detectable limit of 1 copy/mu L, completed within an hour, no cross-reaction with main porcine DNA or RNA viruses like PCV1, PCV3, and PEDV, and a 100% coincidence rate with that of the quantitative PCR (qPCR) method in the evaluation of 30 clinical blood samples, respectively. Therefore, this novel method makes rapid, on-site, visual, highly sensitive, and specific detection of PCV2 possible, facilitating the prevention of this pathogen in the field.

AB  - Slaughterhouse plants, especially meat and poultry products (MPPs), generate significant quantities of wastewater during the slaughtering process and the cleaning of machinery. The handling and final disposal of wastewater from the slaughterhouse is a public and environmental health issue due to its pollution potential. The monitoring of three full-scale buffalo meat-based abattoir effluent treatment plants (ETPs) to remove organic matter and nutrients was conducted at three separate sites in India. Rotary and static screens, an equalization tank, a dissolved air flotation (DAF) system, aeration tanks, and clarifiers were the component unit operations/processes of the wastewater treatment systems. All the treatment plants were operating at an average flow rate of 254 m(3)/d Meem Agro (designed capacity 500 m(3)/d); 427 m(3)/d Al Noor (designed capacity 500 m(3)/d), and 353 m(3)/d International Agro Foods (IAF) plant (designed capacity 750 m(3)/d) for the treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater. The Al Noor and Meem Agro's ETP consisted of a DAF unit working at the surface-loading rates of 5.7 and 1.48 m3/m(2) h, respectively, applied during the analysis to the DAF system, resulting in 46.5 and 56.8% efficiencies of O&G and SS removal. The ETP of Al Noor and Meem Agro and IAF was loaded at an organic loading rate of 276 kg COD/day, 746 kg COD/day, and 629 kg COD/day, respectively. Performance of ETPs showed that the efficiency of total COD, total BOD, and TSS removal was 97, 98, and 99%; 94, 94, and 93%, and 95, 98, and 99% for Al Noor, Meem Agro, and IAF plants, respectively. The treatment plants' efficiencies in all three plants for the removal of organic matter surpassed the effluent discharge level (as per Indian standards). Still, it is concluded that the ETPs need to be upgraded by incorporating the advanced wastewater treatment methods for the removal of nutrient concentration from treated effluents.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Macrophages play a central role in innate immune response to both infectious and non-infectious stressors. They respond to different agonists modifying their phenotype and functions. In humans and mice, the regulatory cytokines IL-10 or TGF-beta are both known to drive macrophage polarization into an anti-inflammatory phenotype, referred to as M2c. However, the immune systems of animal species each have their own peculiarities and the M2c subsets has never been investigated in pigs. A deep knowledge of the porcine immune system is required to design vaccines or control strategies against pathogens, which are a major constraint to pork production. Due to anatomical, physiological, and immunological similarities, swine are attracting increasing attention as a model for human diseases. To better characterize porcine macrophages, we evaluated the effects of IL-10 or TGF-beta on the phenotype and function of monocyte-derived macrophages. Both cytokines downregulated the expression of MHC II DR and CD14. IL-10, but not TGF-beta, statistically significantly reduced the ability of macrophages to respond to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4 agonists. Whilst these data suggest differentiation to an M2c-like immunosuppressive phenotype, the responses, and differences between IL-10 and TGF-beta also reveals species-specific differences.
   Macrophages are phagocytic cells involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis and defense against pathogens. Macrophages may be polarized into different functionally specialized subsets. M2c macrophages arise following stimulation with IL-10 or TGF-beta and mediate anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions. M2c macrophages remain poorly characterized in the pig, thus we investigated the impact of these regulatory cytokines on porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (moM phi). The phenotype and functionality of these cells was characterized though confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, ELISA, and RT-qPCR. Both cytokines induced CD14 and MHC II DR down-regulation and reduced IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CD14 expression, suggestive of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, neither IL-10 or TGF-beta were able to trigger IL-10 induction or release by moM phi. Differences between these cytokines were observed: stimulation with IL-10, but not TGF-beta, induced up-regulation of both CD16 and CD163 on moM phi. In addition, IL-10 down-regulated expression of IL-1 beta and IL-12p40 4h post-stimulation and induced a stronger impairment of moM phi ability to respond to either TLR2 or TLR4 agonists. Overall, our results provide an overview of porcine macrophage polarization by two immunosuppressive cytokines, revealing differences between IL-10 and TGF-beta, and reporting some peculiarity of swine, which should be considered in translational studies.

AB  - Sulfate transporters (SULTRs) are responsible for the uptake of sulfate (SO42-) ions in the rhizosphere by roots and their distribution to plant organs. In this study, SULTR family members in the genomes of two oilseed crops (Camelina sativa and Brassica napus) were identified and characterized based on their sequence structures, duplication events, phylogenetic relationships, phosphorylation sites, and expression levels. In total, 36 and 45 putative SULTR genes were recognized in the genomes of C. sativa and B. napus, respectively. SULTR proteins were predicted to be basophilic proteins with low hydrophilicity in both studied species. According to the observed phylogenetic relationships, we divided the SULTRs into five groups, out of which the SULTR 3 group showed the highest variation. Additionally, several duplication events were observed between the SULTRs. The first duplication event occurred approximately five million years ago between three SULTR 3.1 genes in C. sativa. Furthermore, two subunits were identified in the 3D structures of the SULTRs, which demonstrated that the active binding sites differed between C. sativa and B. napus. According to the available RNA-seq data, the SULTRs showed diverse expression levels in tissues and diverse responses to stimuli. SULTR 3 was expressed in all tissues. SULTR 3.1 was more upregulated in response to abiotic stresses in C. sativa, while SULTR 3.3 and SULTR 2.1 were upregulated in B. napus. Furthermore, SULTR 3 and SULTR 4.1 were upregulated in response to biotic stresses in B. napus. Additionally, the qPCR data showed that the SULTRs in C. sativa were involved in the plant's response to salinity. Based on the distribution of cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region, we speculated that SULTRs might be controlled by phytohormones, such as ABA and MeJA. Therefore, it seems likely that SULTR genes in C. sativa have been more heavily influenced by evolutionary processes and have acquired further diversity. The results reveal new insights of the structures and functions of SULTRs in oilseed crops. However, further analyses, related to functional studies, are needed to uncover the role of SULTRs in the plants' development and growth processes, as well as in their response to stimuli.

AB  - Maternal care plays a crucial role for infant development. In humans, skin-to-skin care is often used for preterm infants to reduce acute stress and improve long-term developmental outcome. Here we propose a new translational approach to study the effects of acute increases in maternal care on offspring development in rodents. First, pilot studies determined that dams spent more time licking pups covered in hazelnut cocoa spread (Nutella(R))) than any other studied substance. For the main experiment, Sprague-Dawley rats were bred in-house, and Nutella(R) was applied four times a day to treatment pups (2 males/females per litter) of seven litters from PN2 to 5. Control pups (2 males/females per litter) were handled similarly without applying any substance. Maternal licking and grooming behavior was observed for 30 min following each Nutella(R) application. Nutella(R)-covered pups received significantly more licking and grooming compared to control pups within each litter. There was no difference in body weight or basal serum corticosterone levels between Nutella(R)-covered and control pups on PN5, suggesting that the Nutella(R) application and subsequent increased maternal licking was not stressful for the pups. Future studies will investigate whether this increase in maternal care can protect pups from stress- or pain-induced rises in corticosterone.

AB  - Treatment with intra-vaginal progesterone pessaries for synchrony of estrus is essential in fixed-time artificial insemination (AI) of sheep. Globally, the conventional 14-day pessary treatment is the mainstay of commercial AI programs. It has remained largely unchanged for many decades even though it is associated with variable patterns of estrus and often disappointing pregnancy rates. Until recently, an understanding of this variability has been elusive. Here we review research of the last 25 years and conclude that synchronising estrus and obtaining satisfactory pregnancy rates (>= 75 %) following AI is more challenging than expected from the original research of the 1960s. In particular, conventional pessary treatment is unable to control the time of emergence of the ovulatory follicle and the resultant variability in follicle age affects fertility. Additionally, the pessary is unable to mitigate the effects of season, nutrition and cyclical status of the ewe on the timing of estrus. It is concluded that the inability of pessary treatment to produce a uniform synchrony together with the adverse effects on follicle quality are primarily responsible for variable pregnancy rates. However, there are strategies to improve AI success rates. The first involves controlling the time of emergence of the ovulatory follicle so that it occurs primarily during the most fertile period of pessary treatment (Days 7-9 of a 14-day treatment). The second involves improving the synchrony of estrus by enhancing circulating levels of progesterone late (Day 9) in the treatment period. The third involves the use of short-term pessary treatments (5-7 days) that avoid some of the abnormalities associated with conventional treatment. Finally, given the variability in the timing of estrus, we address the challenge of optimising the time of insemination, an essential requirement of successful AI programs.

AB  - This study investigates the socio-economic impacts of human-elephant conflict (HEC) in the Betla Range of Palamau Tiger Reserve. The Betla Range, characterized by frequent human- elephant interactions, provides valuable context for exploring these complex conflicts. Aimed at understanding the perception and consequences of HEC on local communities, this research utilizes a semi-structured questionnaire survey among 108 villagers to gather perspectives of the locals on their experiences with HEC and its resolution. In addition, we have also conducted Risk mapping exercises to understand the perceived gravity of HEC as a threat compared to other risks that the locals face. The research highlights frequent encounters with elephants, especially during monsoon rice-farming season, and nocturnal nature of elephant raids, the preference of elephants for ripe crops, and the limited effectiveness of community-based mitigation strategies leading to substantial crop and property damage. The findings revealed a high awareness of government compensation policies among villagers, although a significant majority report received inadequate or no compensation due to the complexity of the process. Risk mapping exercises also showed that animal raids, in particular, crop raiding by elephants was perceived as the greatest risk by the locals.

AB  - Flow cytometry can be used to evaluate many sperm attributes and Dr. Duane Garner was influential in developing assays to understand sperm physiology and function. We review some of Dr. Garner's work and describe experiments that evaluate sperm capacitation using Dr. Garner's philosophy. In exploratory experiments, boar sperm were cryopreserved in lactose egg yolk (LEY) or Beltsville Freezing Extender 5 (BF5) and incubated in one capacitating medium. In another experiment, frozen-thawed bull sperm were incubated in TALP-Ca or CFDM1 capacitating media. In both experiments, sperm viability and capacitation were evaluated using multiple probes. Boar sperm frozen in LEY had greater survival rates (38%) than sperm frozen in BF5 (22%; P < 0.05) but did not capacitate as effectively as sperm in BF5 (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, bull sperm survived to a greater extent when incubated in TALP-Ca than in CFDM1 (P < 0.05) and had greater capacitation for most parameters (P < 0.05). Of particular interest, 77% of sperm incubated in TALP-Ca had activated second messenger systems involved in capacitation, compared with < 5% of sperm incubated in CFDM1. The results indicate different freezing and capacitating media induce different responses to sperm capacitation and functions. If only sperm viability and acrosomal integrity were evaluated, these results would be interpreted very differently. Dr. Garner's philosophy of evaluating multiple sperm parameters was an impetus to determine unique treatment differences which help in understanding sperm capacitation, and design further experiments to determine how media content causes sperm physiology differences.

AB  - Simple Summary Rodents have become increasingly popular as household pets, but few studies have focused on tumors in pet rodents. Pet rodents differ from their laboratory counterparts in many aspects such as geographical preference of pet species or breeds, household raising conditions, population density, and life expectancy. Therefore, it is worth conducting this pathological study of 77 spontaneous tumors from 70 pet rodents. Overall, mammary gland tumors were common. In the meantime, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-like sequences were found in the tissues of dogs, cats, and humans, raising the concern of whether these pets may incidentally serve as a vehicle for the cross-species transmission of MMTV to household personnel. For that purpose, nuclei acid extracted from the formalin-fixed paraffine-embedded tissues of 20 rodent mammary gland tumors was detected for MMTV env gene sequences. All tumors revealed negative results of MMTV detection.Abstract Compared to the number of studies on the neoplasms of laboratory rodents, fewer studies have focused on spontaneous neoplasms in pet rodents. Notably, the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is associated with mammary tumors in rodents. In this study, 77 tumors and tumor-like lesions of biopsy samples were collected from 70 pet rodents, including hamsters (n = 47), guinea pigs (n = 16), unknown species (n = 4), rats (n = 2), and a gerbil. Fifty tumors were collected from 47 hamsters, in which the most common tumors were mammary tumors (13/50), followed by fibrosarcoma (9/50), mast cell tumors (4/50), and squamous cell carcinoma (4/50). The collected subtypes of mammary tumors in hamsters included tubular carcinoma (n = 5), tubular adenoma (n = 4), carcinoma and malignant myoepithelioma (n = 1), simple tubular carcinoma (n = 1), adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 1), and tubulopapillary adenoma (n = 1). In addition, twenty tumors were collected from guinea pigs, in which the most common tumor was lipoma (6/20), followed by adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland (4/20), trichofolliculoma (2/20), and collagenous hamartomas (2/20). In guinea pigs, the subtypes of mammary gland tumors were tubular carcinoma (n = 2), tubular and solid carcinoma (n = 1), and tubulopapillary carcinoma (n = 1). In 20 cases of mammary tumors, MMTV was not detected, implicating no evidence of MMTV infection in mammary oncogenesis in pet rodents in Taiwan.

AB  - Calmodulin-binding transcription activators (CAMTAs) are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors and have multi-functions in plant development and stress response. However, identification and functional analysis of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) CAMTA genes (CsCAMTAs) are still lacking. Here, five CsCAMTAs were identified from tea plant genomic database. Their gene structures were similar except CsCAMTA2, and protein domains were conserved. Phylogenetic relationship classified the CsCAMTAs into three groups, CsCAMTA2 was in group I, and CsCAMTA1, 3 and CsCAMTA4, 5 were, respectively, in groups II and III. Analysis showed that stress and phytohormone response-related cis-elements were distributed in the promoters of CsCAMTA genes. Expression analysis showed that CsCAMTAs were differentially expressed in different organs and under various stress treatments of tea plants. Three-hundred and four hundred-one positive co-expressed genes of CsCAMTAs were identified under cold and drought, respectively. CsCAMTAs and their co-expressed genes constituted five independent co-expression networks. KEGG enrichment analysis of CsCAMTAs and the co-expressed genes revealed that hormone regulation, transcriptional regulation, and protein processing-related pathways were enriched under cold treatment, while pathways like hormone metabolism, lipid metabolism, and carbon metabolism were enriched under drought treatment. Protein interaction network analysis suggested that CsCAMTAs could bind (G/A/C)CGCG(C/G/T) or (A/C)CGTGT cis element in the target gene promoters, and transcriptional regulation might be the main way of CsCAMTA-mediated functional regulation. The study establishes a foundation for further function studies of CsCAMTA genes in stress response.

AB  - Simple Summary Infection by gastrointestinal nematodes is a major sanitary issue in sheep production. Therefore, improvements in the animal's health are important to reduce losses and improve animal welfare. Thus, this study investigated the feasibility of using easy-to-measure phenotypic traits to predict sheep resistant, resilient, and susceptible to gastrointestinal nematodes, compared the classification performance of different methods, and evaluated the applicability of the best classification model on each farm. The results revealed the multinomial logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis models presented the best classification performances for the susceptible and resistant animals. The results suggest that the use of readily available records and easily measurable traits may contribute to the identification of susceptible animals, supporting management decisions at the farm level and potentially reducing the economic losses due to parasitic infection. The animals identified as resistant can also be incorporated as selection candidates into breeding programs for the genetic improvement of sheep populations. This study investigated the feasibility of using easy-to-measure phenotypic traits to predict sheep resistant, resilient, and susceptible to gastrointestinal nematodes, compared the classification performance of multinomial logistic regression (MLR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods, and evaluated the applicability of the best classification model on each farm. The database comprised 3654 records of 1250 Santa Ines sheep from 6 farms. The animals were classified into resistant (2605 records), resilient (939 records), and susceptible (110 records) according to fecal egg count and packed cell volume. A random oversampling method was performed to balance the dataset. The classification methods were fitted using the information of age class, the month of record, farm, sex, Famacha (c) degree, body weight, and body condition score as predictors, and the resistance, resilience, and susceptibility to gastrointestinal nematodes as the target classes to be predicted considering data from all farms randomly. An additional leave-one-farm-out cross-validation technique was used to assess prediction quality across farms. The MLR and LDA models presented good performances in predicting susceptible and resistant animals. The results suggest that the use of readily available records and easily measurable traits may provide useful information for supporting management decisions at the farm level.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of sex on live weight and growth intensity of lambs of the Thracian merino breed, raised at the Agricultural Institute in Stara Zagora. For the period of two years, ewes in the flock were divided into 2 groups - mated in the spring (hormonally treated) and in the summer (not hormonally treated). The autumn progeny formed the Ist (experimental) group and respectively the winter progeny - the IInd /control/ group. Live weight of lambs at birth, at 10, 30, 70 days of age and at weaning was reported and growth intensity was calculated. Feeding and rearing were equal for both groups. As a result, it was found that male lambs had a higher live weight than females, born in the autumn, with the ex-ception of twins at weaning. Significant differences were found at all ages for the singles /except at weaning/ and from birth up to the 30th day of age for the twins. The male progeny, born in the winter, also showed higher live weight than female progeny, except for the singles at 30 days of age. Significant differences of medium degree (p < 0.01) were established at the age of 70 days for both singles and twins and of low degree (p < 0.05) only for the twins at birth and at 10 days of age. The live weight of lambs from both groups increased most intensively in the period from 30th to 70th day after birth, except for the females, born in the winter, which grew rapidlier by the 10th day after birth in comparison to the next ages. A higher average daily gain was calculated for the male progeny in the experimental group, while in the control group the results varied by sex.

AB  - Some nonhuman primate species, whose original habitats have been reclaimed by artificial activities, have acquired boldness toward humans which is evident based on the diminished frequency of escape behaviors. Eventually, such species have become regular users of human settlements, and are referred to as "urban primates." Considering this, we developed a noninvasive technique based on bioacoustics to provide a transparent assessment of troop addiction levels in anthropogenic environments, which are determined by the dependence on agricultural crops and human living sphere for their diets and daily ranging, respectively. We attempted to quantify the addiction levels based on the boldness of troops when raiding settlements, characterized by a "landscape of fear" because of the presence of humans as predators. We hypothesized that the boldness of troops could be measured using two indices: the frequency of raiding events on settlements and the amount of time spent there. For hypothesis testing, we devised an efficient method to measure these two indices using sound cues (i.e., spontaneous calls) for tracing troop movements that are obtainable throughout the day from most primate species (e.g., contact calls). We conducted a feasibility study of this assessment procedure, targeting troops of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). For this study, we collected 346 recording weeks of data using autonomous recorders from 24 troops with different addiction levels during the nonsnowy seasons. The results demonstrated that troops that reached the threshold level, at which radical interventions including mass culling of troop members is officially permitted, could be readily identified based on the following behavioral characteristics: troop members raiding settlements two or three times per week and mean time spent in settlements per raiding event exceeding 0.4 h. Thus, bioacoustic monitoring could become a valid option to ensure the objectivity of policy judgment in urban primate management.
   Increasing the experience of nonhuman primates to access to human settlements has sometimes resulted in elevating their addiction levels to artificial resources by displaying boldness toward humans.image
   To cope with urban primate issues, we developed a transparent procedure to determine the addiction levels of troops to the human sphere using a bioacoustic approach, which has several advantages.We conducted a feasibility study of the present procedure by collecting 346 recording weeks of data targeting different addiction levels of Japanese macaque troops (n = 24) in eastern Japan.The frequency and duration of settlement raiding events by troops could readily be measured using the present procedure and serve as effective indices to identify problem troops, which may need to be approved for mass culling as a practical option.

AB  - Keratin is a plentiful and renewable fibrous protein resource found in nature, but a great deal of keratin-containing waste causes environmental problems, especially wool waste, which accounts for the majority. A green and efficient extraction method of keratin based on microwave induction method was studied. Compared with traditional thermal induction, the extraction time was shortened by half, and the dissolution rate of the wool was improved. The effects of the above two methods on the size, structure, crystallinity, and thermal stability of wool keratin were studied by a series of analysis methods [e.g., attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), and so on]. The results showed that under microwave irradiation, the disulfide bonds were destroyed greatly, and the secondary structure changed significantly, which was beneficial to obtain wool keratin with low crystallinity and small particle size.

AB  - Sterols, bile acids, and acylcarnitines are key players in human metabolism. Precise annotations of these metabolites with mass spectrometry analytics are challenging because of the presence of several isomers and stereoisomers, variability in ionization, and their relatively low concentrations in biological samples. Herein, we present a sensitive and simple qualitative LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry) method by utilizing a set of pure chemical standards to facilitate the identification and distribution of sterols, bile acids, and acylcarnitines in biological samples including human stool and plasma; mouse ileum, cecum, jejunum content, duodenum content, and liver; and pig bile, proximal colon, cecum, heart, stool, and liver. With this method, we detected 24 sterol, 32 bile acid, and 27 acylcarnitine standards in one analysis that were separated within 13 min by reversed-phase chromatography. Further, we observed different sterol, bile acid, and acylcarnitine profiles for the different biological samples across the different species. The simultaneous detection and annotation of sterols, bile acids, and acylcarnitines from reference standards and biological samples with high precision represents a valuable tool for screening these metabolites in routine scientific research.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a metal with toxic effects on the environment, including living organisms. Organic Hg derivatives readily penetrate biological membranes and pose a particular health risk. Food of aquatic origin is the main source of human exposure to methylmercury (MeHg). In Poland, the consumption of fishery and aquaculture products has been gradually increasing. The aim of this study was to determine the content of Hg in fish intended for human consumption and purchased in Poland. The total Hg content of the edible parts of different species of marine and freshwater fish was analysed. The range of Hg content in all fish was 0.004-0.827 mg/kg, with an arithmetic mean of 0.084 mg/kg. The concentration of Hg in marine fish (0.100 mg/kg) was higher than in freshwater fish (0.063 mg/kg). The highest concentration of Hg was found in tuna. The Estimated Hazard Quotient (EHQ) calculated for the tuna samples analysed was >1. This may represent a potential health risk for consumers. The consumption of the other fish analysed was considered safe on the basis of the EHQ. The Hg content of the analysed fish samples did not exceed the current limits for food.

AB  - Moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been associated with emotional dysregulation such as loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia and major depressive disorder. The gene Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is involved in protein synthesis and degradation, apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress, processes that trigger mTBI. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of LRRK2 in reducing depression-related symptoms after mTBI and to determine whether inhibition of LRRK2 mediated by PF-06447475 could have antidepressant effects. Moderate traumatic brain injury was induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) and mice were treated with PF-06447475 at doses of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg once daily for 14 days. We performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses of brain tissue 24 days after mTBI. Furthermore, the tissue changes found in the hippocampus and amygdala confirmed the depression-like behavior. PF-treatment with 06447475 significantly reduced the histological damage and behavioral disturbances. Thus, this study has shown that mTBI induction promotes the development of depression-like behavioral changes. LRRK2 inhibition showed an antidepressant effect and restored the changes in the copper/glutamate/N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (Cu/NMDAR) system.

AB  - Mammalian parental care varies widely in investment and duration. While many species transition gradually from dependence on maternal care, others, such as the Northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), are abruptly weaned and endure prolonged fasting, relying solely on resources stored during nursing. Limited resources can lead to trade-offs between costly processes like growth and immune responses, which influence survival and fitness. Resource allocation reflects individual condition and species life-history, and may differ by sex if larger size benefits male lifetime fitness. We investigated inflammation and bacterial inhibition in Northern elephant seal pups immediately after weaning and one month into fasting, assessing whether responses were influenced by sex, growth, fatty reserves (body condition and blubber thickness), available energy (blood levels of glucose, triglycerides and total protein), nutritional stress (creatinine and delta 15N), concurrent infections, and differences in maternal foraging (inferred from isotopic signals in pups' whiskers). Newly-weaned pups had stronger immune responses than later in fasting: bactericidal ability decreased by 8.76 % (95 % CI: 5.16-12.47) and inflammation by 36.37 % (95 % CI: 16.39-53.07), as resources became depleted. Although body length and mass did not differ by sex, females maintained higher body condition (mass per unit length) throughout fasting. Newly-weaned females inhibited bacterial growth better than males, but this advantage disappeared after a month. Fatty reserves and plasma proteins were associated with immune responses later in fasting, but maternal feeding site and trophic level were not. However, endogenous resource use (measured as delta 15N values) was positively correlated with bacterial inhibition. Neutrophil counts and blood iron levels explained variation in inflammation. Our study shows that innate immune responses in a rapidly growing, capital-breeding mammal depend on maternal resources and reflect early sex differences and concurrent physiological challenges. Allocation of depleting resources during fasting drives trade-offs between immune function, growth, and development.

AB  - T-2 toxin belongs to the trichothecenes group A compound, mainly produced by Fusarium fungi. It has been shown that T-2 toxin could cross the placental barrier and breast milk, thus endangering the health of offspring. The present study aimed to explore the effects of maternal T-2 toxin exposure on the integrity of the intestinal barrier and the intestinal microflora of young mice. From late pregnancy (GD 14) to lactation (LD 21), pregnant mice were given T-2 toxin daily at 0, 0.005, or 0.05 mg T-2 toxin/kg BW. Postnatal day 21 (PND21), PND28, and PND56 young mice were chosen as objects to detect the influences of maternal T-2 toxin exposure to mice on the offspring. The results showed that maternal exposure to T-2 toxin disturbed the balance of the intestinal mi-crobial flora of the young mice. Villous adhesions and fusion of ileum were observed in T-2-treated groups. In addition, supplementation of T-2 toxin significantly decreased the gene expressions of Claudin 1, Occludin, Tjp1, Il10, Il6, and Tnf in PND 21. However, in PND 28, the expressions of Tnf were significantly increased. The ex-pressions of Claudin 1, Occludin, Tjp1, Il10, Il6 and Tnf were significantly increased after T-2 toxin treatment in PND 56. These results suggested that maternal exposure to T-2 toxin has negative influences on the intestine of young mice, which may be due to the alterations of microbial composition.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) visual tracking has always been a challenging task. Existing correlation filter tracking algorithms typically utilize the histograms of oriented gradients (HOGs) and color names (CNs) method to directly incorporate the extracted target features into the model updating process. However, low-resolution (LR) video quality leads to unstable target feature values. To address this limitation, we propose a novel preprocessing technique involving Gaussian denoising. This preprocessing step is designed to enhance the stability of the target's feature values and make the target's scale information clearer, thereby improving the tracker's recognition capability for the target and effectively reducing noise interference. Furthermore, in contrast to other UAV trackers that rely on a singular representation of contextual information, this article aims to enhance the utilization of historical information. Therefore, we introduce a context-based approach that integrates continuously weighted dynamic response maps from both temporal and spatial perspectives. Our tracker has the ability to adapt to rapid environmental changes during the tracking process while simultaneously reducing the potential risks of model overfitting and distortion. Extensive experiments are conducted on authoritative datasets, including DTB70, UAV123@10fps, and UAVDT, comparing our model against other advanced trackers. The experimental results validate the superior tracking performance and robustness of our tracker.

AB  - Background and aimSocial isolation stress (SIS) is a stressor known to trigger depressive behaviors. Psychiatric disorders are associated with neurobiological changes, such as neuroinflammation and an increase in nitric oxide (NO) signaling. Despite the well-established detrimental effects of SIS and the involvement of neuroinflammation and NO in depression, potential management strategies, especially resocialization, remain insufficiently explored. Our aim was to elucidate the effects of resocialization on depressive behaviors in socially isolated mice, with a focus on the possible involvement of neuroinflammation and nitrite in the hippocampus (HIP).MethodsWe utilized 24 Naval Medical Research Institute male mice, maintained under both social and isolation conditions (SC and IC). After the isolation period, the mice were divided into two groups of eight, including the SIS group and a resocialized group. The SC group was kept without exposure to isolation stress. We conducted the open-field test, forced swimming test, and splash test to evaluate depressive behaviors. Additionally, nitrite levels, as well as the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the HIP, were measured.ResultsThe study found that resocialization significantly reduces depressive behaviors in SIS mice. The results suggest that the antidepressive effects of resocialization may be partially due to the modulation of the neuroinflammatory response and nitrite levels in the HIP. This is supported by the observed decrease in hippocampal gene expression of IL-1 beta, TLR4, and TNF, along with a reduction in nitrite levels following resocialization.ConclusionThese insights could pave the way for new management strategies for depression, emphasizing the potential benefits of social interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary The Aleurocanthus camelliae cryptic species complex, which includes a number of morphospecies and/or haplotypes, is one of the growing biological issues, the underlying mechanism of which is still unknown. It is well-known that Wolbachia infection can produce significant mitochondrial divergence in insects, which may eventually result in cryptic speciation. Therefore, the diversity and phenotypic characteristics of Wolbachia natural infections in the A. camelliae cryptic species complex were investigated. Two morphospecies were found to have distinct infection statuses. A. spiniferus morphospecies was the uninfected population, while A. camelliae morphospecies was fixed for infections. The oscillation hypothesis is discussed in light of the current discovery of novel cryptic species of A. camelliae. This idea may offer insights into cryptic speciation, specifically on how specialization and host expansion have been observed among these species. Additionally, this research discovered a parasitoid wasp from the genus Eretmocerus in A. camelliae for the first time in Japan. Wolbachia, an alphaproteobacterial reproductive parasite, can cause profound mitochondrial divergence in insects, which might eventually be a part of cryptic speciation. Aleurocanthus camelliae is a cryptic species complex consisting of several morphospecies and/or haplotypes that are genetically different but morphologically indistinctive. However, little is known about the Wolbachia infection status in these tea and Citrus pests. Thus, this study aimed to profile the diversity and phenotypic characteristics of Wolbachia natural infections in the A. camelliae cryptic species complex. A monophyletic strain of Wolbachia that infected the A. camelliae cryptic species complex (wAlec) with different patterns was discovered. Whiteflies that are morphologically identical to Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Aleurocanthus cf. A. spiniferus in Eurya japonica and A. spiniferus in Citrus) were grouped into uninfected populations, whereas the fixed infection was detected in A. camelliae B1 from Theaceae. The rapid evolution of wAlec was also found to occur through a high recombination event, which produced subgroups A and B in wAlec. It may also be associated with the non-cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) phenotype of wAlec due to undetectable CI-related genes from phage WO (WOAlec). The current discovery of a novel cryptic species of A. camelliae led to a discussion about the oscillation hypothesis, which may provide insights on cryptic speciation, particularly on how specialization and host expansion have been recorded among these species. This study also identified a parasitoid wasp belonging to the genus Eretmocerus in A. camelliae, for the first time in Japan.

AB  - Several studies have highlighted the effect of Tea polyphenol (TPs) on growth performance and the gene regulation associated with the metabolic pathway and of various species. However, there is less information about the effect of TPs on growth performance and the regulation of genes related to the metabolic pathway of Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). Six diets with different TPs level (0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 mg/kg) were formulated. Result found that TPs increased the feed conversion efficiency (FCE) at different levels, and the highest FCE and specific growth rate (SGR) (p < 0.05) were achieved by the 500 mg/kg in the TPs group. Additionally, transcriptome sequencing of control and TPs groups was performed, and numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined in the metabolic pathway of grass carp. The differentially expressed genes were validated by the qRT-PCR technique. DEGs were associated with arachidonic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation. Our findings could provide new insight into the effect of TPs on growth performance and the regulation of genes associated with the metabolic pathway of grass carp.

The objective of this protocol is to allow comparisons between the available taxonomic information for species, and to provide objective criteria for assessing the information gaps for each taxon in order to prioritize topics for future investigation. Key aspects of taxonomic practice (condition of type specimens, helpfulness of descriptions and figures, compilation of distribution data, molecular data) were noted, the data were tabulated, and the taxa ranked. In addition, specific notes for each species have been included that may help to improve the solutions to the problems raised here.

AB  - Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) is closely related to late-onset depression (LOD). In addition, the benefits of metformin treatment of depression have been documented in a range of rodent studies and human trials, but few studies have probed into the effect of metformin on and the related mechanism in depressed elderly mice, especially in those APOE4 carriers. Here, we treated 13-month-old apoE3-targeted replacement (TR) and apoE4-TR mice with an intragastric administration of metformin (300 mg/kg/d) or normal saline for 5 months. We found that metformin exerted antidepressant effects on apoE4 mice, including reduced immobility time in TST and FST, and increased ratios of time and distance in the central area of OFT. Importantly, compared with apoE3 mice, apoE4 mice showed a higher expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1 and PDK4) in the hippocampus. The increased LDH level was rescued by metformin treatment. Moreover, the metformin administration increased the levels of transcriptional factor NRF-1 and TFAM, mtDNA, and most mitochondrial complex subunits in apoE-TR mice. Furthermore, it upregulated the expressions of antioxidant enzymes, such as MnSOD, GPX1, and GSR1/2. Interestingly, apoE4 blunted the hypoglycemic effect of metformin in aged mice. These data suggest that metformin ameliorates the depression-like behaviors probably by improving glucose metabolism and mitochondria biogenesis in the hippocampus of aged apoE4 mice. These findings imply that chronic metformin treatment can improve apoE4-mediated LOD, providing mechanistic insights for apoE4- and age-based depression prevention and therapy.

AB  - 5-HT4 receptors play an important role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. However, the effect of 5-HT4Rs on neural network activity and intercellular calcium signaling remains enigmatic. Using calcium imaging and original software, we determined the network-level characteristics of calcium dynamics within primary hippocampal cultures. We found that the single activation of 5-HT4 receptors by BIMU8 significantly reduced the correlation of activity within neuron-glial networks of primary cultures, without altering the proportion of active cells or the frequency of calcium events. In contrast, chronic stimulation of 5-HT4Rs promoted greater cell involvement in Ca2+ signal generation and increased the frequency of calcium events, while maintaining the connectivity level of the neuron-glial network. Moreover, our immunocytochemical labeling results indicated that chronic stimulation of 5-HT4Rs increased the size of both presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. The acute blockade of 5-HT4Rs by RS23597-190 exerted a marked inhibitory effect on calcium activity in primary hippocampal cultures. Network connectivity and correlation of calcium activity were disrupted, and the number of functional connections among cells sharply declined. Our study showed that 5-HT4 receptors exhibit diverse effects based on the type and duration of activation, mediating several key functions in regulating neural network calcium activity.

AB  - Fumane Cave, located in Northern Italy, is a major prehistoric site for understanding late Neandertal and early modern human behaviours. The cave contains a 12-m-thick stratigraphic sequence of Middle and Upper Palaeolithic layers, which have yielded a number of flint artefacts and faunal remains. The upper part of the stratigraphic sequence is well-dated using radiocarbon analysis, placing the last Middle Palaeolithic occupations at ca. 44-45 ka cal BP and the first Upper Palaeolithic occupations (Uluzzian and Aurignacian) after around 43 ka cal BP. However, the lower part of the stratigraphic sequence remains less well-documented chronologically. Previous thermoluminescence (TL) dating placed the entire sequence within the last climatic cycle, following the last Interglacial stage (MIS 5e). In this study, we present a revised chronology for the Middle Palaeolithic levels at Fumane Cave, based on combined Electronic Spin Resonance/Uranium (ESR/U)-series dating of herbivorous teeth spanning much of the sequence. Our results diverge from earlier TL data, indicating that the oldest layers date to MIS 7-6 (units S9-S3) and MIS 6-5 (units BR12-BR9). For the late Mousterian (units A11-A4) and the Upper Palaeolithic (unit A2), recalculated ages using new in situ gamma measurements align with existing radiocarbon and TL dates. However, our findings highlight the methodological challenges of applying ESR/U-series dating to samples younger than 50 ka, particularly in heterogeneous layers. These new results suggest that Middle Palaeolithic occupations at Fumane Cave spanned over 200 ka, covering the two most recent climatic cycles. This extended temporal framework parallels that of San Bernardino cave, another key site in Northern Italy, and underscores the prolonged presence of Levallois technology in the region.

AB  - Plant-insect interactions are a driving force into ecosystem evolution and community dynamics. Many insect herbivores enter diapause, a developmental arrest stage in anticipation of adverse conditions, to survive and thrive through seasonal changes. Herein, we investigated the roles of medium- to non-polar metabolites during larval development and diapause in a specialist insect herbivore, Chlosyne lacinia, reared on Aldama robusta leaves. Varying metabolites were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics. Sesquiterpenes and steroids were the main metabolites putatively identified in A. robusta leaves, whereas C. lacinia caterpillars were characterized by triterpenes, steroids, fatty acids, and long-chain alkanes. We found out that C. lacinia caterpillars biosynthesized most of the identified steroids and fatty acids from plant-derived ingested metabolites, as well as all triterpenes and long-chain alkanes. Steroids, fatty acids, and long-chain alkanes were detected across all C. lacinia instars and in diapausing caterpillars. Sesquiterpenes and triterpenes were also detected across larval development, yet they were not detected in diapausing caterpillars, which suggested that these metabolites were converted to other molecules prior to the diapause stage. Our findings shed light on the chemical content variation across C. lacinia development and diapause, providing insights into the roles of metabolites in plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Representatives of the subfamily Cylapinae (Insecta: Heteroptera: Miridae) mostly inhabit the subtropics and tropics. The group currently comprises five tribes: Bothriomirini, Cylapini, Fulviini, Rhinomirini, and Vanniini. Additionally, the Psallopinae are sometimes included in this subfamily as a tribe. The interrelationships within Cylapinae are unknown, the monophyly is doubtful, and a phylogenetic study focusing on the entire subfamily has never been published. The molecular and fossil data analyses show that Miridae occurred at least in the Jurassic. The divergence dates for Cyalpinae tribes are unknown. We performed the phylogenetic analysis of Cylapinae based on molecular and morphological data, in addition to a combined dataset. We calibrated the molecular trees with fossil data. The results suggested non-monophyly of Cylapinae. The monophyly of Bothriomirini was confirmed. Cylapini were rendered as non-monophyletic. The Cylapus complex formed a clade with Vanniini, and the monophyly of Vanniini was doubtful. Fulviini were recovered as non-monophyletic, and the representatives fell into two separate well-supported clades. Dating analyses showed that the groups of the suprageneric level distributed across different continents diverged near the boarder between Mesosoic and Cenosoic, that was also true for the Asian suprageneric groups and the South American Cylapus complex. Australian groups of genera diverged in the Cenozoic.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 is an efficient genome-editing tool, and the identification of editing sites and potential influences in the Camellia sinensis genome have not been investigated. In this study, bioinformatics methods were used to characterise the Camellia sinensis genome including editing sites, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), G-quadruplexes (GQ), gene density, and their relationships. A total of 248,134,838 potential editing sites were identified in the genome, and five PAM types, AGG, TGG, CGG, GGG, and NGG, were observed, of which 66,665,912 were found to be specific, and they were present in all structural elements of the genes. The characteristic region of high GC content, GQ density, and PAM density in contrast to low gene density and SSR density was identified in the chromosomes in the joint analysis, and it was associated with secondary metabolites and amino acid biosynthesis pathways. CRISPR/Cas9, as a technology to drive crop improvement, with the identified editing sites and effector elements, provides valuable tools for functional studies and molecular breeding in Camellia sinensis.

AB  - Simple Summary We have conducted a 10-year coprological study of animals housed in two zoological institutions with different housing conditions to assess parasite biodiversity and prevalence, their relationship with host class (mammal/bird), diet (carnivorous/omnivorous/herbivorous), and enclosure characteristics (soil type, isolation from wild fauna), and evaluated the risk of transmission to humans. A total of 4476 faecal samples from 132 mammal species and 951 samples from 86 avian species were examined, with 62.1% of mammal species and 12.8% of avian species testing positive. Statistically significant differences were found based on diet type; few carnivorous species were detected infected, primarily by nematodes, while many herbivorous and omnivorous species were primarily infected by protists. No statistically significant differences were observed based on soil type (artificial, natural, mixed) and isolation level (isolated/accessible). Several parasite species found in the study (Entamoeba spp., Giardia spp., Balantioides coli, Trichuris spp.) could potentially be transmitted between housed animals, wild fauna, and humans. Regular analyses of the animals and implementation and follow-up of health programs would minimise transmission risks between housed animals, wild fauna, and humans.Abstract We have conducted a 10-year-long coprological study of the animals housed in two zoological institutions (ZooAquarium and Faunia, Madrid, Spain) to assess the parasite biodiversity, prevalence, and their relation with host class, diet, and enclosure type (soil type and level of isolation from wild fauna). A total of 4476 faecal samples from 132 mammal species and 951 samples from 86 avian species were examined. The results indicated that only 12.8% of avian species had parasites at least once during the study period, whereas 62.1% of mammal species tested positive. Predominantly, protists (Entamoeba, flagellates, and ciliates) and nematodes (mainly Trichuris) were identified in the findings. Carnivorous species were primarily infected by nematodes, while herbivorous and omnivorous species were mainly infected by protists. The number of infected herbivorous and omnivorous species was significantly greater than carnivorous species. Differences were observed based on soil type (artificial, natural, mixed) and isolation level (isolated/accessible), but these differences were not statistically significant. Several parasites (Entamoeba spp., Giardia spp., Balantidoides coli, Trichuris spp.) could potentially be transmitted between humans and some mammals and birds. Regular animal analyses and a personnel health program in the institutions would minimise transmission risks between zoo animals, wildlife, and humans.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Reproductive management of sheep for autumnal lambing often require induction and synchronization of oestrus and ovulation, either for natural mating or artificial insemination, by the use of pharmacological treatments. Such treatments are mostly based on the administration of progesterone followed by a single intramuscular dose of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) at progesterone withdrawal. However, repeated eCG treatments in consecutive mating seasons can result in the outbreak of resistance with a rise of anti-eCG antibodies. Furthermore, the future use and availability of eCG appears to be strongly challenged by the highly active animal-rights movement because the hormone is obtained from pregnant mares. The present study demonstrated that the administration of glycerol-based formulations to milked ewes is a valid alternative to eCG treatment in reproductive management protocols based on the induction of ovulation with progesterone-releasing devices at the end of anoestrus period. The glucogenic treatment administration to late lactation dairy ewes at the end of the anoestrus period improved their metabolism without harming animal production or animal welfare, thus promoting a sustainable reproductive management of dairy sheep.
   This study investigated whether the administration of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) in a protocol to induce and synchronize ovulations before mating could be replaced by the administration of glycerol-based formulations in milked ewes at the end of their seasonal anoestrus. Forty-eight late-lactation dairy ewes of the Sarda breed were synchronized using sponges impregnated with progestogen and then joined with fertile rams (day (D) 0, ram introduction). From D-4 to D-1, the ewes received by gavage either 100 mL of a glucogenic mixture (70% glycerol, 20% propylene glycol and 10% water; GLU group; n = 24) or 100 mL of water (GON group; n = 24) twice daily. Moreover, on the day of sponge withdrawal (D-1), GON ewes received 200 IU of eCG. There were no differences in reproductive performances between groups. GLU ewes showed higher glycemia (p < 0.001), insulinemia (p < 0.05), plasma glycerol (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p < 0.001) and lower cholesterol (p < 0.001), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA; p < 0.05) and urea (p < 0.001). Plasma osmolality was higher in GLU but only 4 h after dosing (p < 0.001). Milk yield and milk composition were not affected by the treatments with exception of milk glycerol (p < 0.001) and milk urea (p < 0.001), which were higher and lower in GLU than GON ewes, respectively. In conclusion, the administration of the glucogenic mixture to late lactation dairy ewes at the end of anoestrus period resulted in reproductive responses as good as the ones obtained by the eCG treatment, suggesting that the objective of a sustainable reproductive management of dairy sheep can be successfully pursued.

AB  - In natural environments, general plant volatiles and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) serve as critical clues for predatory natural enemies in the search for prey. The insect olfactory system plays a vital role in perceiving plant volatiles including HIPVs. In this study, we found that HIPV (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT) and the plant volatile geranyl acetate (GA), two structurally similar chemicals, displayed electrophysiological activities on the antennae of the ladybird Hippodamia variegata, but were only attractive to adult females in behavior. Moreover, mated female ladybirds laid a significantly higher number of eggs on TMTT-treated and GA-treated cotton leaves compared to controls. Screening of female-biased odorant receptors (ORs) from the antennal transcriptomes, performing Xenopus oocytes expression coupled with two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, suggested that HvarOR28 specifically tuned to TMTT and GA. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the amino acid residues Tyr143 and Phe81 of HvarOR28 are the key site for binding with TMTT and GA. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) assay demonstrated that HvarOR28-silenced individuals demonstrated a notable decrease in electrophysiological responses, even female adults almost lost behavioral preference for the two compounds. Thus, it could be concluded that HvarOR28 in H. variegata contributes to facilitating egg laying through the perception of TMTT and GA. These findings may help to develop new olfactory modulators based on the behaviorally active ligands of HvarOR28.

AB  - With the identification of the Jaramillo geomagnetic subchron, the late Early Pleistocene vertebrate succession of the Quibas-Sima section (Quibas karstic complex, southern Spain) represents a time span scarcely recorded in Europe. To complete the existing chronostratigraphic framework published earlier by Pinero et al. (2020), we provide here additional new information about the lithostratigraphy and micromammal succession along the sedimentary sequence. Seven lithostratigraphic units have been differentiated (QS-1 to QS-7) at Quibas-Sima, documenting an almost continuous small mammal record, including representatives of the families Soricidae, Erinaceidae, Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, Arvicolidae, Muridae, Gliridae, Sciuridae, Leporidae and Ochotonidae. The small mammal association indicates that units QS-1 to QS-4 have an intermediate biostratigraphic position between the sites of Fuente Nueva 3 (ca.1.2 Ma) and Cueva Victoria (ca. 0.9 Ma). New numerical age result from the combined U-series/ESR dating of one equid tooth from QS-3 consistently support the general chronostratigraphic framework based on magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphic inferences by confirming a post-Olduvai age. Based on an estimation of the sedimentation rate during the Jaramillo subchron, these broad chronological constraints may be confidently refined to approx. 1.1-0.9 Ma for the whole sequence. While we acknowledge the existing uncertainty associated to this age range, it is nevertheless consistent with biostratigraphic evidence indicating that all stratigraphic units most likely do not significantly differ from a chronological point of view. Both independent proxies (biostratigraphy and the sedimentation rate) strongly suggest that the sedimentary sequence covers a relatively short time interval (<200 kyr). These results place the Quibas-Sima sequence as one of the longest and most complete pre-Jaramillo (QS-1) to Jaramillo (QS-2 to QS-5) continental vertebrate succession in Europe.

AB  - To understand groundwater pollution and its associated health hazards and to ensure the availability of a clean, safe, and sustainable water supply, comprehensive research plays a crucial role. This article presents an integrated investigation of groundwater conditions, hydrogeochemistry, and health implications arising from fluoride (F - ) and nitrate (NO 3 - ) contamination in eastern Ghana. Analysis of 107 samples revealed variable groundwater suitability for human consumption, as indicated by Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG) values ranging from 0.11 to 1.19. The study highlights significant variations in health hazard risks due to F - and NO 3 - exposure. Hazard indices (HIs) for nitrate ingestion range from 0.000 to 16.321, for fluoride ingestion from 0.000 to 17.426, and for the combined ingestion risks from 0.000 to 17.602. Dermal absorption risk for nitrate is minimal, with values between 0.000 and 0.049. Spatially distinct contamination and health risks were mapped using GIS, to pinpoint vulnerable localities in the study region. Hydrochemical investigations, confirmed by clustering and factor analyses, revealed that natural geological processes are the primary drivers of groundwater quality and mineralization, with limited anthropogenic impacts. Further, an artificial neural network model with an impressive R 2 of 0.976 and low statistical errors demonstrated strong potential for accurate prediction of groundwater quality. The holistic study approach significantly advances groundwater research in the region, paving the way for effective resource management strategies by revealing areas of concern, understanding the contamination drivers, and predicting future water quality with high accuracy.

AB  - (1) Background: Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is a persistent organic pollutant that is possibly carcinogenic to humans. It is still found in the environment, humans and animals, and in foods, including milk and dairy products; (2) Methods: The influence of the probiotic cultures Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LCR and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum LP on the possibility of effecting the biodegradation of HCB in dairy products fermented from mare milk was investigated, taking into account the product storage time (maximum 21 days). HCB content was determined using the GC/MS method; (3) Results: A strong negative Pearson correlation (p < 0.05) was found between HCB concentration and the refrigeration storage time of the fermented beverages. The highest HCB reduction was observed in milk fermented with both Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LCR and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum LP (78.77%), while the lowest was noted when only Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum LP was used (73.79%); (4) Conclusions: This pilot study confirmed that probiotics commonly used to give products health-promoting properties can also contribute to reducing the content of undesirable substances, and the bacterial cultures used might provide an alternative method for reducing HCB residues in fermented drinks.

AB  - Elephant populations are in decline worldwide. The Asian elephant is a listed endangered species with an estimated population that has halved in the last century with approximately 40,000 and 50,000 remaining, most of which are in India where conservation efforts have helped restore some populations. This study examines the role of protected areas to support elephant populations while minimizing the human-elephant conflict (HEC) that can arise when protected areas abut human settlement. Our study area is a typical protected area for elephants in Thailand: Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary. Limited food and water sources for elephants in the sanctuary have led to elephants entering nearby villages, damaging crops and property, with some human and elephant loss of life. The novel contribution of this study is using economic analysis to calculate the net present values of policy options that authorities have put forth to reduce HEC. The policies include varying combinations of ecosystem management, physical investments, and crop alterations. The combination of habitat improvement, physical barriers, and elephant contraception yields the highest net present values under a variety of simulations. This combination may not be sustainable over time, however, due to the limited capacity in the park to accommodate a growing elephant population. Thus, like other studies, this suggests the need for expansion of protected areas for wildlife.

AB  - Restrictive diets (RD) can influence the inflammatory phenotype of dams and their offspring. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of caloric restriction on the neuroinflammatory profile in the hippocampus and the short-term recognition memory of male offspring from RD-fed dams. Mice dams received standard diet ad libitum (CONT) or restrictive diet (RD; 30% reduction of CONT consumption) during pregnancy and lactation. Male pups were weaned at 21 days and randomly divided into two groups that received CONT or RD; groups were named according to maternal/offspring diets: CONT/CONT, CONT/RD, RD/CONT, and RD/RD. At 90 days old, short-term memory was assessed by the object recognition test (ORT); the inflammatory state of the hippocampus was analyzed by gene expression of sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) and inflammasome Nlrp3; and by protein expression of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Our results showed an improvement in short-term memory in RD-fed offspring. The expression of Sirt1 was higher in RD/CONT compared to CONT/CONT and decreased in RD/RD compared to CONT/RD. Nlrp3 gene expression showed an offspring effect, being decreased in RD-fed mice. TLR-4 expression was higher in RD/CONT compared to CONT/CONT, similarly to ZO-1 expression. However, ZO-1 also showed a maternal diet effect and increased expression in the offspring of RD dams. Our findings demonstrate that caloric restriction improved short-term recognition memory. However, a restrictive diet should be applied with caution; depending on the offspring's diet, it may not benefit the neuroinflammatory phenotype or cognition.

AB  - The generation of waste in agricultural and livestock industries, followed by inadequate treatment and uncontrolled disposal to natural recipients, results in significant environmental pollution. Thus, the efficient and integrated management of high-organic-load waste produced in such activities is a key factor for sustainability and the protection of aqueous matrices. In this work, we investigate an integrated management approach for the treatment of agricultural, high-organic-load waste via a combination of processes, with an ultimate goal to improve the characteristics of the final waste and enhance the valorization of the nutrients contained in it. Towards this direction, a waste mixture comprising pig waste, cheese dairy, and food residues was sequentially treated in a laboratory scale by anaerobic digestion, followed by activated sludge (aerobic-anoxic treatment), and last by adsorption using natural zeolite. The efficiency of two different adsorption routes was examined (magnetically agitated zeolite or packed zeolite column), while the effect of the granule sizes of zeolite (0-1 mm or 1.5-3 mm) was also evaluated with regards to the remediation of the final effluent. Excellent adsorption capacities were observed in all cases, with the larger-sized zeolite exhibiting a superior performance, while the granule size of zeolite significantly affected the lifetime of the packed columns, as the smaller-sized zeolite columns reached their saturation point faster than the larger-sized zeolite analogue. The average ammonium nitrogen removal in the column experiment was similar to 92%, while total phosphorus was similar to 68%, respectively. Overall, an almost complete remediation of the final effluent was observed when compared with the physicochemical parameters of the initial waste, with a similar to 96% chemical oxygen demand, similar to 79% total nitrogen, similar to 96% total phosphorus, and similar to 82% phenols concentration decrease, signifying the high performance of the sequential treatment strategy proposed herein.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) demonstrates a significantly high prevalence among swine populations. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high affinity for conserved epitopes of PRRSV can facilitate the development of a broad-spectrum detection method for this virus. This study identified two PRRSVspecific mAbs, designated 2B1 and 2C6, which recognized two conformation-dependent epitopes through indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot analysis. Further investigation via immunoprecipitation and eukaryotic expression studies confirmed that both mAbs specifically target the Nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV. Importantly, these two epitopes exhibit high conservation across PRRSV isolates, including DV, CH-1a, HuN4, NADC30-like strains, NADC34-like strains and VR2332. The mAb 2C6 was effectively blocked by sera from pigs positive for PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2. Consequently, a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA) based on 2C6 was developed to detect anti-PRRSV antibodies, achieving enhanced sensitivity and specificity. The results obtained using this method demonstrated a higher concordance rate compared to those derived from commercial kit. Additionally, a total of 451 animals from various provinces in China were sampled, revealing an overall IgG antibody seropositivity against PRRSV of 77.38 % (349/451), with nursery pigs at 33.48 % (151), growing pigs at 15.96 % (72), fattening pigs at 39.69 % (179) and sows at 10.86 % (49). Collectively, the established b-ELISA represents an optimal method for large-scale serological investigations into PRRSV antibodies within farming operations.

AB  - Aims: Cigarette smoke often induces pulmonary and systemic inflammation. In animal models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) tend to ameliorate these effects. We aimed to explore the local and systemic expression of cytokines in guinea pigs chronically exposed to cigarette smoke, and their modifications by MSC.Main methods: Concentrations of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, TSG-6, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and/or TIMP-2 in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) from animals exposed to tobacco smoke (20 cigarettes/day, 5 days/ week for 10 weeks) were determined, and mRNA expression of some of them was measured in lung tissue. Intratracheal instillation of allogeneic bone marrow MSC (5x106 cells in 1 ml) was done at week 2.Key findings: After cigarette smoke, IL-6 and IFN-gamma increased in serum and BALF, while IL-1 beta and IL-12 decreased in serum, and TSG-6 and TIMP-2 increased in BALF. IL-1 beta had a paradoxical increase in BALF. MSC had an almost null effect in unexposed animals. The intratracheal administration of MSC in guinea pigs exposed to cigarette smoke was associated with a statistically significant decrease of IL-12 and TSG-6 in serum, as well as a decrease of IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma and an increase in TIMP-1 in BALF. Concerning mRNA expression in lung tissue, cigarette smoke did not modify the relative amount of the studied transcripts, but even so, MSC decreased the IL-12 mRNA and increased the TIMP-1 mRNA.Significance: A single intratracheal instillation of MSC reduces the pulmonary and systemic proinflammatory pattern induced by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke in guinea pigs.Trial registration: Not applicable.

AB  - Metformin (Met) is a commonly used drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Currently, it has been found that Met can effectively reduce the incidence of stroke and exert anti-inflammatory effects. However, its role in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced nerve injury remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of Met in I/R-induced neuron injury as well as the underlying mechanism. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, which were then treated with different doses of Met. Neurological deficits of rats were measured at different times post-surgery. TTC staining was done to observe the volume of cerebral infarction. HE staining was performed to observe pathological changes of brain tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe the expression of inflammatory factors in the cerebral tissues. qRT-PCR method was used to detect the relative expression of PI3K, Akt mRNA in cells after 24 h of drug action. Western blot method was used to detect the expression of PI3K, p-PI3K, Akt, and p-Akt in hippocampus. What is more, in vitro experiments were performed on BV2 microglia to verify the role of Met against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). As a result, Met dose-dependently attenuated neurological deficits and neuronal apoptosis. Besides, Met administration also significantly reduced BV2 cells apoptosis and inflammatory response. Mechanistically, Met inactivated PI3K/Akt pathway induced by I/R and OGD, while it upregulated PI3K. In conclusion, Met protected rats from cerebral I/R injury via reducing neuronal apoptosis and microglial inflammation through PI3K/Akt pathway.

AB  - Schizophrenia is characterized by cognitive impairments and widespread structural brain abnormalities. Brain structure-cognition associations have been extensively studied in schizophrenia, typically involving individual cognitive domains or brain regions of interest. Findings in overlapping and diffuse brain regions may point to structural alterations in large-scale brain networks. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining whether brain structure-cognition associations can be explained in terms of biologically meaningful brain networks. Of 7,261 screened articles, 88 were included in a series of meta-analyses assessing publication bias, heterogeneity, and study quality. Significant associations were found between overall brain structure and eight MATRICS-inspired cognitive domains. Brain structure mapped onto the seven Yeo functionally defined networks and extraneous structures (amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum) typically showed associations with conceptually related cognitive domains, with higher-level domains (e.g., executive function, social cogni-tion) associated with more networks. These findings synthesize the extensive literature on brain structure and cognition in schizophrenia from a contemporary network neuroscience perspective and suggest that brain structure-cognition associations in schizophrenia may follow functional network architecture.

AB  - Solanaceous plants are ubiquitous and are able to colonize degraded, abandoned and metal polluted habitats. Members of the family have evolved interesting extrinsic and intrinsic traits to combat the metal toxicity in multiple ways. Indumentum constituted mostly of trichome layer provides structural defense for both biotic stress (herbivory, oviposition, microbial pathogenesis) and abiotic stress (like drought, heat, freezing, photooxidation and UV radiation). Plants with heavy metal tolerance can accumulate toxic heavy metals in their trichomes as a part of their elemental defense detoxification strategy. Apart from the canonical functions, trichomes support ion and metal homeostasis, including the sequestration, compartmentalization, accumulation and excretion of heavy metals in many ways. The trichomes in Solanaceae are known to have a key role in the detoxification of Cd, Ni, Pb and Zn. Expressed sequence tag (EST)-based large-scale gene analysis in tobacco has indicated that trichomes are biologically active and stress-responsive structures. Trichome secretions and exudates also play an active role in metal detoxification process. Given that trichomes provide chemical defense from heavy metal stresses in the form of sequestration and extrusion, the plants having trichomes have potential role in remediation of contaminated soils. Solanaceae trichomes can serve as important model tissues that can be modified to attenuate metal toxicity, serve as environmental indicators and enhance phytoremediation potential of the family.

AB  - Current assisted reproduction technologies (ART) are insufficient to cover the slice of the population needing to restore fertility, as well as to amplify the reproductive performance of domestic animals or endangered species. The design of dedicated reproductive scaffolds has opened the possibility to better recapitulate the reproductive 3D ovarian environment, thus potentially innovating in vitro folliculogenesis (ivF) techniques. To this aim, the present research has been designed to compare ovine preantral follicles in vitro culture on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)-based electrospun scaffolds designed with different topology (Random vs. Patterned fibers) with a previously validated system. The ivF performances were assessed after 14 days under 3D-oil, Two-Step (7 days in 3D-oil and on scaffold), or One-Step PCL protocols (14 days on PCL-scaffold) by assessing morphological and functional outcomes. The results show that Two- and One-Step PCL ivF protocols, when performed on patterned scaffolds, were both able to support follicle growth, antrum formation, and the upregulation of follicle marker genes leading to a greater oocyte meiotic competence than in the 3D-oil system. In conclusion, the One-Step approach could be proposed as a practical and valid strategy to support a synergic follicle-oocyte in vitro development, providing an innovative tool to enhance the availability of matured gametes on an individual basis for ART purposes.

AB  - Alternative mating tactics within mating systems are characterized by discrete patterns of spatio-temporal overlap with same-and opposite-sex conspecifics and mating-relevant outcomes. Socially monogamous "residents" maintain relatively small home range sizes, have territories that almost exclusively overlap with their mating partners, and are more likely to produce offspring than non-bonded "wandering" conspecifics. Because mating tactics appear to be so closely tied to patterns of space use, differences in spatial cognitive abilities might differentially impact individual males' decisions to adopt a particular mating tactic and/or how efficient they are within their chosen mating tactic. Yet few studies have considered how the hippocampus, a brain region important for encoding cognitive maps and for processing contextual information, might impact how individuals adopt mating tactics or the spatio-temporal behaviors closely associated with them. We assessed the impact of lesions to the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) region of the hippocampus on male prairie vole space use, reproductive success, and mating tactics in semi-natural outdoor field conditions. Interestingly, dCA1 lesions did not impact the proportion of males that adopted resident or wandering mating tactics, and dCA1 lesions did not impact a male's ability to form a pair bond in the lab. In contrast, we found that lesioning the dCA1 shifted the home range size of reproductively successful and unsuccessful males. Furthermore, we found that patterns of space use among residents were unaffected by dCA1 lesions, whereas wanderers with dCA1 lesions showed pronounced reductions of their space use habits and resembled non-lesioned residents. Collectively, our study supports the hypothesis that wanderer male prairie voles rely on dCA1-mediated spatial cognition to navigate their world in a way that resident males do not. Such differences might have implications for how individuals efficiently attract and defend mates, obtain resources, defend territories, and outcompete rivals.

AB  - Recent advances in Colletotrichum taxonomy have led to the need to conduct fresh surveys of Colletotrichum species associated with important crops. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is one of the destructive diseases on Camellia sinensis. In this study, a total of 22 representative Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from diseased leaves of Ca. sinensis cultivated in four tea plantation regions in Anhui Province of China. The isolates were identified based on multilocus (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, TUB2, GAPDH) phylogenetic analyses, and their morphological characteristics were also analyzed. Twenty-one isolates belonging to C. gloeosporioides complex were identified as C. camelliae, C. fructicola, and C. siamense. One isolate belonging to C. boninense complex was identified as C. karstii. Pathogenicity tests revealed that the isolates of C. camelliae and C. fructicola were highly virulent when inoculated on the leaves of detached twigs of Ca. sinensis cv. Shuchazao. Furthermore, it was found that the interspecies virulence was less distinct and individual isolates showed varied virulence when inoculated on different varieties of Ca. sinensis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii causing anthracnose on Ca. sinensis in Anhui Province, China.

AB  - Soil acidity is one of the major soil-degradation events throughout the world, and the long-term application of nitrogenous fertilizers is thought to be a main cause of soil acidity. In the present experiment, we collected soil and tea (Camellia sinensis L.) leaf samples from five representative tea gardens in Bangladesh and evaluated soil nutrient pools and biochemical properties of tea leaves. The results showed that there was a negative relationship between soil pH and the amount of applied nitrogenous fertilizers. Moreover, continuous application of traditional fertilizers over twenty-five years promoted not only the deficiency of phosphorus (P) and mineral-based cations, such as potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+), but also increased manganese (Mn2+) and aluminum (Al3+) toxicity in soils, which suppressed the yield and quality of tea. Crucially, tea leaf production remained almost similar (average 1079.77 kg ha(-1)) from 1995 to 2015, while the application doses of urea, TSP, and MoP increased by 24.69%, 18.92%, and 16.67%, respectively, in garden soils. However, the pH value of soil declined up to 24% from 1992 to 2020 in the tested gardens. Consequently, the availability of K+, P, Ca2+, and Mg2+ decreased by 56%, 25%, 55%, and 49%, respectively, in those tea garden soils. In addition, the quality of tea leaves was severely affected, as evident by the reduced levels of total flavonoids, polyphenols, soluble solids, vitamin C, vitamin B1, and vitamin B2. Moreover, free-radical scavenging activity (DPPH), caffeine, and tannin concentration were increased in tea leaves, which indicated that tea plants were potentially being stressed. Therefore, we study concluded that long-term application of traditional nitrogenous fertilizers can be an important regulator of lowering garden soil pH, which reduces native soil nutrient pools and thereby the yield and quality of tea leaves.

AB  - Simple Summary During the weaning period, the change of feed and separation from ewe induce weaning stress and may affect the growth and health of kids. The application of antibiotics could relieve weaning stress; however, their prophylactic application coerces researchers to find antibiotic alternatives to relieve weaning stress. Fucoidan is a natural plant extract widely used in animal production with antioxidant and immune-modulatory properties resulting in beneficial effects on the intestinal tract. In the present study, fucoidan dietary supplementation boosted antioxidant and immune functions, improved the morphology of the intestinal tract and promoted the growth performance of kids. These results indicated that fucoidan could be used to alleviate weaning stress in kids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fucoidan dietary supplementation on growth performance, organs' relative weight, serum anti-oxidation markers, immune function indices and intestinal morphology in weaned kids. A total of 60 2-month-old weaned castrated male kids (Chuanzhong black goat) were used for this 30-day experiment and randomly allocated to four groups. The control group (CON) fed a basal diet, while the other three groups were provided with the same diet further supplemented with fucoidan at 0.1%, 0.3% or 0.5%, namely, F1, F2 and F3 groups, respectively. The results indicated that dietary fucoidan supplementation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the activity of catalase (CAT) when compared to the CON group on day 15. Moreover, the addition of fucoidan at 0.3% and 0.5% significantly increased (p < 0.05) the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD). On day 30, dietary fucoidan supplementation significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the feed conversion rate (FCR), contents of tumor necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while it significantly increased (p < 0.05) the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), the content of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the villus height (VH) of the duodenum. Moreover, dietary 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan supplementation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the villus height (VH) of the jejunum and ileum and significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the crypt depth (CD) of ileum. In conclusion, dietary fucoidan had positive effects on growth performance, serum anti-oxidation, immune function and intestinal morphology of weaned kids.

AB  - Identifying the genes relevant for muscle development is pivotal to improve meat production and quality in pigs. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a thiol zinc-metalloendopeptidase, has been known to regulate the myogenic process of mouse and rat myoblast cell lines, while its myogenic role in pigs remained elusive. Therefore, the current study aimed to identify the effects of IDE on the proliferation and apoptosis of porcine skeletal muscle stem cells (PSMSCs) and underlying molecular mechanism. We found that IDE was widely expressed in porcine tissues, including kidney, lung, spleen, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Then, to explore the effects of IDE on the proliferation and apoptosis of PSMSCs, we subjected the cells to siRNA-mediated knockdown of IDE expression, which resulted in promoted cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. As one of key transcription factors in myogenesis, MYOD, its expression was also decreased with IDE knockdown. To further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, RNA sequencing was performed. Among transcripts perturbed by the IDE knockdown after, a downregulated gene myostatin (MSTN) which is known as a negative regulator for muscle growth attracted our interest. Indeed, MSTN knockdown led to similar results as those of the IDE knockdown, with upregulation of cell cycle-related genes, downregulation of MYOD as well as apoptosis-related genes, and enhanced cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings suggest that IDE regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of PSMSCs via MSTN/MYOD pathway. Thus, we recruit IDE to the gene family of regulators for porcine skeletal muscle development and propose IDE as an example of gene to prioritize in order to improve pork production.

AB  - Coprophilous species of Coprinopsis sect. Niveae, commonly known as "snow inkcap", are widespread in pastoral areas; however, wide sampling approaches are needed to discover new taxa and to clarify the taxonomic status of the so-called "snow inkcap". Nationwide field work was conducted in China with a detailed record collected of the distribution and the animal origin of the dung. A four-loci phylogenetic study of Coprinopsis sect. Niveae was conducted based on the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), the ribosomal large subunit (LSU), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-alpha)], and the mitochondria small ribosomal RNA subunit (mtSSU). Fourteen phylogenetic species were assigned to this section, including six novel species, namely Coprinopsis furfuracea, C. iliensis, C. khorqinensis, C. sericivia, C. subigarashii, and C. tenuipes. Macro-, micro-, and ultramicro-morphological observations of species collected from China were also conducted and the detailed descriptions and illustrations of the novel species are provided. Our studies revealed that the different origin of herbivore dung, the distribution, the color and thickness of the pileus, the shape of stipes, the shape and size of basidiospores, and the presence or absence of pleurocystidia can be used as characteristics for distinguishing species in sect. Niveae. The key to species belonging to this section is also provided.

AB  - This study analyses long-term trends in sheep meat production using data collected over a period of more than 50 years, which includes a wide variety of regions with different production systems and challenges. The production of meat is of significant importance to global food security and nutrition, providing sources of protein and essential nutrients. Using ARIMA modelling, the research evaluates historical patterns and forecasts future dynamics, providing valuable insights into the global sheep meat industry. Global sheep meat production trends were analyzed by examining major producer countries, including Algeria, Australia, China, New Zealand, and T & uuml;rkiye, as well as the European Union, a significant collective producer, and overall global production, thereby highlighting regional differences in production trends and the crucial factors influencing each. The findings indicate that China is expected to maintain its growth trend, whereas production in the European Union may continue to decline in the short term without strategic interventions. ARIMA projections indicate that production in Algeria and T & uuml;rkiye is likely to remain at a consistent growth trend, while Australia and New Zealand are expected to decline following marginal fluctuations. Although the European Union countries are still among the first 3 with the highest production capacity, it was found that the trend of decline in recent years is likely to persist. On a global scale, there is a projected annual increase in sheep meat production. By utilising these forecasts, the global sheep meat industry can more effectively manage the challenges and thereby ensure an ongoing role in the global food system. The present study underscores the vital necessity for long-term planning and international collaboration to ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of sheep meat production on a global scale.

AB  - Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11), also known as RANKL, plays a crucial role in regulating several physiological and pathological activities. Additionally, it is a vital factor in bone physiology, and the sex hormone progesterone regulates the expansion of stem cells and the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. It is essential for animal growth and reproductive physiological processes. This study aimed to evaluate the tissue-specific expression characteristics and promoter activity of the TNFSF11 gene in pigs. As a result, the study examined the presence of TNFSF11 expression in the tissues of Xiangsu pigs at 0.6 and 12 months of age. Moreover, the core promoter region of TNFSF11 was also identified by utilizing a combination of bioinformatic prediction and dual-luciferase activity tests. Finally, the effect of transcription factors on the transcriptional activity of the core promoter region was determined using site-directed mutagenesis. TNFSF11 was uniformly expressed in all tissues; however, its expression in muscles was comparatively low. The core promoter region of TNFSF11 was located in the -555 to -1 region. The prediction of the transcription start site of TNFSF11 gene-2000 similar to + 500bp showed that there was a CpG site in 17 similar to + 487bp. Analysis of mutations in the transcription factor binding sites revealed that mutations in the Stat5b, Myog, Trl, and EN1 binding sites had significant effects on the transcriptional activity of the TNFSF11 gene, particularly following the EN1 binding site mutation (P < 0.001). This study provides insights into both the tissue-specific expression patterns of TNFSF11 in the tissues of Xiangsu pigs and the potential regulatory effects of transcription factors on its promoter activity. These results may be helpful for future research aimed at clarifying the expression and role of the porcine TNFSF11 gene.

AB  - Neurons are highly polarized cells, with axons that may innervate distant target regions. In the brain, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) possess extensive axons that project to several target regions such as the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, and may be exposed to a specific microenvironment in their axon targets that may have retrograde effects on neuronal health. Interestingly, BFCNs express the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR throughout life while also concomitantly co-expressing all Trk receptors, making them capable of responding to both mature and precursor neurotrophins to promote survival or apoptosis, respectively. Levels of these trophic factors may be modulated in the BFCN axon or soma microenvironment under neurodegenerative conditions such as seizure and brain injury. In this protocol, BFCNs are established in microfluidic devices for compartmental culture, with the aim of studying the effects of axon- or soma-specific stimulation of BFCNs for an in vitro representation of distal axon vs. soma environments as seen in vivo. This study further establishes a novel method of tracing and imaging live BFCNs exposed to stimuli in their distal axons with the aim of assessing retrograde cell death. The in vitro compartmental culture system of BFCNs that allows live imaging may be applied to investigate various effects of axon- or soma-specific stimuli that affect BFCN health, maintenance, and death, to model events that occur in the context of brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Many clinical trials repeatedly measure several longitudinal outcomes on patients. Patient follow-up can discontinue due to an outcome-dependent event, such as clinical diagnosis, death, or dropout. Joint modeling is a popular choice for the analysis of this type of data. Using example data from a prodromal Alzheimer's disease trial, we propose a new type of multivariate joint model in which longitudinal brain imaging outcomes and memory impairment ratings are allowed to be associated both with time to open-label medication and dropout, and where the brain imaging outcomes may also directly affect the memory impairment ratings. Existing joint models for multivariate longitudinal outcomes account for the correlation between the longitudinal outcomes through the random effects, often by assuming a multivariate normal distribution. However, for these models, it is difficult to interpret how the longitudinal outcomes affect each other. We model the dependence between the longitudinal outcomes differently so that a first longitudinal outcome affects a second one. Specifically, for each longitudinal outcome, we use a linear mixed-effects model to estimate its trajectory, where, for the second longitudinal outcome, we include the linear predictor of the first outcome as a time-varying covariate. This facilitates an easy and direct interpretation of the association between the longitudinal outcomes and provides a framework for latent mediation analysis to understand the underlying biological processes. For the trial considered here, we found that part of the intervention effect is mediated through hippocampal brain atrophy. The proposed joint models are fitted using a Bayesian framework via MCMC simulation.

AB  - Cold-acclimated and non-acclimated contrasting Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) biotypes were investigated for changes in stress-associated biomarkers, including antioxidant enzyme activity, lipid peroxidation, protein, and proline content. In addition, a well-known freezing tolerance pathway participant known as C-repeat/DRE-binding factors (CBFs), an inducer of CBF expression (ICE1), and a cold-regulated (COR6.6) genes of the ICE-CBF-COR pathway were studied at the transcriptional level on the doubled-haploid (DH) lines. Freezing stress had significant effects on all studied parameters. The cold-acclimated DH34 (a freezing-tolerant line) showed an overall better performance under freezing stress than non-acclimated plants. The non-cold-acclimated DH08 (a frost-sensitive line) showed the highest electrolyte leakage after freezing stress. The highest activity of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) was also detected in non-acclimated plants, whereas the cold-acclimated plants showed lower enzyme activities upon stress treatment. Cold acclimation had a significantly positive effect on the total protein and proline content of stressed plants. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed significant differences in the expression and cold-inducibility of CsCBF1-3, CsICE1, and CsCOR6.6 genes among the samples of different treatments. The highest expression of all CBF genes was recorded in the non-acclimated frost-tolerant biotype after freezing stress. Interestingly a significantly higher expression of COR6.6 was detected in cold-acclimated samples of both frost-sensitive and -tolerant biotypes after freezing stress. The presented results provide more insights into freezing tolerance mechanisms in the Camelina plant from both a biochemical point of view and the expression of the associated genes.

AB  - In the atria, the rapid delayed rectifier channel (I-Kr) is a critical contributor to repolarization. In lipotoxic atria, increased activity of the serine/threonine mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may remodel I-Kr and predispose patients to arrhythmias. To investigate whether mTOR produced defects in I-Kr channel function (protein expression and gating mechanisms), electrophysiology and biochemical assays in HEK293 cells stably expressing hERG1a/1b, and adult guinea pig atrial myocytes were used. Feeding with the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid high-fat diet (HFD) was used to induce lipotoxicity. Lipotoxicity-challenged HEK293 cells displayed an increased density of hERG1a/1b currents due to a targeted and significant increase in hERG1b protein expression. Furthermore, lipotoxicity significantly slowed the hERG1a/1b inactivation kinetics, while the activation and deactivation remained essentially unchanged. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibition with rapamycin (RAP) reversed the increase in hERG1a/1b density and inactivation. Compared to lipotoxic myocytes, RAP-treated cells displayed action potential durations (APDs) and I-Kr densities similar to those of controls. HFD feeding triggered arrhythmogenic changes (increased the I-Kr density and shortened the APD) in the atria, but this was not observed in low-fat-fed controls. The data are the first to show the modulation of I-Kr by mTORC1, possibly through the remodeling of hERG1b, in lipotoxic atrial myocytes. These results offer mechanistic insights with implications for targeted therapeutic options for the therapy of acquired supraventricular arrhythmias in obesity and associated pathologies.

AB  - Renewable energy production in biogas plants seems to be recognised in literature from the environmental perspective. However, innovative technologies are still launched to improve energy efficiency. In this perspec-tive, the authors developed the patented hybrid pump to improve the yield of methane production and reduce the environmental impact of renewable energy production. This research assesses the environmental performance of an innovative, patented hybrid pump designed for mixing the input of anaerobic digestion of pig slurry, based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The comparative environmental analysis of two different mixing systems installed in the pilot biogas plant was conducted on the basis of the selected impact categories. The application of innovative mixing technology with a hybrid pump increased the percentage yield of methane in biogas from slurry by about 10% compared to a conventional hydraulic pump. The application of a hybrid pump in the tested biogas plant reduced the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) ratio by almost 30% compared to a conventional hydraulic pump. A similar level was obtained for other environmental impact ratios in terms of global warming potential, abiotic depletion of fossil fuels, human toxicity, acidification, and eutrophication.

AB  - Cerebral amyloid angiopathy or CAA is a type of vascular dementia that can cause neuroinflammation, ischemia and hemorrhage, among other complications. CAA results from the deposition of amyloid beta (A beta) in blood vessels and is frequently observed in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). One functional output of those pathological changes is measurable cognitive decline. Still not well understood, however, is the impact of gender or sex on the pathology of CAA, as well as CAA-induced cognitive decline. Here, we studied how sex impacts deposition of CAA-related pathology and the associated cognitive decline. We observed differential hippocampal pathology as far as regions of deposition, type of morphology, and total amount of pathology when assessing CAA pathology via (E,E)-1-fluoro-2,5-bis-(3-hydroxycarbonyl-4-hydroxy)styrylbenzene (FSB)-labeling, as well as neurodegeneration via Fluoro Jade C (FJC)-labeling, and lysosomal associated membrane protein deposition via LAMP-1 labeling. In accordance with other studies, our data suggest female TG-SwDI mice exhibit more severe pathological alterations in CAA pathology. Additionally, behavioral assessments revealed an impact of genotype that was more pronounced in TG-SwDI females. While the primary measure of learning and memory, the water maze, suggests an overall effect of genotype, effects in measures of locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior suggest reduced habituation in females. This could be due to a lower retention for the tasks. Results of this study offer significant insight into the importance of examining effects of sex on CAA.

AB  - In previous research, we found that chronic-intermittent ethanol administration (CIEA), a model of binge drinking, impaired emotional memory in mice, and this impairment was counteracted by the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of CIEA on spatial memory and cognitive flexibility in adolescent mice of both sexes. Animals were randomly assigned to one of four groups for each sex: SS (saline + saline), SA (saline + alcohol), SI (saline + indomethacin), and AI (alcohol + indomethacin). They were injected with saline, ethanol (3 g/kg) or indomethacin (10 mg/kg) for the first three days of each week, throughout three weeks. 96 h after treatment, subjects learnt a standard water maze task on five consecutive days (4-day training and 1-day probe trial). One day later, mice underwent a reversal task for evaluating spatial cognitive flexibility. Animals receiving alcohol (SA and AI groups) did not differ from controls (SS groups) during the standard task, but animals treated with indomethacin performed better than controls, both in the acquisition trials and the probe trial. During the reversal task, no significant differences between alcohol groups and controls were observed, but the indomethacin group showed significant lower escape latencies than controls. No sex differences were found in either task. In conclusion, binge drinking does not impair spatial memory or spatial cognitive flexibility, while the anti-inflammatory indomethacin improves both, showing that the effects of alcohol and indomethacin on spatial memory (dependent on hippocampus) are different to those they exert on emotional memory (dependent on amygdala).

AB  - Listeriosis is a disease that is induced by infection with the Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Much is still unknown about the pathogenesis of encephalitic listeriosis. We aimed to identify the contribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), S100, and acute-phase proteins (APPs) in pathogenesis, clinical and preclinical diagnosis of natural cases of encephalitic listeriosis. Of 1,325 Ossimi sheep, 64 were suspected of having listeriosis from 2018 to 2020. Prospective cohort evaluation of clinical and postmortem findings was performed, in addition to bacterial isolation, the measurement of APPs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of GFAP, S100, and E-cadherin. Infected sheep showed nervous symptoms ranging from neck stretching to complete paralysis. APPs were significantly increased in the CSF of both clinically and preclinically diseased animals; however, serum APPs were only significantly increased in clinically diseased animals. Histopathological evaluation revealed microabscesses, meningoencephalitis, and perivascular cuffing of the brainstem of infected sheep. Immunohistochemical investigations revealed strong expression of GFAP and S100 in necrotic areas and negative expression of E-cadherin. The measurement of CSF APPs could be useful in the preclinical diagnosis of sheep listeriosis. GFAP and S100 proteins could be involved in the pathogenesis of listeriosis; however, E-cadherin does not appear to be involved.

AB  - Background Cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian tissue (OTCTP) represent a promising fertility preservation technique for prepubertal patients or for patients requiring urgent oncological management. However, a major obstacle of this technique is follicle loss due to, among others, accelerated recruitment of primordial follicles during the transplantation process, leading to follicular reserve loss in the graft and thereby potentially reducing its lifespan. This study aimed to assess how cryopreservation itself impacts follicle activation. Results Western blot analysis of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt and mTOR signalling pathways showed that they were activated in mature or juvenile slow-frozen murine ovaries compared to control fresh ovaries. The use of pharmacological inhibitors of follicle signalling pathways during the cryopreservation process decreased cryopreservation-induced follicle recruitment. The second aim of this study was to use in vitro organotypic culture of cryopreserved ovaries and to test pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt and mTOR pathways. In vitro organotypic culture-induced activation of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway is counteracted by cryopreservation with rapamycin and in vitro culture in the presence of LY294002. These results were confirmed by follicle density quantifications. Indeed, follicle development is affected by in vitro organotypic culture, and PI3K/PTEN/Akt and mTOR pharmacological inhibitors preserve primordial follicle reserve. Conclusions Our findings support the hypothesis that inhibitors of mTOR and PI3K might be an attractive tool to delay primordial follicle activation induced by cryopreservation and culture, thus preserving the ovarian reserve while retaining follicles in a functionally integrated state.

Feral cats (Felis catus) are a major predator of many native Australian mammals and a significant contributor to translocation failure in this group. However, identifying cat predation as the cause of mortality in the field is challenging and can hinder or delay the implementation of appropriate management actions. We compared field and genetic data collected from 92 cat predation events that occurred during native mammal translocations in South Australia. Our study found that necropsy and genetic evidence obtained through DNA analysis were the most reliable methods for identifying feral cat predation. Field evidence such as cat tracks, scats or collar bite marks were recorded infrequently and inconsistently. Relying solely on field evidence will significantly underestimate predation by feral cats on translocated species and even DNA evidence was found to underestimate impact. We demonstrated the value of intensively monitoring translocated animals post-release so as to facilitate prompt collection of multiple lines of evidence such as necropsy, field evidence and reliable DNA samples. An absence of field evidence should not be used to discount cat predation as a potential cause of mortality in translocation programs.

AB  - Silflower (Silphium integrifolium (Michaux)) is a native North American relative of sunflower that is undergoing domestication as a perennial oilseed crop. As silflower incurs pest damage from multiple insect species, it is necessary to screen genotypes for their effect on insect performance such that more pest tolerant/resistant accessions can be incorporated into future silflower breeding programs. We present a bioassay protocol for silflower using the generalist herbivore fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)). In this study, fall armyworm larvae were placed on leaf and flower tissue from eleven silflower genotypes, one cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum (L.) (Asterales: Asteraceae)) genotype, and an inbred sunflower line (Helianthus annuus (L.) (Asterales: Asteraceae), HA89). Caterpillar weight gained during a 4-d feeding period significantly differed on leaf and floral tissue from different silflower genotypes, between the Silphium species (silflower and cup plant), and between Silphium genotypes and annual sunflower. Two wild silflower genotypes produced lower larval weight gain on both the floral and leaf tissue than all other genotypes, suggesting these genotypes have either lower nutrition or greater resistance to fall armyworm. However, nonsignificant correlations between larval growth on floral versus leaf tissue across all plant species tested and among all silflower accessions suggest insect performances on these tissue types in silflower are independent. Along with identifying germplasm of interest for silflower breeding programs, we established an easily replicable bioassay protocol using fall armyworm on silflower floral and leaf tissues.

AB  - Road transport systems kill millions of animals on every inhabited continent each year, and thousands of human lives are lost. Odour repellents (ORE) are a WVC mitigation measure which have been extensively applied across central Europe to prevent or minimise the number of ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVCs). OREs aim to increase the vigilance of ungulates near roads and therefore change their behaviour in areas where vehicle collisions may occur. Despite many scientific papers on the topic of odour repellent effectiveness, a lack of behavioural studies means there is still little understanding of the mechanism of ORE functionality. OREs are applied as an area repellent, so their effectiveness is influenced by multiple factors, and constantly discussed by both academics and the lay public. This paper summarises the state of knowledge about application and effectiveness of odour repellents in road ecology, and suggests research questions to fill information gaps.

AB  - The porcine gut is increasingly regarded as a useful translational model. The enteric nervous system in the colon coordinates diverse functions. However, knowledge of the molecular profiling of porcine enteric nerve system and its similarity to that of human is still lacking. We identified the distinct transcriptional programs associated with functional characteristics between inner submucosal and myenteric ganglia in porcine proximal and distal colon using bulk RNA and single-cell RNA sequencing. Comparative transcriptomics of myenteric ganglia in corresponding colonic regions of pig and human revealed highly conserved programs in porcine proximal and distal colon, which explained >96% of their transcriptomic responses to vagal nerve stimulation, suggesting that porcine proximal and distal colon could serve as predictors in translational studies. The conserved programs specific for inflammatory modulation were displayed in pigs with vagal nerve stimulation. This study provides a valuable transcriptomic resource for understanding of human colonic functions and neuromodulation using porcine model.
   Single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses between dissected components of the pig and human colonic enteric nervous system provide insight into the relevance of pig models for understanding human colonic function and neuromodulation.

AB  - The microRNA (miR)-432 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of two breeds of lactating sheep with different milk production traits, and between the non-lactating and peak-lactation periods, but there have been no reports describing the molecular mechanisms involved. In this study, the effect of miR-432 on the proliferation of ovine mammary epithelial cells (OMECs) and the target genes of miR-432 were investigated. The effects of miR-432 on the expression of the target genes and the content of triglycerides in the OMECs were also analyzed. Transfection with a miR-432 mimic was found using CCK8 and Edu assays, to inhibit the viability of OMECs and reduce the number of proliferated OMECs. In contrast, a miR-432 inhibitor had the opposite effect to the miR-432 mimic, and together these results suggest that miR-432 inhibits the proliferation of OMECs. A dual luciferase assay revealed that the genes for stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are targeted by miR-432. The transfection of miR-432 mimic into OMECs resulted in decreases in the expression of SCD and LPL, and three other milk fat synthesis marker genes; FABP4, LPIN1 and ACACA. The mimic also decreased the content of triglycerides. The miR-432 inhibitor had the opposite effect to the mimic on the expression of these genes and the level of triglycerides. This is the first study to reveal the biological mechanisms by which miR-432 inhibits milk fat synthesis in sheep.

AB  - Nitrogen fertilizer increases agricultural yields but increases economic costs and causes a series of environmental problems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have the potential to be used as biological fertilizer. However, the influence of nitrogen form on plant growth responsiveness to AMF inoculation is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of Funneliformis mosseae on growth, root morphology and photosynthetic characteristics of Camellia oleifera under different nitrogen forms during three harvest periods and clarified the most suitable nitrogen form for C. oleifera-AMF symbiosis. The results showed that urea, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen promoted plant growth and photosynthetic capacity, among which urea treatment had the highest value in all three harvests. No significant difference in plant growth parameters was observed between ammonium and nitrate nitrogen treatments in the first two harvests, while the plant height was significantly lower under ammonium nitrogen treatment than nitrate nitrogen treatment in the third harvest. Inoculation with F. mosseae in the presence of indigenous AMF could promote AMF colonization and plant growth at all three harvest times. Inoculation with F. mosseae significantly increased gas exchange parameters, the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and the actual photochemical efficiency (phi PSII). Inoculation with AMF increased the photochemical quenching coefficient (qP) better under urea treatment and improved the non-photochemical quenching coefficient (qN) better under ammonium nitrogen treatment. Principal component analysis showed that urea is the most beneficial nitrogen fertilizer for C. oleifera-AMF symbiosis. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the combination use of AMF and nitrogen fertilizer in agroforestry.

AB  - Simple Summary Premature birth disrupts the continuity of bodily contact between mother and newborn, leading to greater prevalence of physiological, cognitive, and behavioral difficulties among prematurely born children. We followed a group of mothers and preterm infants who received skin-to-skin contact (Kangaroo Care, KC) in the neonatal period, as compared to a matched group who received standard incubator care, from birth to adulthood. Our aim was to investigate how a touch-based neonatal intervention shaped three outcomes in young adulthood: anxiety and depressive symptoms, levels of oxytocin, and markers of the immune system. Findings indicated that the effects of KC on adult outcomes were indirect and stemmed from its impact on mother, child, and the dyad across infancy, childhood, and adolescence. KC reduced maternal anxiety and depression in infancy, improved infant attention and child executive functions, and increased mother-child synchrony across development. These effects were interconnected and led to improved outcomes in adulthood. Our study uniquely describes mechanisms by which a birth intervention can influence adult outcomes through step-by-step enhancement and provides valuable insights into the topic of "developmental continuity", a key controversy in developmental research. Premature birth disrupts the continuity of maternal-newborn bodily contact, which underpins the development of physiological and behavioral support systems. Utilizing a unique cohort of mother-preterm dyads who received skin-to-skin contact (Kangaroo Care, KC) versus controls, and following them to adulthood, we examined how a touch-based neonatal intervention impacts three adult outcomes; anxiety/depressive symptoms, oxytocin, and secretory immunoglobulin A (s-IgA), a biomarker of the immune system. Consistent with dynamic systems' theory, we found that links from KC to adult outcomes were indirect, mediated by its effects on maternal mood, child attention and executive functions, and mother-child synchrony across development. These improvements shaped adult outcomes via three mechanisms; (a) "sensitive periods", where the infancy improvement directly links with an outcome, for instance, infant attention linked with higher oxytocin and lower s-IgA; (b) "step-by-step continuity", where the infancy improvement triggers iterative changes across development, gradually shaping an outcome; for instance, mother-infant synchrony was stable across development and predicted lower anxiety/depressive symptoms; and (c) "inclusive mutual-influences", describing cross-time associations between maternal, child, and dyadic factors; for instance, from maternal mood to child executive functions and back. Findings highlight the long-term impact of a birth intervention across development and provide valuable insights on the mechanisms of "developmental continuity", among the key topics in developmental research.

AB  - Once outside the synaptic cleft, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is rapidly bound by its high-affinity transporters, which are expressed in abundance on the surface of perisynaptic astroglia. While this binding and the subsequent uptake of glutamate constrain excitatory transmission mainly within individual synapses, there is growing evidence for the physiologically important extrasynaptic actions of glutamate. However, the mechanistic explanation and the scope of such actions remain obscure. Furthermore, a significant proportion of glutamate molecules initially bound by transporters could be released back into the extracellular space before being translocated into astrocytes. To understand the implications of such effects, we simulated the release, diffusion, and transporter and receptor interactions of glutamate molecules in the synaptic environment. The latter was represented via trial-by-trial stochastic generation of astroglial and neuronal elements in the brain neuropil (overlapping spheroids of varied sizes), rather than using the 'average' morphology, thus reflecting the probabilistic nature of neuropil architectonics. Our simulations predict significant activation of high-affinity receptors, such as receptors of the NMDA type, at distances beyond half-micron from the glutamate release site, with glutamate-transporter unbinding playing an important role. These theoretical predictions are consistent with recent glutamate imaging data, thus lending support to the concept of significant volume-transmitted actions of glutamate in the brain.

However, the functions and precise mechanisms of m(6)A signaling in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neurogenesis-related depression remain largely enigmatic. We found that depletion of Mettl3 or Mettl14 in neural stem cells (NSCs) dramatically reduced m(6)A abundance, proliferation, and neuronal genesis, coupled with enhanced glial differentiation. Conversely, overexpressing Mettl3 promoted proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Mechanistically, the m(6)A modification of Lrp2 mRNA by Mettl3 enhanced its stability and translation efficiency relying on the reader protein Ythdc2, which in turn promoted neurogenesis. Importantly, mice lacking Mettl3 manifested reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, which could contribute to spatial memory decline, and depression-like behaviors. We found that these defective behaviors were notably reversed by Lrp2 overexpression. Moreover, Mettl3 overexpression in the hippocampus of depressive mice rescues behavioral defects. Our findings uncover the biological role of m(6)A modification in Lrp2-mediated neurogenesis via m(6)A-binding protein Ythdc2, and propose a rationale that targeting Mettl3-Ythdc2-Lrp2 axis regulation of neurogenesis might serve as a promising antidepressant strategy.

AB  - Ferrets are the gold-standard model for influenza A virus (IAV) research due to their natural susceptibility to human and zoonotic IAV, comparable respiratory anatomy and physiology to humans, and development of clinical signs similar to those seen in infected people. Because the presence and progression of clinical signs can be useful in infectious disease research, uncertainty in how analgesics alter research outcomes or compromise characteristics of disease progression have outweighed the concern regarding animal discomfort from these symptoms. Nonetheless, the principles of animal research require consideration of refinements for this important model for IAV research. Opioids offer a possible refinement option that would not directly affect the inflammatory cascade involved in IAV infection. Mirroring pathogenicity studies that use ferrets, 12 ferrets were inoculated intranasally with the A(H3N2) IAV A/Panama/2007/1999 and divided into 3 treatment groups (n = 4 each), of which 2 groups received buprenorphine treatments on different schedules and the third received a saline control. The duration and location of viral replication, lymphohematopoietic changes, and clinical signs were comparable across all groups at all time points. High quantities of infectious virus in nasal wash specimens were detected in ferrets from all groups through day 5 after inoculation, and peak viral titers from the upper respiratory tract did not differ between ferrets receiving buprenorphine treatments on either schedule. Compared with the saline group, ferrets receiving buprenorphine exhibited transient weight loss and pyrexia, but all groups ultimately achieved similar peaks in both of these measurements. Collectively, these findings support the continued evaluation of buprenorphine as a refinement for IAV-challenged ferrets.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, a case of infection with RVC was identified and the full-length genome of RVC in China was sequenced. A natural recombination event was observed in the RVC genome. Collectively, our data suggest that the RVC exists in China and it can be mixed with other diarrhea viruses, which brings new challenges to the prevention and control of diarrhea disease in pigs. Our data provide a new insight into the evolution of the rotavirus. Swine enteric disease is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality, and viral species involved in swine enteric disease include rotaviruses and coronaviruses, among others. Awareness of the circulating porcine rotavirus group C (PoRVC) in pig herds is critical to evaluate the potential impact of infection. At present, due to the lack of disease awareness and molecular diagnostic means, the research on RVC infection in China is not well-studied. In this study, diarrhea samples collected from pig farms were detected positive for RVC by PCR, and the full-length RVC was not previously reported for Chinese pig farms. This rotavirus strain was designated as RVC/Pig/CHN/JS02/2018/G6P6. A natural recombination event was observed with breakpoints at nucleotides (nt) 2509 to 2748 of the VP2 gene. Phylogenetic analysis based on nsp1 revealed that a new branch A10 formed. Collectively, our data suggest a potentially novel gene recombination event of RVC in the VP2 gene. These findings provide a new insight into the evolution of the rotavirus.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Rhinophyma, an advanced form of rosacea, is characterized by significant nasal tissue enlargement and deformation, leading to aesthetic and psychosocial challenges. Traditional treatments are often invasive with variable outcomes, emphasizing the need for improved therapeutic approaches. This study evaluates the efficacy of a dual-laser therapy (CO2 and dye lasers) in treating rhinophyma. An innovative diagnostic algorithm using multispectral imaging guided treatment decisions, while Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was utilized to analyze post-treatment vascular and collagen changes. Methods: A prospective study was conducted involving 20 patients with rhinophyma. Multispectral imaging was used to guide the tailored application of CO2 laser, dye laser, or both, depending on the predominant vascular or glandular components in the nasal tissue. Post-treatment analysis employed OCT to assess changes in vascular and collagen density, providing insights into the tissue modifications induced by laser therapy. Results: The treatment significantly reduced vascular density from 35,526.75 to 26,577.55 at 300 microns and from 46,916.25 to 35,509.25 at 500 microns. Collagen density decreased from 81.35 to 66.34. All reductions were statistically significant, with highly significant p-values. These findings highlight the dual-laser therapy's effectiveness in addressing the pathological features of rhinophyma. Conclusions: Dual-laser therapy guided by multispectral imaging provides a targeted and effective treatment for rhinophyma, addressing its vascular and glandular components. The use of OCT enhances understanding of laser-induced tissue changes and confirms significant reductions in vascular and collagen density. This approach represents a significant advancement in the management of rhinophyma, offering improved precision and therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - Background Genetic factors affect the variability of fatty acid composition in ruminant products. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between the variations of the SCD gene and fatty acid composition in Awassi sheep. Methods and results A total of 100 Awassi rams between the ages of one and two and a half years old were used in this study. Blood samples were taken at abattoirs in Babylon, and from each animal, longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle samples were taken to measure the fatty acid composition. DNA samples were isolated from each blood sample, then PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) experiments were conducted for genotyping followed by sequencing reactions. The study identified two genotypes (TT and TA) of the SCD gene (exon 3). Several novel variants were discovered in the amplified fragments of the SCD gene. Conclusions The TA genotype resulted in increased intramuscular fat and monounsaturated fatty acids compared to the TT genotype. Breeding for the TA genotype could be used for producing meat containing less saturated fatty acids and more monounsaturated fatty acids, making meat more favorable for human consumption.

AB  - Over two decades ago, an intercropping strategy was developed that received critical acclaim for synergizing food security with ecosystem resilience in smallholder farming. The push-pull strategy reportedly suppresses lepidopteran pests in maize through a combination of a repellent intercrop (push), commonly Desmodium spp., and an attractive, border crop (pull). Key in the system is the intercrop's constitutive release of volatile terpenoids that repel herbivores. However, the earlier described volatile terpenoids were not detectable in the headspace of Desmodium, and only minimally upon herbivory. This was independent of soil type, microbiome composition, and whether collections were made in the laboratory or in the field. Furthermore, in oviposition choice tests in a wind tunnel, maize with or without an odor background of Desmodium was equally attractive for the invasive pest Spodoptera frugiperda. In search of an alternative mechanism, we found that neonate larvae strongly preferred Desmodium over maize. However, their development stagnated and no larva survived. In addition, older larvae were frequently seen impaled and immobilized by the dense network of silica-fortified, non-glandular trichomes. Thus, our data suggest that Desmodium may act through intercepting and decimating dispersing larval offspring rather than adult deterrence. As a hallmark of sustainable pest control, maize-Desmodium push-pull intercropping has inspired countless efforts to emulate stimulo-deterrent diversion in other cropping systems. However, detailed knowledge of the actual mechanisms is required to rationally improve the strategy, and translate the concept to other cropping systems.

AB  - Chiffon is the sole Drosophila ortholog of Dbf4, the regulatory subunit for the cell-cycle kinase Cdc7 that initiates DNA replication. In Drosophila, the chiffon gene encodes two polypeptides with independent activities. Chiffon-A contains the conserved Dbf4 motifs and interacts with Cdc7 to form the Dbf4-dependent Kinase (DDK) complex, which is essential for a specialized form of DNA replication. In contrast, Chiffon-B binds the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 to form the Chiffon histone acetyltransferase (CHAT) complex, which is necessary for histone H3 acetylation and viability. Previous studies have shown that the Chiffon-B region is only present within insects. However, it was unclear how widely the interaction between Chiffon-B and Gcn5 was conserved among insect species. To examine this, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays using Chiffon-B and Gcn5 from a variety of insect species and found that Chiffon-B and Gcn5 interact in Diptera species such as Australian sheep blowfly and yellow fever mosquito. Protein domain analysis identified that Chiffon-B has features of acidic transcriptional activators such as Gal4 or VP16. We propose that the CHAT complex plays a critical role in a biological process that is unique to Dipterans and could therefore be a potential target for pest control strategies.

AB  - The ovine cervical spine model has been established as a representative model of the human cervical spine in the current literature, and is the most commonly used large animal model in studies investigating pathogenesis and treatment strategies for intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. However, existing data regarding morphometry, biomechanical profiles and the microscopic features of a physiological ovine cervical IVD remain scarce. Hence, the aim of this study was to perform a multimodal morphometric, biomechanical and histologic evaluation of a normal ovine cervical IVD. For this purpose, nine ovine cervical IVDs were harvested from three female sheep, and subjected to morphometrical, biomechanical and histologic analyses. The biomechanical assessment included the performance of cyclic compression, creepand compressive strength tests in a controlledlaboratory environment. Histological evaluation was performed using hematoxylin-eosin, Masson's trichrome and Alcian blue staining. The results from the morphometric analysis showed that the range of disc heights was 4-9 mm in all surfaces, featuring a constant increase from cranial to caudal levels. Biomechanical evaluation revealed that cyclic loading for 20 cycles was necessary for preconditioning so that the repeatability of the force-displacement hysteresis response is present. The critical failure point was defined at 15.5 MPa, whereas Young's modulus of elasticity was 1.2 MPa. The histologic assessment demonstrated the presence of a concentric arrangement of collagen lamellae in external annulus fibrosus, along with the sparsely organized internal nucleus pulposus. Ovine cervical IVD represents a complex structure with distinct features that should be considered by researchers in this field in order to optimize the reliability and validity of testing results.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential for the use of organic ingredients as protein sources in the diet of juvenile organic seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). A total of 486 juvenile seabass with an average weight of 90 g were fed six diets containing varied organic proteins. The control group (CON) was fed a diet with conventional fishmeal from sustainable fisheries as the primary protein source. The other five groups were fed diets with different compositions: organic Iberian pig meal byproduct (IB diet), a combination of organic Iberian pig meal byproduct and insect meal (IB-IN diet), a mix of organic Iberian pig meal byproduct and organic rainbow trout meal byproduct (IB-TR diet), a blend of organic rainbow trout meal byproduct and insect meal (TR-IN), and a mixed diet containing all of these protein sources (MIX diet). Over a 125-day feeding trial, growth performance, feed utilisation, feed digestibility, and histological parameters were assessed. The results showed that the fish fed the control diet had the highest final weight and specific growth rate, followed by the fish fed the TR-IN and IB-TR diets. The IB-TR diet had the highest apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for protein, while the TR-IN diet had the lowest. Histological analysis revealed that fish fed the control diet had the largest nucleus diameter and hepatocyte diameter. Use of IN seems to penalise performance in several ways. Fish fed diets containing insect meal grew less, and those diets had lower digestibility. Fish fed the TR and IB diets grew at rates near that of the control, and the feed had acceptable digestibility.

AB  - Simple Summary The choice of the optimal sperm preservation method is an important consideration in animal breeding. Stored semen can be used for reproductive purposes to introduce new genotypes and prevent inbreeding, which poses a considerable problem in cervid farms. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of storage time and storage method (liquid state/epididymides) on the motility, morphology, and antioxidant status of European red deer sperm stored at 5 degrees C for up to six days (D0-D6). Sperm samples were assessed for motility, viability, morphology, activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; catalase, CAT), and lipid peroxidation (based on malondialdehyde, MDA, content). Significant differences between storage variants were noted on D2 in sperm morphology; on D4 in the percentage of progressively motile sperm, MDA content, and SOD and GPx activity; and on D6 in the percentage of motile and viable spermatozoa. Sperm motility, viability, and antioxidant status are more effectively preserved during liquid storage than epididymal storage. Morphological and functional abnormalities of sperm were observed earlier during epididymal storage, which suggests that spermatozoa can be stored for shorter periods of time in the epididymides than in a liquid state.Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the motility, morphology, and antioxidant status of European red deer sperm stored in a liquid state (variant I) and in the epididymides (variant II). Spermatozoa were harvested post-mortem from the cauda epididymis. Sperm samples in both variants were stored for up to six days (D6) at 5 degrees C. Spermatozoa were assessed for motility, viability, morphology, activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; catalase, CAT), and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA, content). Sperm samples were analyzed on storage days 0, 2, 4, and 6 (D0-D6). Storage time and storage method significantly (p <= 0.05) influenced the examined variables. On D2, a decrease in motility and acrosomal integrity was observed in both storage variants, whereas a decrease in viability and an increase in MDA content were noted in spermatozoa stored in the epididymides. On D4, higher values of SOD and GPx activity and MDA content were noted in variant I than in variant II. Catalase activity was very low. GPx is the key enzyme that participates in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide in sperm cells. Spermatozoa stored in a liquid state were characterized by higher motility and viability, improved morphology and antioxidant status than those stored in the epididymides; therefore, liquid storage is more recommended for short-term preservation of epididymal spermatozoa.

AB  - Due to the similarity to human hepatocytes, porcine hepatocytes play an important role in hepatic research and drug evaluation. However, once hepatocytes were cultured in vitro, it was often prone to dedifferentiate, resulting in the loss of their characteristic features and normal functions, which impede their application in liver transplantation and hepatotoxic drugs evaluation. Up to now, this process has yet to be thoroughly investigated from the single-cell resolution and multi-omics perspective. In this study, we utilized 10x multiome technology to dissect the heterogeneity of porcine hepatocytes at different time points (Days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7) during dedifferentiation. We comprehensively investigated cell heterogeneity, cellular dynamics, signalling pathways, potential gene targets, enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks, cell-cell communications of these cells and the conservation of mechanisms across species. We found that a series of critical signalling pathways driven by ERK, PI3K, Src and TGF-beta were activated during this process, especially in the early stage of dedifferentiation. Based on these discoveries, we constructed a chemical combination targeting these pathways, which effectively inhibited the dedifferentiation of porcine hepatocytes in vitro. To validate the effectiveness of this combination, we transplanted such treated hepatocytes into FRGN mice, and the results demonstrated that these cells could effectively repopulate the liver and improve the survival of mice.

AB  - <bold>Objective</bold> In recent years, with the intensification of environmental issues and the depletion of ozone layer, incidence of skin tumors has also significantly increased, becoming one of the major threats to people's lives and health. However, due to factors such as high concealment in the early stage of skin tumors, unclear symptoms, and large human skin area, most cases are detected in the middle to late stage. Early detection plays a crucial role in postoperative survival of skin tumors, which can significantly improve the treatment and survival rates of patients. We proposed a rapid non-invasive electrical impedance detection method for early screening of skin tumors based on bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) technology.<bold>Methods</bold> Firstly, we have established a complete skin stratification model, including stratum corneum, epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. And the numerical analysis method was used to investigate the effect of dehydrated and dry skin stratum corneum on contact impedance in BIS measurement. Secondly, differentiation effect of different diameter skin tumor tissues was studied using a skin model after removing the stratum corneum. Then, in order to demonstrate that BIS technology can be used for detecting the microinvasion stage of skin tumors, we conducted a simulation study on the differentiation effect of skin tumors under different infiltration depths. Finally, in order to verify that the designed BIS detection system can distinguish between tumor microinvasion periods, we conducted tumor invasion experiments using hydrogel treated pig skin tissue.<bold>Results</bold> The simulation results show that a dry and high impedance stratum corneum will bring about huge contact impedance, which will lead to larger measurement errors and affect the accuracy of measurement results. We extracted the core evaluation parameter of relaxed imaginary impedance (Z(imag-relax)) from the simulation results of the skin tumor model. When the tumor radius (R-tumor) and invasion depth (h)>1.5 mm, the designed BIS detection system can distinguish between tumor tissue and normal tissue. At the same time, in order to evaluate the degree of canceration in skin tissue, the degree of tissue lesion (epsilon(worse)) is defined by the relaxed imaginary impedance (Z(imag-relax)) of normal and tumor tissue (epsilon(worse) is the percentage change in virtual impedance of tumor tissue relative to that of normal tissue), and we fitted a Depth-Z(imag-relax) curve using relaxation imaginary impedance data at different infiltration depths, which can be applied to quickly determine the infiltration depth of skin tumors after being supplemented with a large amount of clinical data in the future. The experimental results proved that when epsilon(worse)=0.492 0, BIS could identify microinvasive tumor tissue, and the fitting curve correction coefficient of determination was 0.946 8, with good fitting effect. The simulation using pig skin tissue correlated the results of real human skin simulation with the experimental results of pig skin tissue, proving the reliability of this study, and laying the foundation for further clinical research in the future.<bold>Conclusion</bold> Our proposed BIS method has the advantages of fast, real-time, and non-invasive detection, as well as high sensitivity to skin tumors, which can be identified during the stage of tumor microinvasion

AB  - Simple Summary A cross-sectional study on vitamin D-3 status was conducted in five Danish outdoor sow herds throughout August 2020. The aim was to determine the vitamin D status of outdoor sows during the peak sunshine season. The average 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 concentration in serum was 67 +/- 16 ng 25(OH)D-3/mL in outdoor sows, which is considerably higher than levels found in sows housed indoors and fed a standard diet supplemented with vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for sow health and productivity. Standard sow feed is therefore supplemented with vitamin D-3 or 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 (25(OH)D-3). However, it is uncertain whether the levels achieved are adequate for optimal performance. Currently, information on serum levels of vitamin D in pigs reared under both indoor and outdoor conditions is lacking. In August 2020, we obtained blood samples from 97 organic newly weaned sows housed outdoors during pregnancy and farrowing and used these to test for vitamin D in serum. The average concentration was 67 +/- 16 ng 25(OH)D-3/mL with a range of 32 to 134 ng 25(OH)D-3/mL. The vitamin D-3 content was 21 +/- 7 ng/mL, ranging from 9 to 48 ng/mL. The average number of hours of sun from June to August was 7.0 +/- 0.5 h/day. Parity, farm and body condition score did not significantly affect serum levels of 25(OH)D-3.

AB  - Pigs are similar to humans in organ size and physiological function, and are considered as good models for studying cardiovascular diseases. The study of porcine-induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSC) differentiating into vascular endothelial cells (EC) is expected to open up a new way of obtaining high-quality seed cells. Given that the hypoxic environment has an important role in the differentiation process of vascular EC, this work intends to establish a hypoxia-induced differentiation system of piPSC into vascular EC. There is evidence that the hypoxia microenvironment in the initial stage could significantly improve differentiation efficiency. Further study suggests that the hypoxia culture system supports a combined effect of hypoxia inducible factors and their associated regulatory molecules, such as HIF-1 alpha, VEGFA, FGF2, LDH-A, and PDK1, which can efficiently promote the lineage-specific differentiation of piPSC into EC. Most notably, the high level of ETV2 after 4 d of hypoxic treatment indicates that it possibly plays an important role in the promoting process of EC differentiation. The research is expected to help the establishment of new platforms for piPSC directional induction research, so as to obtain adequate seed cells with ideal phenotype and functionality.

AB  - Simple Summary The acute phase response (APR), which comprises a series of specific physiological reactions, is a systemic reaction of the organism to disturbances in its homeostasis caused by infection, inflammation, tissue damage, and stress. Even in healthy ewes, during pregnancy and the transition period, corticosteroids are released which cause the physiological acute phase response. Both in humans and animals, the immune system, like many other physiological systems, is dysregulated with age and a process known as immunoaging occurs. Knowledge of APPs, cortisol, and haematological parameters and factors that influence their alteration could be useful for establishing herd health in ewes during the periparturient period. Understanding how these factors interact with the immune system will help in developing disease control and management strategies that will aid in maintaining good health in ewes and lambs, resulting in greater reproduction. A well-functioning immune system is the basis for protection against infectious and metabolic diseases, and a smooth return to homeostasis. The periparturient period is considered critical because major changes in the endocrine, behavioural, digestive, and immune systems dysregulate immune function, leading to immunosuppression. With age, the immune system could become dysregulated. The purpose of the present investigation was to compare changes in plasma concentrations of acute phase proteins, cortisol, and haematological parameters in the peripheral blood of two age-related groups of healthy ewes to get a better understanding of changes around lambing. Two groups of ewes were enrolled in the study: 3-year-old (young; n = 9) and 7-year-old ewes (old; n = 9). All females were synchronised and inseminated. In blood plasma, serum amyloid A (SAA) and cortisol concentrations were measured using ELISA tests, a spectrophotometric method to determine haptoglobin (Hp), and a thrombin clottable estimation to determine the fibrinogen (Fb) concentration. The blood parameters were examined using an automated haematological analyser. In clinically healthy ewes, no significant effect of age was observed in SAA, Hp, Fb and cortisol concentration in most of analysed terms. SAA, Hp, Fb, and cortisol fluctuations typical for the periparturient period were observed. There were no age-associated differences in red or white blood cell parameters.

AB  - The immunopotentiating properties of BCG vaccine strain antigen conjugated with betulin derivatives have been evaluated. The experiments were carried out on agouti guinea pigs (n = 20). The animals of the experimental groups (n = 5) were immunized with the following antituberculosis drugs: group 1, with antigens of the BCG vaccine strain conjugated with betulinic acid; group 2, with BCG antigens conjugated with betulonic acid; and group 3, with the BCG vaccine. The animals of the control group (n = 5) were injected with a saline solution. All the animals were infected with a virulent culture of Mycobacterium bovis (strain 8) on day 30 after the administration of antituberculosis drugs. The blood sampling for the assessment of the immune status was conducted on day 30 after the administration of drugs and day 30 after the infection with M. bovis. The designed conjugates were found to display immunopotentiating activity characterized by a 1.7-3.8-fold increase in the number of immunocompetent cells and an increase in the neutrophil functional activity observed to a greater degree in the guinea pig group 2. After infection with M. bovis some key parameters of the immune system, such as a T-lymphocyte count and the activity of enzymatic (myeloperoxidase) and nonenzymatic (cationic proteins) bactericidal systems of neutrophilic granulocytes significantly increased in groups 2 and 3, which implied the highest antituberculosis activity of the agents administered to these animals. The guinea pigs were euthanized 45 days after the infection with M. bovis. The next pathoanatomical experiments proved that the vaccine strain conjugates with betulonic acid and the BCG vaccine induced marked resistance against the pathogenic mycobacteria. The protection indexes for these agents were approximately the same and achieved 66 and 71%, respectively.

AB  - Leather is the transformed product obtained from processing of raw skins and hides flayed from animals. Proteins, being the main constituent of the raw materials with about 70% moisture, are prone to microbial attack. Preservation of the raw materials is quintessential to retain the protein matrix for successful leather production. Common salt to the extent of 40-50% w/w is a widely practised method of preservation. Although effective, this approach generates huge amount of pollutants in the form of total dissolved solids (TDS) and chlorides demanding alternative curing systems. In this view, gallic acid-capped silver nanoparticles (GA@AgNPs) were evolved to serve as an alternative curing system for broad-spectrum antimicrobial and pollution abatement under optimized conditions. Nanocharacteristics were studied using UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron microscopic (EM) analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using an array of microbes isolated (n = 15) from flayed goat skin, and minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) was determined. The preservation efficacy of GA@AgNPs and salt (40%) challenged against goat skin was demonstrated and the leather characteristics validated after 30 days of treatment. Possible mechanism involved in curing process was deciphered using EM studies. GA@AgNPs were prepared under optimized conditions in a rapid fashion that typically revealed surface plasmon resonance with lambda(max) 406 nm, crystalline phase, and spherical and anisotropic particles of size < 40 nm. Significant antimicrobial activity was exhibited upon exposing individual microbe and consortia at 1 mg/mL of GA@AgNPs. Antimicrobial mechanism via membrane damage was clearly elucidated using EM studies. The preservative efficacy of GA@AgNPs at 10% (v/w) was well-established from its water repelling efficacy and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity owing to their strong zeta potential (- 31.4 mV) conferred by gallic acid. Therefore, GA@AgNPs might find its application in leather industry as an alternative curing system prior to trials and challenging adverse environmental conditions.

AB  - The growth and survival of cells depends both on their intrinsic properties and interactions with their neighbors. In a screen of genes encoding cell-surface proteins for knockdowns that affect clone size or shape in mosaic Drosophila imaginal discs, we found that clones with reduced echinoid (ed) function are fewer and smaller, and are frequently eliminated during development. This elimination results, in significant part, from increased levels of apoptosis due to decreased Diap1 protein. We found that Hippo pathway activity is not decreased in ed mutant cells, as previously claimed, but is decreased in some of their immediate wild-type neighbors, consistent with the observed elimination of ed clones by a mechanism resembling cell competition. In contrast to the underrepresentation of ed clones, discs or compartments composed of mostly ed mutant tissue overgrow, despite having increased levels of apoptosis. The overgrowth results from a failure to arrest growth at the appropriate final size during an extended larval stage. Thus, ed has two distinct functions: an anti-apoptotic function via maintenance of Diap1 levels, and a function to arrest growth at the appropriate final size.

AB  - Porcine organs and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoids as alternative organs for human transplantation have garnered attention, but both face technical challenges. Interspecies chimeric organ production using human iPSCs shows promise in overcoming these challenges. Our group successfully generated chimeric renal organoids using human iPSC-derived nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and fetal mouse kidneys. However, the current technology is limited to rodents. Therefore, this study focused on producing human-pig chimeric renal organoids, as pigs are the most promising species for xenotransplantation. Modification of existing culture systems enables continuous renal development in both species, resulting in the successful creation of human-pig chimeric renal organoids. Moreover, this method can be applied to generate humanized xenogeneic kidneys for future clinical applications. This study provides evidence that optimizing culture conditions enables the early-stage kidney development beyond species barriers, thus laying the foundation for accelerating research on humanized xenogeneic kidney fabrication for clinical purposes.
   Creation of chimeric renal organoids using human iPSC technology with fetal pig kidneys demonstrates inter-species coexistence and codevelopment in early kidney development, paving the way for humanized xenogeneic kidney creation for clinical use.

AB  - Elemental and stable isotope analyses are useful and common methods for wildlife diet studies, e.g., for characterizing diets and trophic relationships. However, little is known about the potential applicability of these techniques to address other aspects of feeding ecology. Here, we evaluated whether faecal elemental (carbon and nitrogen) and/or isotopic values (d(13)C, d(15)N) can determine variations in the amount of food intake. Overall, elemental analyses and d(15)N values failed in reporting significant differences, but preliminary outcomes support the potential use of faecal d(13)C values as an indicator to detect short-term slight food intake changes. The results of this work provide, for the first-time, reference data for interpreting faecal elemental and isotopic patterns in free-ranging wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), as well as new insights into the additional applicability of isotopic analysis in feeding ecology studies.The analysis of carbon and nitrogen elemental (C, N) and isotopic compositions (d(13)C, d(15)N) in faeces are considered reliable methodologies for the study of diet in wildlife. Here, we tested the suitability of these techniques to detect variations in the amount of food intake. We captured wild wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) with Sherman live traps where bait access was initially free, and later it was experimentally limited inside by four different devices to cause intended variations in the amount ingested. The total C and N (%) and stable d(13)C and d(15)N isotopic values were determined for the bait and in mice faecal samples. Faecal values were lower than bait ones except for N, likely due to animal matter ingested before capture. No significant differences in total C, N and d(13)C were found due to individual traits. However, breeding males showed higher d(15)N values than breeding females, probably due to differences in energy and protein demands between both sexes during the breeding season. Only d(13)C detected food intake variations (>= 2 g). Despite further research being needed, these results initially support the potential of d(13)C to provide information on the amount ingested, thus being useful to complement trophic ecology studies.

AB  - Elephants are one of the largest animals on earth and are found in forests, grasslands and savannahs in the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. A country like India, especially the northeastern region, is covered by deep forests and is home to many elephants. Railroads are an effective and inexpensive means of transporting goods and passengers in this region. Due to poor visibility in the forests, collisions between trains and elephants are increasing day by day. In the last ten years, more than 190 elephants died due to train accidents. The most effective solution to this collision problem is to stop the train immediately. To address this sensitive issue, a solution is needed to detect and monitor elephants near railroad tracks and analyze data from the camera trap near the intersection of elephant corridors and railroad tracks. In this paper, we have developed a fog computing-based framework that not only detects and monitors the elephants but also improves the latency, network utilization and execution time. The fog-enabled elephant monitoring system informs the train control system of the existence of elephants in the corridor and a warning light LED flashes near the train tracks. This system is deployed and simulated in the iFogSim simulator and shows improvements in latency, network utilization, and execution time compared to cloud-based infrastructures.

AB  - Illegal harvest (poaching) is a geographically widespread threat to animal populations. Wire snares are a common poaching technique used in the Global South and are indiscriminate with respect to species, age, and sex of individual animals that they capture. When caught, relatively large mammals frequently break free from the snares, suffering injuries in the process. The prevalence of snaring injuries as well as the ecological and conservation implications of such patterns have not been widely investigated for many animal populations. We evaluated the prevalence and spatial distribution of giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) with snaring injuries in Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda, a system experiencing high rates of wire snare poaching. We conducted photographic spatial encounter surveys along five fixed road transects. We photographed detected giraffes, recorded whether a snaring injury was present, and identified individuals via autonomous image processing of pelage patterns. We fitted a spatial capture-recapture (SCR) model to the encounter history data to estimate abundance and predict the spatial distribution of injured giraffes. We detected 1306 (sub) adult giraffes from the surveys and predicted 1939 (+/- 80) via the SCR model. We encountered 26 giraffes with snaring injuries, corresponding to a population-level snaring rate of 1.4%. Individuals with higher movement scales were more at risk of being snared. Though not fatal across the three-month duration of this study, the injuries likely lead to secondary infections, disability, and potentially death in the long term. We explore the implications of bearing snaring injuries for ecology, behavior, and conservation of affected species.

AB  - The health risks to populations induced by lead (Pb) and high-fat diets (HFD) have become a global public health problem. Pb and HFD often co-exist and are co-occurring risk factors for cognitive impairment. This study investigates effect of combined Pb and HFD on cognitive function, and explores the underlying mechanisms in terms of regulatory components of synaptic plasticity and insulin signaling pathway. We showed that the co exposure of Pb and HFD further increased blood Pb levels, caused body weight loss and dyslipidemia. The results from Morris water maze (MWM) test and Nissl staining disclosed that Pb and HFD each contributed to cognitive deficits and neuronal damage and combined exposure enhanced this toxic injury. Pb and HFD decreased the levels of synapsin-1, GAP-43 and PSD-95 protein related to synaptic properties and SIRT1, NMDARs, phosphorylated CREB and BDNF related to synaptic plasticity regulatory, and these decreases was greater when combined exposure. Additionally, we revealed that Pb and HFD promoted IRS-1 phosphorylation and subsequently reduced downstream PI3K-Akt kinases phosphorylation in hippocampus and cortex of rats, and this process was aggravated when co-exposure. Collectively, our data suggested that combined exposure of Pb and HFD enhanced cognitive deficits, pointing to additive effects in rats than the individual stress effects related to multiple signaling pathways with CREB-BDNF signaling as the hub. This study emphasizes the need to evaluate the effects of mixed exposures on brain function in realistic environment and to better inform prevention of neurological disorders via modulating central pathway, such as CREB/BDNF signaling.

AB  - Early-life metabolic stress has been demonstrated to affect brain development, persistently influence brain plasticity and to exert multigenerational effects on cognitive functions. However, the impact of an ancestor's diet on the adult neurogenesis of their descendants has not yet been investigated. Here, we studied the effects of maternal high fat diet (HFD) on hippocampal adult neurogenesis and the proliferation of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) derived from the hippocampus of both the second and the third generations of progeny (F2(HFD) and F3(HFD)). Maternal HFD caused a multigenerational depletion of neurogenic niche in F2(HFD) and F3(HFD) mice. Moreover, NSPCs derived from HFD descendants showed altered expression of genes regulating stem cell proliferation and neurodifferentiation (i.e., Hes1, NeuroD1, Bdnf). Finally, ancestor HFD-related hyper-activation of both STAT3 and STAT5 induced enhancement of their binding on the regulatory sequences of Gfap gene and an epigenetic switch from permissive to repressive chromatin on the promoter of the NeuroD1 gene. Collectively, our data indicate that maternal HFD multigenerationally affects hippocampal adult neurogenesis via an epigenetic derangement of pro-neurogenic gene expression in NSPCs.

AB  - Extrafloral nectarized plants attract ants, which may protect them against herbivory and increase plant fruit set production. In some cases, however, ants are ineffective against herbivores. Such events occur, for instance, when herbivores present adaptations to avoid ant predation. Thus, the outputs of these interactions depend on factors such as ant identity, plant phenology and herbivore features. Here, we investigated the endophytic florivorous beetles' impact on the reproductive success of their host plants, two sympatric Banisteriopsis (Malpighiaceae) species, depending on the action of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) visiting ants. We experimentally manipulated the presence of ants and herbivores on B. malifolia and B. laevifolia species during their reproductive period to test the effectiveness of ants-EFNs mutualism on plant fruit set production. We performed treatments where three similar inflorescences were selected to be (I) control branch, with no manipulations, (II) beetle-free branch, isolated with textile cover and (III) ant-free branch, isolated at the base with atoxic wax. We hypothesized that endophytic herbivores have a negative impact on the plant reproductive success because they escape the action of ants (biotic defences). As a result, we observed (i) that florivorous Anthonomus beetles have a negative impact on Banisteriopsis reproductive success; (ii) ants fail in protecting plants against floral endophytic beetles; and (iii) most of the results were species-specific. Our results indicate that these systems present very conditional outcomes that depend on the intrinsic factors of each plant species.

AB  - Research question: What is the effect of embryo morphology score on 14-day $-HCG levels and 14- 18-day $-HCG doubling values, and do they have differences in day-3 embryo or day-5 blastocyst transfers? Design: Retrospective analysis of 4434 fresh cycles of single embryo transfers (SET) with $-HCG > 15 mIU/ml on day 14 after transfer via IVF and ICSI. The correlation between embryo morphology score and 14-day $-HCG was examined. Doubling of 14-18 day $-HCG was analysed in 2628 cycles to determine correlations with embryo morphology score. Results: In day-3 SET, number of embryonic cells was positively correlated with 14-day post-transfer $-HCG values (R = 0.076; P = 0.013). No significant correlation was observed between the grade of the transferred embryos and the 14- 18-day serum $-HCG doubling values. In day-5 single blastocyst transfers, the degree of blastocyst expansion, trophoblast cell and inner cell mass (ICM) grades demonstrated a significant positive correlation with 14-day post-transfer $-HCG (P < 0.001, P = 0.014, P = 0.003). Degree of blastocyst expansion was significantly correlated with 14- 18-day $-HCG doubling values (R =- 0.051, P = 0.027). Grades of the ICM and trophoblast cells showed no significant correlation with 14- 18-day $-HCG doubling values. Conclusion: In fresh SET, embryo morphology score influences 14-day $-HCG values in day-3 embryos and day-5 blastocyst transfers. Embryo morphology score in day-3 SET does not affect 14- 18-day $-HCG doubling values. Degree of blastocyst expansion significantly affects 14- 18-day $-HCG doubling values in day-5 blastocyst transfers.

AB  - Elevated basal cortisol levels in elderly may indicate dysregulation of the internal stress-related system, as well as dysfunction and structural alterations in brain structures necessary for cognition, such as hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Because of the close relation of executive functions and episodic memory processing, in this study we explored whether the association of elevated cortisol levels on episodic memory could be partly attributed to cortisol effects on executive functions. In this cross-sectional study we analyzed data from a sample of 236 community-dwelling older adults from the Cretan Aging Cohort aged 75.56 +/- 7.21 years [53 with dementia due to probable Alzheimer's disease, 99 with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 84 cognitively non impaired participants (NI)]. Morning serum cortisol levels were higher in the probable AD as compared to the NI group (p = .031). Mediated regression models in the total sample supported the hypothesis that the negative association of basal cortisol levels with delayed memory was fully mediated by the relation of basal cortisol levels with executive functions and immediate memory (adjusted for age and self-reported depression symptoms). Moderated mediation regression models revealed that the direct effect of cortisol on executive function and the effect of executive function on delayed memory performance were statistically significant among participants diagnosed with MCI, while the immediate memory effect on delayed memory was more pronounced in AD patients, as compared to the NI group. The current findings corroborate neuroimaging research highlighting cortisol effects on executive functions and immediate memory and further suggest that dysregulation of systems involved in these functions may account for the purported detrimental long-term effects of high cortisol levels on delayed memory.

AB  - The number of live births is a critical indicator of the performance of sows and is also a significant factor in determining the economic benefits of pig breeding. Mummified piglets are an important challenge affecting production efficiency in the pig industry. However, the value of metabolomics in unraveling the mechanisms of piglet mummification has not yet been established. This study aimed to investigate the serum and urine metabolomes of sows to identify biomarkers of piglet mummification. During gestation (35th, 56th, 77th, and 98th), serum and urine samples were collected from eight pigs from each group. To assess changes in metabolite classes in serum and urine from sows with a high incidence of mummified piglets and normal sows, a combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling approach was used. The identified metabolites were involved in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and bile secretion. A total of six potential markers related to piglet mummification were screened, including hypotaurine, taurodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, arginine, glutamic acid, and proline. These metabolites are expected to be novel biomarkers of piglet mummification, although their use requires further validation. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: As the elderly population grows, the prevalence of dementia is also rapidly increasing worldwide. Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, has been shown to have ameliorative effects on impaired cognitive functions in experimental models. However, studies have generally used young animals. Additionally, although it has a major role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and memory, literature information about the effects of metformin on the cholinergic system is limited. In this study, we investigated the effects of metformin on memory in a model of scopolamine-induced memory impairment in aged rats. We also examined the effects of metformin on the cholinergic system, which is very important in cognitive functions. Methods: Metformin was administered orally to male Wistar rats (20-22 months old) at 100 mg/kg/day for three weeks. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to assess spatial memory. Before the probe test of the MWM test, scopolamine was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 mg/kg. After testing, animals were sacrificed, whole brains were removed, and hippocampus samples were separated for biochemical analysis. Results: Impaired memory associated with scopolamine administration was reversed by metformin. In addition, metformin administration ameliorated scopolamine-induced changes in acetylcholine (ACh) levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity. Conclusion: Our results show that metformin may have protective effects in a scopolamine-induced memory impairment model in aged animals by improving cholinergic function. Metformin shows promise in preventing dementia with its dual cholinesterase inhibition and ChAT activation effect.

AB  - In eusocial termites, successful pairing is an essential element of dispersal and distribution after the departure of alates from natal colonies. Two situations could arise during the pairing process: mixed-sex pairs and same-sex pairs. However, most previous studies focused on mixed-sex pairs, overlooking groups formed by same-sex pairings, especially potential fecundity (the total number of oocytes or ovarioles), oogenesis and the development stage of oocytes of females in female-female pairs, and spermatogenesis and testis development of males in male-male pairs. In this study, through experimentation, we investigated the reproductive ability of virgin dealates based on various pairing types as mentioned above. We found that the life spans of virgin dealates can cover 1 yr or even more when they establish a nest with a partner, which is more than 10-fold longer than the life span of individuals establishing a colony alone. After 1 yr of pairing, the potential fecundity of virgin same sex dealates did not degenerate significantly compared with newly emerged dealates, including the number of ovarioles, size of testis, oogenesis, and the development stage of the oocytes. Moreover, when individuals of same-sex pairings experimentally changed into mixed-sex pairs after 1 yr, the eggs produced in the colony hatched into larvae. These findings suggest that dealates which through same-sex pairs retain fecundity after 1 yr have more reproductive potential than dealates that failed to pair with heterosexuals, shedding light on the ecological significance of homosexual behaviors in terms of the successful extension and fecundity of eusocial termites.

AB  - Oryctes rhinoceros larva has the potential to be developed into protein hydrolysates. In this study, O. rhinoceros larva was hydrolysed with crude papain protease extract at different concentrations (1, 2, and 3% w/w) and hydrolysis time (60, 120, 180 min). The objective of this study was to investigate the functional properties of protein hydrolysates from O. rhinoceros larva affected by different papain concentrations and hydrolysis time. Yield, protein concentration, and functional properties were measured and compared with whey protein. The result showed that the yield and protein concentration increased significantly (P<0.05) with increasing papain concentration. The water holding capacity varied between 1.66-4.23 g/g and OHC varied in the range of 2.61-5.24 g/g, higher than control (P<0.05). O. rhinoceros protein hydrolysate has good emulsifying activity and stability, ranging from 8.38 to 45.88 m2/g and 12.09 to 30.87 min, respectively, while foam capacity ranged from 21.11% to 59.78% and foaming stability up to 25.11%. Generally, the functional properties of O. rhinoceros larva protein hydrolysate improved with the increase of the crude papain concentration and hydrolysis time. Several improved functional properties showed potential for developing O. rhinoceros larva protein hydrolysates as an alternative functional protein source in food ingredient formulation.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, remains untreatable. One of the factors that contributes to its progression is microglia-mediated inflammation. Pterostilbene, a compound isolated from Chinese dragon's blood, can reduce inflammation caused by overactive microglia. However, its effects on AD transgenic animals and the possible underlying mechanism remain unknown.
   Methods: We evaluated the effect of pterostilbene on learning and memory difficulties in transgenic APP/PS1 mice. We used immunofluorescence to detect microglial activation and A beta aggregation. We explored the cellular mechanism of pterostilbene by establishing LPS- stimulated BV2 cells and oA beta(1-42)-exposed HEK 293T cells that overexpress TLR4 and/or MD2 via lentivirus. We applied flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation to examine how pterostilbene regulates TLR4 signaling.
   Results: Pterostilbene enhanced the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice and reduced microglial activation and A beta aggregation in their hippocampus. Pterostilbene alleviated oA beta(1-42)-induced inflammation, which required the involvement of MD2. Pterostilbene disrupted the binding between TLR4 and MD2, which may further prevent TLR4 dimerization and subsequent inflammatory response. Moreover, pterostilbene restored the impaired endocytosis of oA beta(1-42) through an autophagy-dependent mechanism.
   Conclusion: This is the first demonstration that pterostilbene can potentially treat AD by blocking the interaction of TLR4 and MD2, thereby suppressing TLR4-mediated inflammation.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes, most notably trichostrongylids, are known to cause significant losses in sheep production. Previous studies have shown that monitoring parameters (e.g., FAMACHA (c), BCS, dag score) change with increasing egg excretion. These parameters are well known and frequently used for targeted selective treatment. Based on the willingness to participate in this study (based on a previous questionnaire distribution among sheep farmers in Austria) we investigated the associations between faecal egg counts and the FAMACHA (c), BCS, and dag scores of 1195 dairy ewes. Faecal samples were analysed using the Mini-FLOTAC technique I and larval culture. Three raters assessed the FAMACHA (c), BCS, and dag scores in sheep to calculate the inter-rater agreement and intraclass correlation coefficient. The responses to the questionnaire of 23 farms were used for the evaluation, of which 16 farms were visited. Trichostrongylid eggs were detected in 95% of the faecal samples. The BCS was negatively correlated with the eggs per gram of faeces (EpG) (r = -0.156; p < 0.001) and the FAMACHA (c) score was slightly positively correlated with EpG (r = 0.196; p < 0.001). A small proportion of sheep (25%) shed the majority of eggs (47% to 84%). A moderate to good agreement for the parameters was found between the raters. In conclusion, the clinical parameters showed only weak correlations with faecal egg counts, and we confirmed that a minority of the flock is responsible for the majority of the pasture contamination with trichostrongylid eggs. Clinical raters should be trained before a study to increase the agreement between them.

AB  - Reducing demand for wildlife products has been recognised as an important global priority. However, consumer demand is a complicated phenomenon involving numerous interacting biological and socio-economic factors, operating at a range of scales and time periods. The demand for elephant ivory is an excellent illustration of the gaps in our current knowledge. Although it is well-documented that Japan is no longer a significant destination consumer market for ivory products, we have little insight into the market drivers behind this change. This is partly because post-hoc evaluations are difficult when relying on traditional quantitative methods. We used General Elimination Methodology and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders to understand the consumer changes in Japan. We identified the two biggest market drivers-the CITES international trade ban and economic recession-as well as a range of minor drivers and enabling conditions. These included respect for government authority, the passive nature of demand for ivory, and a general cultural shift away from conspicuous consumption. This case study highlights the role of theory-based qualitative evaluations in conservation, which recognises that specific outcomes are likely to be caused by multiple contributing factors driven by interactions between different actors.

AB  - Toilet revolution is driven by the urgent need for solutions to improve sanitation and access to high-quality organic fertilizer for rural areas, which is tagged "resource recovery from human waste." This study provides a possible solution via semisolid anaerobic co-digestion (Aco-D) of source-separated fecal slag (SFS) and food waste (FW) (3:1). A comprehensive investigation of Aco-D at different inoculum/substrate ratios (ISR) was conducted. Results revealed that the reactor with ISR of 1:4 reached the highest methane yield (255.05 mL/gVS), which enhanced Methanosaetaceae, Methanomicrobiales, and Syntrophomonas. Additionally, the reactor with low feedstock (ISR of 1:2) showed higher removal efficiency of antibiotics (74.75%). The ecological risk of digestate decreased to an insignificant hazard quotient level, and the contents of nutrients and heavy metals were in line with the standard requirement for fertilizer. This study could serve as an alternative technology to support further research in SFS management and digestate utilization as fertilizer.

AB  - Liver biotransformation enzymes have long been thought to enable animals to feed on diets rich in xenobiotic compounds. However, despite decades of pharmacological research in humans and rodents, little is known about hepatic gene expression in specialized mammalian herbivores feeding on toxic diets. Leveraging a recently identified population of the desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida) found to be highly tolerant to toxic creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), we explored the expression changes of suites of biotransformation genes in response to diets enriched with varying amounts of creosote resin. Analysis of hepatic RNA-seq data indicated a dose-dependent response to these compounds, including the upregulation of several genes encoding transcription factors and numerous phase I, II, and III biotransformation families. Notably, elevated expression of five biotransformation families - carboxylesterases, cytochromes P450, aldo-keto reductases, epoxide hydrolases, and UDPglucuronosyltransferases - corresponded to species-specific duplication events in the genome, suggesting that these genes play a prominent role in N. lepida's adaptation to creosote bush. Building on pharmaceutical studies in model rodents, we propose a hypothesis for how the differentially expressed genes are involved in the biotransformation of creosote xenobiotics. Our results provide some of the first details about how these processes likely operate in the liver of a specialized mammalian herbivore.

AB  - Ceratapion basicorne (Illiger) is a recently approved univoltine biological control agent that develops inside the rosette of yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.), an invasive annual plant. Adult weevils normally emerge in early summer, and females are thought to be in reproductive diapause until the following spring, when they oviposit in rosettes. The long period of reproductive diapause constrains mass-rearing this weevil because only one generation per year can be produced. Determining the environmental conditions that regulate diapause termination may enable shortening diapause under laboratory conditions to increase production of adults to release. We tested three hibernating conditions (greenhouse [ambient temperature and photoperiod], glass door refrigerator [5 degrees C and ambient photoperiod], and growth chamber [5 degrees C and 24 h dark]) for three durations (4, 8, 11 wk). The highest proportion of females laying eggs came from the growth chamber, with 40% terminating diapause after 4 wk, 80% after 8 wk, and 95% after 11 wk of exposure. Our study demonstrates that duration of cold temperature is an important stimulus to terminate reproductive diapause of C. basicorne, and that exposure to ambient light had no effect at 5 degrees C. However, 47% of females held at ambient greenhouse conditions, without any chilling period, completed diapause within 11 wk. Thus, a cold period can accelerate diapause development, but it is not necessary for its completion. Reducing the winter diapause period from about 6 mo to 11 wk should enable the production of multiple generations per year to increase the number of insects available to release.

AB  - Pain and depression comorbidity affects patients' physical and mental health, as well as quality of life. Comorbid depressive symptoms in cancer pain have a severe impact on the recognition and treatment of pain. Similarly, cancer pain patients with depression are inclined towards more despair and greater impairment. The mechanisms responsible for the comorbid depressive symptoms in bone cancer pain (BCP) have not been fully delineated. Here, it was reported that the implantation of carcinoma cells into the femoral cavity of mice led to the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in the hippocampus. This was associated with the activation of microglial signaling pathway mediated by the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2) and DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12). Pain and depression-like behaviors were reversed by the knockdown of hippocampal MHC-I via a lentiviral vector harboring ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) sequence. Moreover, MHC-I knockdown exhibited a marked reduction in the expression of TREM2 and DAP12. These results suggested that hippocampal MHC-I was involved in BCP and depression comorbidity via upregulating the signals mediated by TREM2/DAP12 in microglia. The suppression of MHC-I could be a potential therapeutic target for BCP.

AB  - Plants emit a wide array of complex blends of volatile organic compounds that can be involved in plant communication with herbivores and their natural enemies. Bracon vulgaris Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid that attacks the boll weevil larvae, Anthonomus grandis Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), an important pest in cotton plantations in Brazil. This parasitoid species has been studied as a potential biological control agent of A. grandis. However, little is known about B. vulgaris host foraging behaviour. We have previously demonstrated that female wasps respond to host-associated cues (boll weevil's aggregation pheromone) and host habitat odours, such as cotton volatiles induced by the presence of the boll weevil's pheromone. In the current study, we evaluated the electrophysiological and behavioural responses of B. vulgaris to constitutive and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) emitted by A. grandis-infested cotton plants at different phenological stages. The results demonstrated that B. vulgaris recognizes and responds to reproductive cotton HIPVs and that polar compounds might not be essential for its attraction. Electroantennogram (EAG) recordings and bioassays suggested that the compounds beta-myrcene, (E)-ocimene, (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT), (E)-(1R,9S)-caryophyllene, and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT), as well as other minor components of cotton blend, can be used by B. vulgaris wasps in its host foraging behaviour. Our results show an important role of terpenoids in cotton indirect defence, which is discussed relative to the role of other minor plant volatiles.

AB  - Context. The exact mechanisms regulating the initiation of porcine conceptus elongation are not known due to the complexity of the uterine environment. Aims. To identify contributing factors for initiation of conceptus elongation in vitro, this study evaluated differential metabolite abundance within media following culture of blastocysts within unmodified alginate (ALG) or Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-modified alginate hydrogel culture systems. Methods. Blastocysts were harvested from pregnant gilts, encapsulated within ALG or RGD or as non-encapsulated control blastocysts (CONT), and cultured. At the termination of 96 h culture, media were separated into blastocyst media groups: non-encapsulated control blastocysts (CONT); ALG and RGD blastocysts with no morphological change (ALG- and RGD-); ALG and RGD blastocysts with morphological changes (ALG+ and RGD+) and evaluated for non-targeted metabolomic profiling by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) techniques and gas chromatography- (GC-MS). Key results. Analysis of variance identified 280 (LC-MS) and 1 (GC-MS) compounds that differed (P < 0.05), of which 134 (LC-MS) and 1 (GC-MS) were annotated. Metabolites abundance between ALG+ vs ALG-, RGD+ vs RGD-, and RGD+ vs ALG+ were further investigated to identify potential differences in metabolic processes during the initiation of elongation. Conclusions. This study identified changes in phospholipid, glycosphingolipid, lipid signalling, and amino acid metabolic processes as potential RGD-independent mechanisms of elongation and identified changes in lysophosphatidylcholine and sphingolipid secretions during RGD-mediated elongation. Implications. These results illustrate changes in phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolic processes and secretions may act as mediators of the RGD-integrin adhesion that promotes porcine conceptus elongation.

AB  - Non-coding RNAs are considered key regulatory factors in biological and reproductive physiological processes in mammals. However, the molecular functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating dynamic uterine development and reproductive capacity during sexual maturation remain unclear. This study analyzed the expression characteristics and molecular functions of lncRNAs in uterine tissues from 20 goats at four specific time points during sexual maturation: day 1 after birth (D1), 2 months (M2), 4 months (M4), and 6 months (M6), finding that stage-specific DE lncRNAs may regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, hormone secretion, metabolism, and immune response through multiple action modes. Within the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network, a novel lncRNA, TCONS_00046732, associated with uterine development, exhibited significantly higher expression during sexual maturity compared to the prepubertal stage, correlating positively with PRLR and negatively with chi-miR-135b-5p. FISH and IF analyses revealed significant co-localization and distinct expression patterns of TCONS_00046732, chi-miR-135b-5p, and PRLR in the endometrial epithelium. Further experiments confirmed that TCONS_00046732 competitively binds to chi-miR-135b-5p to upregulate PRLR, thereby activating the PI3KAkt signaling pathway, promoting primary endometrial epithelial cell proliferation, G1-to-S phase transition, and inhibiting apoptosis. These findings enhance our understanding of uterine molecular regulation and provide key insights into the molecular basis of goat sexual development.

AB  - Simple Summary The inflammatory reaction in the body is a very complex process linked with a series of changes in many parameters, including hematological ones. Levamisole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic used in veterinary medicine. This antiparasitic agent is furthermore suspected of immunomodulatory activity. Therefore, this study is focused on the immunostimulating effect of single and triple doses of levamisole on hematological parameters. During the experiment, it was observed how levamisole modified the inflammatory response to carrageenan in the rat pleural cavity. This study showed the immunomodulatory effect of levamisole on the blood parameters and mild reduction in pneumonia in histopathological examination. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of single and triple administration of levamisole on the dynamics of hematological parameters during experimental pleuritis. The experiment was performed on female Buffalo rats. Rats were randomly assigned to two equal groups that received 1 and 3 doses of levamisole every 2, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Following the experiment, blood samples for the measurement of hematological parameters were collected. The study group receiving three doses of levamisole observed a significant reduction of red blood cell count at 48 h post administration and an increase in mean corpuscular volume compared to the control inflammation group. The administration of a single dose of levamisole results in a significant increase in hematocrit at 72 h, an increase in white blood cell count at 24 h and 72 h, and an increase in neutrophil count at 72 h compared to the control inflammation group. Administration of a single and triple dose of levamisole showed statistically significant modification of some hematological parameters and thus modulates the inflammatory process. In the lungs, this results in a reduction in leukocyte infiltrations around the bronchi and blood vessels.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis underpins classical (or importation) biocontrol as a management technique for invasive species. Classical biocontrol has had resounding success when prospective control agents have been subject to appropriate screening before release. Occasionally, however, natural enemies have been reunited with their hosts accidentally. Such adventive agents may provide effective control but have also avoided the careful screening characteristic of modern importation biocontrol programmes. We were studying the invasive mustard, Hesperis matronalis L. (Dame's rocket; Brassicaceae: Hesperidae), when we discovered rampant seed predation by an unknown seed predator. Using DNA barcoding, we identified this seed predator as Ceutorhynchus inaffectatus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a recently (2018) detected species in North America. Comparing potential and realised seed production, we found that seed predation by C. inaffectatus strongly reduces H. matronalis fecundity, and that this effect was not moderated by infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), a commercially important pathogen hosted by H. matronalis and transmitted by polyphagous aphid species. C. inaffectatus is expected to be highly host-specific, and the absence of native Hesperidae species in North America suggests the potential for C. inaffectatus as a classical, but adventive, biocontrol agent of H. matronalis. We suggest population genetic research to identify the origin of C. inaffectatus, and host specificity testing before any intentional redistribution of this species for H. matronalis biocontrol. More generally, this system acts as a model for biocontrol prospects with adventive insect herbivore species.

AB  - The amygdala is a collection of nuclei that support adaptive social behavior and are implicated in disorders such as autism. The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), a main subdivision of the amygdala, influences fear responses, motivated behavior, and memory of emotional events via its communication with other amygdalar nuclei and with other brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. The specific role of the BLA in responses to social stimuli is less clear. The present study of female rats investigated the role of the BLA in responding to socially-relevant information by asking how inactivation of the BLA with bilateral infusions of the GABA receptor agonist muscimol would affect spontaneous exploration of wood blocks scented either with conspecific male or female urine or with nonsocial odorants. Conspecific urine samples were used because urine conveys information about sex, health, social status, and reproductive state in rodents. The results revealed that BLA inactivation reduced female rats' spontaneous preference for social odors over nonsocial odors, specifically for female urine. However, BLA inactivation did not generally impair rats' ability to distinguish two odors from the same category (e.g., urine odors from two different male rats). The results indicate that the BLA is important for responding to salience of social stimuli but not for discriminating between different individuals, a result that has important implications for amygdalar modulation of downstream attention, motivation, and memory pro-cesses for social stimuli.

AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleuropneumoniae) causes porcine pleuropneumonia that seriously endangers pig's health. Adh, located in the head region of trimeric autotransporter adhesion of A. pleuropneumoniae, affects bacterial adhesion and pathogenicity. However, how Adh mediates A. pleuropneumoniae immune invasion is still unclear. Here, we established the A. pleuropneumoniae strain L20 or L20 Delta Adh-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) model, and applied protein overexpression, RNA interference, qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunoflourescence techniques to dissect the effects of Adh on PAM during A. pleuropneumoniae infection. We found that Adh could increase the A. pleuropneumoniae adhesion and intracellular survival in PAM. Gene chip analysis of piglet lungs further showed that Adh significantly induced cation transport regulatory-like protein 2 (CHAC2) expression, whose overexpression suppressed the phagocytic capacity of PAM. Furthermore, CHAC2 overexpression dramatically increased glutathione (GSH) expression, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and promoted A. pleuropneumoniae survival in PAM, while the knockdown of CHAC2 reversed these phenomena. Meanwhile, CHAC2 silence activated the NOD1/NF-kappa B pathway, resulting in an increase in IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression, whereas this effect was weakened by CHAC2 overexpression and addition of NOD1/NF-kappa B inhibitor ML130. Moreover, Adh enhanced the secretion of LPS of A. pleuropneumoniae, which regulated the expression of CHAC2 via TLR4. In conclusion, through a LPS-TLR4-CHAC2 pathway, Adh inhibits respiratory burst and inflammatory cytokines expression to promote A. pleuropneumoniae survival in PAM. This finding may provide a novel target for the prevention and treatment of A. pleuropneumoniae.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are a defense mechanism against herbivores, which in turn use detoxification metabolism to process ingested and absorbed PSMs. The feeding environment can cause changes in liver metabolism patterns and the gut microbiota. Here, we compared gut microbiota and liver metabolome to investigate the response mechanism of plateau zokors (Eospalax baileyi) to toxic plant Stellera chamaejasme (SC) in non-SC and SC grassland (-SCG and +SCG). Our results indicated that exposure to SC in the -SCG population increased liver inflammatory markers including prostaglandin (PG) in the Arachidonic acid pathway, while exposure to SC in the +SCG population exhibited a significant downregulation of PGs. Secondary bile acids were significantly downregulated in +SCG plateau zokors after SC treatment. Of note, the microbial taxa Veillonella in the -SCG group was significantly correlated with liver inflammation markers, while Clostridium innocum in the +SCG group had a significant positive correlation with secondary bile acids. The increase in bile acids and PGs can lead to liver inflammatory reactions, suggesting that +SCG plateau zokors may mitigate the toxicity of SC plants by reducing liver inflammatory markers including PGs and secondary bile acids, thereby avoiding liver damage. This provides new insight into mechanisms of toxicity by PSMs and counter-mechanisms for toxin tolerance by herbivores.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible changes of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and ferritin during the entire productive cycle in fattening pigs and at different diurnal sampling times. Moreover, the possible effects of the presence of pen contaminants and storage stability at different temperature conditions were assessed. The analytes changed along the different phases of the fattening productive cycle, showing, in general, higher values at the initial phases. In addition, statistically significant variations were found in Zn and Cu measurements at different sampling times of the day. In the spectrophotometric assays, the values of all analytes significantly increased after adding high concentrations of feces or feed. However, when low concentrations of feces or feed were added, only Cu showed a significant increase. Overall, the salivary levels of Zn, Cu, Fe and ferritin in pigs can change during different fattening phases and the different hours of the day. These analytes were more stable at -80 degrees C and, if saliva is contaminated with feces or feed, it can lead to an increase in these analytes.

AB  - Sunflower meal (SFM) is a basic and cheap source of feed protein in Bulgaria. Its use is limited by the high content of hulls, which decrease its energy and protein value, and by low content of the amino acids lysine and threonine. In ruminants, an additional problem is a high degradability of protein. For more than ten years a new technology for separation of SFM in low and high cellulose fractions was developed and applied. The low cellulose fraction contains 46 or 50% crude protein (HPSFM-46 or -50). It is suitable for feeding poultry, growing pigs and lactating sows. To increase utilization of diet is necessary for SFM to be supplemented with fat, synthetic amino acids (lysine, threonine), enzymes (phithase, beta-glucanase, xylanase, protease) and eventually to be pelleted. The high cellulose fraction (17% crude protein) contains too much impregnation by lignin and silica hulls, which limit including in rations. After additional removal of parts of hulls and supplementation with molasses, minerals and vitamins, it may become acceptable concentrate feed (app. 25% CP) for low productive ruminants (dry cows, first stage of fattening animals, replacing heifers, lambs, and kids). It is necessary to prove possibilities to use this low protein fraction in rations of rabbits, pregnant sows and during the finishing period of fattening pigs. SFM for high productive ruminants should be toasted to decrease degradability and increase utilization of protein. Studies are needed for better estimation of the feeding characteristics of different new SFM products, for optimizing combinations with other protein sources, and for establishing the best composition of feed mixtures for different species and categories of animal. Trials are needed for estimation of the degree of replacement of soybean meal by new SFM products and its economic impact on animal production.

AB  - The FATTY ACID DESATURASE 7 (FAD7) enzyme is widely conserved across many groups of plants and influences resistance to multiple stresses, including aphid infestation. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Brassicaceae), a loss-of-function mutation in the FAD7 gene decreases population growth of a generalist herbivore, the green peach aphid (GPA), Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). This study used multiple bioassay designs to further characterize the effects of a fad7 mutant on the GPA, and also to determine whether fad7 impacts a specialist herbivore, the cabbage aphid (CA), Brevicoryne brassicae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae). In choice assays, when presented with wild-type A. thaliana (Col-0) or fad7, neither GPA nor CA showed a preference between genotypes within 48 h. In no-choice assays the fad7 mutation decreased the overall population growth of GPA, with significant differences in juvenile production occurring as early as 48 h after infestation. In contrast, CA showed comparable population growth on fad7 and Col-0 at all time points, from 24 to 144 h (6 days). No-choice assays also demonstrated that the fad7 mutation increased GPA development time and reduced fecundity but did not influence the mortality rates of adults or juveniles, or the weight of newly emerged adults reared on fad7. These results indicate that aphid resistance in the fad7 mutant is species-specific, and that it impacts the population growth of GPA solely through antibiosis, decreasing adult fecundity and increasing juvenile development time.

AB  - The tumor microenvironment is a complex ecosystem that plays a critical role in cancer progression and treatment response. Recently, extracellular amyloid fibrils have emerged as novel components of the tumor microenvironment; however, their function remains elusive. In this study, we establish a direct connection between the presence of amyloid fibrils in the secretome and the activation of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator involved in cancer proliferation and drug resistance. Furthermore, we uncover a shared mechano-signaling mechanism triggered by amyloid fibrils in both melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the glycocalyx protein Agrin which binds to extracellular amyloid fibrils and acts as a necessary factor in driving amyloid-dependent YAP activation. Additionally, we reveal the involvement of the HIPPO pathway core kinase LATS1 in this signaling cascade. Finally, we demonstrate that extracellular amyloid fibrils enhance cancer cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, our research expands our knowledge of the tumor microenvironment by uncovering the role of extracellular amyloid fibrils in driving mechano-signaling and YAP activation. This knowledge opens up new avenues for developing innovative strategies to modulate YAP activation and mitigate its detrimental effects during cancer progression.

AB  - Therapeutic hypothermia significantly improves outcomes after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy but is only partially protective. There is evidence that cortical inhibitory interneuron circuits are particularly vulnerable to HI and that loss of interneurons may be an important contributor to long-term neurological dysfunction in these infants. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that the duration of hypothermia has differential effects on interneuron survival after HI. Near-term fetal sheep received sham ischemia or cerebral ischemia for 30 min, followed by cerebral hypothermia from 3 h after ischemia end and continued up to 48 h, 72 h, or 120 h recovery. Sheep were euthanized after 7 days for histology. Hypothermia up to 48 h recovery resulted in moderate neuroprotection of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)(+) and parvalbumin(+) interneurons but did not improve survival of calbindin(+) cells. Hypothermia up to 72 h recovery was associated with significantly increased survival of all three interneuron phenotypes compared with sham controls. By contrast, while hypothermia up to 120 h recovery did not further improve (or impair) GAD(+) or parvalbumin(+) neuronal survival compared with hypothermia up to 72 h, it was associated with decreased survival of calbindin(+) interneurons. Finally, protection of parvalbumin(+) and GAD(+) interneurons, but not calbindin(+) interneurons, with hypothermia was associated with improved recovery of electroencephalographic (EEG) power and frequency by day 7 after HI. The present study demonstrates differential effects of increasing the duration of hypothermia on interneuron survival after HI in near-term fetal sheep. These findings may contribute to the apparent preclinical and clinical lack of benefit of very prolonged hypothermia.

AB  - Herbivores are frequently exposed to potentially toxic doses of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). Furthermore, the plant species available and their associated PSMs may change over extended time periods. To understand the ability of herbivores to biotransform novel PSMs, we investigated populations of one species of mammalian herbivore that had undergone a radical diet shift, i.e., the desert woodrat's (Neotoma lepida) switch juniper (Juniperus spp) to creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). To determine whether woodrats currently feeding on creosote also retain the ability to consume and biotransform the PSMs in their ancestral diet of juniper, we compared various metrics of hepatic biotransformation in a population that ingests creosote bush (Mojave woodrats) to one that specializes on the ancestral diet of juniper (Great Basin woodrats). We investigated PSM biotransformation capabilities by quantifying the hepatic metabolism of alpha-pinene, a common terpene in juniper. We also measured total cytochrome P450 content, cytochrome P450 2B (CYP2B) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) concentrations, and the activity of GST in the livers of both populations consuming control (rabbit chow) and juniper diets. There were no differences in hepatic metabolism of alpha-pinene, total P450 content, or CYP2B concentration between woodrat populations when feeding on juniper. The only difference found was that the Mojave woodrats had higher GST activity compared to the Great Basin woodrats when feeding on juniper. Our results suggest that despite the change to a novel toxic diet, the Mojave woodrats maintain the capacity to metabolize their ancestral diet of juniper.

AB  - The efficient management and utilization of coal mine equipment maintenance knowledge is an indispensable foundation for advancing the establishment of intelligent mines. This knowledge has problems such as scattered, low sharing, and insufficient management, which restricts the development of coal mine intelligence. For the above-mentioned problems, a large language model for the maintenance of coal mine equipment based on multi-source text (XCoalChat) was proposed to better manage and utilize the existing massive knowledge of coal mine equipment maintenance. The dataset of coal mine equipment maintenance based on ReliableCEMK-Self-Instruction was constructed to obtain a wide and diverse amount of knowledge through sample generation. Aiming at the illusory problem of the large language model, a knowledge graph enhancement method based on the "Coal Mine Equipment Maintenance System-Full Life Cycle-Specification" was proposed to improve the knowledge density. A triple-LoRA fine-tuning mechanism and DPO direct preference optimization method were introduced into the top of the baseline model, which guarantees that XCoalChat can handle multiple Q&A and maintenance decision analysis tasks with limited computing power. Compared with ChatGLM, Bloom, and LLama, the comprehensive assessment of XCoalChat was performed by experiments including coal mine dialog consulting, coal mine professional consulting, and maintenance decision analysis. The results showed that XCoalChat achieved the best response accuracy in professional consulting and maintenance decision analysis; XCoalChat also took the least reasoning time on average. XCoalChat outperformed other mainstream large language models, which verify that XCoalChat is an effective large language model in the field of coal mine equipment maintenance.

AB  - This study aimed to detect the incidence, seasonal variation, age susceptibility of domestic pigeon to P. canariensis as well as ultra-morphological and molecular identification of circulating species (spp.) in Egypt. To achieve this aim; different pigeon premises in El- Gharbia governorate were investigated to correlate the findings with environmental factors responsible for parasitism. A total of two hundred pigeons (100 squabs and 100 adult) were examined for the presence of P. canariensis. during the period from March 2020 to March 2021. The incidence of P. canariensis was 64% among the examined birds. Higher incidence was recorded in young squabs than adults. P. canariensis infestation was predominant in both summer and spring seasons. The pigeon fly is a medium to large sized, flat with a flattened head, thorax and abdomen with short sheathed palpi (twice longer than broad). The wings are characterized by weak posterior veins, which have five veins behind the costal vein. The molecular characterization of this fly using the COX I (GenBank accession No. MW853922) was revealed that 704 bp, which displayed as 99.78% identity with the COI gene of Pseudolynchia sp. In a conclusion, to manage the external parasitism; sanitation and cleanliness are essential. Deltamethrin (Butox, 12.5 %) is effective insecticides periodically used as spray to overcome ectoparasites infestations for both bird and surrounding environment.

AB  - The South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), is one of the major invasive pests that causes severe economic damage to several hosts, especially tomato plants, globally. Spinosad, a biopesticide widely used against several insect pests, also shows promising results against T. absoluta. Here, we investigated the evolution of spinosad resistance and its effects on biological traits and related gene effects to fully understand the relationship between resistance degree and associated fitness costs. The spinosad-resistant strain (SpRS) with a moderate level of resistance (14.40-fold) was developed following continuous selection of the susceptible strain (SS) against spinosad for eight generations. Fitness analysis showed that the larval and pupal developmental durations were significantly increased, while the adult emergence was substantially reduced in the SpRS compared to SS. Adult longevity (male and female), fecundity, and hatching rates significantly decreased in the SpRS T. absoluta compared to SS. Additionally, the gene expression analyses indicated the down-regulation of development and reproduction-related genes (Vg, VgR, JHBP, JHAMT, JHE, and JHDK) in the SpRS population. Further, the mRNA expression level of the resistance-related cytochrome P450 gene CYP321C40, followed by CYP4M116, CYP6AW1, CYP339A1, and CYP6AB327, were significantly increased in the SpRS T. absoluta. Taken together, these results indicated that although T. absoluta developed a moderate level of spinosad resistance accompanied by fitness costs, continuous and indiscriminate use might elevate the resistance level. Overall, these findings provide important information about the trade-off between resistance degree and fitness cost that might be crucial to designing resistance management strategies against this key invasive herbivore.

AB  - The intensity of use of a location is one of the most studied properties of animal movement, yet movement analyses generally focus on the overall use of a location without much consideration of how patterns in intensity of use emerge. Extracting properties related to intensity of use, such as the number of visits, the average and variation in time spent and the average and variation in time between visits, could help provide a more mechanistic understanding of how animals use landscape. Combining and synthesizing these properties into a single spatial representation could inform the role that a location plays for an animal.We developed an R package named 'UseScape' that allows the extraction of these metrics and then clustered them using mixture modelling to create a spatial representation of the type of use an animal makes of the landscape. We illustrate applications of the approach using datasets of animal movement from four taxa and highlight species-specific and cross-species insights.Our framework highlights properties that functionally differ in how animals use them, contrasting, for example, heavily used locations that emerge because they are frequented for long durations, locations that are repeatedly and regularly visited for shorter durations of time or locations visited irregularly. We found that species generally had similar types of use, such as typical low, mid and high use, but there were also species-specific clusters that would have been ignored when only focusing on the overall intensity of use.Our multi-system comparison highlighted how the framework provided novel insights that would not have been directly obtainable by currently available approaches. By making the framework available as an R package, these analyses can be easily applicable to a myriad of systems where relocation data are available. Movement ecology as a field can strongly benefit from approaches that not just describe patterns in space use, but also highlight the behavioural mechanisms leading to these emerging patterns.

AB  - Simple Summary Piglets experience a significant temperature drop soon after birth and the time taken to recover can impact their survival and growth. Rectal temperature is the best method currently used to monitor temperature change, however, it is invasive and requires handling which can be stressful. Infrared camera technology has improved and surface temperature has been suggested to be a good substitute for rectal temperature. A study was undertaken to investigate the utility of infrared measurements of piglets from immediately after birth to 24 h old. Results showed that surface temperature had a similar temperature pattern to rectal temperature but was highly affected by the environment and cannot be recommended as a substitute for rectal temperature measurement.Abstract The use of infrared cameras to record surface temperature has shown some promise in older pigs, but neonatal piglets are metabolically less mature and experience rapid temperature changes during their first 24 h. The present experiment aimed to compare rectal temperature to surface temperature at the base of the ear, measured using an infrared camera, for piglets of different birth weights. During farrowing, 48 multiparous sows were monitored, and rectal and surface temperatures were recorded for their lower-birth-weight (<= 1.2 kg) piglets within 3 min of birth and at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.50, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h. Piglet birth weights were assigned to one of three categories (BWC): BWC1 (<= 0.80 kg), BWC2 (0.81 to 1.10 kg), or BWC3 (1.11 to 1.20 kg). Piglet rectal temperatures at 1.25 h after birth were assigned to one of three categories: RC1 (<= 32.0 degrees C), RC2 (32.1 to 35.0 degrees C), or RC3 (>= 35.1 degrees C). Surface temperatures showed a similar recovery pattern to rectal temperatures in the first 24 h across all piglet birth weights, although large and variable differences seen in the current study militate against surface temperature being an appropriate replacement for neonatal rectal temperature for use in production.

AB  - Cucurbitaceae plants produce cucurbitacins, bitter triterpenoids, to protect themselves against various insects and pathogens. Adult banded cucumber beetles (Diabrotica balteata), a common pest of maize and cucurbits, sequester cucurbitacins, presumably as a defensive mechanism against their natural enemies, which might reduce the efficacy of biological control agents. Whether the larvae also sequester and are protected by cucurbitacins is unclear. We profiled cucurbitacin levels in four varieties of cucumber, Cucumis sativus, and in larvae fed on these varieties. Then, we evaluated larval growth and resistance against common biocontrol organisms including insect predators, entomopathogenic nematodes, fungi and bacteria. We found considerable qualitative and quantitative differences in the cucurbitacin levels of the four cucumber varieties. While two varieties were fully impaired in their production, the other two accumulated high levels of cucurbitacins. We also observed that D. balteata larvae sequester and metabolize cucurbitacins, and although the larvae fed extensively on both belowground and aboveground tissues, the sequestered cucurbitacins were mainly derived from belowground tissues. Cucurbitacins had no detrimental effects on larval performance and, surprisingly, did not provide protection against any of the natural enemies evaluated. Our results show that D. balteata larvae can indeed sequester and transform cucurbitacins, but sequestered cucurbitacins do not impact the biocontrol potential of common natural enemies used in biocontrol. Hence, this plant trait should be conserved in plant breeding programs, as it has been demonstrated in previous studies that it can provide protection against plant pathogens and generalist insects.

AB  - Hemolysins cause the lysis of invading organisms, representing major humoral immunity used by invertebrates. Hemolysins have been discovered in hemolymph of Helicoverpa armigera larvae as immune factors. As oral immunity is great important to clear general pathogens, we presumed that hemolysins may be present in oral secretions (OS). To confirm this hypothesis, we conducted four testing methods to identify hemolysin(s) in larval OS of H. armigera, and analyzed physicochemical properties of the hemolysin in comparison with hemolytic melittin of Apis mellifera (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) venom. We found hemolysin(s) from OS of H. armigera for the first time, and further identified in other lepidopteran herbivores. It could be precipitated by ammonium sulfate, which demonstrates that the hemolytic factor is proteinaceous. Labial gland showed significantly higher hemolytic activity than gut tissues, suggesting that hemolysin of OS is mainly derived from saliva secreted by labial glands. Physicochemical properties of hemolysin in caterpillar's OS were different from bee venom. It was noteworthy that hemolytic activity of OS was only partially inhibited even at 100 degrees C. Hemolytic activity of OS was not inhibited by nine tested carbohydrates contrary to bee venom melittin. Moreover, effects of metal ions on hemolytic activity were different between OS and bee venom. We conclude that there is at least a novel hemolysin in OS of herbivorous insects with proposed antibacterial function, and its hemolytic mechanism may be different from melittin. Our study enriches understanding of the potential role of hemolysins in insect immunity and provides useful data to the field of herbivorous insect-pathogen research.

AB  - Social network size has been associated with complex socio-cognitive processes (e.g., memory, perspective taking). Supporting this idea, recent neuroimaging studies in healthy adults have reported a relationship between social network size and brain volumes in regions related to memory and social cognition (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala). Lesion-deficit studies in neurological patients are rare and have been inconclusive due to differences in participant sampling and measurement. The present study uses a multiple case study approach. We investigated patients with focal damage to the hippocampus and/or amygdala (two neural structures thought to be critical for social networks), and examined the patients' social network size, loneliness, and life satisfaction relative to a non-injured comparison group. Patients with amygdalar damage had smaller social networks and reported higher levels of loneliness and lower life satisfaction, on average, than comparison participants. Patients with damage to the hippocampus reported more friends than the comparison participants, but did not differ in their ratings of loneliness or life satisfaction. This lesion study offers new evidence that the amygdala is critical for social networks, life satisfaction, and reduced loneliness.

AB  - Adequate crude protein (CP) levels in diets play potential roles in swine production. This study determined the impacts of different CP levels on the antioxidant capacity of pigs during different body weight (BW) stages. Three hundred and sixty Huanjiang mini-pigs were allocated to one of three independent experiments, including a 5-10 kg BW group, where CP levels included 14%, 16%, 18%, 20%, and 22%; a 10-20 kg BW group, where CP levels included 12%, 14%, 16%, 18%, and 20%; and a 20-30 kg BW group, where CP levels included 10%, 12%, 14%, 16%, and 18%. These independent experiments were conducted for 28, 28, and 26 days, respectively. Results showed that the 20% CP level increased (p < 0.05) the plasma CAT and GSH-Px activities and the GSH concentration of pigs than in the pigs supplemented with the 14-18% CP levels, and the 20% CP level up-regulated (p < 0.05) the ileal oxidative stress-related gene expression levels of pigs than in the pigs supplemented with the 14% CP level at the 5-10 kg BW. In addition, diets supplemented with 18% CP level increased (p < 0.05) the ileal GSH concentration of pigs than in the pigs supplemented with the 14% and 20% CP levels, and the 16-18% CP levels increased (p < 0.05) the jejunal SOD activity of pigs than in the pigs supplemented with the 14% CP level. At 10-20 kg BW, the 16% CP level presented the strongest jejunal and ileal antioxidant capacity, the 18% CP level had the lowest plasma concentrations of MDA and highest GSH, and the 14-16% CP levels increased the plasma CAT and SOD activities (p < 0.05). Moreover, the 16-20% CP levels up-regulated (p < 0.05) the oxidative stress-related gene expression levels. At 20-30 kg BW, diets supplemented with the 16% CP level increased the plasma CAT activity of pigs than in the pigs supplemented with the 12-14% CP levels, and the 14-16% CP levels decreased the MDA concentration compared with the 10% CP levels (p < 0.05). In conclusion, these findings indicate adequate CP levels of 20%, 16%, and 14% for Huanjiang mini-pigs at the 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 kg BW stages, respectively.

AB  - Animal posture is a manifestation of animal behavior, and an animal's behavior provides information about their health, welfare, and living environment. In recent years, machine vision and machine learning technologies have been widely used to detect individual or group behavior of pigs. The purpose of this study is to use machine vision and deep learning technologies to recognize and score multiple postures (standing, sitting, sternal recumbency, ventral recumbency and lateral recumbency) of pigs under commercial conditions based on depth images. In this study, the Azure Kinect DK depth camera with a top view was used to obtain the depth image of pigs, and the target pig image was obtained by GrabCut image segmentation and watershed segmentation of target object calibration. Then, based on the characteristics of the image, the convex hull, boundary, and the depth distance of the shoulder and the hip were obtained. The ratio of the convex hull perimeter to the boundary and the ratio of the convex hull area to the boundary, as well as the depth distance of the shoulder and the hip, and the depth distance ratio of the shoulder to the hip were obtained as the input of the Convolutional Neural Network-Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM) classification model, and the model was trained and tested. In various classifier detection experiments, the performance of our pig posture classifier for standing posture and lateral recumbency posture was better, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) values being 0.9969 and 0.9967, respectively. However, the performance of sitting posture, sternal recumbency posture and ventral recumbency posture classifier was slightly worse but still had good performance: AUC values were 0.9790, 0.9355 and 0.9795, respectively. The model in this article was used to detect the average postures of pigs in one day (taking the average for eight consecutive days), and it was found that the proportion of lying postures was higher than other postures (lying postures were 72%, standing postures were 20%, and sitting postures were 8%). The proportion of standing postures in the daytime was higher than that in the evening, and lying posture was the opposite. The proportion of the three lying postures also changes over time. This study compared the difference of posture recognition accuracy between the model in this paper (CNN-SVM), SVM and CNN; using the same training data and experimental data, the accuracy of posture recognition of the three models was 94.6368%, 92.2175% and 90.5396%, respectively. Therefore, the recognition accuracy of the model in this paper was improved greatly compared with CNN and SVM.

AB  - Colostrum, the first milk produced by mammals, is rich in various bioactive components that provide numerous health benefits to newborns, such as growth factors, hormones, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and enzymes. Topical application of bovine or equine colostrum has been found to improve regeneration, accelerate cutaneous wound healing, and have moisturizing, protective, and anti-aging properties. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a cosmetic preparation containing sheep colostrum on skin with signs of aging in mature women. Fifty-two women, aged 40-70, were randomized into two groups to receive either colostrum or placebo cream. The participants applied the cream for eight weeks. Skin hydration, TEWL, sebum, erythema, and tone were measured using a standardized Courage + Khazaka electronic GmbH Multi Probe Adapter; skin elasticity was measured with a cutometer, and images were taken by FotoMedicus. The treatment increased skin moisture, reduced TEWL, and improved skin firmness. These findings were confirmed by the subjective survey. The participants reported, inter alia, improved skin softness and less redness and hypersensitivity. Sheep colostrum cream was more effective at improving skin conditions than placebo cream. Colostrum creams can improve certain aspects of skin quality, especially the hydrolipid barrier, and overall rejuvenation.

AB  - Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a phytohormone that has been used to artificially induce plant resistance against multiple arthropod herbivores. However, it is still uncertain whether MeJA can trigger pepper plant resistance against Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) (green peach aphid, GPA). In this study, we assessed the effects of different concentrations (0, 0.008, 0.04, 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 mM) of MeJA-treated pepper on the development and reproduction performance of GPA to identify an appropriate concentration for vigorous resistance enhancement. MeJA dose was applied on the pepper to investigate the changes in activities of protective enzyme (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; peroxidase, POD and polyphenol oxidase, PPO), detoxification enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, AchE; glutathione S-transferase, GSTs; cytocrome P450, CYP450, and carboxylesterase, CarE), and digestive enzymes (protease, PRO and amylase, AMY) in GPA. The results showed that all concentrations of MeJA-treated pepper significantly suppressed GPA performance, wherein 0.2 mM was the optimal concentration, as it presented the lowest intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), finite rate of increase (lambda), and the highest population doubling time (Dt) values. Furthermore, the protective enzymes (SOD and CAT), detoxification enzymes (GSTs, CYP450, and CarE), and AMY activities increased significantly in MeJA-treated groups than the control group, while the POD and PPO activities were remarkly inhibited under 0.2 mM treatment. These findings indicate that exogenous spraying of 0.2 mM of MeJA significantly enhanced pepper resistance against GPA. The result of this study suggests MeJA application can be used as a promising strategy in integrative management of this insect pest.

AB  - Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd) is globally recognized as a destructive polyphagous insect pest of various crops in the world. It is commonly managed by chemical pesticides, which can cause deleterious effects such as environmental pollution, toxicity to non-target organisms and the emergence of secondary pests. Hence, investigations into alternative pest control strategies such as the use of resistant host plant cultivar against S. littoralis is important. This study aimed to explore the nutritional performance of S. littoralis larvae in dependence on total anthocyanin, flavonoid, and phenol levels across 11 bean cultivars (Phaseolus and Vigna spp.) under laboratory conditions. The results revealed that the Mashhad cultivar accumulated the highest amount of total phenols (13.59 mg ml(-1)), whereas Yaghout and Arabi cultivars posed the lowest total phenols contents (1.80 and 1.90 mg ml(-1), respectively). Across larval instars (third to sixth), the highest consumption index and relative consumption rate were recorded on the Mashhad cultivar. The lowest values of efficiency of conversion of ingested food and the efficiency of conversion of digested food of total larval instars were detected in the larvae which were reared on the Mashhad cultivar. Likewise, the lowest value of the index of plant quality (IPQ) was obtained in the Mashhad cultivar; however, IPQ was figured out at the highest level in the Arabi cultivar. Our findings show that the differential accumulation of secondary metabolites would change the nutritional quality of plants for S. littoralis. Based on the findings, the Mashhad cultivar may serve as a candidate for either integrated pest management or breeding programs aiming at controlling this pest.

AB  - All yellow Camellia plants in China are threatened, but their classification is contentious. Here, we performed a phylogenetic reconstruction based on nuclear double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), transcriptomes, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS), and the small single-copy region of the chloroplast genome, in combination with morphological evidence to help resolve taxonomic ambiguity of those rare and threatened species. Conflicting relationships were derived from nuclear and chloroplast sequences. The strong hybridization/introgression signal detected suggests reticulate evolution mainly caused this discordance pattern. The nuclear-ddRAD and RNA-seq phylogenies fit better to the yellow camellias' morphology, providing a clear resolution for inferring their relationships in China. Based on present phylogenetic analyses and morphological characters, we propose these taxonomic suggestions: (i) Camellia petelotii and Camellia nitidissima are distinct species; (ii) Camellia ptilosperma, Camellia longruiensis, Camellia longgangensis, and C. longgangensis var. grandis are conspecific with Camellia flavida; (iii) Camellia multipetala and C. longgangensis var. patens are synonyms of Camellia quinqueloculosa, and C. quinqueloculosa should be recognized as an independent species; (iv) Camellia wumingensis should be formally recognized as an independent species; (v) Camellia longzhouensis is a synonym of Camellia chrysanthoides; (vi) Camellia xiashiensis and Camellia parvipetala should be treated as synonyms of Camellia micrantha; (vii) Camellia achrysantha is a good species; (viii) Camellia tunghinensis is an independent species; (ix) species status of Camellia huana is well-supported; and (x) Camellia pingguoensis var. terminals should be correctly identified to species level as Camellia terminalis. These results provide the basis for the recognition 20 yellow Camellia species in China.

AB  - Plant volatiles serve as critical cues for mate location in herbivorous insects, often interacting with sex pheromones to enhance attraction. For male Apolygus lucorum, sex pheromone lures were found to be highly attractive in field traps but showed no significant effect in laboratory assays, suggesting that host plant volatiles may influence the detection of sex pheromones. To investigate this hypothesis, we first simulated field conditions using an H-type olfactometer and obtained consistent results. Subsequently, 15 odorant receptors (ORs) exhibiting high or male-biased expression in male antennae were selected for functional characterization. These AlucORs were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their responses to 64 compounds were analyzed using two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings. Among the 15 AlucORs examined, nine displayed functional responses to the tested compounds. Of these responsive AlucORs, six displayed a broad ligand spectrum, responding to both major sex pheromone component trans-2-hexenyl butyrate (E2HB) and structurally similar floral esters. In particular, recombinant AlucOR3 and AlucOR81 were highly sensitive to the two key floral esters, butyl propionate and butyl butyrate, as well as to E2HB. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a novel clade of ORs (AlucOR3-subclade) in mirid bugs that exhibited dual sensitivity to both sex pheromones and floral volatiles and was subject to strong purifying selection. Additionally, bioactive ligands combined with E2HB could influence the behavioral attractiveness of male bugs. Our findings provide molecular and behavioral evidence for a synergistic mate-location strategy where plant-derived cues enhance pheromone perception in this agricultural pest.

AB  - Simple Summary
   An abattoir based surveillance system was implemented in the Lao People's Democratic Republic to determine the prevalence of two diseases that can spread between animals and humans: Brucellosis and Q fever. A total of 683 cattle and buffalo samples were collected from abattoirs in six selected provinces between March-December 2019. Laboratory diagnostic tests to detect antibodies against both diseases were performed and the number of animals that tested positive for either disease was relatively low. However, extensive animal movement within the country was also identified, which has the potential to increase the risk of spreading disease within and between countries. Monitoring of high impact animal/human diseases assists pathogen surveillance and the country's food security. This study highlights the importance of ongoing animal health surveillance and the need to find cost-effective approaches for its long-term sustainability.
   Although animal health surveillance programmes are useful for gaining information to help improve global health and food security, these programmes can be challenging to establish in developing economies with a low-resource base. This study focused on establishing a national surveillance system initiated by the Lao PDR government using a passive surveillance system of abattoir samples as a pilot model, and to gain information on contagious zoonoses, particularly Q fever and brucellosis, in the large ruminant population. A total of 683 cattle and buffalo samples were collected from six selected provinces of Lao PDR between March-December 2019. Out of 271 samples tested, six samples (2.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.0, 4.8) were positive in the Q fever antibody ELISA test. Only one sample (out of 683; 0.2%, 95% CI 0.0, 0.8) tested positive to the Brucella antibody ELISA test. Seroprevalence of these important zoonoses in Lao PDR were relatively low in cattle and buffaloes; however, extensive animal movement within the country was identified which could increase risks of spreading transboundary diseases. The study highlights the importance of ongoing animal health surveillance and the need to find cost-effective approaches for its long-term sustainability.

AB  - Previously, the 5 kDa retentate (5kDaR) of a casein hydrolysate (CH) and yeast beta-glucan (YBG) were identified as promising anti-inflammatory dietary supplements for supporting intestinal health in pigs post-weaning. However, their direct effects on intestinal bacterial populations are less well-known. The main objectives of this study were to determine if the increasing concentrations of the CH, 5kDaR and YBG individually, can: (1) alter the bacterial and short-chain fatty acid profiles in a weaned pig faecal batch fermentation assay, and (2) directly influence the growth of selected beneficial (Lactobacillus plantarum, L. reuteri, Bifidobacterium thermophilum) and pathogenic (Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium) bacterial strains in individual pure culture growth assays. The potential of CH as a comparable 5kDaR substitute was also evaluated. The 5kDaR increased lactobacilli counts and butyrate concentration in the batch fermentation assay (P < 0.05) and increased L. plantarum (linear, P < 0.05), L. reuteri (quadratic, P < 0.05) and B. thermophilum (linear, P < 0.05) counts and reduced S. typhimurium (quadratic, P = 0.058) counts in the pure culture growth assays. CH increased butyrate concentration (P < 0.05) in the batch fermentation assay. YBG reduced Prevotella spp. counts (P < 0.05) and butyrate concentration (P < 0.05) in the batch fermentation assay. Both CH and YBG had no major effects in the pure culture growth assays. In conclusion, the 5kDaR had the most beneficial effects associated with increased counts of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera and butyrate production and reduced S. typhimurium counts in vitro indicating its potential to promote gastrointestinal health.

AB  - Real-time target detection plays an important role in campus intelligent surveillance systems. This paper introduces Soft-NMS, GSConv, Triplet Attention, and other advanced technologies to propose a lightweight pedestrian and vehicle detection model named SGST-YOLOv8. In this paper, the improved YOLOv8 model is trained on the self-made dataset, and the tracking algorithm is combined to achieve an accurate and efficient real-time pedestrian and vehicle tracking detection system. The improved model achieved an accuracy of 88.6%, which is 1.2% higher than the baseline model YOLOv8. Additionally, the mAP0.5:0.95 increased by 3.2%. The model parameters and GFLOPS reduced by 5.6% and 7.9%, respectively. In addition, this study also employed the improved YOLOv8 model combined with the bot sort tracking algorithm on the website for actual detection. The results showed that the improved model achieves higher FPS than the baseline YOLOv8 model when detecting the same scenes, with an average increase of 3-5 frames per second. The above results verify the effectiveness of the improved model for real-time target detection in complex environments.

AB  - BACKGROUNDGut microbiota mediating insect-plant interactions have many manifestations, either by provisioning missing nutrients, or by overcoming plant defensive reactions. However, the mechanism by which gut microbiota empower insects to survive by overcoming a variety of plant secondary metabolites remains largely unknown. Bactrocera minax larvae develop in immature citrus fruits, which present numerous phenolic compounds that challenge the larvae. To explore the role of gut microbes in host use and adaptability, we uncovered the mechanisms of phenol degradation by gut microbes using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses, and verified the degradation ability of isolated and cultured bacteria. Research on this subject can help develop potential strain for the environmental friendly pest management operations. RESULTSWe demonstrated the ability of gut microbes in B. minax larvae to degrade phenols in unripe citrus. After antibiotic treatment, coniferyl alcohol and coumaric aldehyde significantly reduced the survival rate, body length and body weight of the larvae. The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses in B. minax provided evidence for the presence of genes in bacteria and the related pathway involved in phenol degradation. Among them, Enterococcus faecalis and Serratia marcescens, isolated from the gut of B. minax larvae, played critical roles in phenol degradation. Furthermore, supplementation of E. faecalis and S. marcescens in artificial diets containing coniferyl alcohol and coumaric aldehyde increased the survival rate of larvae. CONCLUSIONIn summary, our results provided the first comprehensive analysis of gut bacterial communities by high-throughput sequencing and elucidated the role of bacteria in phenol degradation in B. minax, which shed light on the mechanism underlying specialist insect adaption to host secondary metabolites via gut bacteria.

AB  - Spatial navigation has received much attention from neuroscientists, leading to the identification of key brain areas and the discovery of numerous spatially selective cells. Despite this progress, our understanding of how the pieces fit together to drive behavior is generally lacking. We argue that this is partly caused by insufficient communication between behavioral and neuroscientific researchers. This has led the latter to under-appreciate the relevance and complexity of spatial behavior, and to focus too narrowly on characterizing neural repre-sentations of space-disconnected from the computations these representations are meant to enable. We therefore propose a taxonomy of navigation processes in mammals that can serve as a common framework for structuring and facilitating interdisciplinary research in the field. Using the taxonomy as a guide, we review behavioral and neural studies of spatial navigation. In doing so, we validate the taxonomy and showcase its usefulness in identifying potential issues with common experimental approaches, designing experiments that adequately target particular behaviors, correctly interpreting neural activity, and pointing to new avenues of research.

AB  - Understanding the environmental and microbial processes involved in DNA degradation from archaeological remains is a fundamental part of managing bone specimens. We investigated the state of DNA preservation in 33 archaeozoological caribou (Rangifer tarandus) ribs excavated from the same excavation trench at a former Inuit hunting camp in West Greenland, separated by 43 years: 1978 and 2021. Our findings show that DNA is better preserved in the most recently excavated samples, indicating a detrimental effect of museum storage on DNA integrity. Additionally, our data reveals a diverse microbiome in these bones, encoding genes relevant for bone degradation, such as enzymatic families relating to collagenases, peptidases and glycosidases. Microbes associated with bone degradation were present in both new and historical samples, with museum-stored bones showing significantly more DNA damage. Overall, our research sheds light on the nuanced dynamics governing the preservation of genomic material in archaeological contexts, underscoring the vital importance of careful considerations in museum curation practices for the sustainable conservation of invaluable skeletal records in museum repositories and in situ.

AB  - P2X3-receptors localized in the hippocampus participate in the transmission of excitation and the formation of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. P2X3-receptors are of great importance in the occurrence of neuropathic pain in epilepsy, acute and inflammatory pain of various genesis and localization as well as in the activation and growth of nerves after traumatic brain injury. The aim of the study was to study the elastic properties of the surface and the metabolic profile of neurons in an embryonic primary mixed hippocampal culture under P2X3-receptor blockade. The study was performed on a primary mixed culture of hippocampal neurons obtained from CD1 mice on the 18th day of gestation (E18). The highly selective blocker 5-(5-iodo-2-isopropyl-4-methoxyphenoxy)pyrimidine-2.4-diamine monochloride salt was selected as a P2X3-receptor blocker. To assess the elastic properties of neurons Young's modulus that characterizes the rigidity of the cell surface was measured. Measurements on an atomic force microscope applying a load in 25 local areas of the cell surface were performed. At each point, the force curves of the cantilever approach and retraction were recorded with subsequent calculation of Young's modulus. The metabolic profile of the neuroglial culture in Energy Phenotype test on a Seahorse HS mini cell metabolism analyzer (USA) was studied. The Young's modulus of the cell surface of neurons in the control was in the range from 6.8 +/- 0.1 to 9.7 +/- 0.2 kPa, and under the action of the P2X3-receptor blocker in the range from 3.1 +/- 0.1 kPa to 8.5 +/- 0.1 kPa. Under the conditions of P2X3-receptor blockade on the 5th day of differentiation the Young's modulus of the cell surface was reduced by 62% (p < 0.05), on the 8th day it increased by 22% (p < 0.05) and by the 11th day it decreased by 16.7% (p < 0.05) compared to the control. Aerobic respiration was characteristic of the embryonic hippocampal culture both in the control and with the P2X3-receptor blockade. Consequently, the blockade of the P2X3-receptor did not affect the metabolic profile of the E18 hippocampal culture. The obtained data indicate the direct participation of the P2X3-receptor in the formation of biomechanical properties of the cell surface in the processes of differentiation and signal transduction. It is possible, that the blockade of the P2X3-receptor will be one of the promising molecular targets that can reduce neuronal damage in brain injuries, neuroinflammation, hypoxia, and epilepsy. In addition, the study of the P2X3-receptor blockade can expand the fundamental understanding of the role of the purinergic signaling system in the formation of complex neuronal morphology at early stages of embryonic development under conditions of rapid excitatory signal transmission mediated by the ATP molecule.

AB  - PremiseAcmopyle (Podocarpaceae) comprises two extant species from Oceania that are physiologically restricted to ever-wet rainforests, a confirmed fossil record based on leaf adpressions and cuticles in Australia since the Paleocene, and a few uncertain reports from New Zealand, Antarctica, and South America. We investigated fossil specimens with Acmopyle affinities from the early Eocene Laguna del Hunco site in Patagonia, Argentina. MethodsWe studied 42 adpression leafy-shoot fossils and included them in a total evidence phylogenetic analysis. ResultsAcmopyle grayae sp. nov. is based on heterophyllous leafy shoots with three distinct leaf types. Among these, bilaterally flattened leaves uniquely preserve subparallel, linear features that we interpret as accessory transfusion tissue (ATT, an extra-venous water-conducting tissue). Some apical morphologies of A. grayae shoots are compatible with the early stages of ovuliferous cone development. Our phylogenetic analysis recovers the new species in a polytomy with the two extant Acmopyle species. We report several types of insect-herbivory damage. We also transfer Acmopyle engelhardti from the middle Eocene Rio Pichileufu flora to Dacrycarpus engelhardti comb. nov. ConclusionsWe confirm the biogeographically significant presence of the endangered West Pacific genus Acmopyle in Eocene Patagonia. Acmopyle is one of the most drought-intolerant genera in Podocarpaceae, possibly due to the high collapse risk of the ATT, and thus the new fossil species provides physiological evidence for the presence of an ever-wet rainforest environment at Laguna del Hunco during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum.

AB  - The nucleus reuniens (RE) is a midline thalamic structure interconnecting the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC). Recent work in both rodents and humans implicates the RE in the adaptive regulation of emotional memories, including the suppression of learned fear. However, the neural correlates of aversive learning in the RE of rodents and humans remain unclear. To address this, we recorded RE activity in humans (BOLD fMRI) and rats (fiber photometry) during Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction. In both rats and humans, we found that conditioned stimulus (CS)-evoked activity in RE reflects the associative value of the CS. In rats, we additionally found that spontaneous neural activity in RE tracks defensive freezing and shows anticipatory increases in calcium activity that precede the termination of freezing behavior. Single-unit recordings in rats confirmed that individual RE neurons index both the associative value of the CS and defensive behavior transitions. Moreover, distinct neuronal ensembles in the RE encode fear versus extinction memories. These findings suggest a conserved role of the RE across species in modulating defensive states and emotional memory processes, providing a foundation for future translational research on fear-related disorders.

AB  - Trade-offs between plant defense investment and fitness traits, including growth, are often invoked to explain evolutionary strategies targeted at resisting herbivores. Many Pinus species have specialized herbivores, including the mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae, and have historically been a focus of defense investigations. We compared defense traits of two high-elevation Pinus species, P. aristata and P. flexilis, that are hosts to MPB and hypothesized to have different growth and defense traits and potential trade-offs. Interspecific differences were assessed by sampling trees within the same stands, and intraspecific differences were assessed by sampling stands at sites across latitudes where both species co-occurred. Constitutive defenses were measured at Day 0, and the timing, concentration, and composition of an induced resin defense response were assessed by sampling at 1, 4, and 30 days following either mechanical wounding only or a simulated MPB attack using its primary fungal symbiont Grosmannia clavigera. At Day 4, induced resin concentrations did not differ between mechanical wounding and simulated MPB attack in either species. By Day 30, resin defense concentrations in response to simulated MPB attack were greater than those in response to mechanical wounding and were >19-fold greater than constitutive levels. Results suggest that initial induced resin defense responses in the two species are likely generalized, with a delayed response that is targeted specifically at MPB and G. clavigera. At all sites, P. aristata had higher concentrations of constitutive and Day-30 induced resin defenses than P. flexilis, although P. flexilis induced proportionately more. Trade-offs in growth and defense between the species were only found at the two most climatically favorable sites where P. aristata grew slower than P. flexilis. No trade-offs were found between the two defense types at either biological scale. Overall, our findings highlight that the two pine species growing in the same stands (1) have a delayed response to a specialized native herbivore and fungal symbiont, (2) only exhibited interspecific defense-growth trade-offs at two climatically favorable sites, and showed no intraspecific defense-growth trade-offs, (3) showed no trade-offs between constitutive and induced defenses at either biological scale, and (4) have evolved different defense strategies.

AB  - Parasitoids lay their eggs in or on a host, usually another insect. During foraging, parasitoids can encounter insects that differ in terms of host suitability and quality. At one extreme end of this spectrum are non-hosts that are unsuitable for offspring development. Non-hosts are generally ignored but parasitization does occur and occasionally also results in egg deposition. Here, the authors investigate how oviposition in a non-host influences subsequent foraging behaviour of a parasitoid and whether this is mediated by learning. The study system consists of the endoparasitoid Cotesia glomerata and the presumed non-host caterpillar Mamestra brassicae. In the presence of Pieris brassicae hosts and/or their traces (frass), C. glomerata inserted its ovipositor into M. brassicae caterpillars. Eggs were deposited, but all eggs disappeared within 96 h, confirming the non-host status of M. brassicae. In contrast to the expectation, there was no memory retention after oviposition in a non-host and parasitoids did not alter their behaviour with respect to non-host contacts and ovipositions. Instead, C. glomerata became more motivated to forage on a non-host infested leaf. The authors propose that egg deposition in non-hosts by C. glomerata might be due to their high egg load, which is thought to make parasitoids less selective on host quality, especially when they have few reproductive opportunities. In such cases, fitness costs to individual females are low. Egg deposition in non-hosts might ultimately lead to host range expansion if parasitoids overcome the defence response of non-hosts over evolutionary time.

AB  - We report the nanoscale spin detection and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of copper (Cu2+) ions via double electron-electron resonance (DEER) with single spins in diamond at room temperature and low magnetic fields. We measure unexpectedly narrow EPR resonances with linewidths similar to 2 - 3 MHz from copper chloride molecules dissolved in polylysine. We also observe coherent Rabi oscillations and hyperfine splitting from single Cu2+ ions, which could be used for dynamic nuclear spin polarization and higher sensitivity of spin detection. We interpret and analyze these observations using both spin Hamiltonian modeling of the copper chloride molecules and numerical simulations of the predicted DEER response, and obtain a sensing volume similar to(250 nm)(3). This work will open the door for copper-labeled EPR measurements under ambient conditions in biomolecules and nanomaterials.

AB  - Groundwater quality is deteriorating throughout the world day by day; hence, this study was carried out to assess the groundwater quality of Taluka Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan. The assessment of groundwater quality was carried out by randomly collecting forty-three (43) groundwater samples from various locations, and physicochemical parameters of each sample were determined using standard available field and laboratory methods. Also, three (03) standard water quality indices such as the synthetic pollution index (SPI), water quality index (WQI), and pollution index of groundwater (PIG) and ArcGIS 10.3 software were used for evaluation of overall groundwater quality, and development of spatial distribution maps, respectively. Analysis revealed that 96% of the samples were colorless, odorless and had no turbidity; however, 14% of samples had a bitter taste. Furthermore, about 83.74%, 21%, 30.25%, 37%, 24%, and 83.74% of the samples had electrical conductivity, chloride, calcium, magnesium, total hardness, and total dissolved solids beyond the WHO drinking water guidelines, respectively. However, about 2.35%, 32.6%, and 65% of the samples were found slightly hard, hard, and very hard, respectively. Analysis based on the SPI categorized 49%, 30%, and 21% of the samples as moderately polluted, highly polluted, and unsuitable for drinking purposes, respectively, while the WQI categorized 53.53%, 18.6%, 16.27%, 11.6% of the samples as good, poor, very poor, and unsuitable for drinking, respectively. Whereas the PIG classified 55.18%, 13.95%, 5.95%, 11.63%, and 13.95% of the samples as insignificant, low polluted, moderately polluted, highly polluted, and unsuitable for drinking purposes, respectively. Overall, the study revealed that groundwater in most of the parts of the study area is not suitable for drinking purposes. Thus, it is recommended that groundwater of the study area should be treated well prior to its use for drinking purposes.

AB  - Animals living in a complex social environment emit diverse acoustic signals and thus serve as excellent subjects for understanding the evolution of acoustic communication. Previous studies have focused on the complexity of social calls in some group-living animals, yet the determinants of vocal complexity at the intraspecific level remain unclear. Here, we aimed to assess the influence of group composition on social call complexity in Himalayan leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros armiger) in the non-breeding season. The bats divided into three groups with the same number of individuals but with different sex ratio compositions. We monitored social vocalizations for the all-male group, the all-female group, the mixed group, and also quantified vocal complexity for each group based on multiple acoustic metrics, including vocal repertoire, call sequences, the diversity index, and information capacity. The results showed that there were significant differences in the composition of call sequences among the three bat groups. The number of vocalizations was the highest in the mixed group, while the social call complexity was the highest in the all-male group, followed by the all-female group, and was the lowest in the mixed group. The results suggest that sex ratio potentially influence the vocal repertoire in Himalayan leaf-nosed bats. Our findings might provide a cue for vocalization research to investigate sex ratio in social groups as a potential driver for vocal complexity.

We studied the properties of MSCs from the bone marrow (BM-MSC) before and after implantation under the renal capsule using a mini pig model. Autologous BM-MSCs were implanted under the kidney capsule. After 2.5 months, ectopic foci containing bones, foci of ectopic hematopoiesis, bone marrow stromal cells and muscle cells formed. Small pieces of the implant were cultivated as a whole. The cells that migrated out from these implants were cultured, cloned, analyzed and were proven to meet the most of criteria for MSCs, therefore, they are designated as MSCs from the implant-IM-MSCs. The IM-MSC population demonstrated high proliferative potential, similar to BM-MSCs. IM-MSC clones did not respond to adipogenic differentiation inductors: 33% of clones did not differentiate, and 67% differentiated toward an osteogenic lineage. The BM-MSCs revealed functional heterogeneity after implantation under the renal capsule. The BM-MSC population consists of mesenchymal precursor cells of various degrees of differentiation, including stem cells. These newly discovered properties of mini pig BM-MSCs reveal new possibilities in terms of their manipulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle is a major insulin-sensitive tissue with a pivotal role in modulating glucose homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of resveratrol (RES) intervention during the suckling period on skeletal muscle growth and insulin sensitivity of neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in a pig model.RESULTS: Twelve pairs of normal birth weight (NBW) and IUGR neonatal male piglets were selected. The NBW and IUGR piglets were fed basal formula milk diet or identical diet supplemented with 0.1% RES from 7 to 21 days of age. Myofiber growth and differentiation, inflammation and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle were assessed. Early RES intervention promoted myofiber growth and maturity in IUGR piglets by ameliorating the myogenesis process and increasing thyroid hormone level. Administering RES also reduced triglyceride concentration in skeletal muscle of IUGR piglets, along with decreased inflammatory response, increased plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) concentration and improved insulin signaling. Meanwhile, the improvement of insulin sensitivity by RES may be partly regulated by activation of the FGF21/AMP-activated protein kinase alpha/sirtuin 1/peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha pathway.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that RES has beneficial effects in promoting myofiber growth and maturity and increasing skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in IUGR piglets, which open a novel field of application of RES in IUGR infants for improving postnatal metabolic adaptation.(c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - It is not well understood how the spectral composition (wavelength) of daylight that varies considerably during the day and seasons affects photoperiodic responses in a seasonal species. Here, we investigated the molecular underpinnings of wavelength-dependent photoperiodic induction in migratory redheaded buntings transferred to 13 h long days in neutral (white), 460 nm (blue), 500 nm (green) or 620 nm (red) wavelength that were compared with one another, and to short day controls for indices of the migratory (body fattening and weight gain, and Zugunruhe) and reproductive (testicular maturation) responses. Buntings showed wavelength-dependent photoperiodic response, with delayed Zugunruhe and slower testis maturation under 620 nm red light. Post-mortem comparison of gene expressions further revealed wavelength-dependence of the photoperiodic molecular response. Whereas there were higher retinal expressions of opn2 (rhodopsin) and opn5 (neuropsin) genes in red daylight, and of rhodopsin-like opsin (rh2) gene in green daylight, the hypothalamic opn2 mRNA levels were higher in blue daylight. Similarly, we found in birds under blue daylight an increased hypothalamic expression of genes involved in the photoperiodic induction (thyroid stimulating hormone subunit beta, tshb; eye absent 3, eya3; deiodinase type 2, dio2) and associated neural responses such as the calcium signaling (ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 2, atp2a2), dopamine biosynthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase, th) and neurogenesis (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, bdnf). These results demonstrate transcriptional changes in parallel to responses associated with migration and reproduction in buntings, and suggest a role of daylight spectrum in photoperiodic induction of the vernal response in obligate spring avian migrants.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is a biological process that has a strong impact on the nutritional and sensorial properties of meat, with relevant consequences on human health. Pork loins determine the effects of marbling on the sensory attributes and meat quality properties, which differ among various pig breeds. This study explores the crosstalk of non-coding RNAs with mRNAs and analyzes the potential pathogenic role of IMF-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in IMF tissues, which offer a framework for the functional validation of key/potential genes. A high-throughput whole-genome transcriptome analysis of IMF tissues from longissimus dorsi muscles of Large White (D_JN) and Laiwu (L_JN) pigs resulted in the identification of 283 differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs), including two key circRNAs (circRNA-23437, circRNA-08840) with potential binding sites for multiple miRNAs regulating the whole network. The potential ceRNA mechanism identified the DEC target miRNAs-mRNAs involved in lipid metabolism, fat deposition, meat quality, and metabolic syndrome via the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network, concluding that ssc-mir-370 is the most important target miRNA shared by both key circRNAs. TGM2, SLC5A6, ECI1, FASN, PER1, SLC25A34, SOD1, and COL5A3 were identified as hub genes through an intensive protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of target genes acquired from the ceRNA regulatory network. Functional enrichments, pathway examinations, and qRT-PCR analyses infer their implications in fat/cholesterol metabolism, insulin secretion, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Here, circRNAs and miRNA sequencing accompanied by computational techniques were performed to analyze their expressions in IMF tissues from the longissimus dorsi muscles of two pig breeds. Their target gene evolutionary trajectories, expression profiling, functional enrichments, subcellular localizations, and structural advances with high-throughput protein modeling, following genomic organizations, will provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and IMF deposition and a much-needed qualitative framework for future research to improve meat quality and its role as a biomarker to treat lipid metabolic syndromes.

AB  - Mastication stimuli are known to relieve senile dementia in human and animal studies. However, few studies have focused on its effect on weaning-stage animals and the underlying molecular processes. In this study, 3-week-old male rats were raised on a powdered (P-group) or chow (C-group) diet for 8 days, and their behavior was examined using the Y-maze and novel object recognition tests. In the Y-maze test, the C-group rats showed a larger alternation ratio than the P-group rats. In the novel object recognition test, the C-group rats exhibited a significantly larger discrimination index for novel objects than for familiar objects, but the P-group rats did not. We then compared the hippocampal neuron morphology and transcriptome between the groups. C-group rats exhibited larger dendrite branch numbers in the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region and a larger spine density in the basal dendrites of CA1 neurons than the P-group rats. Using DNA microarray analysis, we identified 621 (P < C) and 96 (P > C) genes that were differentially expressed between the groups. These genes were enriched in functional terms related to dendrite growth and included the Igf2, RhoA, and Rho GEF genes, most of which were upregulated in the C-group. These results suggest that the mastication stimuli during the weaning period can enhance the learning ability of rats by increasing the dendrite branches of hippocampal CA1 neurons and by regulating genes related to dendrite growth.

AB  - Salmonellosis is one of the most important foodborne diseases worldwide, including the European Union. Despite the One Health approach measures for risk assessment and risk management implemented by the European Union, the occurrence of disease and disease outbreaks remains high (e.g. 694 outbreaks were reported in 2020), highlighting the need of new assessment methods. Herein we applied machine learning using the random forests method to evaluate and identify key points regarding the occurrence of Salmonella sp. along the Spanish food chain during 2015-2020, using data provided by the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition. We compared the role of the three categorical variables [product (20 categories), region (18 categories) and stage (11 categories)]. Salmonella presence was influenced by the three explanatory variables considered: first by product, followed by region and stage. The most determinant product for Salmonella probability was 'meat', while the most important stage was 'slaughterhouse'. Specifically, the highest values were found in pig and poultry meats. In these products, the Salmonella probability was high at the early and final stages of the food chain, although not at intermediate stages. The presence of Salmonella in the final stages (retail) of the food chain is of concern, as it can cause human cases of salmonellosis, including outbreaks. This study demonstrates the utility of the random forest method to identify key points and evaluate the control efforts. We recommend improving the surveillance and control measures, especially in the product and stages pointed out by our analysis, and enhancing the data collection harmonization among the different autonomous communities.

AB  - This determination of the mitochondrial effect of pharmacologically different antidepressants (agomelatine, ketamine and vortioxetine) was evaluated and quantified in vitro in pig brain-isolated mitochondria. We measured the activity of mitochondrial complexes, citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase and monoamine oxidase, and the mitochondrial respiratory rate. Total hydrogen peroxide production and ATP production were assayed. The most potent inhibitor of all mitochondrial complexes and complex I-linked respiration was vortioxetine. Agomelatine and ketamine inhibited only complex IV activity. None of the drugs affected complex II-linked respiration, citrate synthase or malate dehydrogenase activity. Hydrogen peroxide production was mildly increased by agomelatine, which might contribute to increased oxidative damage and adverse effects at high drug concentrations. Vortioxetine significantly reduced hydrogen peroxide concentrations, which might suggest antioxidant mechanism activation. All tested antidepressants were partial MAO-A inhibitors, which might contribute to their antidepressant effect. We observed vortioxetine-induced MAO-B inhibition, which might be linked to decreased hydrogen peroxide formation and contribute to its procognitive and neuroprotective effects. Mitochondrial dysfunction could be linked to the adverse effects of vortioxetine, as vortioxetine is the most potent inhibitor of mitochondrial complexes and complex I-linked respiration. Clarifying the molecular interaction between drugs and mitochondria is important to fully understand their mechanism of action and the connection between their mechanisms and their therapeutic and/or adverse effects.

AB  - There are many costs associated with increased body size and longevity in animals, including the accumulation of genotoxic and cytotoxic damage that comes with having more cells and living longer. Yet, some species have overcome these barriers and have evolved remarkably large body sizes and long lifespans, sometimes within a narrow window of evolutionary time. Here, we demonstrate through phylogenetic comparative analysis that multiple turtle lineages, including Galapagos giant tortoises, concurrently evolved large bodies, long lifespans, and reduced cancer risk. We also show through comparative genomic analysis that Galapagos giant tortoises have gene duplications related to longevity and tumor suppression. To examine the molecular basis underlying increased body size and lifespan in turtles, we treated cell lines from multiple species, including Galapagos giant tortoises, with drugs that induce different types of cytotoxic stress. Our results indicate that turtle cells, in general, are resistant to oxidative stress related to aging, whereas Galapagos giant tortoise cells, specifically, are sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress, which may give this species an ability to mitigate the effects of cellular stress associated with increased body size and longevity.

AB  - The genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) includes myrmecophytes that allow symbiotic ants to nest inside their hollow stems. The plant exhibits a mutualistic relationship with the ants by providing them with so-called "food bodies." Such symbiotic ants, called "plant-ants," patrol the surface of the host plants to repel herbivorous insects from the host plants. The ratio of the food body produced by the host plant for the plant-ants to the host plant's above-ground biomass decreased as the plant grew in Macaranga bancana, a myrmecophytic species. This phenomenon led us to predict that the average number of plant-ants per leaf would decrease as the host plant grew. To test this hypothesis, we counted plant-ant workers on the leaf surface of M. bancana at various stages of its growth in a lowland rainforest in Borneo. We examined the relationship between the number of plant-ant workers per leaf and host plant size. The number of ants per leaf decreased significantly with increasing host plant size. Additionally, the number of plant-ant workers attending to a leaf was significantly higher on younger leaves than on older leaves. However, these differences became significantly smaller as the plants grew. These observations suggest that the need for antiherbivore defense by plant-ants decreases with increasing tree size and leaf age.

AB  - Plants growing in unfavorable environments, such as sea buckthorn, can have a high serotonin content. The potential of using different parts of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) as a natural source of serotonin was investigated. The feasibility of extracting serotonin hormone from the non-fruit parts of sea buckthorn is demonstrated. One- and two-year-old woody shoots were the best material for obtaining serotonin-containing raw product. Serotonin content in shoots of different sea buckthorn varieties growing in different regions and its dynamics during the vegetation period were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serotonin is a water-soluble substance prone to microbial degradation, so proper preparation of raw materials plays a very important role in preserving serotonin in plant samples. A method for serotonin extraction using preliminary mechanochemical treatment is presented: it consists in pre-grinding, followed by mechanical treatment of raw materials with 5% adipic acid in a semi-industrial centrifugal mill. The highest degree of serotonin extraction was achieved when using air circulation at a drying temperature of 60-80 & DEG;C; serotonin concentration decreased when temperature was further increased. Serotonin content depended on the place and time of harvesting, the method used for drying the branches, and the characteristics of the plant variety. The minimum serotonin concentration (29 mg/g dry basis) was observed during summer; the maximum concentration was observed during winter; the annual changes in concentration can be as significant as 10-fold. The possibility of industrial cultivation and harvesting of different sea buckthorn varieties was also considered.

AB  - Arboreal herbivores require large digestive tracts for leaf fermentation and detoxification; however, they must also have a low body mass that allows them to reach the foliage. The three-toed sloth, Bradypus tridactylus, experiences this trade-off, as leaves comprise 97.2% of its diet. Their calorie intake is extremely low owing to the low available caloric density of leaves and slow digestive processes related to leaf fibre fermentation and sec-ondary compound detoxification. Sloths may require a high body temperature to assist fermentation; however, thermogenesis is energy-consuming. To investigate how sloths accomplish thermoregulation using marginal energy, we attached heart rate (HR) and temperature loggers to wild B. tridactylus individuals inhabiting the Amazon rainforest and recorded their HR and body surface temperature (Tskin). Tskin changed with ambient temperature (Ta) but was higher than Ta in 99.2% of cases. Increases in Tskin and HR did not coincide, suggesting that the increases were not caused by thermogenesis. Instead, they may passively increase Tskin by selecting warmer microhabitats and sunbathing. Consequently, 90.5% of Tskin were within 27.6-36.0 degrees C while the Ta fluctuated between 21.5 and 42.9 degrees C. This low-cost thermoregulation results in a low HR. In this study, the mean HR during observation was approximately 38.4% of the expected value based on the mammalian allometric relationship between body mass and HR. Thus, these properties may contribute to the low metabolic rates of sloths, alleviating their restricted energy intake.

AB  - Phosphate invert glasses (PIGs) have been attracting attention as materials for bone repair. PIGs have a high flexibility in chemical composition because they are composed of orthophosphate and pyrophosphate and can easily incorporate various ions in their glass networks. In our previous work, incorporation of niobium (Nb) into melt-quench-derived PIGs was effective in terms of controlling their ion release, and Nb ions promoted the activity of osteoblast-like cells. In the present work, a liquid-phase method was used for synthesizing Nb-containing PIGs, as this method allows us to prepare a glass precursor solution at room temperature, which can be attributed to improved glass-shape design. Nb-containing PIGs were successfully prepared, and their ion release behavior was controlled by changing the Nb content in the PIGs. The functions of Nb varied according to its content. For example, in the case of PIGs containing a larger amount of Nb, Nb acted as both the network modifier and former while also inducing the formation of chain-like structures. These glasses possessed a gradual ion release in a tris-HCl buffer solution. Cotton-wool-like structured scaffolds were fabricated using the synthesized Nb-containing glass using a wet-spinning method. Because the scaffolds possess excellent flexibility and controllable ion release, they are good candidates for new biomaterials.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most common serious brain disorders, affecting about 1% of the population all over the world. Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) and L-carnitine (LC) reportedly possess the antioxidative activity and neuroprotective potential. In this report, we investigated the possible protective and therapeutic effects of GbE and LC against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epileptic seizures in rat hippocampus and hypothalamus. Adult male albino rats were equally divided into eight groups: control, GbE (100 mg/kg), LC (300 mg/kg), PTZ (40 mg/kg), protective groups (GbE + PTZ and LC + PTZ), and therapeutic groups (PTZ + GbE and PTZ + LC). The oxidative stress, antioxidant, and neurochemical parameters, viz., malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), acetylcholine esterase (AchE), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT), in the hippocampal and hypothalamic regions have been evaluated. PTZ injection leads to an increase in the seizure score, the levels of MDA and NO, and to a decrease in the activity of GSH, SOD, CAT, and GPx. Besides, monoamine neurotransmitters, DA, NE, and 5-HT, were depleted in PTZ-kindled rats. Furthermore, PTZ administration caused a significant elevation in the activity of AchE. Hippocampal and hypothalamic sections from PTZ-treated animals were characterized by severe histopathological alterations and, intensely, increased the ezrin immunolabeled astrocytes. Pre- and post-treatment of PTZ rats with GbE and LC suppressed the kindling acquisition process and remarkably alleviated all the aforementioned PTZ-induced effects. GbE and LC have potent protective and therapeutic effects against PTZ-induced kindling seizures via the amelioration of oxidative/antioxidative imbalance, neuromodulatory, and antiepileptic actions.

AB  - Leptin is a well-known adipokine that plays critical role in adiposity. To further investigate the role of leptin in adiposity, we utilized leptin overexpressing transgenic pigs and evaluated the effect of leptin on growth and development, fat deposition, and lipid metabolism at tissue and cell level. Leptin transgenic pigs were produced and divided into two groups: elevated leptin expression (leptin ( +)) and normal leptin expression group (control). Results indicated that leptin ( +) pigs had elevated leptin protein and mRNA expression levels and exhibited sluggish growth and development followed by decreased subcutaneous fat thickness, low serum triglycerides, saturated, unsaturated fatty acids and high cholesterol esters (p < 0.05). There were differences in the lipid metabolism related genes at different fat depots, including upregulation of PPAR gamma, AGPAT6, PLIN2, HSL and ATGL in subcutaneous, PPAR gamma in perirenal, and FAT/CD36 and PLIN2 in mesenteric adipose tissues and downregulation of AGPAT6 and ATGL in perirenal and AGPAT6 in mesenteric adipose tissues (p < 0.05). Additionally, in-vitro cultured leptin ( +) preadipocytes exhibited upregulation of PPAR gamma, FAT/CD36, ACACA, AGPAT, PLIN2, ATGL and HSL as compared to control (p < 0.05). These findings suggested that homeostasis imbalance in lipolysis and lipogenesis at adipose tissue and adipocytes levels led to low subcutaneous fat depots in leptin overexpression pigs. These pigs can act as model for obesity and related metabolic disorder.

AB  - Gut microbiota is becoming one of the key determinants in human health and disease. Shifts in gut microbiota composition affect cognitive function and provide new insights for the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. Diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD) is one of the central nervous system complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has long been used for the treatment of T2DM and prevention of DACD. However, the contribution of ZBPYR treatment to the interaction between the gut microbiota and metabolism for preventing and treating DACD remains to be clarified. Here, we investigate whether the gut microbiota plays a key role in ZBPYR-mediated prevention of DACD and treatment of T2DM via incorporating microbiomics and metabolomics, and investigate the links between the microbiota-gut-brain axis interaction and the efficacy of ZBPYR in ZDF rats. In the current study, we found that ZBPYR treatment produced lasting changes in gut microbiota community and metabolites and remotely affected hippocampus metabolic changes, thereby improving memory deficits and reversing beta-amyloid deposition and insulin resistance in the brain of ZDF rats from T2DM to DACD. This may be related to a series of metabolic changes affected by gut microbiota, including alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid metabolism; branched-chain amino acid metabolism; short-chain fatty acid metabolism; and linoleic acid/unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. In summary, this study demonstrates that prevention and treatment of DACD by ZBPYR partly depends on the gut microbiota, and the regulatory effects of bacteria-derived metabolites and microbiota-gut-brain axis are important protective mechanisms of ZBPYR.

AB  - To address the bottleneck in meat production efficiency within China's mutton sheep industry, this study established a two-generation crossbreeding program between WHS rams and STH ewes. Hybrid offspring (F1 and BC1) were evaluated for growth performance, slaughter traits, meat quality, and reproductive performance. The F1 generation exhibited significant improvements over STH in 6-month body weight (52.3 kg, +27.3%), dressing percentage (56.1%, +6.3%), and feed efficiency ratio (FER) of 4.6 (p < 0.05). The BC1 generation shows a mixed state of paternal and maternal characteristics and further enhanced these traits, achieving a 6-month body weight of 55.2 kg (+5.4% vs. F1), a dressing percentage of 58.3%, and an optimized gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) of 4.2 (-8.7%). Meat quality parameters, including shear force (32.5 N vs. 41.6 N in F1 vs. STH) and intramuscular fat content (4.5% vs. 3.8% in F1 vs. STH), demonstrated superior tenderness and marbling. Despite a decline in lambing rate (F1: 178%; BC1: 142%), the hybrids combined the dam's adaptability with the sire's meat traits, forming a novel germplasm for sustainable mutton production. This study provides a replicable model for balancing genetic improvement and ecological sustainability in central China.

AB  - Among the many calcium-binding proteins, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 play important roles in inflammation, innate immunity, and antimicrobial function, but their expression, regulation, and function at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs are not fully understood. Therefore, we determined the expression and regulation of S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, and their receptor AGER at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs. We found that S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 mRNAs were expressed in the endometrium during the estrous cycle and pregnancy, with the greatest levels on Day (D) 12 of pregnancy, and AGER appeared at greater levels on D15 and D30 of pregnancy than on other days. The expression of S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 was predominantly localized to epithelial cells in the endometrium, and they were detected in early-stage conceptus and later chorioallantoic tissues during pregnancy. AGER expression was localized to endometrial epithelial and stromal cells and chorionic epithelial cells. In endometrial explant tissues, the expression of S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 was induced by estrogen, S100A8 by interleukin-1 beta, and AGER by interferon-gamma. We further found that on D12 of pregnancy, the expression of S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 decreased significantly in the endometria of gilts carrying conceptuses derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer. These results indicate that the expression of S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 is dynamically regulated in response to conceptus-derived signals at the maternal-conceptus interface, suggesting that S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 could play a critical role in regulating endometrial epithelial cell function and conceptus implantation to support the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in pigs.
   Summary Sentence
   S100A calcium-binding proteins S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 are dynamically expressed in response to conceptus-derived signals at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs.

AB  - The curve number (CN) equation is a semiempirical, event-based model commonly used to estimate rainfall runoff. This model was originally developed in the 1950s to estimate storm runoff from 24-h rainfall events from small catchments. The model consists of two parameters: (1) the curve number (CN), which represents soil type, land use, and land cover; and (2) the initial abstraction (Ia), i.e., the amount of rain that needs to accumulate before storm runoff begins. Despite its narrow-intended use, the CN model is widely used for many applications from engineering design to hydrologic modeling and uses parameter tables and guidelines developed in the mid-20th century. Changes in land management and hydrological science pose questions about the continued relevancy of the model in general and the tabulated parameters specifically. We used Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-Sample Studies (CAMELS), a recently collated data set of watershed characteristics and performed regression analyses on the watershed attributes to determine whether the CN and Ia parameters can better fit a wider range of attributes than can the currently used tables. Our analyses focused on 5-35 year peak runoff events. We considered 333 small to medium watersheds distributed across the contiguous US and more than 40 watershed characteristics. We found that the CN model generally worked best if Ia was much smaller than traditionally assumed. Indeed, Ia=0 generally worked well. We also found that CN-values generally correlated well with climate (elevation, average precipitation) and soil permeability (sand fraction, saturated hydraulic conductivity). Our results suggest that the CN model can work relatively well for engineering purposes in ungauged watersheds and that the expanding stream of remotely sensed geographic data may allow for better CN-values than those from the current tables. We suggest that this study be expanded to include a wider range of watershed and storm characteristics.

AB  - Pig slurry is an agricultural residue with potential for utilisation as organic fertiliser and biomethane feedstock. That potential value is typically diminished via greenhouse and ammonia gaseous losses during temporary storage, an issue further exacerbated by the global warming, pollutant and malodorous nature of those compounds. Existing methods of reducing emissions from pig slurry may require significant capital outlay and/or may prove difficult to retrofit. A promising reactive oxygen-based additive (GasAbate (R)) was thus scaled-up to 1 m3 tanks filled with 750 L weaner slurry. Several experiments were carried out in three distinct phases, namely i. ambient temperature scale-up; ii. heated 1 m3 trials to determine optimal application method; iii. heated 1 m3 trials to compare results in static and dynamic chamber scenarios, with each iteration aiming to garner understanding of treatment efficacy under various conditions. The results demonstrate the scalability of this additive, its efficacy in reducing total volume of gaseous emissions (63-90% reduction), ammonia emissions (22-58% reduction) and malodorous compound evolution (22-83% reduction for a range of compounds) during temporary storage and the resulting retention of energy and nutrient value in the slurry, with 34-57% higher biomethane potential. The use of this additive could be well suited to farms that require short-term slurry storage (ca. 30 days) before feeding the slurry to a biogas system.

AB  - Thousands of people suffer from nausea with pregnancy each year. Nausea can be alleviated with cannabidiol (CBD), a primary component of cannabis that is widely available. However, it is unknown how fetal CBD exposure affects embryonic development and postnatal outcomes. CBD binds and activates receptors that are expressed in the fetal brain and are important for brain development, including serotonin receptors (5HT(1A)), voltage-gated potassium (Kv)7 receptors, and the transient potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1). Excessive activation of each of these receptors can disrupt neurodevelopment. Here, we test the hypothesis that fetal CBD exposure in mice alters offspring neurodevelopment and postnatal behavior. We administered 50 mg/kg CBD in sunflower oil or sunflower oil alone to pregnant mice from embryonic day 5 through birth. We show that fetal CBD exposure sensitizes adult male offspring to thermal pain through TRPV1. We show that fetal CBD exposure decreases problem-solving behaviors in female CBD-exposed offspring. We demonstrate that fetal CBD exposure increases the minimum current required to elicit action potentials and decreases the number of action potentials in female offspring layer 2/3 prefrontal cortex (PFC) pyramidal neurons. Fetal CBD exposure reduces the amplitude of glutamate uncaging-evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents, consistent with CBD-exposed female problem-solving behavior deficits. Combined, these data show that fetal CBD exposure disrupts neurodevelopment and postnatal behavior in a sex specific manner.

AB  - Kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous neuroprotectant with antiexcitotoxic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, is synthesized through the tryptophan-kynurenine (KYN) pathway. We investigated whether brain KYN or KYNA levels were affected by asphyxia in a translational piglet model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). We also studied brain levels of the putative blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable neuroprotective KYNA analogue SZR72, and whether SZR72 or therapeutic hypothermia (TH) modified KYN or KYNA levels. KYN, KYNA, and SZR72 levels were determined using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in five brain regions 24 h after 20 min of asphyxia in vehicle-, SZR72- and TH-treated newborn piglets (n = 6-6-6) and naive controls (n = 4). Endogenous brain KYN levels (median range 311.2-965.6 pmol/g) exceeded KYNA concentrations (4.5-6.0 pmol/g) similar to 100-fold. Asphyxia significantly increased cerebral KYN and KYNA levels in all regions (1512.0-3273.9 and 16.9-21.2 pmol/g, respectively), increasing the KYN/Tryptophan, but retaining the KYNA/KYN ratio. SZR72 treatment resulted in very high cerebral SZR72 levels (13.2-33.2 nmol/g); however, KYN and KYNA levels remained similar to those of the vehicle-treated animals. However, TH virtually ameliorated asphyxia-induced elevations in brain KYN and KYNA levels. The present study reports for the first time that the KYN pathway is altered during HIE development in the piglet. SZR72 readily crosses the BBB in piglets but fails to affect cerebral KYNA levels. Beneficial effects of TH may include restoration of the tryptophan metabolism to pre-asphyxia levels.

AB  - Changes in physiological and biochemical parameters are crucial for the reproductive performance and health of perinatal ewes. This study investigated the temporal variations in feed intake, nutrient digestibility, serum parameters, and ruminal fermentation on days 21, 14, and 7 before lambing (Q21, Q14, and Q7) and days 3, 7, and 14 after lambing (H3, H7, and H14). The results showed that dry matter intake (DMI) and glucose (Glu) gradually decreased (p < 0.05) before lambing and increased (p < 0.05) after lambing. The digestibility of dry matter (DMD), crude protein (CPD), and acid detergent fiber (ADFD) increased (p < 0.05) before lambing, then decreased (p < 0.05) on day H3, and then increased (p < 0.05) on day H14. The rumen pH, NH3-N, and triglycerides (TG) gradually increased (p < 0.05) before lambing and were higher (p < 0.05) on day Q7 than after lambing. The concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and total volatile fatty acids (T-VFA) were lower (p < 0.05) on day Q7 than those on days Q21 and Q14, then increased (p < 0.05) after lambing. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations gradually decreased (p < 0.05) in perinatal ewes. BHBA and NEFA concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) on day Q21 than those from days Q14 to H14. The rumen microbiota compositions were different (p < 0.05) in perinatal ewes, and g_Anaerovibrio, g_Lachnobacterium, and g_Schwartzia were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with DMI, Glu, acetate, propionate, and T-VFA, and negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with LDL-C. g_Bacillus was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with DMI, Glu, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and T-VFA, but positively correlated (p < 0.05) with rumen pH and LDL-C. In summary, the DMI, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, and serum parameters changed during the perinatal period of ewes, and the changes in DMI, serum glucose, acetate, propionate, and T-VFA were related to the rumen bacteria.

AB  - The mouse brain contains a rich diversity of inhibitory neuron types that have been characterized by their patterns of gene expression. However, it is still unclear how these cell types are distributed across the mouse brain. We developed a computational method to estimate the densities of different inhibitory neuron types across the mouse brain. Our method allows the unbiased integration of diverse and disparate datasets into one framework to predict inhibitory neuron densities for uncharted brain regions. We constrained our estimates based on previously computed brain-wide neuron densities, gene expression data from in situ hybridization image stacks together with a wide range of values reported in the literature. Using constrained optimization, we derived coherent estimates of cell densities for the different inhibitory neuron types. We estimate that 20.3% of all neurons in the mouse brain are inhibitory. Among all inhibitory neurons, 18% predominantly express parvalbumin (PV), 16% express somatostatin (SST), 3% express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the remainder 63% belong to the residual GABAergic population. We find that our density estimations improve as more literature values are integrated. Our pipeline is extensible, allowing new cell types or data to be integrated as they become available. The data, algorithms, software, and results of our pipeline are publicly available and update the Blue Brain Cell Atlas. This work therefore leverages the research community to collectively converge on the numbers of each cell type in each brain region.
   Author summary
   Obtaining a global understanding of the cellular composition of the brain is a very complex task, not only because of the great variability that exists between reports of similar counts but also because of the numerous brain regions and cell types that make up the brain.
   Previously, we presented a model of a cell atlas, which provided an estimate of the densities of neurons, glia and their subtypes for each region in the mouse brain. Here, we describe an extension of this model to include more inhibitory neuron types. We collected estimates of inhibitory neuron counts from literature and built a framework to combine them into a consistent cell atlas. Using brain slice images, we also estimated inhibitory neuron density in regions where no literature data are available. We estimated that in the mouse brain 20.3% of all neurons are inhibitory. Among all inhibitory neurons, 18% predominantly express parvalbumin (PV), 16% express somatostatin (SST), 3% express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the remainder 63% belong to the residual GABAergic population. Our approach can be further extended to any other cell type and provides a resource to build tissue-level models of the rodent brain.

AB  - Background: Catalpol, an important compound found in Rehmannia glutinosa (a plant with high nutritional and antidepressant medicinal value), exhibits various biological activities and has the ability to penetrate the bloodbrain barrier. Our recent studies revealed a gender difference in the antidepressant activity of Rehmannia glutinosa with females showing better responses than males. Catalpol is likely the key compound responsible for this gender-specific difference, which caters to current clinical observations that the severity and impact of depression are approximately two to three times higher in females than in males. However, the sex-specific mechanism of catalpol's antidepressant effects remains unclear. Purpose and Methods: Our recent molecular network predictions suggest that the gender-specific antidepressant properties of catalpol primarily involve the regulation of SIRT1-mediated synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Building on this, the present study used a well-established chronic unpredictable mild stress model of depression in mice to confirm the sex-specific antidepressant characteristics of catalpol over time and intensity. Furthermore, using SIRT1 inhibitors and activators, behavioral tests, hematoxylin & eosin, Nissl, and Golgi staining, western blotting, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR, we evaluated the key indicators of depressive behavior, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis before and after SIRT1 intervention to comprehensively assess whether the sex-specific antidepressant mechanism of catalpol indeed involves SIRT1-mediated synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Results: The gender-dependent antidepressant effects of catalpol are characterized by a faster onset and stronger effects in females compared to males, with females showing stronger regulation of SIRT1-mediated synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Activation of SIRT1 preserved the gender differences in catalpol's effects on depressive behavior, hippocampal synaptic plasticity (including neuronal consolidation, neuronal density, dendritic spines, and PSD95 and SYP gene and protein expression), and neurogenesis (including enhancement of GAP43 and MAP2 expression, activation of c-myc, cyclinD1, Ngn2, and NeuroD1 mRNA levels, and upregulation of the Wnt3a/beta-catenin/GSK-3 beta pathway), while inhibition of SIRT1 abolished these gender differences in the effects of catalpol. Conclusions: Catalpol exhibits higher antidepressant activity in female mice compared to male mice, and the mechanism underlying this gender difference in antidepressant effects may depend on catalpol's higher sensitivity in improving hippocampal SIRT1-mediated synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in females. The novelty of this study lies in its first-time revelation of the gender-specific phenotypes, targets, and molecular mechanisms of the antidepressant effects of catalpol.

AB  - Clearance of mitochondria following damage is critical for neuronal homeostasis. Here, we investigate the role of Miro proteins in mitochondria! turnover by the PINK1/Parkin mitochondrial quality control system in uitro and in uiuo. We find that upon mitochondrial damage, Miro is promiscuously ubiquitinated on multiple lysine residues. Genetic deletion of Miro or block of Miro1 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation lead to delayed translocation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin onto damaged mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial clearance in both fibroblasts and cultured neurons. Disrupted mitophagy in uiuo, upon postnatal knockout of Miro1 in hippocampus and cortex, leads to a dramatic increase in mitofusin levels, the appearance of enlarged and hyperfused mitochondria and hyperactivation of the integrated stress response (ISR). Altogether, our results provide new insights into the central role of Miro1 in the regulation of mitochondria! homeostasis and further implicate Miro1 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder with complex symptoms and neurobiology. Serotonergic dysregulation is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia although dopaminergic and gluta-matergic systems are thought to have central roles in neurobiology. No significant success can be achieved in the treatment of negative and cognitive symptoms while positive symptoms can be significantly reduced with current pharmacotherapy. Vortioxetine is a new multimodal antidepressant with 5-HT1A agonism, 5-HT1B partial agonism, 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D antagonism, and serotonin reuptake inhibition. A limited number of studies suggest its therapeutic effect on the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, we investi-gated the potential beneficial effects of vortioxetine on behavioral and molecular deficits in the MK-801 model of schizophrenia in rats. Female Wistar albino rats (10-12 weeks) were grouped as saline, MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg), MK-801 + vortioxetine (2.5 mg/kg), MK-801 + vortioxetine (5 mg/kg), MK-801 + vortioxetine (10 mg/kg), MK-801 + risperidone (0.3 mg/kg), MK-801 + haloperidol (1 mg/kg) (n = 8 in each group). MK-801 has been daily administered (i.p.) for 14 days. Vortioxetine and antipsychotic treatments were injected for 21 days after a washout period of MK-801 and locomotor activity (LA), social interaction (SI), novel object recognition (NOR), Y-maze and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests were performed at the 16-20th days of treatments, respectively. ELISA test was conducted to evaluate molecular analyses. MK-801 decreased PPI (%), social behaviors, and discrimi-nation index in NOR and alternation (%) in the Y-maze test. In NOR and Y-maze tests, especially vortioxetine 5 and 10 mg/kg increased discrimination index and alternation (%) compared to MK-801. In addition, vortioxetine administration increased social behaviors. Moreover, MK-801 decreased GAD67 and parvalbumin levels while vortioxetine increased these protein levels compared to MK-801. Herein, we first suggested a potential thera-peutic effect of vortioxetine, a new multimodal antidepressant, on negative and cognitive symptoms and neurobiological deficits including GAD67 and parvalbumin low expression in the MK-801 model in rats. It would be beneficial to confirm our results in different rodent models and to shed light on the possible mechanisms underlying these effects.

AB  - Glyphodes pyloalis Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is the most destructive pest, causing severe damage to mulberry production in China's sericulture industry. The insecticide application in mulberry orchards poses a significant risk of poisoning to Bombyx mori. Shifting from insecticides to odor attractants is a beneficial alternative, but not much data is available on the olfactory system of G. pyloalis. We identified 114 chemosensory genes from the antennal transcriptome database of G. pyloalis, with 18 odorant-binding protein (OBP) and 17 chemosensory protein (CSP) genes significantly expressed in the antennae. Ligand-binding assays for two antennae-biased expressed general odorant-binding proteins (GOBPs) showed high binding affinities of GOBP1 to hexadecanal, (1-ionone, and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, while GOBP2 exhibited binding to 4-tert-octylphenol, benzyl benzoate, (1-ionone, and farnesol. Computational simulations indicated that van der Waal forces predominantly contributed to the binding free energy in the binding processes of complexes. Among them, Phe12 of GOBP1 and Phe19 of GOBP2 were demonstrated to play crucial roles in their bindings to plant volatiles using site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Moreover, hexadecanal and (1-ionone attracted G. pyloalis male moths in the behavioral assays, while none of the candidate plant volatiles significantly affected female moths. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying olfactory recognition in G. pyloalis, setting the groundwork for novel mulberry pests control strategies based on insect olfaction.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common mental disorder and is one of the main causes of disability. Berberine (BBR), the major constituent alkaloid originally from the famous Chinese herb Huanglian (Coptis chinensis), has been shown to exert antidepressant-like effects. This study was to investigate the hypothesis that BBR treats depressive-like behavior by shifting the balance of the kynurenine (KYN)/serotonin (5-HT) pathway toward the 5-HT pathway through downregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and upregulated dopamine decarboxylase (DDC) in hippocampus.
   Method: A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice model of depression was established via 21 days unpredictable stimulation. Then the mice were randomly assigned into six groups, namely control, model, fluoxetine [FLU, (10 mg/kg)], BBRL (25 mg/kg), BBRM (50 mg/kg), and BBRH (100 mg/kg) groups. Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate the antidepressant effects of BBR. The levels of 5-HT, KYN, tryptophan (TRP), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in hippocampus were estimated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The mRNA and protein levels of DDC, MAOA and IDO1 in hippocampus were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot (WB), respectively.
   Result: The results showed that a successful CUMS mice model was established through 21 days of continuous unpredictable stimulation, as indicated by the significant decrease in locomotor activity and increase in immobility time, reduction in body weight and sucrose preference rate etc. Compared with the normal group, the concentrations of KYN/TRP had significantly increased (p(##) <0.01) and 5-HT/5-HIAA had decreased (p(#) <0.05) at day 21 in the control group, but then improved after drug treatment with FLU and BBR. Compared with the normal group, the mRNA of IDO1 and MAOA were significantly upregulated (p(#) <0.05) in the control group, MAOA and IDO1 gene were downregulated by FLU and BBR treatment. Protein expressions of IDO1 and MAOA was significantly increased (p(#) <0.05) and DDC downregulated (p(##)<0.01). BBR treatment downregulated IDO1 and MAOA, upregulated DDC.
   Conclusions: BBR reversed the abnormalities of the KYN/5-HT pathway in depressed mice and achieved an excellent antidepressant effect. Its direct impact may be observed as changes in biological indicators in mice hippocampus tissue.

AB  - Handmade cloning (HMC) has a higher yield and is relatively less difficult to operate compared to traditional micromanipulation cloning. Yet, there are few reports on handmade cloning in sheep. Therefore, this study investigates the key nodes such as AC and DC voltage, denucleation method and fusion method in sheep handmade cloning. In addition, it compares the effects of fibroblasts (FC) and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) of different states as donors on the development of HMC embryos. Furthermore, the effect of different freezing solutions on the survival rate of frozen blastocysts without zona pellucida was also investigated. The results indicate that an AC voltage of 150 V/cm and a DC voltage of 1800 V/cm significantly enhanced the fusion and blastocyst rates (p < .01). The blastocyst rate achieved with umbilical cord MSCs as nucleus donors was significantly higher (40.3%) than that achieved with fibroblasts and differentiated umbilical cord MSCs (21.5%, 22.5%) (p < .01). The highest survival rate was achieved using 20% DMSO + 20% EG for freezing without zona pellucida. In conclusion, the most efficient and pregnant ovine HMC cloning method using 150 V/cm AC, 1800 V/cm DC, knife-cut denucleation, two-step fusion and the use of UC-MSCs as nucleus donors resulted in the highest overall efficiency and pregnancy after transplantation.

AB  - The growing environment of Camellia oleifera fruits is complex, often covered by branches and leaves or fruit overlapping influence, which seriously restricts the picking efficiency. Existing picking systems often limited to specific conditions, leading to false and missed detection. To address this issue, a vision-guided autonomous detection and position picking system was designed, integrating object detection, stereo matching, and inverse kinematics reduced dimensional solution. The object detection model Detect-COF incorporates a dual-backbone structure combined with a lightweight Bidirectional Feature Pyramid module (BiFPN-s) to effectively capture diverse feature representations of occluded fruits, maintaining an optimal balance of accuracy, speed, and lightweight. Unlike traditional binocular camera depth prediction methods, this system calculates parallax using the bounding box generated by the Detect-COF model, thereby obtaining the precise picking point and depth. The computational burden is reduced by transmitting the depth information to the picking device for dimension reduction. The study evaluated four categories of datasets: no occlusion (NO), leaf occlusion (LO), branch-trunk occlusion (BTO), and hybrid occlusion (HO). The Detect-COF achieved mean Average Precision (mAP) of 94.4%, 98.4 %, 87.8 % and 89.2 % in these categories, respectively. Additionally, Detect-COF demonstrated high detection precision across varying conditions: 94.1 % in light, 91.9 % in dark, 91.6 % under slight occlusion, and 88.1 % under severe occlusion. Compared to the YOLOv8-n model, it showed a 4.4 % improvement in precision, a 5.1 % improvement in recall and a 40.0 % reduction in parameters. For depth positioning accuracy, as measured by the Leica D2 laser rangefinder, the relative error between predicted and real depths can be maintained within 2.6 %, sufficiently meeting positioning requirements. Consequently, this research provides visual assistance for Camellia oleifera fruit picking in complex occluded environments, enabling real-time detection and accurate positioning of fruit. This not only helps reduce labor costs but also offers theoretical support for automatic agricultural picking devices.

AB  - The present study was carried out to improve, test, and validate the Cascade Forward Neural Network (CFNN) for co-composting of municipal solid waste (MSW) and cattle manure (CM). Composting was performed in vessel pilot-scale reactors with different CM rates for 105 days. The CFNN used 5 input variables containing CM and MSW mixture combinations, and 1 output for each of the compost quality parameters. The CFNN results were compared with Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) results. Multi-objective optimization process using Genetic Algorithm (GA), the total desirability, which has a much better value than the RSM, was obtained as 0.4455 and the CM ratio and processing time were determined as approximately 23.39% and 104.86 days, respectively. It is concluded that CFNN is a unique modeling tool, exhibiting superior modeling and prediction performance in MSW and compost modeling for CM.

AB  - Body stalk anomaly (BSA) is a rare and usually fatal congenital disorder involving severe malformations of the body wall, limbs, spine, and internal organs. This study presents the first documented cases of BSA in seven dogs, offering new insights into how the disorder manifests in animals. The affected fetuses consistently exhibited major anomalies, including large abdominal wall defects, structural spinal abnormalities, and a variety of limb malformations ranging from partial agenesis and meromelia to phocomelia and complete amelia. Structural urogenital anomalies and orofacial clefts were also observed, aligning with similar findings in BSA cases reported in pigs and cats. These findings support the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology involving early embryonic disruptions, such as abnormal folding of the embryo, rupture of the amniotic membrane, and vascular compromise. The frequent occurrence of abdominal wall defects alongside umbilical cord abnormalities further suggests a shared developmental pathway. This study also highlights the value of veterinary cases in comparative embryology and the need to assess congenital anomalies as part of a broader malformation complex. By expanding the phenotypic spectrum of BSA in domestic animals, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis and emphasizes the importance of further research into the genetic and environmental factors involved. Such efforts could lead to improved classification and diagnosis of complex congenital malformations, as well as facilitate cross-species comparisons.

AB  - Sleep deprivation leads to hippocampal injury. Proteostasis disturbance is an important mechanism linking sleep deprivation and hippocampal injury. However, identifying noninvasive imaging biomarkers for hippocampal proteostasis disturbance remains challenging. Amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging is a chemical exchange saturation transfer technique based on the amide protons in proteins and peptides. We aimed to explore the ability of APTw imaging in detecting sleep deprivation-induced hippocampal proteostasis disturbance and its biological significance, as well as its biological basis. In vitro, the feasibility of APTw imaging in detecting changes of the protein state was evaluated, demonstrating that APTw imaging can detect alterations in the protein concentration, conformation, and aggregation state. In vivo, the hippocampal APTw signal declined with increased sleep deprivation time and was significantly lower in sleep-deprived rats than that in normal rats. This signal was positively correlated with the number of surviving neurons counted in Nissl staining and negatively correlated with the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 evaluated in immunohistochemistry. Differentially expressed proteins in proteostasis network pathways were identified in the hippocampi of normal rats and sleep-deprived rats via mass spectrometry proteomics analysis, providing the biological basis for the change of the hippocampal APTw signal in sleep-deprived rats. These findings demonstrate that APTw imaging can detect hippocampal proteostasis disturbance induced by sleep deprivation and reflect the extent of neuronal injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

AB  - The glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily members play an important role in the male reproductive tract and sperm physiology. However, the expression profiles of some members of this protein family and their effect on sperm quality remain unclear. In this study, we found that GST kappa 1 (GSTK1) encoded protein is abundant in the testes and capacitated sperm acrosome. Western blot analysis revealed that the decreased abundance of GSTK1 was observed in low motile spermatozoa; moreover, GSTK1 expression decreased in sperm stored at 17 degrees C under a long preservation time. In vitro analyses revealed that GSTK1 had no significant effect on sperm motility, capacitation, or acrosome reaction. Notably, after capacitated sperm were incubated with 4 and 8 mu g/ml anti-GSTK1 antibodies, the fertilization rate significantly decreased in vitro fertilization assay. The current study demonstrates that GSTK1 is correlated with sperm quality and is a promising marker for the assessment of sperm quality and provides a basis for understanding the potential molecular mechanism for targeting pathogenic factors in male infertility.

AB  - Axo-axonic cells (AACs), also called chandelier cells (ChCs) in the cerebral cortex, are the most distinctive type of GABAergic interneurons described in the neocortex, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). AACs selectively innervate glutamatergic projection neurons (PNs) at their axon initial segment (AIS), thus may exert decisive control over PN spiking and regulate PN functional ensembles. However, the brain-wide distribution, synaptic connectivity, and circuit function of AACs remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of specific and reliable experimental tools. Here, we have established an intersectional genetic strategy that achieves specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs throughout the mouse brain based on their lineage (Nkx2.1) and molecular (Unc5b, Pthlh) markers. We discovered that AACs are deployed across essentially all the pallium-derived brain structures, including not only the dorsal pallium-derived neocortex and medial pallium-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lateral pallium-derived claustrum-insular complex, and the ventral pallium-derived extended amygdaloid complex and olfactory centers. AACs are also abundant in anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, and lateral septum. AACs show characteristic variations in density across neocortical areas and layers and across subregions of the hippocampal formation. Neocortical AACs comprise multiple laminar subtypes with distinct dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing from AACs across neocortical, hippocampal, and BLA regions reveal shared as well as distinct patterns of synaptic input. Specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs facilitates the study of their developmental genetic program and circuit function across brain structures, providing a ground truth platform for understanding the conservation and variation of a bona fide cell type across brain regions and species.

AB  - Development of estrogen therapies targeting the beta (ER beta) but not alpha (ER alpha) estrogen receptor is critically needed for the treatment of negative menopausal symptoms, as ER alpha activation increases health risks like cancer. Here, we determined the effects of long-term oral treatment with EGX358, a novel highly selective ER beta agonist, on memory, vasodilation, and affect in young ovariectomized mice. Mice were orally gavaged daily for 9 weeks with vehicle, 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), the ER beta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN), or EGX358 at doses that enhance memory when delivered acutely. Tail skin temperature was recorded as a proxy for vasodilation following injection of vehicle or senktide, a tachykinin receptor 3 agonist used to model hot flashes. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM), and depression-like behavior was measured in the tail suspension (TST) and forced swim tests (FST). Finally, memory was assessed in object recognition (OR) and object placement (OP) tasks. E-2, DPN, and EGX358 reduced senktide-mediated increases in tail skin temperature compared to vehicle. All three treatments also enhanced memory in the OR and OP tasks, whereas vehicle did not. Although E-2 increased time spent in the center of the OF, no other treatment effects were observed in the OF, EPM, TST, or FST. These data suggest that long-term ER beta activation can reduce hot flash-like symptoms and enhance spatial and object recognition memories in ovariectomized mice. Thus, the highly selective ER beta agonist EGX358 may be a promising avenue for reducing menopause-related hot flashes and memory dysfunction.

AB  - In this study, black soldier fly (BSF) dried larvae were fractionated into their defatted, lipid, protein, and chitin- rich fractions. The samples were then characterised in terms of proximate composition, analysis of amino acids, analysis of the molecular weight distribution of proteins via gel electrophoresis, and fatty acids analysis of the lipid fraction. The antibacterial activity of all fractions was determined against Escherichia coli F4 and Streptococcus suis, two common swine pathogens. Finally, the prebiotic activity of the whole larvae and of their protein isolate and chitin-rich pellet was determined for Limosilactobacillus reuteri, a naturally occurring species in the gastrointestinal tract of the pig. The results on amino acid profile showed that the protein extraction method used was not fully effective in cleaving chitin-bound proteins, as expected, as the true protein content of the chitin-rich sample was 48.5%. This was in accordance with the SDS-PAGE analysis, where the molecular weight distribution of proteins in the protein isolate sample did not show band at higher molecular weight, which were instead present in the chitin-rich sample. The analysis of fatty acid (FA) profile showed that lauric acid was the most abundant FA, in accordance with the literature. The results on microbiological analyses highlighted how all nitrogen-containing samples showed antibacterial activity against E. coli, the highest being the defatted fraction at 1% with a decrease of-0.77 log CFU/mL, while only the lipid fraction against S. suis (-0.48 log CFU/mL at 1%). All tested samples showed prebiotic activity for L. reuteri, but it was noticed that the increase in chitin concentration resulted in the decrease of the prebiotic effect. By combining the results of both antibacterial and prebiotic tests, it could be inferred that chitin might be considered as an antibacterial compound.

AB  - The object of the present study was to investigate leukocyte subsets distribution and the dynamics of some pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to shearing in sheep having different hematocrit values. Thirty Ile De France ewes were selected from an experimental herd according to their hematocrit levels and were allocated into 3 groups as follows: and mean hematocrit (MHct) group (hematocrit range 28.3-29.8%). The traits investigated were leukocyte subsets (basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, large immature cells,) and cytokines (IL-2, Il-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha). The experiment was conducted at the end of the first month after artificial insemination. Daily minimum and maximum ambient temperatures during the whole experimental period were 13.4 and 24.2C, respectively. Blood samples were taken by jugular venipuncture before shearing, immediately after shearing, at 3 h and 48 h after shearing. Shearing elicited significant increase in neutrophil numbers in all the 3 groups at 3h after shearing followed by a return to normal levels at 48 h after shearing. Lymphocyte numbers were not influenced by shearing. There were hematocrit associated changes in basophil, eosinophil and monocyte numbers suggesting different trafficking patterns of these leukocyte subsets. Large immature cells increased significantly in all experimental animals at 3 h after shearing. Three ewes in LHct group had 3-8 fold higher levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 compared to the other animals in the same group suggesting pregnancy associated transition towards Th2-type cytokines. Investigated pro-inflammatory Th17 (IL-17A) and Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) as well as anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were not influenced by shearing. The results are interpreted to suggest that shearing of pregnant ewes at ambient temperature below the lower critical temperature prevents cytokines increase.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding freezing is essential for stable cryopreservation of sperm. In the freezing process, ice crystal is developed from a change of matter from liquid water to solid water. Unfortunately, they tend to make damage of membrane in frozen sperm. From a perspective, sperm membrane damage due to ice crystal formation, magnetized freezing water that has easy supercooling, and the construction of smaller ice crystals because weaken the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules also has an infinite potential to cryopreserve sperm. Here, we applied the magnetization technique for making of freezing extender, and the extenders were used in the freezing process in sperm cryopreservation. As a result, sperm membrane damage was reduced in frozen sperm by a magnetized freezing extender, and we determined that in vitro fertility of frozen sperm by magnetized extender was improved. In conclusion, the magnetization technique would be useful for sperm cryopreservation. Furthermore, the study suggests that the technique has great potential for storing frozen material for biological aspects. Magnetized water is defined as the amount of water that has passed through a magnet. The magnetic field weakens the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules, leading to the magnetized liquid acquiring special characteristics such as easy supercooling and forming smaller ice crystals. We researched the influences of a magnetized freezing extender on cell membrane damage and in vitro fertilization of boar sperm during cryopreservation. The freezing extenders were passed through 0, 2000, 4000, and 6000 gausses (G) of magnetic devices using a liquid cycling pump system and then used for the sperm freezing process. The damage to plasma, acrosomal, and mitochondrial membranes in frozen-thawed spermatozoa was investigated by flow cytometry, and motility was assessed using the CASA system. The fertility of frozen-thawed sperm was estimated using in vitro fertilization. The damage to the membranes was significantly decreased in the magnetized freezing extender by the 6000 G magnetic field compared to that of the control in frozen-thawed sperm, and motility was increased in the 6000 G group. Although there were no significant differences in the cleavage rates of in vitro fertilized oocytes among the treatment groups, the ratio of blastocyst formation increased in the magnetized freezing extender groups compared with that in the control group. The number of blastocysts was significantly higher in the 4000 G group than in the 0 G group. In conclusion, these results suggest that a magnetized freezing extender could improve the freezability of sperm and the development of oocytes fertilized in vitro with frozen-thawed sperm.

AB  - Recently, Zhong et al. [1, 2] performed land-mark Gaussian boson sampling experiments with up to 144 modes using threshold detectors. The authors claim to have achieved quantum computational advantage with the implementa-tion of these experiments, named Jiuzhang 1.0 and Jiuzhang 2.0. Their experimental results are validated against several classical hypotheses and adversaries using tests such as the compar-ison of statistical correlations between modes, Bayesian hypothesis testing and the Heavy Out-put Generation (HOG) test. In this work we propose an alternative classical hypothesis for the validation of these experiments. We use the probability distribution of mixtures of coher-ent states sent into a lossy interferometer; these input mixed states, which we term squashed states, have vacuum fluctuations in one quadra-ture and excess fluctuations in the other. We find that for configurations in the high photon number density regime, the comparison of statis-tical correlations does not tell apart the ground truth of the experiment (namely, the probabil-ity distribution of two-mo de squeezed states sent into a lossy interferometer) from our alternative hypothesis. On the other hand, the Bayesian test indicates that, for all configurations except-ing Jiuzhang 1.0, the ground truth is a more likely explanation of the experimental data than our alternative hypothesis. A similar result is obtained for the HOG test: for all configura-tions of Jiuzhang 2.0, the test indicates that the experimental samples have higher ground truth probability than the samples obtained from our alternative distribution; for Jiuzhang 1.0 the test is inconclusive. Our results provide a new hypothesis that should be considered in the val-idation of future GBS experiments, and shed light into the need to identify proper metrics to verify quantum advantage in the context of threshold GBS. Additionally, they indicate that a classical explanation of the Jiuzhang 1.0 ex-periment, lacking any quantum features, has not been ruled out.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) is a common non-steroidal estrogenic mycotoxin found in a range of animal feeds and poses a serious threat to the reproductive health of farm animals and humans. However, the mechanism underlying ZEA-induced reproductive toxicity in sheep remains unknown. Granulosa cells are crucial for egg maturation and the fertility of female sheep. In this study, we aimed to examine the impact of different ZEA concentrations on sheep follicular granulosa cells and to elucidate the potential molecular mechanism underlying ZEA-induced toxicity using transcriptome sequencing and molecular biological approaches. Treating primary sheep follicular granulosa cells with different concentrations of ZEA promoted the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased lipid peroxidation products, led to cellular oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, and induced cell apoptosis. Using transcriptome approaches, 1395 differentially expressed genes were obtained from sheep follicular granulosa cells cultured in vitro after ZEA treatment. Among them, heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) was involved in 11 biological processes. The protein interaction network indicated interactions between HMOX1 and oxidative and apoptotic proteins. In addition, N-acetylcysteine pretreatment effectively reduced the ZEA-induced increase in the expression of HMOX1 and Caspase3 by eliminating ROS. Hence, we suggest that HMOX1 is a key differential gene involved in the regulation of ZEA-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in follicular granulosa cells. These findings provide novel insights into the prevention and control of mycotoxins in livestock.

AB  - Simple Summary The gut microbiota plays an important role in animals. Metabolomics analysis was used in this study to investigate the rumen microbiota density and metabolome interactions in lambs supplemented with Astragalus root powder; the density of the rumen microbiota and its relationship with the metabolome in lambs supplemented with Astragalus root powder were evaluated. The results showed a significant correlation between the rumen microbiota and its metabolome in lambs. These findings have important implications for livestock nutrition and management practices, particularly in terms of improving overall productivity and profitability. Abstract The gut microbiota is highly symbiotic with the host, and the microbiota and its metabolites are essential for regulating host health and physiological functions. Astragalus, as a feed additive, can improve animal immunity. However, the effects of Astragalus root powder on the rumen microbiota and their metabolites in lambs are not apparent. In this study, thirty healthy Hu sheep lambs with similar body weights (17.42 +/- 2.02 kg) were randomly selected for the feeding experiment. Lambs were fed diets supplemented with 0.3% Astragalus root powder, and the rumen microbiota density and metabolome were measured to determine the effects of Astragalus on the health of lambs in the rumen. The results showed that the relative abundance of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (Bf), Ruminococcus flavefaciens (Rf), Succiniclasticum (Su), and Prevotella (Pr) in the rumen was increased in the Astragalus group (p < 0.01), and metabolic profiling showed that the metabolites, such as L-lyrosine and L-leucine, were upregulated in the Astragalus group (p < 0.01). KEGG functional annotation revealed that upregulated metabolites were mainly enriched in the pathways of amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and bile secretion in the Astragalus group, and downregulated metabolites were enriched in the pathways of methane metabolism and other pathways. Correlation analysis revealed that butyric acid was positively correlated with Roseburia and Blautia (p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with Desulfovibrio (p < 0.05). Thus, by analyzing the interactions of Astragalus root powder with the density of rumen microorganisms and their metabolites in lambs, it was shown that Astragalus root powder could improve the structure of rumen microbiota and their metabolites and then participate in the regulation of amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, immune metabolism, and other pathways to improve the efficiency of energy absorption of the lambs.

AB  - Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and poultry litter are waste materials readily available all year round in West Africa that can be harnessed for the production of biochar via simultaneous thermochemical processing. In this study, the quality of biochar produced via the low-temperature thermochemical conversion of poultry litter and elephant grass at averaged temperature of 300 degrees C was evaluated in a retort heated, non-electrically powered, top-lit updraft reactor. The product was characterised using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses. From the FTIR, it was observed that the co-conversion of poultry litter with elephant grass do not significantly increase the functional groups present in the biochar in comparison with those from the single feedstock. The specific surface areas of the biochar from poultry litter, elephant grass and combined feedstock were 307.0, 475.1 and 398.6 m(2)/g, respectively. The char obtained are mesoporous and possess large pore size which reinforces its potential for multiple environmental and agricultural applications. The findings of the study are advantageous in efforts for solid waste management and environmental pollution control.

AB  - IntroductionDisrupted sleep has been consistently linked with lower academic achievement and worse mental health in children. Less is understood about sleep as a potential factor underlying socioeconomic differences in brain morphometry in children. The goals of this study were to investigate the associations among socioeconomic factors, sleep duration, and brain morphometry in children, and to examine the roles of the sleep environment and family routines in these associations. MethodsParticipants were 5- to 9-year-old children from socioeconomically diverse families (N = 94; 61% female). Parents reported on children's weekday and weekend sleep durations, sleep environment, and family routines. High-resolution, T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired. Analyses focused on cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and amygdala and hippocampal volume. ResultsResults indicated that lower family income-to-needs ratio and parental education were significantly associated with shorter weekday sleep duration in children. Shorter weekday sleep duration was significantly associated with reduced thickness in the left middle temporal, right postcentral, and right superior frontal cortices and smaller basolateral but not centromedial amygdala volume. Family routines significantly mediated the associations of family income-to-needs ratio and parental education with weekday sleep duration in children. ConclusionThese results contribute to our understanding of sleep factors as proximal mechanisms through which socioeconomic context may alter neural development during childhood.

AB  - We present here the first record of plant-insect interactions from an ephemeral volcanic island that was placed 150 km away from the nearest continental mass. The island was formed and destroyed during the Aalenian (Middle Jurassic) in a shallow sea of the southwestern Tethyan realm corresponding today to a place located in eastern Spain. These plant-insect interactions were mainly documented in leaves of Cycadophytes (comprising both Cycads and Bennettitales), and they have been described and classified into different Damage Types (DTs) and Functional Feeding Groups (FFGs). The interactions were assigned to 11 different DTs including different types of hole feeding, margin feeding, surface feeding, piercing and sucking, mining(?), and some putative ovipositional scars. The presence of these interactions implies that the island was colonized by different groups of insects, including orders such as Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata, or Lepidoptera. The low variety and incidence of interactions comparing with other Middle Jurassic plant-insect interactions assemblages indicate that the diversity of insects was not high, possibly due to the difficulty of reaching this island by various lineages, the small size of the landmass of the island, and the limited food availability (mainly Cycadophytes). Possible colonization strategies could be by atmospheric dispersion, using floating remains of plants or pterosaurs as vectors, by active flight for Lepidoptera, or by rafting and floating in marine currents for flightless or other insects.

AB  - The mitogenome sequence data have been widely used in inferring the phylogeny of insects. In this study, we determined the complete mitogenome for Macrotermes sp. (Termitidae, Macrotermitinae) using next-generation sequencing. Macrotermes sp. possesses a typical insect mitogenome, displaying an identical gene order and gene content to other existing termite mitogenomes. We present the first prediction of the secondary structure of ribosomal RNA genes in termites. The rRNA secondary structures of Macrotermes sp. exhibit similarities to closely related insects and also feature distinctive characteristics in their helical structures. Together with 321 published mitogenomes of termites as ingroups and 8 cockroach mitogenomes as outgroups, we compiled the most comprehensive mitogenome sequence matrix for Termitoidae to date. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using datasets employing different data coding strategies and various inference methods. Robust relationships were recovered at the family or subfamily level, demonstrating the utility of comprehensive mitogenome sampling in resolving termite phylogenies. The results supported the monophyly of Termitoidae, and consistent relationships within this group were observed across different analyses. Mastotermitidae was consistently recovered as the sister group to all other termite families. The families Hodotermitidae, Stolotermitidae, and Archotermopsidae formed the second diverging clade, followed by the Kalotermitidae. The Neoisoptera was consistently supported with strong node support, with Stylotermitidae being sister to the remaining families. Rhinotermitidae was found to be non-monophyletic, and Serritermitidae nested within the basal clades of Rhinotermitidae and was sister to Psammotermitinae. Overall, our phylogenetic results are largely consistent with earlier mitogenome studies.

AB  - ObjectivesIt is assumed that neuroplasticity plays a central role in the effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on patients with major depressive disorder. We carried out an explorative study to map out the extent in which gray matter volume changes could be found directly after ECT treatment and after follow-up.MethodsInitially, 12 patients with treatment-resistant depression were recruited from the Radboud Medical Center. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were conducted at the following 3 time points: before ECT (n = 12), after ECT (n = 10), and at 3-month follow-up (n = 8). Subcortical volume, hippocampal subfield volume, and cortical thickness were analyzed using FreeSurfer.ResultsThe extensive, generalized changes in gray matter volume are largely transient after treatment with ECT, with the noted exceptions being a sustained increase in volume of the right amygdala and a part of the left cornu ammonis. Post hoc testing revealed no significant correlation with clinical response.DiscussionOur results suggest that the neuroplastic effects of ECT may not be mediators of clinical response and could be transient epiphenomena.

AB  - This study investigates the establishment and colonization dynamics of Beauveria bassiana as an endophyte in maize plants using various inoculation methods. Surface sterilization and fungal isolation confirmed B. bassiana as an endophyte, with isolates ChBb and NaBb exhibiting distinct colonization patterns. Notably, foliar spray demonstrated the highest initial colonization efficiency, with ChBb achieving 93.3% in leaves at 7 days post-inoculation (DPI), decreasing to 13.3% at 35 DPI. NaBb similarly exhibited high initial colonization via foliar spray, with 93.3% in leaves at 7 DPI, declining to 33.3% at 35 DPI. Molecular analysis using nested PCR confirmed the presence of B. bassiana DNA exclusively in treated tissues, with a consistent 300 bp PCR product observed in leaf, stem, and root samples. Phylogenetic analysis highlighted genetic relationships among B. bassiana isolates, underscoring their diversity and potential for biocontrol applications. Pathogenicity tests against Spodoptera frugiperda demonstrated significant mortality rates: ChBb achieved 77.20% mortality in direct contact assays (where larvae were exposed directly to the fungal spores) and 56.82% mortality in vivo (where larvae were fed plants colonized by the fungus), while NaBb resulted in 75.86% and 51.42% mortality, respectively. These findings emphasize the efficacy of B. bassiana as a biocontrol agent, particularly through foliar application for initial colonization in maize plants.

TI  - Sedation Characteristics of Intranasal Alfaxalone in Adult Yucatan Swine
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Compared with intravenous and intramuscular methods, intranasal administration of sedatives is a less invasive and nonpainful technique. In this prospective, randomized, crossover study, we evaluated the sedative characteristics of 2 doses (1 and 2 mg/kg) of alfaxalone administered intranasally to 7 adult Yucatan swine. We compared sedation scores before and after administration of alfaxalone and between groups by using a composite sedation scoring system (range, 0 to 12, with 12 being the highest level of sedation)). Pigs were randomly assigned to receive 2 doses of intranasal alfaxalone (1 mg/kg [A1]); 2 mg/kg [A2]) as 2 separate events in a crossover design with a 60-d washout period. Categories scored were posture, palpebral droop, uninhibited behavior, drowsiness, and acceptance of anesthetic facemask. Sedation scores were collected before sedation was administered and then every 3 min for 30 min afterward. Instilled volumes (mean +/- 1 SD) were 5.7 +/- 0.5 and 11.3 +/- 0.8 mL for A1 and A2, respectively. Both alfaxalone doses produced significant increases in sedation scores compared with baseline. Median sedation scores for A1 (6; range, 4-12) were not different from those for A2 (6; range, 6 to 12). Intranasal administration of alfaxalone as the sole sedative agent increased sedation scores from baseline, achieving peak sedation at 6 to 9 min after instillation of A2. However, sedation scores were similar between the 2 groups, and neither dose produced sufficient sedation to facilitate handling or the performance of any clinical procedures. Given the concentration of alfaxalone solution currently available, volume is the major limiting factor regarding testing higher doses of this drug for its use as a sole sedative agent in swine.

AB  - Diet analysis integrates a wide variety of visual, chemical, and biological identification of prey. Samples are often treated as compositional data, where each prey is analyzed as a continuous percentage of the total. However, analyzing compositional data results in analytical challenges, for example, highly parameterized models or prior transformation of data. Here, we present a novel approximation involving a Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM). We first review how this approximation emerges from considering predator foraging as a thinned and marked point process (with marks representing prey species and individual prey size). This derivation can motivate future theoretical and applied developments. We then provide a practical tutorial for the Tweedie GLM using new package mvtweedie that extends capabilities of widely used packages in R (mgcv and ggplot2) by transforming output to calculate prey compositions. We demonstrate this approach and software using two examples. Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) provisioning their chicks on a colony in the northern Gulf of Alaska show decadal prey switching among sand lance and prowfish (1980-2000) and then Pacific herring and capelin (2000-2020), while wolves (Canis lupus ligoni) in southeast Alaska forage on mountain goats and marmots in northern uplands and marine mammals in seaward island coastlines.

AB  - Simple Summary Ophraella communa is an effective biocontrol agent against the invasive common ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia. However, whether some closely related non-target plants can become alternative host plant species of O. communa in China remains unclear. Although extensive host-plant selection tests have been used to ensure the host specificity of O. communa in other countries, some doubts remain. In this study, we conducted a series of choice experiments in outdoor cages and open fields to determine the preference of O. communa for A. artemisiifolia and three non-target plant species: sunflower (Helianthus annuus), cocklebur (Xanthium sibiricum), and giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida). The results showed that this beetle poses no threat to the biosafety of H. anunuus or A. trifida and exhibits a robust dispersal capacity to find and feed on A. artemisiifolia. However, in the future, we should be aware that X. sibiricum has the potential to be an alternative host plant for O. communa. Understanding the host-selection behavior of herbivorous insects is important to clarify their efficacy and safety as biocontrol agents. To explore the host-plant selection of the beetle Ophraella communa, a natural enemy of the alien invasive common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), we conducted a series of outdoor choice experiments in cages in 2010 and in open fields in 2010 and 2011 to determine the preference of O. communa for A. artemisiifolia and three non-target plant species: sunflower (Helianthus annuus), cocklebur (Xanthium sibiricum), and giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida). In the outdoor cage experiment, no eggs were found on sunflowers, and O. communa adults rapidly moved from sunflowers to the other three plant species. Instead, adults preferred to lay eggs on A. artemisiifolia, followed by X. sibiricum and A. trifida, although very few eggs were observed on A. trifida. Observing the host-plant selection of O. communa in an open sunflower field, we found that O. communa adults always chose A. artemisiifolia for feeding and egg laying. Although several adults (<0.02 adults/plant) stayed on H. annuus, no feeding or oviposition were observed, and adults quickly transferred to A. artemisiifolia. In 2010 and 2011, 3 egg masses (96 eggs) were observed on sunflowers, but they failed to hatch or develop into adults. In addition, some O. communa adults crossed the barrier formed by H. annuus to feed and oviposit on A. artemisiifolia planted in the periphery, and persisted in patches of different densities. Additionally, only 10% of O. communa adults chose to feed and oviposit on the X. sibiricum barrier. These findings suggest that O. communa poses no threat to the biosafety of H. anunuus and A. trifida and exhibits a robust dispersal capacity to find and feed on A. artemisiifolia. However, X. sibiricum has the potential to be an alternative host plant for O. communa.

AB  - With the high demand of modern people for lighting quality, higher requirements have been put forward for the lighting technology. Compared with traditional light emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diode (LD)-driven lighting technology has more prominent advantages in the fields of industry, military and life. Here, we report a phosphor-in-glass (PiG) material formed by co-firing commercial beta-Sialon:Eu2+ phosphor and SiO2-Na2CO3-H3BO3-CaO (SNBC) glass. It is found that the powder perfectly dispersed in the glass without obvious interface reaction. Fluorescence intensity of PiG sintered at 800 degrees C is the strongest, and the position of the luminescence peak is around 540 nm. Then through the analysis of different concentrations of PiG phosphors, it is found that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) can reach 72%. The specific heat capacity decreases with the increase of temperature, indicating that the heat dissipation effect is fine. Under the blue LD irradiation of 450 nm, the luminous flux of the PiG sample reaches 363 lm and the high luminous efficiency of 154 lm/W. Our research found that the prepared beta-Sialon-PiG can provide green light for high-power laser illumination and is a stable and efficient fluorescent conversion material. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The miniature pig is a suitable animal model for investigating human cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the alterations in lipid metabolism within atherosclerotic plaques of miniature pigs, along with the underlying mechanisms, remain to be comprehensively elucidated. In this study, we aim to examine the alterations in lipid composition and associated pathways in the abdominal aorta of atherosclerotic pigs induced by a high-fat, high-cholesterol, and high-fructose (HFCF) diet using lipidomics and RNA-Seq methods. The results showed that the content and composition of aortic lipid species, particularly ceramide, hexosyl ceramide, lysophosphatidylcholine, and triglyceride, were significantly altered in HFCF-fed pigs. Meanwhile, the genes governing sphingolipid metabolism, iron ion homeostasis, apoptosis, and the inflammatory response were significantly regulated by the HFCF diet. Furthermore, C16 ceramide could promote iron deposition in RAW264.7 cells, leading to increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis, and activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) inflammatory pathway, which could be mitigated by deferoxamine. Our study demonstrated that dysregulated ceramide metabolism could increase ROS production, apoptosis, and inflammatory pathway activation in macrophages by inducing iron overload, thus playing a vital role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This discovery could potentially provide a new target for pharmacological therapy of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.

AB  - Many herbivorous Lepidoptera accumulate plant toxins within their own tissues as a defensive strategy. Pioneering research in this area was conducted by Miriam Rothschild and Deane Bowers, who showed that the cycad-feeding butterfly Eumaeus atala sequester the toxic plant compound cycasin and thereby deter vertebrate and invertebrate predators. The current study focuses on another cycad compound, beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), that is known to accumulate in the tissues of insects and other herbivores, and which has been shown to have neurotoxic effects in humans. Chemical analyses revealed that BMAA accumulates in both immature and adult tissues of E. atala, as well as adult tissues of another cycad-feeding lepidopteran, Seirarctia echo. However, the distribution of BMAA across life stages and tissues did not conform to patterns predicted for defensive sequestration, and subsequent behavioral experiments with ants showed that these invertebrate predators were not deterred by BMAA. Our results suggest that high levels of BMAA in the tissues of cycad-feeding insects likely reflect passive bioaccumulation rather than defensive sequestration. Combined with the previous work by Rothschild and Bowers, these results provide an example in which two different plant toxins accumulate within the tissues of a single herbivore species via different mechanisms and with different implications for ecology and evolution. They thereby lay the groundwork for further investigation into the processes underlying active sequestration and non-adaptive bioaccumulation.

AB  - Reproductive traits play a vital role in determining the production efficiency of sheep. Maximizing the production is of paramount importance for breeders worldwide due to the growing population. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) act as miRNA sponges by absorbing miRNA activity through miRNA response elements (MREs) and participate in ceRNA regulatory networks (ceRNETs) to regulate mRNA expression. Despite of extensive research on role of circRNAs as miRNA sponges in various species, their specific regulatory roles and mechanism in sheep ovarian tissue are still not well understood. In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing of circRNAs, miRNA and mRNA employing bioinformatic techniques on ovine tissues of two contrasting sheep breeds "Small tail Han (X_LC) and Dolang sheep (D_LC)", which results into identification of 9,878 circRNAs with a total length of 23,522,667 nt and an average length of 2,381.32 nt. Among them, 44 differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) were identified. Moreover, correlation between miRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-miRNA provided us with to prediction of miRNA binding sites on nine differentially expressed circRNAs and 165 differentially expressed mRNAs using miRanda. miRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-miRNA pairs with negative correlation were selected to determine the ceRNA score along with positively correlated pairs from lncRNA and mRNA network. Integration of ceRNA score and positively correlated pairs exhibit a significant ternary relationship among circRNAs-miRNA-mRNA demonestrated by ceRNA, comprising of 50 regulatory pairs sharring common nodes and predicted potential differentially expressed circRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs regulatory axis. Based on functional enrichment analysis shortlisted key ceRNA regulatory pairs associated with reproduction including circRNA_3257-novel579_mature-EPHA3, circRNA_8396-novel130_mature-LOC101102473, circRNA_4140- novel34_mature > novel661_mature-KCNK9, and circRNA_8312-novel339_mature-LOC101110545. Furthermore, expression profiling, functional enrichments and qRT-PCR analysis of key target genes infer their implication in reproduction and metabolism. ceRNA target mRNAs evolutionary trajectories, expression profiling, functional enrichments, subcellular localizations following genomic organizations will provide new insights underlying molecular mechanisms of reproduction, and establish a solid foundation for future research.

AB  - MicroRNA21 (MIR21) abundance in porcine oocytes and cumulus cells increases during in vitro maturation. The mechanism by which MIR21 regulates oocyte maturation and the effect on the developmental competence of subsequent embryos remains unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the function of MIR21 during porcine oocyte maturation and its effect on embryonic development. Treatment with peptide nucleic acid MIR21 inhibitor (MIR21-PNA), designed to specifically bind to and prevent MIR21 activity during in vitro oocyte maturation, decreased cumulus cell expansion, and the oocyte ability to achieve metaphase II maturation stage when compared to control groups. Following parthenogenetic activation, the cleavage rate at 48 h in the MIR21-PNA group was decreased (p <= 0.03) relative to the control groups. Additionally, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of oocyte and cumulus cell total protein following MIR21-PNA treatment during in vitro maturation identified changes in signaling pathways with primary involvement of glucose metabolism (GM) pathways. Furthermore, there was no difference (p = 0.21) in oocyte maturation of control and MIR21-PNA treated oocytes when cultured in pyruvate lacking medium. Finally, MIR21-PNA treatment decreased (p = 0.04) glutathione and increased (p = 0.07) reactive oxygen species production in the oocyte. These data suggest that MIR21 influences porcine oocyte maturation by regulating GM pathways in the cumulus-oocyte complex.

AB  - Hipposideros larvatus sensu lato constitutes a widespread species complex consisting of morphologically similar forms with a taxonomy that is in need of a revision. Here we present the results of a phylogenetic analysis of members of this species complex based on two mitochondrial (CytB and COI) and seven nuclear (ABHD11, ACOX2, COPS, RAG2, ROGDI2, SORBS2 and THY) genes, and a morphometric analysis. Morphological data, although showing certain diversity, does not allow an accurate delimitation of the taxonomic boundaries and occasionally contradict to genetic grouping. The molecular analyses based on mitochondrial data support the paraphyly of the H. larvatus species complex, with H. armiger recovered nested within. The nuclear data recovered all the lineages of H. larvatus sensu lato forming a monophyletic clade. Within it, apparently four different species-level clades could be revealed in Southeast Asia. One is distributed in northern Myanmar, southern China (including Hainan) and northern Vietnam, and also reaches into central Vietnam along the coast (Cham Islands). The valid name for this taxon must be H. poutensis Allen. The second clade is comprised by populations inhabiting the Malay Peninsula and the Sunda Islands, we identify this taxon as H. larvatus sensu stricto. The third taxon was identified only from southern Myanmar. The fourth taxon is distributed in southern and central Indochina. Its representatives were not related to any of the forms identified in Myanmar, and therefore, its previous identification with H. grandis sounds questionable. Since both the third and fourth taxa cannot now be unambiguously associated with a particular named form, we conventionally designate them as H. cf. grandis 1 and 2.

AB  - The moth Trabala vishnou gigantina Yang is a leaf-eating pest, and there have been severe outbreaks of it in Hippophae rhamnoides plantations in North China. To study the effects of short-term high temperatures on its feeding, mating, longevity, and fecundity, T. vishnou gigantina were cultivated at 30, 35, and 40 degrees C for 1, 2, and 4 h. The results showed that the different intensities and durations of the high temperatures had significant impacts on the moth's survival and reproduction. With increased temperatures and durations of exposure, the development time of T. vishnou gigantina was shortened and then prolonged. At 30 and 35 degrees C, with increased exposure time, the development time was shorter than that at 25 degrees C, whereas it was significantly longer at 40 degrees C. The increase in temperatures and treatment times resulted in gradual decrease in mating rate. With increased temperature, the average fecundity, fecundity rate, and average adult longevity (of both the males and females), gradually decreased. Furthermore, with increased treatment times, at the same temperatures, the average fecundity, fecundity rate, and average adult longevity (of both the males and females), also gradually decreased. In conclusion, T. vishnou gigantina is significantly impacted on survival and reproduction by short term high temperatures. This study is expected to provide a scientific basis for predicting the population dynamics in T. vishnou gigantina.

AB  - High-quality genetic maps play important roles in QTL mapping and molecular marker-assisted breeding. Tea leaves are not only important vegetative organs but are also the organ for harvest with important economic value. However, the key genes and genetic mechanism of regulating leaf area have not been clarified. In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing on "Jinxuan," "Yuncha 1" and their 96 F1 hybrid offspring. From the 1.84 Tb of original sequencing data, abundant genetic variation loci were identified, including 28,144,625 SNPs and 2,780,380 indels. By integrating the markers of a previously reported genetic map, a high-density genetic map consisting of 15 linkage groups including 8,956 high-quality SNPs was constructed. The total length of the genetic map is 1,490.81 cM, which shows good collinearity with the genome. A total of 25 representative markers (potential QTLs) related to leaf area were identified, and there were genes differentially expressed in large and small leaf samples near these markers. GWAS analysis further verified the reliability of OIL mapping. Thirty-one pairs of newly developed indel markers located near these potential QTLs showed high polymorphism and had good discrimination between large and small leaf tea plant samples. Our research will provide necessary support and new insights for tea plant genetic breeding, quantitative trait mapping and yield improvement.

AB  - Tea oil plants are economically valuable as a chemical feedstock, a bioenergy source, and a dietary supplement. The lack of molecular markers for genetic resource clustering for conservation restricts research on these species. Based on EST sequences, 28,120 SSR primer pairs were found in this study. Of those SSRs, 192 had a successful amplification rate of 93.23% in Camellia oleifera and high transferability rates in C. semiserrata (77.09%), C. gauchowensis (84.92%), C. japonica (78.77%), and C. polyodonta (89.39%). The genetic distance (GD) between 54 accessions, as determined by sixteen SSRs, ranged from 0.26 to 2.26 (GD > 0), indicating that these accessions could be discriminated completely by these sixteen SSRs. We suggest that the EST-SSRs generated in this study will be useful for resource identification and dendrogram construction for resource collection and conservation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of different suckling methods on newborn Assaf lambs growth performance and mortality. A total of 97 lambs were used in the study, with lambing periods starting from October 2020 to January 2021. Ewes' parities were first, second, and third. After lambing, lambs were randomly distributed according to the suckling method into three groups: natural suckling (G1) (39 lambs), lambs fed completely with milk replacer (G2) (29 lambs), and lambs fed milk replacer at a rate of 4 times per day (G3) (29 lambs). In G1, lambs were 59% twins and 41% single lambs. Lambs from first, second, and third parity were 8, 21, and 28% respectively. Single lambs of G2 were 62%, while twin lambs were 38%. Lambs from first, second, and third parties were 14, 48, and 38%, respectively. However, 69% of G3 were singles. The natural suckling lambs (G1) were kept with their dams for free suckling until weaning at 60 days of age. However, the artificial suckling groups (G2) were isolated from dams and fed milk replacer ad libitum until weaning at 40 days of age. Lambs of the G3 were isolated from mothers and took their milk replacer through an automatic sucking machine four times a day, for half an hour each time, until weaning at 40 days. The results showed that weaning weights at 40 days were 13.7, 12.83 and 13 kg for lambs in G1, G2 and G3, respectively. The sucking method had no effect on mortality (P>0.05). The mortality rate decreased from 18% in G1 to 7 and 3.5% in G2 and G3 respectively. Most of the dead lambs were single lambs. Significant cost effects (P<0.05) were observed by feeding milk replacer in suckling lambs. The cost of milk per lamb was reduced from 120 to 40 USD. It was determined that feeding milk replacers to nursing lambs will result in significant cost reductions. However, these reductions were expected from the savings in milk expenses and the significant decrease in lambs' mortality rate. We recomend the use of milk replacer in Assaf lambs for better performnce and economic cost.

AB  - Research suggests that assisted reproductive technologies may lead to adverse effects on the offspring. To date, long-term effects from fetal development through adulthood have been scarcely researched. In the present observational study, we aimed to describe growth (body weight, BW; crown-rump length, CRL; and average daily gain, ADG), and growth-related hormone levels (growth hormone, GH; insulin-like growth factor 1, IGF-1; thyroxine, T4; cortisol) of pigs derived from artificial insemination (AI) and from embryos produced in vitro under two different conditions, C-IVP, with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), and RF-IVP, with reproductive fluids and BSA, as protein source in culture, from birth to 5 years of age. In vitro-produced animals showed greater BW, CRL and ADG than AI. Additionally, C-IVP animals had greater BW, CRL and ADG than RF-IVP up to 6 months of age. Regarding hormones, GH concentration was greater in RF-IVP compared to AI and C-IVP. In males, IGF-1 levels of RF-IVP were greater than those of AI. Instead, T4 levels of AI males were greater than C-IVP and RFIVP. Males showed greater IGF-1 and GH than females, the latter only from 1 year old. Instead, females had greater T4 concentration than males. No differences in cortisol were observed between groups or sexes. In conclusion, this study sets reference values of growth and hormone concentrations for adult pigs that are missing in literature. Although the differences observed between the experimental groups were within physiological ranges, there was a greater growth performance in the IVP groups.

AB  - Our understanding of trophic interactions of small insectivorous mammals has been drastically improved with the advent of DNA metabarcoding. The technique has continued to be optimised over the years, with primer choice repeatedly being a vital factor for dietary inferences. However, the majority of dietary studies examining the effect of primer choice often rely on in silico analyses or comparing between species that occupy an identical niche type. Here, we apply DNA metabarcoding to empirically compare the prey detection capabilities of two widely used primer sets when assessing the diets of a flying (lesser horseshoe bat; Rhinolophus hipposideros) and two ground-dwelling insectivores (greater white-toothed shrew; Crocidura russula and pygmy shrew; Sorex minutus). Although R. hipposideros primarily rely on two prey orders (Lepidoptera and Diptera), the unique taxa detected by each primer shows that a combination of primers may be the best approach to fully describe bat trophic ecology. However, random forest classifier analysis suggests that one highly degenerate primer set detected the majority of both shrews' diet despite higher levels of host amplification. The wide range of prey consumed by ground-dwelling insectivores can therefore be accurately documented from using a single broad-range primer set, which can decrease cost and labour. The results presented here show that dietary inferences will differ depending on the primer or primer combination used for insectivores occupying different niches (i.e., hunting in the air or ground) and demonstrate the importance of performing empirical pilot studies for novel study systems.

AB  - ER Bodies accumulate atypical myrosinases that hydrolyzes glucosinolates, generating chemically reactive products toxic to pathogens and herbivores. NAI2 is an ER Body component that facilitates ER body formation, similar to the ER Body, its homologous proteins are shown only in Brassicaceae. A new type of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles, NAIP vesicles-which are related to the ER Body-have been found in recent years, and NAIPs (NAI2-interact proteins) not only play a critical and redundant role in ER Body formation, but also could assemble other proteins to coordinate or promote cargo recruitment to drive the formation of the NAIP vesicle. Unlike NAI2, homologous proteins of NAIPs are shown in all kinds of plants with 3 or 4 members, which increases the difficulty in studying the biological function of NAIP vesicles. Here, we optimized the CRISPR/Cas9 system for concurrent editing of multiple target genes by designing suitable multiple targeting sequences and ingeniously utilizing enzymatic sites for the linkage of various promoters. Additionally, appropriate methodologies were employed to construct CRISPR/Cas9 expression vectors and introduce them into tomato, resulting in knocking off three members of the NAIP vesicle-associated gene family. Noteworthy, this CRISPR/Cas9 system has potential applications for functional studies of the functionally redundant genes in eudicot plants. We also found that slnaip1/2/3s mutants were shorter in the youth age compared to the wild type, which provides a favorable clue for the subsequent identification of NAIP vesicles in other plants.

AB  - Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a widely used flavour enhancer. A daily intake of MSG at high dosage (2000-4000 mg/kg body weight) is reported to be toxic to humans and experimental animals. The present study aims to investigate the toxic effect of oral administration of MSG at low concentrations (30 and 100 mg/kg body weight) by evaluating biochemical parameters of oxidative stress and inflammation in blood; expression of neuroinflammatory gene and histopathological changes in brain on male Wistar rats. The administration of MSG significantly increases serum level of fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and decrease level of high-density lipoprotein. Significant low level of FRAP, GSH, SOD, CAT and higher level of MDA, PCO, AOPP, PMRS, NO, CRP, IL-6, TNF-a confirms substantial oxidative stress followed by inflammation after 100 mg MSG treatment. RT-PCR figure shows significant expression of neuroinflammatory gene IL-6 and TNF-a and histopathological examination revealed severe neurodegeneration in hippocampus (CA1 and CA3) and cerebral cortex region of brain at 100 mg MSG treatment. Our result provides evidence that MSG administration at 30 mg does not impose toxicity, however at 100 mg/ kg body weight, which is considered a low dose, there is significant toxic effects and may be detrimental to health.

AB  - In agriculture, insect pests must be identified at the initial stage of infestation to avoid their spread in the field. Leaf folders (cnaphalocrocis medinalis) and yellow stemborers (scirpophaga incertulas) are destructive pests of paddy crops, which are causing severe yield loss. Manual identification of insect pests in the crop is time-consuming, tedious, and ineffective. This paper focuses on a light trap based four-layer deep neural network with search and rescue optimization (DNN-SAR) method to identify leaf folders and yellow stemborers. Light traps are designed to lure the insects in the paddy field and the images of trapped insects are analyzed using the proposed detection method. In the DNN-SAR, images are contrast enhanced using deer hunting algorithm, impulse noise is removed with fast average group filter, and segmented using social ski-driver optimization. The search and rescue optimization algorithm is used for the selection of optimal weights in the deep neural network, which has improved the convergence rate, lowered the complexity of learning, and improved the accuracy of detection. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods and achieved 98.29% pest detection accuracy.(c) 2020 China Agricultural University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat waves can have fatal effects on arthropods such as insects and mites since their heat tolerance is often lower than the diurnal maximum temperatures during heat waves. Plastic modifications by the parents, however, can rapidly result in favorable adaptations in offspring traits. This question was investigated by using a prominent natural enemy/pest couple in biological control, the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis and its prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. We exposed both species separately to extreme or mild heat waves during their juvenile development, a vital phase of arthropod life, for two generations and assessed various fitness-relevant parameters of the offspring generation. Under extreme heat waves, adult body sizes of predator and prey males and prey females were insensitive, when they derived from parents also reared under extreme heat waves. Irrespective of their origin, offspring reached earlier adulthood under extreme heat waves. In general, prey benefitted more from parental modifications compared to the predator. However, further investigations are needed to verify whether these changes affect the interactions between the predators and their prey to an extent that it may jeopardize biological control during extreme heat waves. Theoretically, parents can adjust vital offspring traits to the irregular and rapid occurrence of heat waves via developmental plasticity. However, the direction and strength of such trait modifications are often species-specific. Here, we investigated within-generational plasticity (WGP) and trans-generational plasticity (TGP) effects induced by heat waves during the offspring development of the predator Phytoseiulus persimilis and its herbivorous prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, to assess plastic developmental modifications. Single offspring individuals with different parental thermal origin (reared under mild or extreme heat waves) of both species were exposed to mild or extreme heat waves until adulthood, and food consumption, age and size at maturity were recorded. The offspring traits were influenced by within-generational plasticity (WGP), trans-generational plasticity (TGP), non-plastic trans-generational effects (TGE) and/or their interactions. When exposed to extreme heat waves, both species speeded up development (exclusively WGP), consumed more (due to the fact of WGP but also to TGP in prey females and to non-plastic TGE in predator males), and predator females got smaller (non-plastic TGE and WGP), whereas prey males and females were equally sized irrespective of their origin, because TGE, WGP and TGP acted in opposite directions. The body sizes of predator males were insensitive to parental and offspring heat wave conditions. Species comparisons indicated stronger reductions in the developmental time and reduced female predator-prey body size ratios in favor of the prey under extreme heat waves. Further investigations are needed to evaluate, whether trait modifications result in lowered suppression success of the predator on its prey under heat waves or not.

AB  - Progesterone treatment for synchrony of estrus is standard in sheep artificial insemination (AI) programs but can be associated with poor outcomes. Potential for improvement exists through a better understanding of the interactions between follicle development, luteal regression, emergence of the ovulatory follicle and timing of estrus. These interactions were examined by comparing progesterone-treated (Day 1 1/4 day of pessary insertion) and naturally cycling ewes (Day 1 1/4 day after estrus) at three times of the year (Autumn, Spring equinox and late Spring). Observations were made from Day 1 until the day of ovulation. Compared with the natural cycle, progesterone treatment (300 mg intra-vaginal pessary for 14 d) reduced the number of follicle waves (2.2 +/- 0.18 versus 2.8 +/- 0.12; P < 0.05) and increased the length of the ovulatory wave (8.6 +/- 0.45 versus 6.6 +/- 0.42 d; P < 0.05). The number of follicles per wave, the inter-wave interval and ovulation rate were not affected. However, progesterone treatment induced (P < 0.05) an earlier luteolysis (9.7 +/- 0.51 versus 15.4 +/- 0.49 d after Day 1), an earlier emergence of the ovulatory follicle (7.5 +/- 0.48 versus 11.4 +/- 0.46 d after Day 1) and an earlier onset of estrus (26.1 +/- 2.95 versus 53.3 +/- 2.84 h after Day 14). Time of year also influenced the response to progesterone treatment. In Autumn compared with the Spring equinox and late Spring, there was a reduction (P < 0.05) in follicle wave number (2.4 +/- 0.21 versus 2.5 +/- 0.29 versus 3.0 +/- 0.20 respectively), follicles per wave (2.6 +/- 0.27 versus 3.5 +/- 0.25 versus 3.2 +/- 0.20 respectively), ovulation rate (1.6 +/- 0.12 versus 1.9 +/- 0.12 versus 2.0 +/- 0.10 respectively) and the inter-wave interval was longer (5.3 +/- 0.40 versus 4.0 +/- 0.32 versus 3.8 +/- 0.27 d respectively; P < 0.05). Time of year also influenced (P < 0.05) the time of luteolysis (earliest in late Spring), emergence of the ovulatory follicle (earliest in Autumn) and onset of estrus (earliest in Autumn). It is concluded that (1) the effects of progesterone treatment on follicle waves are relatively minor, (2) the effects of treatment on timing of luteolysis, emergence of the ovulatory follicle and onset of estrus are all significant although the effects on AI outcomes remain to be determined and (3) time of year has a minimal effect on follicle waves but a more significant effect on other parameters of the estrous cycle. A better understanding of these complexities will assist in the development of improved protocols for synchrony of estrus.

AB  - Key messageWe identified a miraculin-like protein (NaMLP) who is a new Kunitz trypsin inhibitor regulated synergistically by JA and ethylene signals and confers Spodoptera litura resistance in wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata. The findings revealed a new source of trypsin inhibitor activities after herbivory, and provide new insights into the complexity of the regulation of trypsin inhibitor-based defense after insect herbivore attack.Upon insect herbivore attack, wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata accumulates trypsin protease inhibitor (TPI) activities as a defense response from different protease inhibitor (PI) coding genes, including WRKY3-regulated NaKTI2, and JA-dependent NaPI. However, whether any other TPI gene exists in N. attenuata is still unclear. A miraculin-like protein gene (NaMLP) was highly up-regulated in N. attenuata after Alternaria alternata infection. However, silencing or overexpression of NaMLP had no effect on the lesion diameter developed on N. attenuata leaves after A. alternata inoculation. Meanwhile, the transcripts of NaMLP could be induced by wounding and amplified by Spodoptera litura oral secretions (OS). S. litura larvae gained significantly more biomass on NaMLP-silenced plants but less on NaMLP overexpressed plants. Although NaMLP showed low sequence similarity to NaKTI2, it had conserved reaction sites of Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, and exhibited TPI activities when its coding gene was overexpressed transiently or stably in N. attenuata. This was consistent with the worst performance of S. litura larvae on NaMLP overexpressed lines. Furthermore, NaMLP-silenced plants had reduced TPI activities and better S. litura performance. Finally, OS-elicited NaMLP was dramatically reduced in JA-deficient AOC silencing and ethylene-reduced ACO-silencing plants, and the expression of NaMLP could be significantly induced by methyl jasmonate or ethephon alone, but dramatically amplified by co-treatment of both methyl jasmonate and ethephon. Thus, our results demonstrate that in addition to JA-regulated NaPI, and WRKY3/6-dependent NaKTI2, N. attenuata plants also up-regulates TPI activities via NaMLP, which confers S. litura resistance through JA and ethylene signaling pathways in a synergistic way.

AB  - Glaesserella parasuis is the etiological agent of Gl & auml;sser's disease, which causes high morbidity and mortality in pigs worldwide. Macrolide resistance poses an urgent threat to their treatment, as macrolides are widely used for preventing and treating G. parasuis infections. Here, we determined the susceptibilities to five macrolides and characterized the genetic markers of macrolide resistance. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 117 G. parasuis isolates to erythromycin, tulathromycin, gamithromycin, tylosin, and tilmicosin was evaluated using broth microdilution method. Erythromycin-resistant isolates were sequenced using whole-genome sequencing. Further analysis of these sequences revealed the genetic basis of macrolide resistance in G. parasuis. Our results show that most G. parasuis isolates remained susceptible to the macrolide drugs. For commonly used agents (e.g., tylosin and tilmicosin), elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were observed, whereas for the newer macrolides (e.g., tulathromycin and gamithromycin), the MICs remained almost unchanged. The macrolide resistance gene erm(T) and the A2059G mutation in 23S rRNA were detected in the current study. To the best of our knowledge, integrative and conjugative element (ICE)-borne erm(T) in G. parasuis is reported for the first time in this study. Taken together, these results provide insights into the susceptibility of G. parasuis to macrolides. The presence of erm(T) on ICEs may facilitate its transfer, reducing the effectiveness of macrolide treatment.

AB  - The precise regulation of synaptic function by targeted protein degradation is fundamental to learning and memory, yet the roles of many brain-enriched E3 ubiquitin ligases in this process remain elusive. Here, we uncover a critical and previously unappreciated role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRAJA1 in orchestrating synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. Utilizing C57BL/6 and 5xFAD male mice and employing a multi-faceted approach including protein biochemistry, molecular biology, in vitro electrophysiology, and behavioral assays, we demonstrate that long-term potentiation (LTP) induction triggers a rapid, proteasome-dependent downregulation of PRAJA1 within the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Critically, selective knockdown of PRAJA1 in vivo profoundly enhanced both object recognition and spatial memory, while disrupting normal exploratory behavior. Mechanistically, we reveal that PRAJA1 acts as a key regulator of synaptic architecture and transmission: its downregulation leads to a reduction in key synaptic proteins and spine density, influencing the excitatory/inhibitory balance and facilitating synaptic plasticity. Conversely, increased PRAJA1 expression potentiates GABAergic transmission. Furthermore, we identify spinophilin as a novel substrate of PRAJA1, suggesting a direct molecular link between PRAJA1 and synaptic remodeling. Strikingly, our findings implicate dysregulation of PRAJA1 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, positioning PRAJA1 as a potential therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement in neurodegenerative conditions. These results unveil PRAJA1 as a critical molecular brake on synaptic plasticity and memory formation, offering a promising new avenue for understanding and potentially treating memory impairment.

AB  - When attacked by insect herbivores, plants initiate sophisticated defenses mediated by complex signaling networks and usually release a blend of functional volatiles such as terpenes against infestation. The extra-long staple cotton Gossypium barbadense cultivated worldwide as natural textile fiber crop is frequently exposed to a variety of herbivores, such as cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. However, little is known about insect-induced transcriptional changes and molecular mechanisms underlying subsequent defense responses in G. barbadense. In the current study, transcriptome changes in G. barbadense infested with chewing H. armigera larvae were investigated, and we identified 5,629 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the infested cotton leaves compared with non-infested controls. H. armigera feeding triggered complex signaling networks in which almost all (88 out of 90) DEGs associated with the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway were upregulated, highlighting a central role for JA in the defense responses of G. barbadense against target insects. All DEGs involved in growth-related photosynthesis were downregulated, whereas most DEGs associated with defense-related transcript factors and volatile secondary metabolism were upregulated. It was noteworthy that a terpene synthase gene in the transcriptome data, GbTPS1, was strongly expressed in H. armigera-infested G. barbadense leaves. The upregulation of GbTPS1 in qPCR analysis also suggested an important role for GbTPS1 in herbivore-induced cotton defense. In vitro assays showed that recombinant GbTPS1 catalyzed farnesyl pyrophosphate and neryl diphosphate to produce three sesquiterpenes (selinene, alpha-gurjunene, and beta-elemene) and one monoterpene (limonene), respectively. Moreover, these catalytic products of GbTPS1 were significantly elevated in G. barbadense leaves after H. armigera infestation, and elemene and limonene had repellent effects on H. armigera larvae in a dual-choice bioassay and increased larval mortality in a no-choice bioassay. These findings provide a valuable insight into understanding the transcriptional changes reprogramming herbivore-induced sesquiterpene biosynthesis in G. barbadense infested by H. armigera, which help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying plant defense against insect pests.

AB  - The family Streblidae is a significant grouping of dipteran insects within the superfamily Hippoboscoidea, which parasitizes the body surface of bats. With the global spread of bat-related pathogens in recent years, Streblidae has gained increasing attention due to its potential for pathogen transmission. A sample of Brachytarsina amboinensis was sequenced on the B. amboinensis were obtained, compared with available Streblidae mitogenomes, and the phylogeny of Hippoboscoidea was reconstructed. The results indicate that the mitochondrial genome of B. amboinensis exhibits a relatively high degree of conservation, with an identical gene count, arrangement, and orientation as the ancestral insect's genome. Base composition analysis revealed a strong bias towards A and T in the base composition. Selection pressure analysis indicated strong purifying selection acting on cox1. Pairwise genetic distance analysis showed that cox1 evolved at a relatively slow rate. Regarding phylogenetic relationships, the constructed phylogenetic trees using Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood methods supported the monophyly of the Hippoboscoidea, Glossinidae, Hippoboscidae, and Nycteribiidae clades, with high nodal support values. Our research confirmed the paraphyly of the families Streblidae. In the familial relations between Nycteribiidae and Streblidae, New World Streblidae share a closer kinship with Nycteribiidae. This contrasts with prior findings which indicated that Old World Streblidae share a closer kinship with Nycteribiidae. This study not only enhances the molecular database for bat flies but also provides a valuable reference for the identification and phylogenetic analysis of Streblidae.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In recent years, prices of imported staples such as corn and soybean meal have risen dramatically. Defatted rice bran (DFRB), an abundant and underutilized agricultural coproduct of the paddy rice, was a replacement of corn and soybean meal. It is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the nutritional value of DFRB. This study determined and compared the net energy (NE) of DFRB from different sources and different processing technology fed to growing pigs using indirect calorimetry. Results indicated that NE contents of extruded DFRB from different provinces were within the range of values ((8.24 to 10.22 MJ/kg dry matter (DM)). The NE contents of extruded DFRB and pelleted DFRB from the same province were 8.24 vs. 6.56 MJ/kg DM. This study showed that there is a discrepancy of approximately 10.01% in the NE content between the DFRB origins. The data above suggested that NE content of DFRB could be related to DFRB origins and processing technology. More NE contents of different DFRB samples deserve to be explored further. The study supported some theoretical foundation for the application of DFRB in the NE system.
   The study was conducted to determine and compare the net energy (NE) of defatted rice bran (DFRB) from different sources and different processing technology fed to growing pigs using indirect calorimetry. Thirty-six growing barrows (30.7 +/- 3.9 kg) were randomly allotted to 1 of 6 diets with 6 replicate pigs per diet. Diets included a corn-soybean meal basal diet and 5 test diets containing 30% DFRB, respectively. These five samples come from 4 different provinces (i.e., Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Jilin, and Liaoning province within China) and two of them with the same origin but different processing technologies (i.e., extruded or pelleted). During each period, pigs were kept individually in metabolism crates for 21 days, including 14 days to adapt to the diets. On day 15, pigs were transferred to the open-circuit respiration chambers for adaptation, and the next day were ready to determine daily total heat production (HP) and were fed 1 of the 6 diets at 2.3 MJ metabolizable energy (ME)/kg body weight (BW)(0.6)/day. Total feces and urine were collected for the determination of digestible energy (DE) and ME and daily total HP was measured from day 16 to day 20 and fasted on day 21 for the measurement of fasting heat production (FHP). The NE contents of extruded DFRB from different provinces were within the range of values (8.24 to 10.22 MJ/kg DM). There is a discrepancy of approximately 10.01% in the NE content between the DFRB origins. The NE contents of extruded DFRB and pelleted DFRB from the same province were 8.24 vs. 6.56 MJ/kg DM. Retained energy (RE) and FHP of diets containing extruded DFRB and pelleted DFRB were 1105 vs. 892 kJ/kg BW0.6/day and 746 vs. 726 kJ/kg BW0.6/day respectively, and those in extruded DFRB from different origins were within the range of values (947 to 1105 kJ/kg BW0.6/day and 726 to 755 kJ/kg BW0.6/day, respectively). In conclusion, NE values are affected by origin and processing technology of DFRB.

AB  - Fungal ball (FB) rhinosinusitis (RS) is the main type of non-invasive fungal RS. Despite positive direct examination (DE) of biopsies, culture remains negative in more than 60% of cases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance/efficacy of targeted metagenomics (TM) to analyze microbiota and mycobiota in FB and find microbial associations. Forty-five sinus biopsies from patients who underwent surgery for chronic RS were included. After DE and culture, DNA was extracted, then fungal ITS1-ITS2 and bacterial V3-V4 16S rDNA loci were sequenced (MiSeq(TM) Illumina). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined via QIIME and assigned to SILVA (16S) and UNITE (ITS) databases. Statistical analyses were performed using SHAMAN. Thirty-eight patients had FB and seven had non-fungal rhinosinusitis (NFRS). DE and culture of FB were positive for fungi in 97.3 and 31.6% of patients, respectively. TM analysis of the 38 FB yielded more than one fungal genus in 100% of cases, with Aspergillus in 89.5% (34/38). Haemophilus was over-represented in FB with >1000 reads/sample in 47.3% (18/38) compared to NFRS (p < 0.001). TM allowed fungal identification in biopsies with negative culture. Haemophilus was associated with FB. Pathogenesis could result from fungi-bacteria interactions in a mixed biofilm-like structure.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of tiger milk mushroom (Lignosus rhinocerotis) extract (LRE) on immune responses and resistance against the aquatic pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) to improve disease management in shrimp aquaculture. LREs were extracted using methanol and water to evaluate their cytotoxicity and antimicrobial efficacy. L. rhinocerotis methanol extract (LRME) exhibited higher antimicrobial activity and lower acute toxicity compared to the aqueous extract, and was selected for subsequent in vitro hemocyte assays and in vivo feeding trials. The in vivo trials were conducted in two batches, with each batch consisting of five diets: a basal diet without LRME inclusion (control), a commercial diet, and three treatment diets supplemented with LRME at 1 g (LRME1), 5 g (LRME5), and 10 g (LRME10) per kilogram of feed. Each diet had three replicates (n = 3). The first batch included 120 shrimp with an average weight of 13.38 +/- 1.72 g, and was used to evaluate immune parameters, including total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte type proportions, phenoloxidase (PO) activity, phagocytic activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, over a 12-day feeding trial. The second batch consisted of 225 post-larvae (PL10) with an average weight of 0.06 +/- 0.01 g, and was used for bacterial challenge tests to assess survival rates following a 4-day feeding trial. In the 12-day feeding trial, shrimp fed with LRME showed significant increases in THC, ROS production, phagocytic, and PO activity, with LRME1 consistently demonstrating substantial improvements across multiple immune parameters. Days 4 and 8 were observed as specific time points when LRME exhibited significant effects on shrimp immunity, highlighting the temporal nature of shrimp immune responses to LRME supplementation. In a subsequent bacterial challenge test, a 4-day supplementation of LRME1 significantly enhanced shrimp survival rates. This study highlights the potential of LRME in enhancing shrimp immunity and resistance against V. parahaemolyticus, with significant effects observed at 1 g kg-1 dietary inclusion and a supplementation period of 4 days.

AB  - Seasonality poses significant nutritional constraints for ungulates. Consequently, most ungulates time their energy-demanding events like calving and lactation to the availability of abundant and high-quality nutritional resources. We investigated the reproductive phenology of blackbuck, Antilope cervicapra, in relation to resource seasonality, in a semi-arid grassland in western India. We examined whether the body condition of females, forage abundance and forage quality influenced the timing of blackbuck reproduction. We also used a conceptual model to explore whether blackbuck use behavioural adaptations in maternal care as an adaptive strategy to buffer the high nutritional demands of lactation. Blackbuck showed biannual calving, which occurred before (pre-monsoon) and after the rains (post-monsoon). We found statistically significant relationships, albeit small effect sizes, of body condition, forage abundance (biomass) and moisture content of grasses on the proportion of lactating females. The biannual reproductive phenology seems more complex than a simple relationship of reproduction with body condition and optimal nutrition supply. In the conceptual model based on our data, we propose that blackbuck females shortened their lactation time and weaned their calves sooner during the pre-monsoon calving to coincide with a period of optimal food quality, thus, ensuring sufficient nutrition for both weanlings and allowing the females to regain body reserves, whereas, resource availability during the post-monsoon calving likely allowed females to invest in longer lactation, weaning the calves later, as compared to the pre-monsoon calving season. Thereby, blackbuck may be maintaining biannual calving and thus increase their lifetime reproductive output.

AB  - Background Dietary shifts are major evolutionary steps that shape ecological niches and biodiversity. The beetle family Coccinellidae, commonly known as ladybirds, first transitioned from a fungivorous to an insectivorous and subsequently a plant diet. However, the molecular basis of this dietary diversification remained unexplored.ResultsWe investigated the molecular evolution of dietary shifts in ladybirds, focusing on the transitions from fungivory to carnivory (Coccinellidae) and from carnivory to herbivory (Epilachnini), by comparing 25 genomes and 62 transcriptomes of beetles. Our analysis shows that chemosensory gene families have undergone significant expansions at both nodes of diet change and were differentially expressed in feeding experiments, suggesting that they may be related to foraging. We found expansions of digestive and detoxifying gene families and losses of chitin-related digestive genes in the herbivorous ladybirds, and absence of most plant cell wall-degrading enzymes in the ladybirds dating from the transition to carnivory, likely indicating the effect of different digestion requirements on the gene repertoire. Immunity effector genes tend to emerge or have specific amino acid sequence compositions in carnivorous ladybirds and are downregulated under suboptimal dietary treatments, suggesting a potential function of these genes related to microbial symbionts in the sternorrhynchan prey.ConclusionsOur study provides a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis to address evolution of chemosensory, digestive, detoxifying, and immune genes associated with dietary shifts in ladybirds. Ladybirds can be considered a ubiquitous example of dietary shifts in insects, and thus a promising model system for evolutionary and applied biology.

AB  - The use of nanostructured materials and nanosized-topographies has the potential to impact the performance of implantable biodevices, including neural interfaces, enhancing their sensitivity and selectivity, while reducing tissue reactivity. As a result, current trends in biosensor technology require the effective ability to improve devices with controlled nanostructures. Nanoimprint lithography to pattern surfaces with high-density and high aspect ratio nanopillars (NPs) made of polystyrene (PS-NP, insulating), or of a polystyrene/carbon-nanotube nanocomposite (PS-CNT-NP, electrically conductive) are exploited. Both substrates are challenged with cultured primary neurons. They are demonstrated to support the development of suspended synaptic networks at the NPs' interfaces characterized by a reduction in proliferating neuroglia, and a boost in neuronal emergent electrical activity when compared to flat controls. The authors successfully exploit their conductive PS-CNT-NPs to stimulate cultured cells electrically. The ability of both nanostructured surfaces to interface tissue explants isolated from the mouse spinal cord is then tested. The integration of the neuronal circuits with the NP topology, the suspended nature of the cultured networks, the reduced neuroglia formation, and the higher network activity together with the ability to deliver electrical stimuli via PS-CNT-NP reveal such platforms as promising designs to implement on neuro-prosthetic or neurostimulation devices.

AB  - Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by the occurrence of recurrent spontaneous seizures. Behavioral disorders and altered cognition are frequent comorbidities affecting the quality of life of people with epi-lepsy. These impairments are undoubtedly multifactorial and the specific mechanisms underlying these comorbidities are largely unknown. Long-lasting alterations in synaptic strength due to changes in expression, phosphorylation, or function of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) have been associated with alterations in neuronal synaptic plasticity. In particular, alterations in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-accepted model of learning and memory, have been associated with altered cognition in epilepsy. Here, we analyzed the effects of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) on AMPARs to determine if alterations in AMPAR signaling might be one of the mechanisms contributing to altered cognition during epilepsy. We found alterations in the phosphorylation and plasma membrane expression of AMPARs. In addition, we detected altered expres-sion of GRIP, a key scaffolding protein involved in the proper distribution of AMPARs at the neuronal cell surface. Interestingly, a functional analysis revealed that these molecular changes are linked to impaired LTP. Together, these observations suggest that seizure-induced alterations in the molecular machinery regulating AMPARs likely impact the neuron's ability to support synaptic plasticity that is required for learning and memory.

AB  - Hair fiber growth is determined by the spatiotemporally controlled proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of hair matrix cells (HMCs) inside the hair follicle (HF); however, dermal papilla cells (DPCs), the cell population surrounded by HMCs, manipulate the above processes via intercellular crosstalk with HMCs. Therefore, exploring how the mutual commutations between the cells are molecularly achieved is vital to understanding the mechanisms underlying hair growth. Here, based on our previous successes in cultivating HMCs and DPCs from cashmere goats, we combined a series of techniques, including in vitro cell coculture, transcriptome sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, to uncover ligand-receptor pairs and signaling networks mediating intercellular crosstalk. Firstly, we found that direct cellular interaction significantly alters cell cycle distribution patterns and changes the gene expression profiles of both cells at the global level. Next, we constructed the networks of ligand-receptor pairs mediating intercellular autocrine or paracrine crosstalk between the cells. A few pairs, such as LEP-LEPR, IL6-EGFR, RSPO1-LRP6, and ADM-CALCRL, are found to have known or potential roles in hair growth by acting as bridges linking cells. Further, we inferred the signaling axis connecting the cells from transcriptomic data with the advantage of CCCExplorer. Certain pathways, including INHBA-ACVR2A/ACVR2B-ACVR1/ACVR1B-SMAD3, were predicted as the axis mediating the promotive effect of INHBA on hair growth via paracrine crosstalk between DPCs and HMCs. Finally, we verified that LEP-LEPR and IL1A-IL1R1 are pivotal ligand-receptor pairs involved in autocrine and paracrine communication of DPCs and HMCs to DPCs, respectively. Our study provides a comprehensive landscape of intercellular crosstalk between key cell types inside HF at the molecular level, which is helpful for an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms related to hair growth.

AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs) into clinical diagnostics has the potential to transform doctor-patient interactions. However, the readiness of these models for real-world clinical application remains inadequately tested. This paper introduces the Conversational Reasoning Assessment Framework for Testing in Medicine (CRAFT-MD) approach for evaluating clinical LLMs. Unlike traditional methods that rely on structured medical examinations, CRAFT-MD focuses on natural dialogues, using simulated artificial intelligence agents to interact with LLMs in a controlled environment. We applied CRAFT-MD to assess the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mistral and LLaMA-2-7b across 12 medical specialties. Our experiments revealed critical insights into the limitations of current LLMs in terms of clinical conversational reasoning, history-taking and diagnostic accuracy. These limitations also persisted when analyzing multimodal conversational and visual assessment capabilities of GPT-4V. We propose a comprehensive set of recommendations for future evaluations of clinical LLMs based on our empirical findings. These recommendations emphasize realistic doctor-patient conversations, comprehensive history-taking, open-ended questioning and using a combination of automated and expert evaluations. The introduction of CRAFT-MD marks an advancement in testing of clinical LLMs, aiming to ensure that these models augment medical practice effectively and ethically.

AB  - Taste recognition memory is evident in rodents because the initial neophobia to novel tastes attenuates across exposures as the taste becomes familiar and safe. This attenuation of taste neophobia (AN) is context-dependent and an auditory background change could induce the recovery of the neophobic response. The AN auditory context-dependency requires the hippocampal integrity but the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the interaction with the taste memory circuit remain unexplored. We have applied pharmacological intervention by 6-hidroxydopamine (6-OHDA) hippocampal lesion for assessing the role of catecholamines in the hippocampal system to Wistar rats that drank a novel 3% vinegar solution for several consecutive days. Additionally, we manipulated the auditory background as a context that could either change or remain constant across all the drinking sessions. We found that a disruption of the context-dependent AN was induced by intracerebral administration of 6-OHDA targeted to the ventral CA1 hippocampus (vCA1). We conclude that the ability of the auditory context to modulate taste recognition memory involves the catecholaminergic activity in the ventral hippocampal circuit for the proper acquisition of safe taste memory.

AB  - The pathophysiology of depression is related to the reduced volume of the hippocampus and amygdala and hypertrophy of the nucleus accumbens. The mechanism of these changes is not well understood; however, clinical studies have shown that the administration of the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine reversed the decrease in hippocampus and amygdala volume in depressed patients, and the magnitude of this effect correlated with the reduction in depressive symptoms. In the present study, we attempted to find out whether the psychedelic substance psilocybin affects neurotransmission in the limbic system in comparison to ketamine. Psilocybin and ketamine increased the release of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the nucleus accumbens of naive rats as demonstrated using microdialysis. Both drugs influenced glutamate and GABA release in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala and increased ACh levels in the hippocampus. The changes in D2, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor density in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus were observed as a long-lasting effect. A marked anxiolytic effect of psilocybin in the acute phase and 24 h post-treatment was shown in the open field test. These data provide the neurobiological background for psilocybin's effect on stress, anxiety and structural changes in the limbic system and translate into the antidepressant effect of psilocybin in depressed patients.

AB  - Selective sensation of sound by the plant Arabidopsis thaliana may enable the timely upregulation of defensive compounds to protect against caterpillars of the plant's primary insect herbivore. Vibration of leaf trichomes has been shown to occur over frequency ranges that are appropriate for responding to these caterpillars, but the distribution of trichome shapes and sizes over a leaf means that a range of sounds could possibly be transduced. To assess how the diversity of trichomes on a leaf may affect sound transduction, we characterized the distribution of trichome sizes on a mature plant of A. thaliana and calculated the ensemble responses of entire leaves. Trichome sizes followed a normal distribution. Modal peaks in single trichome response spectra were at lower frequencies those of larger trichomes, roughly consistent with an inverse relationship between modal frequencies and trichome size. Ensemble response spectra for entire leaves showed frequency bands of responsiveness separated by defined band gaps, suggesting a possible mechanism for collective identification of the sounds of specific caterpillars.

AB  - Pig cough is considered the most common clinical symptom of respiratory diseases. Thus, establishing an early warning system for respiratory diseases in pigs by monitoring and identifying their cough sounds is important. In this paper, we propose a new fusion feature, namely Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient-convolutional neural network (MFCC-CNN), to improve the recognition accuracy of pig coughs. We obtained the MFCC-CNN feature by fusing multiple frames of MFCC with multiple one-layer CNNs. We used softmax and linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for classification. We tested the algorithm through field experiments. The results reveal that the performance of classifiers using the MFCC-CNN feature was significantly better than those using the MFCC feature. The F1-score increased by 10.37% and 5.21%, and the cough accuracy increased by 7.21% and 3.86% for the softmax and SVM classifiers, respectively. We also analyzed the impact of different numbers of fusion frames on the classification performance. The results reveal that fusing 55 and 45 adjacent frames resulted in the best performance for the softmax and SVM classifiers, respectively. From this research, we can conclude that a system constructed by simple one-layer CNNs and SVM classifiers can demonstrate excellent performance in pig sound recognition.(c) 2020 China Agricultural University.

AB  - The eutherian placenta is highly complex, evolving to regulate the inflammatory phase of pregnancy during conceptus attachment and placental tissue development. Tripartite motif family-like (TRIMLs) proteins are implicated in downregulating inflammation. In mammals, TRIML1 and TRIML2 show preferential expression in gonads, preimplantation embryos and placenta. TRIML1 domains differ between eutherians and marsupials, while TRIML2 is absent in marsupials, suggesting it may play a unique role in regulating the inflammatory phase during conceptus attachment, critical for establishing and maintaining pregnancy to term. This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of TRIML1 and TRIML2 in various tissues, as well as during embryo development, conceptus attachment, and placental formation in pigs. Transcripts for TRIML2 were detected in embryos, conceptuses, extraembryonic membranes, ovary and testis but not in any of the other tissues examined. In contrast, TRIML1 expression was only observed in testis. In situ hybridization of TRIML1 and TRIML2 confirmed these results. The specific expression of TRIML2 in immune privileged sites is consistent with it serving as an anti-inflammatory factor to provide immunological protection of the eutherian placenta. To further investigate the role of TRIML2, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was employed to knock out either TRIML1 (control) or TRIML2. TRIML1-/- and TRIML2-/- porcine fetal fibroblasts were used for somatic cell nuclear transfer, and the resulting embryos were transferred into surrogate gilts. Early conceptus and placental development were not affected by the loss of conceptus TRIML2.

AB  - Across the globe, the frequent occurrence of drought spells has significantly undermined the sustainability of modern high-input farming systems, particularly those focused on staple crops like wheat. To ameliorate the deleterious impacts of drought through a biologically viable and eco-friendly approach, a study was designed to explore the effect of nicotinic acid on different metabolic, and biochemical processes, growth and yield of wheat under optimal moisture and drought stress (DS). The current study was comprised of different levels of nicotinic acid applied as foliar spray (0 g L-1, 0.7368, 1.477, 2.2159 g L-1) and fertigation (0.4924, 0.9848, and 1.4773 g L-1) under normal conditions and imposed drought by withholding water at anthesis stage. The response variables were morphological traits such as roots and shoots characteristics, yield attributes, grain and biological yields along with biosynthesis of antioxidants. The results revealed that nicotinic acid dose of 2.2159 g L-1 out-performed rest of treatments under both normal and DS. The same treatment resulted in the maximum root growth (length, fresh and dry weights, surface area, diameter) and shoot traits (length, fresh and dry weights) growth. Additionally, foliar applied nicotinic acid (2.2159 g L-1) also produced as the highest spike length, grains spike-1, spikelet's spike-1 and weight of 1000 grains. Moreover, these better yield attributes led to significantly higher grain yield and biological productivity of wheat. Likewise in terms of physiological growth of wheat under DS, the same treatment remained superior by recording the highest SPAD value, relative water content, water potential of leaves, leaf area, stomatal conductance (292 mmolm- 2S- 1), internal carbon dioxide concentration, photosynthesis and transpiration rate. Interestingly, exogenously applied nicotinic acid remained effective in triggering the antioxidant system of wheat by recording significantly higher catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase.

AB  - Morphometric studies of 3D micro CT-scanned images can provide insights into the evolution of the brain and sensory structures but such data are still scarce for the most diverse mammalian order of rodents. From reviewed and new data, we tested for convergence to extreme aridity and high elevation in the sensory and brain morphology of rodents, from morphometric data from micro-CT X-ray scans of 174 crania of 16 species of three distantly related African murid (soft-furred mice, Praomyini, laminate-toothed rats, Otomyini, and gerbils, Gerbillinae) clades and one North American cricetid (deer mice and white-footed mice, Peromyscus) clade. Recent studies demonstrated convergent evolution acting on the oval window area of the cochlea (enlarged in extremely arid-adapted species of Otomyini and Gerbillinae) and on endocranial volume (reduced in high elevation taxa of Otomyini and Peromyscus). However, contrary to our predictions, we did not find evidence of convergence in brain structure to aridity, or in the olfactory/respiratory system (turbinate bones) to high elevation. Brain structure differed, particularly in the petrosal lobules of the cerebellum and the olfactory bulbs, between Otomyini and Gerbillinae, with extreme arid-adapted species in each clade being highly divergent (not convergent) from other species in the same clade. We observed greater "packing" of the maxillary turbinate bones, which have important respiratory functions, in Peromyscus mice from high and low elevations compared to the high-elevation African Praomyini, but more complex patterns within Peromyscus, probably related to trade-offs in respiratory physiology and heat exchange in the nasal epithelium associated with high-elevation adaptation.
   Based on 174 cranial 3D images, when considering allometric and phylogenetic constraints, muroid rodents showed potentially adaptive responses to aridity in the bulla, cochlea, paraflocculi, and olfactory lobes of the brain and to high elevation in endocranial volume and the respiratory turbinate bone of the nasal capsule. image

AB  - Emerging evidence supports the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanism upon how cannabinoids impact brain cognition and AD pathology remains unclear. Here we show that chronic cannabidiol (CBD) administration significantly mitigates cognitive deficiency and hippocampal beta-amyloid (A beta) pathology in 5xFAD mouse model of AD. CBD achieves its curative effect mainly through potentiating the function of inhibitory extrasynaptic glycine receptor (GlyR) in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Based on the in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recording and calcium imaging, CBD mediated anti-AD effects via GlyR are mainly accomplished by decreasing neuronal hyperactivity of granule cells in the DG of AD mice. Furthermore, the AAV-mediated ablation of DG GlyR alpha 1, or the GlyR alpha 1S296A mutation that exclusively disrupts CBD binding, significantly intercepts the anti-AD effect of CBD. These findings suggest a GlyR dependent mechanism underlying the therapeutic potential of CBD in the treatment of AD.

The developed method made it possible to quickly obtain geometries that were very realistic to the original ones as shown in the case study described in the paper. In particular, the application of ShrinkWrap algorithm on the simplify point cloud allowed us to obtain a polygonal mesh model without errors such as holes, non-manifold surfaces, compenetrating surfaces, etc.

AB  - A growing body of evidence shows that cigarette smoking impairs cognitive performance. The 'Calcium Hypothesis' theory of neuronopathies reveals a critical role of aberrant calcium signaling in compromised cognitive functions. However, the underlying implications of abnormalities in calcium signaling in the neurotoxicity induced by cigarette smoke (CS) have not yet been identified. CACNA2D1, an important auxiliary subunit involved in the composition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), was reported to affect the calcium signaling in neurons by facilitating VGCCs-mediated Ca2+ influx. AFOSB, an alternatively-spliced product of the Fosb gene, is an activity-dependent transcription factor induced robustly in the brain in response to environmental stimuli such as CS. Interestingly, our preliminary bioinformatics analysis revealed a significant coexpression between AFOSB and CACNA2D1 in brain tissues of patients with neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Therefore, we hypothesized that the activation of the AFOSB-CACNA2D1 axis in response to CS exposure might cause dysregulation of calcium homeostasis in hippocampal neurons via VGCCs-mediated Ca2+ influx, thereby contributing to cognitive deficits. To this end, the present study established a CS-induced mouse model of hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairment, in which the activation of the AFOSB-CACNA2D1 axis accompanied by severe calcium overload was observed in the mouse hippocampal tissues. More importantly, AFOSB knockdown-/overexpression-mediated inactivation/activation of the AFOSB-CACNA2D1 axis interdicted/mimicked CS-induced dysregulation of calcium homeostasis followed by severe cellular damage in HT22 mouse hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically speaking, a further ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed the physical interaction between transcription factor AFOSB and the Cacna2d1 gene promoter, suggesting a direct transcriptional regulation of the Cacna2d1 gene by AFOSB. Overall, our current work aims to deliver a unique insight into the neurotoxic mechanisms induced by CS to explore potential targets for intervention.

AB  - While many individuals experience traumatic events during their lifetimes, only some go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This susceptibility and resilience to developing PTSD can be modelled in rodents using the stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) procedure, in which rats are exposed to a session of massed, unpredictable footshocks and subsequently assessed on tasks of adaptive fear learning. It has previously been observed that subpopulations of rats are susceptible and resilient to showing the PTSD-like phenotype following SEFL, and that these rats show differences in glutamate receptor expression in the basolateral amygdala. However, it is currently unknown whether structural differences are observed in other brain regions implicated in stress responding and memory. Using the refined SEFL procedure, this study aimed to determine whether expression of GluN2B, GluA1 and GluA2 receptor subunits in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and dorsal hippocampus could be correlated to the SEFL-phenotype or shock experience in male rats. Here we show that following SEFL, differences can be observed in receptor subunit expression in the infralimbic cortex and dorsal hippocampus as a function of shock experience, whilst differences in the prelimbic cortex are associated with susceptibility. Importantly, these structural changes can be observed in male rats that are group-housed and exposed to 13-shocks rather than 15-shocks, indicating that the refined SEFL procedure offers a robust animal analogue of the non-associative fear sensitisation that occurs in PTSD. Future studies using this procedure could pave the way to the eventual development of pharmacological treatments to alleviate or prevent stress-induced psychopathology in susceptible individuals.

AB  - The yield efficiency of transgenic animal generation is relatively low[1]. To improve its efficiency has become a priority task for researchers[2]. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, MD is a potent-free radical scavenger and antioxidant to protect mitochondria, lipids, protein and DNA from oxidative stress[3]. In this study, we observed that improving the quality of both donor and recipient cells by giving physiological concentration (10(-7) M) of MT significantly increase the sheep transgenic embryo development in the in vitro condition. MT promotes the donor cell viability, proliferation, efficiency of monoclonal formation and the electrotransferring efficiency of fetal fibroblast cells (FFCs). The mechanistic exploration indicates that MT has the capacity for the synchronization of cell division cycle, reduction of cellular oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the increase of mitochondrial number and function. All of these render MT's ability to increase the efficiency of animal transgenic processes such as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and electroporation. The outcomes are the increased cleavage rate and blastocyst rate of the transgenic sheep embryos after MT treatment. These beneficial effects of MT on transgenic embryo development are worth to be tested in the in vivo condition in the future.

AB  - As a result of numerous fossil and subfossil finds of ostriches, there is great demand for a comprehensive osteometric dataset for the living species and subspecies of the genus Struthio. We meet this demand by providing a set of > 100 measurements for a sample of 18 sexed skeletons, including all living and recently extinct species and subspecies of ostriches. We provide the first mensural data for two extinct subspecies, the hitherto questioned Struthio camelus spatzi from north-western Africa and the Arabian ostrich, Struthio camelus syriacus. The unique skeletal proportions of S. c. spatzi, with a relatively short wing, broad pelvis, short tarsometatarsus and big third toe, confirm the validity of this taxon and suggest an increased stability at the expense of cursoriality, which might have contributed to its extermination by humans. Our biometric analysis of the entire sample suggests a subtle sexual dimorphism in the ostrich skeleton, with females having more robust limb bones (especially wider and/or deeper at the ends) despite being on average smaller than males. If confirmed by further research, this size-independent dimorphism might reflect the independent regulation of the longitudinal and transverse dimensions of bones as revealed by several independent studies of morphological integration (covariance among morphological traits) in the avian skeleton.

AB  - Simple Summary The effectiveness of genomic selection in pig breeding depends largely on genomic prediction accuracy. The relatively short generation interval and the high selection intensity make the issue of the selection criterion accuracy extremely important. Genotyping animals by SNP markers makes it possible to increase the accuracy of breeding criteria for young replacement animals. However, the applied computational algorithm plays an equally important role, that is, the method of calculating the genomic estimates. The study compared three methods (BLUP AM, ssGBLUP, wssGBLUP) for the assessment of pigs' breeding value according to five main breeding traits. Changes in the accuracy of the genomic estimates obtained by the ssGBLUP and wssGBLUP methods were evaluated using different reference groups. The weighting procedure's reasonableness of application Pwas considered to improve the accuracy of genomic predictions for meat, fattening and reproduction traits in pigs. Six reference groups were formed to assess the genomic data quantity impact on the accuracy of predicted values (groups of genotyped animals). The datasets included 62,927 records of meat and fattening productivity (fat thickness over 6-7 ribs (BF1, mm)), muscle depth (MD, mm) and precocity up to 100 kg (age, days) and 16,070 observations of reproductive qualities (the number of all born piglets (TNB) and the number of live-born piglets (NBA), according to the results of the first farrowing). The wssGBLUP method has an advantage over ssGBLUP in terms of estimation reliability. When using a small reference group, the difference in the accuracy of ssGBLUP over BLUP AM is from -1.9 to +7.3 percent points, while for wssGBLUP, the change in accuracy varies from +18.2 to +87.3 percent points. Furthermore, the superiority of the wssGBLUP is also maintained for the largest group of genotyped animals: from +4.7 to +15.9 percent points for ssGBLUP and from +21.1 to +90.5 percent points for wssGBLUP. However, for all analyzed traits, the number of markers explaining 5% of genetic variability varied from 71 to 108, and the number of such SNPs varied depending on the size of the reference group (79-88 for BF1, 72-81 for MD, 71-108 for age). The results of the genetic variation distribution have the greatest similarity between groups of about 1000 and about 1500 individuals. Thus, the size of the reference group of more than 1000 individuals gives more stable results for the estimation based on the wssGBLUP method, while using the reference group of 500 individuals can lead to distorted results of GEBV.

AB  - Actin cytoskeleton predominantly regulates the formation and maintenance of synapses by controlling dendritic spine morphology and motility. To visualize actin dynamics, actin molecules can be labeled by genetically fusing fluorescent proteins to actin monomers, actin-binding proteins, or single-chain anti-actin antibodies. In the present study, we compared the dendritic effect of EGFP-actin, LifeAct-TagGFP2 (LifeAct-GFP), and Actin-ChromobodyTagGFP2 (AC-GFP) in mouse cultured hippocampal neurons using unbiased quantitative methods. The actin-binding probes LifeAct-GFP and AC-GFP showed similar affinity to Factin, but in contrast to EGFP-actin, they did not reveal subtle changes in actin remodeling between mushroom-shaped spines and filopodia. All tested actin probes colocalized with phalloidin similarly; however, the enrichment of LifeAct-GFP in dendritic spines was remarkably lower compared with the other constructs. LifeAct-GFP expression was tolerated at a higher expression level compared with EGFP-actin and AC-GFP with only subtle differences identified in dendritic spine morphology and protrusion density. While EGFP-actin and LifeAct-GFP expression did not alter dendritic arborization, AC-GFP-expressing neurons displayed a reduced dendritic tree. Thus, although all tested actin probes may be suitable for actin imaging studies, certain limitations should be considered before performing experiments with a particular actin-labeling probe in primary neurons.

AB  - The adaptations of omnivorous insects to food are manifested in a multifaceted manner, and the availability of food resources directly determines insect feeding tendencies, which contribute to a complex insect-food relationship and impact insect functionality in the environment. Stable isotope analysis was applied to test the feeding preference and further define the functional role of omnivorous beetles in cropland. Our results confirmed that as an omnivorous beetle, the fungivorous nature of Notoxus trinotatus accounted for a prominent proportion food selection at the adult stage, and more importantly, this dietary feature contributed to the dispersal of the northern corn leaf blight in maize (NLB) during the feeding trials. In addition to the preference for fungi, water supplementation was an essential element extending adult longevity, which directly prolonged the contact time of adults with pathogenic fungi in agricultural fields. Consistent with the herbivorous characteristics of beetles, before the emergence of NLB fungal pathogens, corn tissues served as the main food, which provided the beetles with more opportunities to transmit fungal pathogen propagules. We conclude that the role of N. trinotatus in carrying NLB pathogen is due to its feeding on this plant mycopathogen, and an increased abundance of beetles carrying the pathogen may increase the rate of NLB disease infestation. More focus should be concentrated on the functions of fungivorous beetles, not only as pathogen-transmitting pests, but also as an element among the balanced biotic factors in farmland.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can induce various difficulties in recognizing emotional facial expressions (EFE), particularly for negative valence emotions. However, these difficulties have not been systematically examined according to the localization of the epileptic focus. For this purpose, we used a forcedchoice recognition task in which faces expressing fear, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, or happiness were presented in different intensity levels from moderate to high intensity. The first objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of emotional intensity on the recognition of different categories of EFE in TLE patients compared to control participants. The second objective was to assess the effect of localization of epileptic focus on the recognition of EFE in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) associated or not with hippocampal sclerosis (HS), or lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE). The results showed that the 272 TLE patients and the 68 control participants were not differently affected by the intensity of EFE. However, we obtained group differences within the clinical population when we took into account the localization of the temporal lobe epileptic focus. As predicted, TLE patients were impaired in recognizing fear and disgust relative to controls. Moreover, the scores of these patients varied according to the localization of the epileptic focus, but not according to the cerebral lateralization of TLE. The facial expression of fear was less well recognized by MTLE patients, with or without HS, and the expression of disgust was less well recognized by LTLE as well as MTLE without HS patients. Moreover, emotional intensity modulated differently the recognition of disgust and surprise of the three patient groups underlying the relevance of using moderate emotional intensity to distinguish the effect of epileptic focus localization. These findings should be taken into account for interpreting the emotional behaviors and deserve to be further investigated before considering TLE surgical treatment or social cognition interventions in TLE patients.

AB  - Acquiring DNA from wild bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) is typically undertaken utilizing highly invasive (but non-lethal) sampling techniques comprising wing biopsies and occasional blood samples. While non-invasive sampling is possible through the extraction of DNA from faecal samples, it is not always possible to acquire samples from individual bats whilst conducting fieldwork, and as such, this method is primarily applicable to roost occupancy identification. Similarly, wing swabbing is liable to cross-contamination from roost mates. Here we present the first use of oral (buccal) swabbing for successful, species-resolution DNA sequencing of Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae in 10 bat species (nine Vespertilionidae and one Rhinolophidae) from the UK.

AB  - BACKGROUND Host plant selection is a key factor affecting the survival, population establishment, and spread of herbivorous insect pests. The pepper weevil is one of the most important pests of cultivated pepper in North America with a capacity to rapidly expand its geographic range, in part through its ability to switch between cultivated and wild Solanaceous host plants. Towards a better management of this pest, this study examined metrics of pepper weevil host use including oviposition preference, development time, and successful offspring emergence on wild Solanaceous species and cultivated pepper cultivars. RESULTS Pepper weevil successfully developed within fruit of several Solanaceous species including eastern black (Solanum ptycanthum) and climbing nightshade (S. dulcamara), in which development time was on average 4 days faster relative to Capsicum annuum cv. jalapeno peppers. Oviposition events occurred in all fruit types assessed and no strong host preference was detected among these. However, the number of emerged offspring was significantly lower than the number of oviposition events in C. chinense cv. habanero pepper fruit. CONCLUSION Although not all nightshade species are suitable hosts for pepper weevil development, those permissive to offspring production do allow for faster development than in C. annuum peppers. While host preference was not detected among fruit types tested, low offspring emergence from fruit with high capsaicin content suggests a reduced ability of pepper weevil to tolerate high concentrations of this metabolite. These findings help elucidate the factors influencing pepper weevil bionomics, and their implications on pepper weevil management are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a severe agricultural crop pest that has developed resistance to most current control methods, requiring the urgent development of novel strategies. Plant proteinase inhibitors (PINs) are small proteins that protect plants against pathogens and/or herbivores, likely by preventing efficient protein digestion. RESULTS: We identified 67 protease genes in the transcriptomes of three M. persicae lineages (USDA-Red, G002 and G006). Comparison of gene expression levels in aphid guts and whole aphids showed that several proteases, including a highly expressed serine protease, are significantly overexpressed in the guts. Furthermore, we identified three genes encoding serine protease inhibitors (SerPIN-II1, 2 and 3) in Nicotiana benthamiana, which is a nonpreferred host for M. persicae. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) with a tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vector and overexpression with a turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) vector, we demonstrated that N. benthamiana SerPIN-II1 and SerPIN-II2 cause reduced survival and growth, but do not affect aphid protein content. Likewise, SerPIN-II3 overexpression reduced survival and growth, and serpin-II3 knockout mutations, which we generated using CRISPR/Cas9, increased survival and growth. Protein content was significantly increased in aphids fed on SerPIN-II3 overexpressing plants, yet it was decreased in aphids fed on serpin-II3 mutants. CONCLUSION: Our results show that three PIN-IIs from N. benthamiana, a nonpreferred host plant, effectively inhibit M. persicae survival and growth, thereby representing a new resource for the development of aphid-resistant crop plants.

AB  - The fertilizer industry in Brazil has been growing at an accelerated pace driven by the increase in The fertilizer industry in Brazil has been growing at an accelerated pace driven by the increase in agribusiness, however this industrial chain involves continuous operation in an aggressive environment, generating stops for corrective maintenance due to the wear and tear of the industrial chain due to corrosion. In recent years, the cost of the industry with maintenance has reached 4% in relation to gross sales. With the objective of reducing this cost and aiming at sustainability, new techniques have been invested to protect the production plant against the severe effects of corrosion, aiming at increasing production, reducing maintenance stops, extending the plant's useful life and decrease in toxic waste. Several studies with extracts of animal and plant origin have been carried out as possible corrosion protection additives for metallic surfaces, as they are considered environmentally correct, forming a film at the corrosive metal-medium interface. This work shows corrosion studies by electrochemical techniques on 1020 steel containing extracts of Struthio Camelus (ostrich), Crolatus Durissus (rattlesnake) and Elaeis Guineensis (palm and palm kernel) in a solution of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) and 3% Urea. The results indicated a significant decrease in the corrosion rates of steel when submitted to 3% Urea in the presence of all extracts, when compared with the results obtained in the presence of 3% NaCl. Carbon steel with Crolatus Durissus extract in Urea 3% showed a corrosion rate of 0.003 mm/year, the best behavior in this medium, followed by Elaeis Guineensis extract, 0.009 nun/year. Steel in the presence of Elaeis Guineensis with 3% NaCl showed a corrosion rate of 0.05 mm/year, being the best result for the medium.

AB  - Sanqi, a traditional Chinese herb, is widely used for cardiovascular diseases, and its neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress were recently discovered. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Sanqi-derived compound K (Sanqi-CK), an active metabolite of Sanqi, could protect melanocytes from oxidative stress. Cultured human primary skin epidermal melanocytes (HEMn-MPs) were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence or absence of Sanqi-CK. Sanqi-CK exhibited protective effects against H2O2-induced cell death by reducing oxidative stress. In addition, treatment with Sanqi-CK reversed the decreased glutathione reductase activity and decreased ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) seen in H2O2-treated melanocytes. Furthermore, topical application of Sanqi-CK alleviated leukoderma in guinea pigs, a disorder characterized by melanocyte cell death resulting from rhododendrol-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest that Sanqi-CK protects melanocytes against oxidative stress, and its protective effects are associated with modulating the redox balance between GSH and GSSG and activating glutathione reductase. Thus, Sanqi-CK may be a good candidate for preventing melanocyte loss in oxidative-stress-associated pigmentary disorders.

AB  - Genomic prediction, which is based on solving linear mixed-model (LMM) equations, is the most popular method for predicting breeding values or phenotypic performance for economic traits in livestock. With the need to further improve the performance of genomic prediction, nonlinear methods have been considered as an alternative and promising approach. The excellent ability to predict phenotypes in animal husbandry has been demonstrated by machine learning (ML) approaches, which have been rapidly developed. To investigate the feasibility and reliability of implementing genomic prediction using nonlinear models, the performances of genomic predictions for pig productive traits using the linear genomic selection model and nonlinear machine learning models were compared. Then, to reduce the high-dimensional features of genome sequence data, different machine learning algorithms, including the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, were used to perform genomic feature selection as well as genomic prediction on reduced feature genome data. All of the analyses were processed on two real pig datasets: the published PIC pig dataset and a dataset comprising data from a national pig nucleus herd in Chifeng, North China. Overall, the accuracies of predicted phenotypic performance for traits T1, T2, T3 and T5 in the PIC dataset and average daily gain (ADG) in the Chifeng dataset were higher using the ML methods than the LMM method, while those for trait T4 in the PIC dataset and total number of piglets born (TNB) in the Chifeng dataset were slightly lower using the ML methods than the LMM method. Among all the different ML algorithms, SVM was the most appropriate for genomic prediction. For the genomic feature selection experiment, the most stable and most accurate results across different algorithms were achieved using XGBoost in combination with the SVM algorithm. Through feature selection, the number of genomic markers can be reduced to 1 in 20, while the predictive performance on some traits can even be improved compared to using the full genome data. Finally, we developed a new tool that can be used to execute combined XGBoost and SVM algorithms to realize genomic feature selection and phenotypic prediction.

AB  - Tea plant, an important beverage crop, is cultivated worldwide. Lignification can improve the hardness of tea plant, which is of great significance for tea quality. Jasmonates (JAs) and cytokinin are plant hormones that control processes of plant development and secondary metabolite accumulation. Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) is primarily involved in lignin biosynthesis. The effects of exogenous application of JAs and cytokinin on lignin biosynthesis and related HCT gene expression profiles in tea plants are still unclear. In order to investigate the effects of exogenous JAs and cytokinin on lignin accumulation, anatomical structures, and CsHCT gene profiles in tea plants, we treated tea plants with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and cytokinin (6-BA). MeJA and 6-BA treatments triggered the lignification at 6 and 12 d in tea leaves. The combined treatment resulted in an increase in lignin content at 6 d, which was 1.32 times of that at 0 d for 'Mengshan 9.' The CsHCTs in clade 2 (CsHCT5, CsHCT6, CsHCT7, and CsHCT8) were mainly expressed in leaves. We found that exogenous MeJA and cytokinin might be able to antagonistically regulate tea plant lignin accumulation through the mediation of CsHCT expression. This study revealed that HCTs play potential important roles involved in lignin biosynthesis of tea plant development and hormonal stimuli.

AB  - Low-temperature stress limits global tea planting areas and production efficiency. Light is another essential ecological factor that acts in conjunction with temperature in the plant life cycle. However, it is unclear whether the differential light environment affects the low temperature adaptability of tea plant (Camellia sect. Thea). In this study, tea plant materials in three groups of light intensity treatments showed differentiated characteristics for low-temperature adaptability. Strong light (ST, 240 & mu;mol & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;s(-1)) caused the degradation of chlorophyll and a decrease in peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities, as well as an increase in soluble sugar, soluble protein, malondialdehyde (MDA), and relative conductivity in tea leaves. In contrast, antioxidant enzyme activities, chlorophyll content, and relative conductivity were highest in weak light (WT, 15 & mu;mol & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;s(-1)). Damage was observed in both ST and WT materials relative to moderate light intensity (MT, 160 & mu;mol & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;s(-1)) in a frost resistance test. Chlorophyll degradation in strong light was a behavior that prevented photodamage, and the maximum photosynthetic quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm) decreased with increasing light intensity. This suggests that the browning that occurs on the leaf surface of ST materials through frost may have been stressed by the previous increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Frost intolerance of WT materials is mainly related to delayed tissue development and tenderness holding. Interestingly, transcriptome sequencing revealed that stronger light favors starch biosynthesis, while cellulose biosynthesis is enhanced in weaker light. It showed that light intensity mediated the form of carbon fixation in tea plant, and this was associated with low-temperature adaptability.

AB  - Camellia oleifera, an important tree species and source of edible oil in China, has received significant attention owing to the oil's high unsaturated fatty acid content, which has benefits for human health. However, the mechanisms underlying C. oleifera yield and oil quality are largely unknown. In this study, 180 F1 progenies were obtained from two parents with obvious differences in fruit- and oil-related traits. We constructed a high-density genetic map using a double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-Seq) strategy in C. oleifera. This map spanned 3327 cM and anchored 2780 markers in 15 linkage groups (LGs), with an average marker interval of 1.20 cM. A total of 221 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with fruit- and oil-related traits were identified across three years' worth of phenotypic data. Nine QTLs were detected simultaneously in at least two different years, located on LG02, LG04, LG05, LG06, and LG11, and explained 8.5-16.6% of the phenotypic variation in the corresponding traits, respectively. Seventeen major QTLs were obtained that explained 13.0-16.6% of the phenotypic variance. Eleven and five flanking SNPs of major QTLs for fruit- and oil-related traits were detected which could be used for marker-assisted selection in C. oleifera breeding programs. Furthermore, 202 potential candidate genes in QTL regions were identified based on the collinearity of the genetic map and the C. oleifera "CON" genome. A potential regulatory network controlling fruit development and oil biosynthesis was constructed to dissect the complex mechanism of oil accumulation. The dissection of these QTLs will facilitate the gene cloning underlying lipid synthesis and increase our understanding in order to enhance C. oleifera oil yield and quality.

AB  - A field study was conducted from 0 to 360 days to investigate the effect of tea pruning litter biochar (TPLBC) on the accumulation of major micronutrients (copper: Cu, manganese: Mn, and zinc: Zn) in soil, their uptake by tea plant (clone: S.3 A/3) and level of contamination in soil due to TPLBC. To evaluate the level of contamination due to TPLBC, a soil pollution assessment was carried out using the geo-accumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF), potential ecological risk factor (PERF), individual contamination factor (ICF), and risk assessment code (RAC). The total content of Cu, Mn, and Zn gradually increased with increasing doses of TPLBC at 0D, and then decreased with time. The fractionation of the three micronutrients in soil changed after the application of TPLBC. The contamination risk assessment of soil for Cu, Mn, and Zn based on the Igeo, EF, CF, PERF, ICF, and RAC suggested that the application of TPLBC does not have any adverse effect on soil. Except for Mn, the bioconcentration and translocation factors were less than one for Cu and Zn. Results from this study revealed that the application of 400 kg TPLBC ha-1 is significantly better than the other treatments for Cu, Mn, and Zn at a 5% level of significance.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Flowers from Styrax japonicus sieb. et Zucc. have been used as a Chinese folk medicine to alleviate pain such as toothache and sore throat. Aim of the study: To testify the analgesic effect of flowers from Styrax japonicus, analyze components of the active fraction, and investigate the mechanism of analgesia. Materials and methods: Flower extracts were obtained by ethanol, petroleum ether and hydrodistillation extraction. Different fractions of ethanol extracts (EE) were isolated by silica gel column chromatography and preparative liquid chromatography. Analgesic effects of EE, petroleum ether extracts (PEE), hydrodistillation extracts (HDE), and fractions of EE were evaluated using hot plate, acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin tests on mice. Components of the active fraction 1 (F1) were determined by the ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography Q extractive mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QE-MS). Anti-inflammatory and sedative effects involving analgesic mechanisms were evaluated by carrageenan induced hind paw oedema and pentobarbital sodium sleep tests, respectively. In addition, antagonists including naloxone hydrochloride (NXH), flumazenil (FM), SCH23390 (SCH) and WAY100635 (WAY) were used to investigate the possible mechanism of analgesia. Contents of neurotransmitters and relevant metabolites in different brain regions of mice were also quantified by the ultraperformance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector (UPLC-FLD). Results: EE rather than PEE and HDE at medium and high doses (150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the latency time of the response of mice to the thermal stimulation in the hot plate test. Moreover, EE significantly decreased number of writhes in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, and reduced licking time in both two phases of the formalin test in a dose-dependent manner. The F1 (50 mg/kg) showed effective antinociceptive responses in all mice models. However, fraction 2 (F2) and fraction 3 (F3) at 50 mg/kg performed no analgesic action. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, pinoresinol-4-O-glucoside, forsythin and arctiin were identified from components of the F1. Furthermore, F1 (50 mg/kg) did not significantly affect hind paw oedema of mice induced by carrageenan but significantly shortened sleep latency and increased sleep duration in the pentobarbital sodium sleep test. In addition, the antinociceptive response of F1 was not affected by NXH in two mice models, but significantly blocked by FM and WAY in the hot plate test. In the formalin test, FM avoided the effect of F1 only in the first phase, while the analgesic activity of F1 was totally suppressed by WAY in both two phases. Otherwise, contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) increased significantly in hippocampus and striatum of mice in the F1 group. Conclusion: EE from flowers of Styrax japonicus, and F1, the active part isolated from EE, showed significant antinociceptive activities. The analgesic effect of F1 appeared to be related to the sedative effect, partially mediated by the GABAergic system, and highly involved in the serotonergic system. This was the first study confirming the analgesic effect of Styrax japonicus flower, which provided a candidate for the development of non-opioid analgesics.

AB  - RXLR effectors are pathogenic factors secreted from oomycetes to manipulate the immunity of the host. Typical RXLR effectors contain an RXLR-dEER motif at the N-terminus, whereas atypical RXLRs show variations on this motif. The oomycete Phytophthora cactorum is known to infect over 200 plant species, resulting in significant agricultural economic losses. Although genome-wide identification and functional analyses of typical RXLRs from P. cactorum have been performed, little is known of atypical PcaRXLRs. Here, we identified RXLRs, both typical and atypical, in P. cactorum and compared them with those of other oomycete pathogens. Fewer RXLRs were identified in P. cactorum compared with other Phytophthora species, possibly due to fewer duplication events of RXLRs. In contrast, the percentage of atypical RXLRs was higher in P. cactorum than in other species, suggesting significant roles in P. cactorum pathogenesis. Analysis of RXLR gene expression showed that most were transcribed, suggesting their functionality. Transient expression of two atypical RXLRs in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that they induced necrosis dependent on host SGT1 and HSP90. Furthermore, two additional atypical RXLRs suppressed the defense response in N. benthamiana and promoted P. cactorum infection. These results demonstrate the vital role of atypical RXLRs in P. cactorum and provide valuable information on their evolutionary patterns and interactions with host plants.

AB  - In addition to its association with milk protein synthesis via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, JAK2 also affects milk fat synthesis. However, to date, there have been no reports on the effect of JAK2 on ovine mammary epithelial cells (OMECs), which directly determine milk yield and milk contents. In this study, the coding sequence (CDS) region of ovine JAK2 was cloned and identified and its tissue expression and localization in ovine mammary glands, as well as its effects on the viability, proliferation, and milk fat and casein levels of OMECs, were also investigated. The CDS region of ovine JAK2, 3399 bp in length, was cloned and its authenticity was validated by analyzing its sequence similarity with JAK2 sequences from other animal species using a phylogenetic tree. JAK2 was found to be expressed in six ovine tissues, with the highest expression being in the mammary gland. Over-expressed JAK2 and three groups of JAK2 interference sequences were successfully transfected into OMECs identified by immunofluorescence staining. When compared with the negative control (NC) group, the viability of OMECs was increased by 90.1% in the pcDNA3.1-JAK2 group. The over-expression of JAK2 also increased the number and ratio of EdU-labeled positive OMECs, as well as the expression levels of three cell proliferation marker genes. These findings show that JAK2 promotes the viability and proliferation of OMECs. Meanwhile, the triglyceride content in the over-expressed JAK2 group was 2.9-fold higher than the controls and the expression levels of four milk fat synthesis marker genes were also increased. These results indicate that JAK2 promotes milk fat synthesis. Over-expressed JAK2 significantly up-regulated the expression levels of casein alpha s2 (CSN1S2), casein beta (CSN2), and casein kappa (CSN3) but down-regulated casein alpha s1 (CSN1S1) expression. In contrast, small interfered JAK2 had the opposite effect to JAK2 over-expression on the viability, proliferation, and milk fat and milk protein synthesis of OMECs. In summary, these results demonstrate that JAK2 promotes the viability, proliferation, and milk fat synthesis of OMECs in addition to regulating casein expression in these cells. This study contributes to a better comprehension of the role of JAK2 in the lactation performance of sheep.

AB  - It is well established that rats exposed to inflammation during pregnancy or the perinatal period have an increased chance of developing schizophrenia-like symptoms and behaviors, and people with schizophrenia also have raised levels of inflammatory markers. Therefore, there is evidence supporting the idea that antiinflammatory drugs may have therapeutic benefits. Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has anti-inflammatory properties and is used clinically to treat inflammatory and painful processes such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, making it a potential candidate for preventive or adjunctive therapy in schizophrenia. This study therefore examined the effect of aceclofenac in a maternal immune activation model of schizophrenia, in which polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) (8 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to pregnant rat dams. Young female rat pups received daily aceclofenac (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, i.p., n = 10) between postnatal day 56 and 76. The effects of aceclofenac were compared with assessment of behavioral tests and ELISA results. During the postnatal days (PNDs) 73-76, behavioral tests were conducted in rats, and on PND 76, ELISA tests were performed to examine the changes in Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), Brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nestin levels. Aceclofenac treatment reversed deficits in prepulse inhibition, novel object recognition, social interaction, and locomotor activity tests. In addition, aceclofenac administration decreased TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In contrast, BDNF and nestin levels did not change significantly during treatment with aceclofenac. Taken together, these results suggest that aceclofenac may be an alternative therapeutic adjunctive strategy to improve the clinical expression of schizophrenia in the further studies.

AB  - The breed of dairy sheep is an important factor affecting milk quality. The aim of this study is to identify the fatty acids (FA) and indices of lipid quality of milk fat in two indigenous Saudi sheep breeds. In this study, thirty-one multiparous ewes of Najdi (n=16) and Awassi (n=15) were examined. The breeds were kept under identical conditions and provided with the same feed (alfalfa hay and commercial pellets). After weaning at 9 to 12 weeks, ewes were milked twice daily until the end of lactation. Duplicate samples were taken from each ewe at weeks 9 and 10 for analysis of FA using a GC mass spectrometer. The collected data were analyzed using the SAS 9.4 program as a general liner modal (GLM) method. Najdi ewes produced more milk than Awassi ewes (0.75 vs. 0.63 L/day; P <= 0.01), while milk components were not influenced by breed. The milk fat of Awassi ewes had higher content of saturated fatty acids (SFA: 59.2%), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA: 35.9%), and polyunsaturated fatty acid, (PUFA: 5.06%). Compared to the Najdi breed, the milk from Awassi ewes had a higher of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), content with values of 0.72% compared to 0.56% in the milk of Najdi ewes. The atherogenic and thrombogenic indices of milk fat varied between 1.52% and 1.79% with sufficiently low values (less than 3%). The milk fat of the Awassi breed had a higher omega-3 (n3) ratio (0.94 vs. 0.54%), a lower n6/n3 ratio (3.77 vs. 7.39%) and a lower Hypocholesterolemia index value (33.6 vs. 36.9%) compared to Najdi's milk fat. These results showed that breed had a significant impact on milk quality, particularly essential fatty acids (CLA and ALA). The importance of selecting the Awassi breed in sheep breeding for the production of the milk with a slightly more favorable FA and lipid quality. This milk can potentially contribute to a healthier diet and improve the overall well-being of consumers.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play an important role in the acquisition of phosphorus (P) by plants. The external hyphae of AM fungi function as an extension of plant roots and may downregulate related functions in the roots. It is not clear whether the ability of AM fungi to mineralize organic P affects root phosphatase activities. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of Funneliformis mosseae on soil organic P mineralization under phytate application and to explore root phosphatase activities, P uptake, and growth in Camellia oleifera Abel. The plants and their growth substrates were harvested 4 and 8 months after planting. The results showed that organic P application had no effect on the total dry mass of nonmycorrhizal plants, but differences in dry mass under P application were observed in mycorrhizal plants in both harvests. Inoculation with F. mosseae increased soil acid phosphatase, phytase, and alkaline phosphatase activities and reduced the soil organic P content. Mycorrhizal plants had higher root activity, shoot and root P contents and root acid phosphatase and phytase activities than nonmycorrhizal plants irrespective of organic P application. In conclusion, AM fungi enhanced the mineralization of soil organic P and positively affect root phosphatase activities.

AB  - The relationship between body mass and the respiratory microenvironment of burrowing animals is examined using artificial burrows containing surrogate animals that simulate O-2 consumption by removal of air and simultaneous replacement with N-2. Allometric relationships between body mass and burrow radius, nest chamber radius, and O-2 consumption rate show that published mathematical predictions of diffusion-mediated gas exchange are adequate to describe the respiratory environments of animals in small blind-ending burrows through porous substrata. Diffusion is sufficient to ventilate burrows containing small mammals weighing less than 340 g, or subterranean nest chambers connected to the surface by one or more tunnels containing mammals weighing less than 30 kg. Outside of these limits, convection prevails and prevents the development of hypoxic conditions, particularly in burrows of mammals weighing more than 1300 g.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal welfare assessment is an essential tool for maintaining positive animal wellbeing. Validated welfare assessment protocols have been developed for farm, laboratory, zoo, and companion animals, including horses in managed care. However, wild and free-roaming equines have received relatively little attention, despite populations being found worldwide. In the UK, free-roaming ponies inhabit areas of Exmoor, Dartmoor, and New Forest, England, and Snowdonia National Park in Wales, amongst others. Visitors and local members of the public who encounter free-roaming ponies occasionally raise concerns about their welfare, as they are not provided with additional food, water, or shelter. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility, reliability, and repeatability of welfare indicators that can be applied to a population of free-roaming Carneddau Mountain ponies to address such concerns. Our findings indicate that many of the trialed indicators were successfully repeated and had good levels of inter-assessor reliability. Reliable and repeatable welfare indicators for free-roaming and semi free-roaming ponies will enable population managers and conservation grazing schemes to manage the welfare of free-roaming horses and ponies. Validated assessment protocols have been developed to quantify welfare states for intensively managed sport, pleasure, and working horses. There are few protocols for extensively managed or free-roaming populations. Here, we trialed welfare indicators to ascertain their feasibility, reliability, and repeatability using free-roaming Carneddau Mountain ponies as an example population. The project involved (1) the identification of animal and resource-based measures of welfare from both the literature and discussion with an expert group; (2) testing the feasibility and repeatability of a modified body condition score and mobility score on 34 free-roaming and conservation grazing Carneddau Mountain ponies; and (3) testing a prototype welfare assessment template comprising 12 animal-based and 6 resource-based welfare indicators, with a total of 20 questions, on 35 free-roaming Carneddau Mountain ponies to quantify inter-assessor reliability and repeatability. This pilot study revealed that many of the indicators were successfully repeatable and had good levels of inter-assessor reliability. Some of the indicators could not be verified for reliability due to low/absent occurrence. The results indicated that many animal and resource-based indicators commonly used in intensively managed equine settings could be measured in-range with minor modifications. This study is an initial step toward validating a much-needed tool for the welfare assessment of free-roaming and conservation grazing ponies.

AB  - The environment outside the Earth's protective magnetosphere is a much more threatening and complex space environment. The dominant causes for radiation exposure, solar particle events and galactic cosmic rays, contain high-energy protons. In space, astronauts need healthy and highly functioning cognitive abilities, of which the hippocampus plays a key role. Therefore, understanding the effects of H-1 exposure on hippocampal-dependent cognition is vital for developing mitigative strategies and protective countermeasures for future missions. To investigate these effects, we subjected 6-month-old female CD1 mice to 0.75 Gy fractionated H-1 (250 MeV) whole-body irradiation at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory. The cognitive performance of the mice was tested 3 months after irradiation using Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. Both sham-irradiated and H-1-irradiated mice significantly preferred exploration of the novel arm compared to the familiar and start arms, indicating intact spatial and short-term memory. Both groups statistically spent more time in the target quadrant, indicating spatial memory retention. There were no significant differences in neurogenic and gliogenic cell counts after irradiation. In addition, proteomic analysis revealed no significant upregulation or downregulation of proteins related to behavior, neurological disease, or neural morphology. Our data suggests H-1 exposure does not impair hippocampal-dependent spatial or short-term memory in female mice.

AB  - ` The aim of this study was to clean up toxic element polluted soil in Madaka, Niger State, Nigeria. Standard techniques were used to determine the soil physicochemical properties. To aid the plants (Melissa officinalis L and Sida acuta) during the remediation process, standard methods were used to make chicken dropping vermicompost and goat manure vermicompost. M. officinalis L mopped up toxic elements in the first location (Angwan Kawo), with concentrations of cadmium, arsenic, and lead ranging from 0.007 to 0.33 mg/kg, 0.09 to 4.39 mg/kg, and 0.07 to 10.35 mg/kg, respectively, while toxic elements, cadmium, arsenic, and lead in S. acuta, ranged from 0.002 to 0.43 mg/kg, 0.27 to 3.79 mg/ kg, and 1.68 to 10.7 mg/kg, respectively. The two plants mopped up toxic elements at different rates in the second location of the polluted soil (Angwan Magiro). Cadmium, arsenic, and lead concentrations in M. officinalis L ranged from 0.03 to 0.41 mg/kg, 0.65 to 4.65 mg/kg, and 1.93 to 11.49 mg/kg, respectively, while toxic element concentrations in S. acuta ranged from 0.06 to 0.66 mg/kg, 0.68 to 4.64 mg/kg, and 1.53 to 11.53 mg/kg, respectively. Melissa officinalis L and Sida acuta were found to be the most suitable plants for phytoextraction of toxic element-contaminated sites because their bioconcentration factor, translocation factor, and biological accumulation coefficient were all greater than one (> 1), and both plants had bioconcentration and translocation factor < 1; they were also classified as phytostabilizers. As a result, the plants could be used to clean up Madaka soil polluted with toxic element.

AB  - Secondary hair follicles (SHFs) produce the thermoregulatory cashmere of goats. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play indispensable roles in hair follicle formation and growth. However, most studies examining miRNAs related to cashmere have been performed on goat skin. It remains unclear which miRNAs are highly expressed in SHFs or how miRNAs affect cashmere growth. In the present study, we isolated the SHFs under a dissecting microscope and analyzed the miRNA signatures during annual cashmere growth. Small-RNA sequencing followed by genome-wide expression analysis revealed that early anagen is a crucial phase for miRNA regulation of the cashmere growth, as revealed by two predominant groups of miRNAs. Although they exhibited opposite expression patterns, both groups demonstrated sharp changes of expression when in transit from early anagen to mid-anagen. In addition, we identified 96 miRNA signatures that were differentially expressed between different phases among 376 miRNAs. Functional analysis of the predicted target genes of highly expressed or differentially expressed miRNAs indicated that these miRNAs were involved in signal pathways associated with SHF development, regeneration, and regression. Furthermore, miR-143-3p was preferentially expressed in SHFs and Itga6 was identified as one of targets. The dual-luciferase and in situ hybridization assay demonstrated that miR-143-3p directly repressed the expression of Itga6, suggesting a possible novel role for miR-143-3p in cashmere growth.

AB  - Long-term high-energy intake has detrimental effects on pig health and elevates the risk of metabolic disease. RNA editing modifying RNA bases in a post-transcriptional process has been extensively studied for model animals. However, less evidence is available that RNA editing plays a role in the development of metabolic disorders. Here, we profiled the A-to-I editing in three tissues and six gut segments and characterized the functional aspect of editing sites in model pigs for metabolic disorders. We detected 64,367 non-redundant A-to-I editing sites across the pig genome, and 20.1% correlated with their located genes' expression. The largest number of A-to-I sites was found in the abdominal aorta with the highest editing levels. The significant difference in editing levels between high-energy induced and control pigs was detected in the abdominal aorta, testis, duodenum, ileum, colon, and cecum. We next focused on 6041 functional A-to-I sites that detected differences or specificity between treatments. We found functional A-to-I sites specifically involved in a tissue-specific manner. Two of them, located in gene SLA-DQB1 and near gene B4GALT5 were found to be shared by three tissues and six gut segments. Although we did not find them enriched in each of the gene features, in correlation analysis, we noticed that functional A-to-I sites were significantly enriched in gene 3 '-UTRs. This result indicates, in general, A-to-I editing has the largest potential in the regulation of gene expression through changing the 3 '-UTRs' sequence, which is functionally involved in pigs under a long-term high-energy diet. Our work provides valuable knowledge of A-to-I editing sites functionally involved in the development of the metabolic disorder.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the protein requirements of growing Fuxing pig, and to provide basic parameters for determining the feeding standards of growing Fuxing pig. In this experiment, a single factor randomized block design was used, and forty healthy weaned pigs with a body weight of (20.45 +/- 1.65kg) were randomly selected and divided into 4 groups, with 10 pigs in each group. Each group was fed diets with CP levels (CP12, CP14, CP16, CP18) during the 67 days feeding trail, the 7 days preliminary experimental period and the 60 days experimental period. Three healthy pigs were randomly selected from each group. Before the last 7 days of the experiment, all urine and feces were collected to determine the nutritional digestibility and metabolic. The results showed that the addition of CP16 to the diet could reduce the F/G. The CP16 group decreased by 8%, 6.9%, and 3.7% compared with that of the CP12, CP14, and CP18 groups, respectively. There was no difference between the CP16 and CP18 groups (P>0.05). The digestibility of EE in the CP16 and CP18 groups was significantly higher than that in the CP12 group (P <= 0.05). There was no significant difference between the CP14, CP16, and CP18 groups (P>0.05). With the increase of the crude protein level, the digestibility of EE in the CP, DCP (digestible crude protein) CP16 and CP18 groups was significantly higher than that of the CP12 group, CP14 group (P <= 0.01), CP16 group. In the case of the CP12 group and the CP14 group, NI (nitrogen intake), UN (urine nitrogen), RN (retention nitrogen), N%, were all significantly higher. To sum, Fuxing pig DCP intake was used as the dependent variable (Y) and ADG as the independent variable (X) for linear regression analysis. The digestible CP requirement the regression equation with Fuxing pig's growing period was as follows: DCP=1.93 W-0.75+0.34 Delta W (DCP: g/d;W-0.75: kg;Delta W: g/d)<bold>.</bold>

AB  - Background: The biosafety of gene therapy products remains a major challenge to their introduction into the clinic. In particular, the problem of immunogenicity of viral vectors is the focus of attention. Large animals such as pigs, whose anatomical and physiological characteristics are similar to those of humans, have an advantage in testing vector systems. Methods: We performed a comprehensive in vitro and in vivo study to evaluate the biosafety of a chimeric adenoviral vector carrying a green fluorescent protein gene (Ad5/35F-GFP) in a mini-pig model. Results: Transcriptome and secretome analyses of mini-pig leucocytes transduced with Ad5/35F-GFP revealed changes restraining pro-inflammatory processes and cytokine production. No adverse effects were revealed through the clinical, instrumental, laboratory, and histological examinations conducted within a week after the direct or autologous leucocyte-mediated administration of Ad5/35F-GFP to mini-pigs. The decrease in cytokine levels in the blood of experimental animals is also consistent with the in vitro data and confirms the immune tolerance of mini-pigs to Ad5/35F-GFP. Conclusions: Here, we show the safety of Ad5/35F in a mini-pig model and provide evidence that Ad5/35F is a promising vector for gene therapy. These results advance our understanding of vector-host interactions and offer a solid foundation for the clinical application of this vector.

AB  - Spatial cognition is used by most organisms to navigate their environment. Some species rely particularly heavily on specialized spatial cognition to survive, suggesting that a heritable component of cognition may be under natural selection. This idea remains largely untested outside of humans, perhaps because cognition in general is known to be strongly affected by learning and experience.(1-4) We investigated the genetic basis of individual variation in spatial cognition used by non-migratory food-caching birds to recover food stores and survive harsh montane winters. Comparing the genomes of wild, free-living birds ranging from best to worst in their performance on a spatial cognitive task revealed significant associations with genes involved in neuron growth and development and hippocampal function. These results identify candidate genes associated with differences in spatial cognition and provide a critical link connecting individual variation in spatial cognition with natural selection.

AB  - Silicon (Si) accumulation in plants is widely recognised as an effective physical defence against chewing herbivores. However, its effects on some feeding guilds such as cell-content feeders are understudied despite being severe economic pests (e.g. Tetranychus urticae). Moreover, most studies focus on direct impacts of Si, but there is growing evidence that Si also impacts indirect defence. We examined the effects of Si on French bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, defences against the two-spotted spider mite, T. urticae. We grew plants hydroponically with (+ Si) or without (-Si) silicon, assessed T. urticae performance and tested the preference of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, for volatiles from T. urticae-infested (+ M) or uninfested (-M) plants. The provision of Si to plants suppressed T. urticae egg-laying, population growth and leaflet damage, and partially ameliorated T. urticae-induced reductions in stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis. Furthermore, T. urticae infestation increased foliar Si accumulation. Predatory mites were more attracted (64%) to volatiles from + Si plants experiencing herbivory than to -Si plants. The relative emissions (%) of volatile compounds, viz. E-2-hexanyl benzoate, hexanal, E-trans-beta-ocimene, D-limonene, beta-caryophyllene and methyl salicylate were elevated from + Si + M plants, while the relative emissions of 3-hexanol, trans-calamenene, o-xylene and o-cymene were lowered compared to -Si + M plants. Our results show, for the first time, that Si defences are inducible and effective even in low Si-accumulating plants against T. urticae and suggest that Si could play a role in pest biocontrol.

AB  - The investigation of small lunar craters holds scientific and engineering significance. This article presents a novel method for detecting small lunar craters. It consists of three stages: seed detection, candidate crater detection, and crater evaluation. First, crater seeds are identified through morphological operations as pixels with the highest local gradient and specific gradient direction. Second, the optimal scale for each seed is estimated based on the maximum response of the established phase congruency maximum moment (PCMM) scale space. For detecting very small craters, a crater detector called statistical morphological constraint path-sets (SMPS), which leverages image spatial domain features, is proposed. It configures the image as a weighted directed graph, using path-sets centered on seeds to flexibly detect highlights and shadow regions of craters. For detecting craters with larger optimal scale, another crater detector named structural consistency constrained multipaths (SCMP) is proposed, utilizing the frequency phase features. The core idea of SCMP is to configure the phase feature type (PFT) map with the optimal scale as a directed graph. Centered on the seed, the multipath operator is designed to detect craters. Unsupervised discriminative correlation filters (UDCFs) are trained with histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features from images or PFT maps to validate candidate craters. The results indicate that for images with a resolution of 0.5-2 m/pixel, the proposed method demonstrates good detection performance for small craters with diameters of less than 5, 5-10 m, and greater than 10 m, with an average detection rate (DR) of 0.89, 0.91, and 0.92, respectively.

AB  - Transforming growth factor (TGF)-81 is an important multifunctional cytokine in the TGF-8 signaling pathway, which is involved in the molecular regulation of multiple activities, including follicle development and ovulation in female reproductive physiology. However, the biological function of TGF-81 in follicular development and in regulating the proliferation or apoptosis of granulosa cells in small tail Han sheep remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of TGF-81 in the ovary at the follicular stage in small tail Han sheep. We further examined the effects of TGF-81 on the viability, proliferation, and apoptosis of granulosa cells. Differential expression of TGF-81 at the mRNA and protein levels was detected in the ovaries between the beginning of estrus and at preovulation. Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling, and flow cytometry assays showed that adding 5 and 10 ng/mL TGF-81 could improve the viability and growth rate, reduce the apoptosis rate, and reduce the expression level of the pro-apoptotic factor Bcl-2-modifying factor (BMF) in granulosa cells. Treatment of 10 ng/mL TGF-81 at all time points (except 72 h) significantly increased the positive rate of EdU labeling compared to that of the control group. RNA interference of SMAD4 reversed the decreased apoptosis rate caused by stimulation with 10 ng/mL TGF-81, accompanied by a corresponding increase in the BMF expression level. Collectively, these results indicate that TGF-81 plays a role in the ovarian follicular-phase activity of small tail Han sheep by inhibiting the apoptosis of sheep granulosa cells through the SMAD4/BMF pathway to promote proliferation and vitality. This study provides new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying TGF-81 function regulation in granulosa cells, suggests a new target for the regulation of follicle development, and expands the new field of animal reproduction regulation technology.

AB  - Plants have a variety of defense mechanisms that are often induced following attacks by herbivores; this benefits those plants by decreasing performance or preference of herbivores that attack the plants later. We investigated the effects of previous exposure of plants to the safflower aphid, Uroleucon carthami, cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, and mechanical wounding on subsequent safflower aphid infestations using commercial safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) cultivars and wild safflower species (C. oxyacantha). The experiments were conducted in a greenhouse with two treatments: previously induced plants via direct herbivory or mechanical wounding, and control plants that had never experienced herbivory. To test the performance of safflower aphid on different plant treatments, five unwinged aphids were placed on each plant and allowed to reproduce for 14 days. Finally, the total numbers of aphids on each plant were counted and the percentage of produced winged individuals was calculated. The number of aphids on plants that were previously infested or injured was significantly lower than in control plants. Percentage of winged aphids was significantly higher on induced plants, which is an indicator for unsuitable conditions. Also, significant increase in total phenolic content and hydrogen peroxide was observed in induced plants, showing that the levels of these compounds were either treatment, cultivar and/or genotype x treatment dependent, highlighting the specificity of these interactions. Overall, among the safflower cultivars the lowest number of aphids and the highest percentage of winged aphid individuals were observed on Mahali-Isfahan cultivar and wild safflower, showing that this cultivar is more sensitive to herbivory and/or responds to it more than other cultivars. These findings could contribute to a better utilization of induced defense in the integrated pest management of safflower fields.

AB  - Strategies that motivate agrifood producers to adopt more sustainable practices are a critical component for a sustainable future. This case study examines farmer attitudes to a recently released New Zealand agricultural policy aimed at improving freshwater quality by restricting agricultural activities. Our study interprets interviews of nine individuals managing a range of dairy and sheep farming operations to explore how these farmers manage societal expectations of being a 'good farmer' in the context of the new regulations. Four themes were developed to capture perceptions of participants: the vested interest of farmers in positive community engagement and being seen as a 'good' farmer; the need to manage farms prudently for future generations; the unique geographical and environmental conditions on each farm and their concerns about the lack of acknowledgment of differences across land types in New Zealand; and the unintended consequences of the new regulations for rural communities. Overall, the themes suggest that the way the policy was enacted conflicts with perceptions of a 'good farmer' and good farming practice, resulting in identity conflicts for the farming community and reduced motivation to adopt alternative practices.

AB  - Due to its high productivity, bovine confinement systems generate high volumes of waste that, when handled poorly, cause numerous environmental problems. One way to avoid such problems is anaerobic biodigestion, an efficient process used in manure treatment, resulting in biogas and biofertilizer as by-products. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of the application of a biofertilizer originated from the biodigestion of wastewater from dairy cattle activities to produce the forage grass Pennisetum purpureum (elephant grass-BRS Capiacu). The experiments were carried out in an experimental field belonging to Embrapa-Gado de Leite, located in the municipality of Coronel Pacheco, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from March to October 2018. Different biofertilizer doses (0, 24, 48 and 72 mm layers) were applied to the elephant grass crop and mean plant height, green and dry mass, productivity, dry matter content, lignin, neutral detergent fibers and acid detergent fibers were determined. Changes in soil fertility at the end of the second cycle after the biofertilizer application were observed. When the biofertilizer was applied at the highest dose, increased forage grass productivity and CO2 fixation were noted, although no significant effect on the assessed nutritional variables was observed.

AB  - To evaluate the molybdenum (Mo)-induced changes of intestinal morphology and the relationship of intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins expression and intestinal barrier function, a total of 20 healthy sheep were randomly divided into five groups of four: 0, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg BW/day Na2MoO4 center dot 2H(2)O were administrated in five groups named control group, Mo 5 group, Mo 10 group, Mo 20 group, and Mo 50 group, respectively. After 28 days of Mo treatment, the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum tissue were collected. The histopathology and the developmental parameters were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The intestinal epithelial cell DNA damage was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. The intestinal glycoprotein and the goblet cells were analyzed by Alcian Blue-Periodic Acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining and PAS staining, respectively. TJ proteins were determined by immunofluorescence technology. Results showed that excessive Mo significantly decreased the small intestinal villus height (VH), crypt depth (CD), VH/CD, and mucosal thickness (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) while induced the damage of DNA in small intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, excessive Mo injured intestinal barrier function by decreasing the percent of glycoprotein distribution area (P < 0.05) and the relative density of intestinal goblet cells (P < 0.05). Mo treatment induced decreased (P < 0.01) expression of Zonula Occludens-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1. In conclusion, excessive Mo interfered with the expression of TJ proteins, inhibited intestinal epithelial development, and further aggravated the intestinal barrier function damage, leading to disturbing the small intestinal microenvironment balance.

AB  - The environmental impact of biowaste generated during animal production can be mitigated by applying a circular economy model: recycling, reinventing the life cycle of biowaste, and developing it for a new use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding sugar concentrate solutions obtained from the nanofiltration of fruit biowaste (mango peel) to slurry from piglets fed with diets incorporating macroalgae on biogas production performance. The nanofiltration of ultrafiltration permeates from aqueous extracts of mango peel was carried out using membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 130 Da until a volume concentration factor of 2.0 was reached. A slurry resulting from piglets fed with an alternative diet with the incorporation of 10% Laminaria was used as a substrate. Three different trials were performed sequentially: (i) a control trial (AD(0)) with faeces resulting from a cereal and soybean-meal-based diet (S0); (ii) a trial with S-1 (10% L. digitata) (AD(1)), and (iii) an AcoD trial to assess the effect of the addition of a co-substrate (20%) to S1 (80%). The trials were performed in a continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) under mesophilic conditions (37.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C), with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 13 days. The specific methane production (SMP) increased by 29% during the anaerobic co-digestion process. These results can support the design of alternative valorisation routes for these biowastes, contributing to sustainable development goals.

AB  - Papaya (Carica papaya) is a tropical fruit having commercial importance because of its high nutritive and medicinal value. The packaging of papaya fruit as per its maturity status is an essential task in the fruit industry. The manual grading of papaya fruit based on human visual perception is time-consuming and destructive. The objective of this paper is to suggest a novel non-destructive maturity status classification of papaya fruits. The paper suggested two approaches based on machine learning and transfer learning for classification of papaya maturity status. Also, a comparative analysis is carried out with different methods of machine learning and transfer learning. The experimentation is carried out with 300 papaya fruit sample images which includes 100 of each three maturity stages. The machine learning approach includes three sets of features and three classifiers with their different kernel functions. The features and classifiers used in machine learning approaches are local binary pattern (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes respectively. The transfer learning approach includes seven pretrained models such as ResNet101, ResNet50, ResNet18, VGG19, VGG16, GoogleNet and AlexNet. The weighted KNN with HOG feature outperforms other machine learningbased classification model with 100% of accuracy and 0.099 5 s training time. Again, among the transfer learning approach based classification model VGG19 performs better with 100% accuracy and 1 min 52 s training time with consideration of early stop training. The proposed classification method for maturity classification of papaya fruits, i.e. VGG19 based on transfer learning approach achieved 100% accuracy which is 6% more than the existing method.

AB  - Citrus leprosis is the most important viral disease affecting citrus. The disease is caused predominantly by CiLV-C and is transmitted by Brevipalpus yothersi Baker mites. This study brings some insight into the colonization of B. yothersi in citrus [(Citrus x sinensis (L.) Osbeck (Rutaceae)] previously infested by viruliferous or non-viruliferous B. yothersi. It also assesses the putative role of shelters on the behavior of B. yothersi. Expression of PR1 and PR4 genes, markers of plant defense mechanisms, were evaluated by RT-qPCR to correlate the role of the plant hormonal changes during the tri-trophic virus-mite-plant interplay. A previous infestation with either non-viruliferous and viruliferous mites positively influenced oviposition and the number of adult individuals in the resulting populations. Mite populations were higher on branches that had received a previous mite infestation than branches that did not. There was an increase in the expression of PR4, a marker gene in the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway, in the treatment with non-viruliferous mites, indicating a response from the plant to their feeding. Conversely, an induced expression of PR1, a marker gene in the salicylic acid (SA) pathway, was observed mainly in the treatment with viruliferous mites, which suggests the activation of a plant response against the pathogen. The earlier mite infestation, as well as the presence of leprosis lesions and a gypsum mixture as artificial shelters, all fostered the growth of the B. yothersi populations after the second infestation, regardless of the presence or absence of CiLV-C. Furthermore, it is suggested that B. yothersi feeding actually induces the JA pathway in plants. At the same time, the CiLV-C represses the JA pathway and induces the SA pathway, which benefits the mite vector.

AB  - Jasmonates (JAs) are a class of phytohormones that play a crucial role in plant growth, development, and environmental stress responses. Central to JA signaling are the MYC2-type transcription factors, as they activate the expression of JA-responsive genes. We previously used CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing to engineer rice OsMYC2 and yielded a mutant (myc2-5) with a single amino acid (aa) deletion (75I) outside the known functional domains of the protein. This myc2-5 mutant also showed some JA-deficient phenotypes, promoting us to investigate how 75I deletion affects JA responses. The mutation is found in the alpha 2 helix element at the N-terminal of OsMYC2. The deletion of 75I in OsMYC2 rendered plants deficient in most of the JA responses, including root growth, leaf senescence, spikelet development, and resistance to pathogens and herbivores. Biochemical assays revealed that the 75I deletion markedly reduced OsMYC2 protein accumulation, subsequently diminishing its transcriptional activity. However, the deletion did not influence the protein's subcellular localization, DNA-binding capability, or its interactions with JAZ transcriptional repressors and the Mediator complex subunit MED25. Additionally, the screening of seven other deletions in the alpha 2 helix further reinforces the importance of this protein element. Our results highlight the significance of the alpha 2 helix in the N-terminus for OsMYC2's functionality, primarily through modulating its protein levels. This insight expands our knowledge of JA signaling and opens new avenues for research into the yet-to-be-explored domains of the MYC2 protein, with the potential to tailor JA responses in rice and other plant species.
   MYC2 transcription factor is the master regulator of plant jasmonate signaling. The functional domains or elements of MYC2 protein determine its activity. Here, we identified a novel element in the N-terminus that is essential for the activity of rice MYC2.

AB  - Calcium hydroxide has shown significant results in the removal of free fatty acids (FFAs), but the unsustainability of commercial calcium sources leads to the high cost of deacidification. In addition, the mechanism of the deacidification reaction is still unclear. In this context, this study employed eggshells as a low-cost calcium source to prepare a high-capacity deacidifier (2567 mg<middle dot>g(-1)) for the removal of FFAs from pork lard. Characterization of the deacidifiers was performed through FTIR, SEM, XRD and N-2 adsorption/desorption, and the effects of deacidifier dosage, reaction time and temperature on the deacidification efficiency were systematically investigated, while the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the deacidification process were analyzed. Results showed that Ca(OH)(2)-850 reacts with FFAs to form insoluble calcium soaps, achieving a 90% FFAs removal rate from waste lard. Response surface methodology (RSM) was further used to optimize the deacidification parameters. The optimal results obtained for deacidifier dosage is 1.4 wt.%, for reaction temperature is 57 degrees C and for reaction time is 11.3 h, which reduced the acid value (AV) of acidic lard to 0.84 mg KOH<middle dot>g(-1) and increased the purity of biodiesel to 94.09%. The deacidification kinetics were consistent with the pseudo-second-order (PSO) chemisorption model. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the removal of FFAs was characterized by heat absorption (Delta H > 0) and a spontaneous process (Delta G < 0). This work confirms that waste eggshells can be effectively utilized as a sustainable calcium source in the field of biodiesel production, offering a promising approach for waste management.

AB  - The GST enzyme is an antioxidant that protects organs against toxic substances. It reduces reactive oxygen species to less reactive metabolites. The GST enzyme has been studied in many living creatures such as sheep, birds, fish, bacteria, cattle, plants and humans. However, no studies on the Goose ( Anser anser Domesticus) liver GST enzyme (E.C. 2.5.1.18) have been found in the literature. This study demonstrates the purification and characterization of the GST enzyme from Goose ( Anser anser Domesticus) liver tissue by affinity chromatography. Besides, inhibitory effects of Hg2+, Ag2+and Fe2+cations and Oxytetracycline HCl, Tylosin Tartrate, Enrofloxacin and Doxycycline Hyclate chemicals on GST enzyme activity were investigated. The research was conducted under in vitro conditions using 1-Chloro-2,4dinitrobenzene method. The degree of purity of the enzyme solution was verified by SDS-PAGE. With the characterization of the enzyme, the optimal pH, optimal ionic strength and optimal temperature values were found to be 7.0, 100 mM and 40 degrees C, respectively. Separate inhibition graphs of Hg2+, Ag2+, Fe2+, Oxytetracycline HCl, Tylosin Tartrate, Enrofloxacin and Doxycycline Hyclate inhibitors were drawn. IC50 levels of inhibitors were found from the Activity%- [Inhibitor] graphs. As a result, the inhibition order of the inhibitors was found to be Hg2+ > Ag2+ > Fe2+ for cations, and Enrofloxacin < Tylosin Tartrate < Doxycycline Hyclate < Oxytetracycline HCl for chemicals.

AB  - Leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing nogo receptor-interacting protein 1 (LINGO-1), a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, is associated with cognitive function, and its expression is highly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Anti-LINGO-1 antibody treatment can effectively antagonize the negative regulatory effect of LINGO-1. In this study, we aim to assess the effect of anti-LINGO-1 antibody treatment on cognition and hippocampal oligodendrocytes in an AD transgenic animal model. First, 10-month-old male amyloid-beta (A beta) protein precursor (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice were administered anti-LINGO-1 antibody for 8 weeks. Then, learning and memory abilities were assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, and A beta deposition and hippocampal oligodendrocytes were investigated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and stereology. We found that anti-LINGO-1 antibody alleviated the deficits in spatial learning and memory abilities and working and reference memory abilities, decreased the density of LINGO-1 positive cells, decreased A beta deposition, significantly increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes and the density of myelin, reversed the abnormal increases in the number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and the densities of oligodendrocytes precursor cells in APP/PS1 mice. Our results provide evidence that LINGO-1 might be involved in the process of oligodendrocyte dysmaturity in the hippocampus of AD mice, and that antagonizing LINGO-1 can alleviate cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice and decrease A beta deposition and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation in the hippocampus of these mice. Our findings suggest that changes in LINGO-1 and oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD and that antagonizing LINGO-1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - Body size is perhaps the most fundamental property of an organism and is central to ecology at multiple scales, yet obtaining accurate estimates of ecologically meaningful size metrics, such as body mass, is often impractical. Allometric scaling and mass-to-mass relationships have been used as alternative approaches to model the expected body mass of many species. However, models for predicting body size in key herbivorous insects, such as grasshoppers, exist only at the family level. To address this data gap, we collected empirical body size data (hind femur length and width, pronotum length, live fresh mass, ethanol-preserved mass, and dry mass) from 368 adult grasshoppers of three flightless species at Hamilton Peak, Southern Alps, New Zealand. We examined the relationships among body size components across all species using linear and non-linear regression models. Femur length and preserved mass were robust predictors of both fresh mass and dry mass across all species; however, regressions using preserved mass as a predictor always showed higher predictive power than those using femur length. Based on our results, we developed species -specific statistical linear mixed-effects models to estimate the fresh and dry masses of individual grasshoppers from their preserved mass and femur length. Including sex as an additional co-variate increased model fit in some cases but did not produce better estimates than traditional mass-to-mass and allometric scaling regressions. Overall, our results showed that two easy-to-measure, unambiguous, highly repeatable, and non-destructive size measures (i.e., preserved mass and femur length) can predict, to an informative level of accuracy, fresh and dry body mass across three flightless grasshopper species. Knowledge about the relationships between body dimensions and body mass estimates in these grasshoppers has several important ecological applications, which are discussed.

AB  - Premise of research. The Miocene Punta Basilica Beds (northeast of Tierra del Fuego, Patagonia, Argentina) preserved a flora rich in insect herbivory traces. Here we document its insect damage and compare it with three Miocene floras from northwestern Argentina (low-latitude San Jose and Palo Pintado) and New Zealand (high-latitude Hindon Maar). In addition, comparisons are established for insect damage observed on Miocene Nothofagus in the Punta Basilica flora and the New Zealand Hindon Maar, Double Hill, and Kaikorai floras. Methodology. Plant-insect interactions were photographed and determined for 209 fossil leaves collected at the Punta Basilica locality. Leaves were censused for the presence/absence of functional feeding types. Pivotal results. Six functional feeding groups and 26 damage types (DTs) were recognized: hole (seven DTs) and margin (five DTs) feeding, skeletonization (six DTs), piercing and sucking (two DTs), mining (three DTs), and galling (three DTs). Nothofagus spp. are the most affected members of the paleoflora. Both of the low-latitude paleofloras compared have lower percentages of damaged leaves than the high-latitude ones; hole and margin feeding, mining, and skeletonization are recognized at all floras. Hole and margin feeding and skeletonization are recognized on Nothofagus leaves and are the most common functional feeding groups; hole feeding on Nothofagus is more prominent at Hindon Maar and Kaikorai than at Double Hill and Punta Basilica. Additionally, Nothofagus specimens from Hindon Maar and Punta Basilica have evidence of mining, whereas galling is observed only on the New Zealand leaves. The Punta Basilica Nothofagus specimens are the only ones with piercing and sucking. Conclusions. Southernmost Miocene records of leaf herbivory worldwide and the first record from Argentine Patagonia are rich and comprise several functional feeding groups also observed in other Miocene paleofloras from the Southern Hemisphere. Clearly, multiple biotic and abiotic factors explain differences in the intensity of folivory. This report evidences the need for additional studies on herbivory at high-latitude floras.

AB  - Many invasive plant species have demonstrated a better ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals than their co-occurring native plants. Given the potential biological toxicity of heavy metals to phytopathogens, we postulated that heavy metal contamination could enhance the pathogen resistance of metal-accumulating invasive plant species over their local congeneric competitors. Here, we compared the resistance of the invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener Alternanthera sessilis to infection by a leaf pathogenic fungus under soil cadmium (Cd) contamination. The findings revealed that A. philoxeroides exhibited superior growth and accumulated superior amounts of Cd in its leaves compared with A. sessilis. Cd exposure decreased leaf lesions in both plant species following artificial infection by the leaf pathogen, with A. philoxeroides experiencing fewer leaf lesions than A. sessilis. Subsequent analysis of the phyllosphere microbiome and toxicity tests suggested that the increased pathogen resistance of A. philoxeroides following Cd exposure could be attributed to both the direct toxic effects of Cd and the Cd-induced alterations in the microbial composition of the epiphytic phyllosphere. We further isolated a bacterial strain with a strong antagonistic effect against the leaf pathogen, potentially elucidating the enhanced pathogen resistance of A. philoxeroides under soil Cd pollution. Collectively, these findings indicate that heavy metal contamination may promote plant invasion by altering interactions between plants and pathogens.

AB  - Simple Summary: As demand for lamb is increasing, shortening the growth cycle and increasing meat production in lambs are major concerns today. Protein and energy are the two nutrients that most directly drive meat production in animals. In lambs, however, too few applications are available through nutrient combinations. We believe it is feasible to encourage animals to improve meat production performance by regulating the simplest nutrients in feed. In this experiment, we investigated the effects of three dietary ingredients with protein-to-fat ratios on growth, slaughter performance, fat deposition and meat quality of Small-Tail Han lambs. The aim of the current research was to gain insights/provide ideas for enhancing nutrient combination effects to improve animal production performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of feed ingredients with different protein-to-fat ratios on growth, slaughter performance and meat quality of Small-Tail Han lambs. Forty-five Small-Tail Han lambs (male) (BW = 34.00 +/- 2.5 kg, age = 120 +/- 9 d) were randomly divided into groups with three different experimental treatments: (1) PF 5, with the ratio of protein to fat (CP:EE) of 50 to 5; (2) PF10, CP: EE = 50:10; (3) PF20, CP: EE = 50:20. Each treatment group had 15 lambs, and each sheep was a repeat. This experiment lasted for 65 days, with feed intake recorded daily, and animals being weighed on days 0, 30, and 65. At the conclusion of the experiment, eight lambs from each group were slaughtered to assess slaughter performance and meat quality. The results showed that the average daily gain (ADG) of the three groups were 315.27, 370.15 and 319.42 g/d, respectively. The PF10 group had the highest ADG (370.15 g) (p < 0.05). Forestomach weights (1216.88 g) of the PF10 group were significantly higher than those of the other groups (p < 0.05). There were no differences (p > 0.05) in fat percentages in various parts of body among treatments. Feed conversion of the PF10 group was higher (p < 0.05) than that of PF 5 and PF 20 groups. Furthermore, the PF10 group had a higher (p > 0.05) carcass weight and slaughter rate and there were few differences between the other groups in terms of dry matter intake, meat quality, organ weight, and fat deposition (p > 0.05). The protein-energy supplement with protein-to-fat ratio, PF10 appeared to be more desirable to promote the growth and development in Small-Tail Han Lambs.

AB  - Animal gut microbiomes play important roles in the health, diseases, and production of animal hosts. The volume of animal gut metagenomic data, including both 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data, has been increasing exponentially in recent years, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to query, retrieve, and reanalyze experimental data and explore new hypotheses. We designed a database called the domestic animal gut microbiome atlas (ADDAGMA) to house all publicly available, high-throughput sequencing data for the gut microbiome in domestic animals. ADDAGMA enhances the availability and accessibility of the rapidly growing body of metagenomic data. We annotated microbial and metadata from four domestic animals (cattle, horse, pig, and chicken) from 356 published papers to construct a comprehensive database that is equipped with browse and search functions, enabling users to make customized, complicated, biologically relevant queries. Users can quickly and accurately obtain experimental information on sample types, conditions, and sequencing platforms, and experimental results including microbial relative abundances, microbial taxon-associated host phenotype, and P-values for gut microbes of interest. The current version of ADDAGMA includes 290,422 quantification events (changes in abundance) for 3215 microbial taxa associated with 48 phenotypes. ADDAGMA presently covers gut microbiota sequencing data from pig, cattle, horse, and chicken, but will be expanded to include other domestic animals. ADDAGMA is freely available at (http://addagma.omicsbio.info/). (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Research Network of Computational and Structural Biotechnology.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal that is of great concern in agroecosystems due to its toxicity to plants, herbivores, carnivores, and human beings. The current study evaluated the allocation and bioaccumulation of Cd from soil to cotton plants, cotton plants to herbivore pests, and herbivorous pests to a natural enemy predator. When soil was spiked with 100 mg/kg Cd, results demonstrated that cotton roots accumulated more Cd than the stems and leaves. The bioaccumulation of Cd was less in 4th instar larvae, pupa, and adults of Serangium japonicum than in Bemisia tabaci adults. The bioaccumulation in S. japonicum elongated the immature development period and reduced adult longevity, oviposition days, fertility, and total pre-oviposition duration. The net reproduction of S. japonicum was also reduced, as was female mature weight and feeding potential; as a result, Cd exposure could reduce the future population size compared to uncontaminated populations. There was decreased activity of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and POD) and energy-conserving lipids (glycogen, triglyceride, and total cholesterol) in Cd-contaminated S. japonicum compared to controls. The detoxifying enzyme activity of GST and P450 increased while AChE activity did not change. The qRT-PCR research showed that SOD1, CAT, POD, glycogen, and triglyceride gene expression was higher than in controls, whereas detoxification gene expression did not change. Our results indicate that Cd exposure has a physiological trade-off between its adverse effects on life history traits and elevated detoxification and antioxidation of S. japonicum, which could result from gene expression alteration. Further studies are needed to assess whether Cd exposure causes irreversible DNA damage in S. japonicum.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The effects of exposure of the juvenile brain to doses of ionizing radiation (IR) <= 2 Gy on cognitive functions in adulthood are not clearly established in humans, and experimental data are scarce. To elucidate how IR can impact the postnatal brain, we evaluated and compared the effect of whole brain (WB) or hippocampal dorsal dentate gyrus (DDG) X-ray exposure (0.25-2 Gy) on spatial memory, three months after irradiation in mice. In our dose-ranging study, spatial memory was not modified after WB exposure, whereas a deficit was highlighted when irradiation beams were focused on the DDG at the dose of 1 Gy, but not for the lowest or highest doses tested. At 1 Gy, DDG irradiation appeared to be more deleterious to spatial memory and also to adult hippocampal neurogenesis than WB irradiation. Alterations in the generation of newborn neuronal cells in the DG may participate in the memory impairment observed after DDG irradiation at this dose. Finally, our work shows that the brain's response to IR is complex and depends on the dose and the irradiated brain volume. The societal interest of this study is notably linked to the advent of computed tomography scans for head exploration in children.
   The cognitive consequences of postnatal brain exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) at low to moderate doses in the adult are not fully established. Because of the advent of pediatric computed tomography scans used for head exploration, improving our knowledge of these effects represents a major scientific challenge. To evaluate how IR may affect the developing brain, models of either whole brain (WB) or targeted dorsal dentate gyrus (DDG) irradiation in C57Bl/6J ten-day-old male mice were previously developed. Here, using these models, we assessed and compared the effect of IR (doses range: 0.25-2 Gy) on long-term spatial memory in adulthood using a spatial water maze task. We then evaluated the effects of IR exposure on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of plasticity involved in spatial memory. Three months after WB exposure, none of the doses resulted in spatial memory impairment. In contrast, a deficit in memory retrieval was identified after DDG exposure for the dose of 1 Gy only, highlighting a non-monotonic dose-effect relationship in this model. At this dose, a brain irradiated volume effect was also observed when studying adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the two models. In particular, only DDG exposure caused alteration in cell differentiation. The most deleterious effect observed in adult hippocampal neurogenesis after targeted DDG exposure at 1 Gy may contribute to the memory retrieval deficit in this model. Altogether these results highlight the complexity of IR mechanisms in the brain that can lead or not to cognitive disorders and provide new knowledge of interest for the radiation protection of children.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted to the hippocampal network via the inferior parietal cortex (HN-Stim) can strengthen hippocampal-cortical connectivity and improve episodic memory, offering a potential clinical intervention. However, acceptance of this technique has been tempered by the infrequent reproduction of findings in rTMS research on cognitive processes. We tested the reproducibility of the HN-Stim effect on episodic memory in our laboratory using different procedures from those previously published. We tested episodic memory in 29 participants before, one day, and one week after, three consecutive days of 20 Hz HN-Stim. Participants received stimulation targeted to either the area of inferior parietal cortex maximally connected to the left anterior hippocampus (HN-Stim; N = 14) or the vertex (control; N = 15), where we expected no effect. HN-Stim increased episodic memory performance one day, but not one week, after the last stimulation session. While failing to reproduce the lasting beneficial effect on memory found by others after five days of treatment, we found robust effects on behavior 24 h after treatment. HN-Stim is a safe and reliable means of enhancing episodic memory and may have potential for boosting learning and treating memory deficits.

AB  - Ras-related protein Ral-A (RalA)-binding protein 1 (RalBP1, also known as Ral-interacting protein of 76 kDa (RLIP76) or Ral-interacting protein 1 (RLIP1 or RIP1)) is involved in the efflux of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE, an end product of lipid peroxidation), as well as mitochondrial fission. In the present study, we found that 2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-oleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid methyl ester (CDDO-Me) attenuated CA1 neuronal death and aberrant mitochondrial elongations in these neurons coupled with enhanced RalBP1 expression and reduced 4-HNE levels following status epilepticus (SE). RalBP1 knockdown did not affect mitochondrial dynamics and CA1 neuronal death under physiological and post-SE conditions. Following SE, however, cotreatment of RalBP1 siRNA diminished the effect of CDDO-Me on 4-HNE levels, mitochondrial hyperfusion in CA1 neurons, and CA1 neuronal death. These findings indicate that CDDO-Me may ameliorate CA1 neuronal death by facilitating RalBP1-mediated 4-HNE efflux and mitochondrial fission following SE. Therefore, our findings suggest that increased RalBP1 expression/activity may be one of the considerable targets to protect neurons from SE.

AB  - Emerging evidence has confirmed resveratrol's (RES) antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidepressant effects. The beneficial effects of RES were confirmed for several emotional and cognitive deficits. This research aimed to assess the impacts of RES on behavior and hippocampal levels of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory factors in rats exposed to chronic social isolation (SI) stress, which is known to induce mental disorders such as depressive-like behavior. The animals were treated by RES (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg/intraperitoneally) for 28 days following a 28-day exposure to stress. Behavioral tests, including the forced swim test (FST), open-field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), and sucrose preference test (SPT), assessed depressive symptoms. Finally, the animals were sacrificed, and molecular studies (qPCR and ELISA) were performed. Exposure of animals to SI dramatically increased the immobility of animals in TST and FST, enhanced the time spent in the open-field peripheral zone of the OFT, and reduced the sucrose preference rate. In addition, SI increased serum levels of corticosterone and hippocampal content of MDA, whereas it reduced hippocampal SOD and CAT activities. Moreover, SI upregulated the expression of IL-10, IL-18, and IL-1 beta and downregulated the expression of TGF-beta in the hippocampus. RES treatment (40 & 80 mg/kg) significantly improved the behavioral alterations through the modulation of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The 20 mg/kg RES dose was inefficient for treating SI-induced depressive-like behavior. These results indicated that RES attenuated depressive-like behavior in pro-longed stressed animals. These properties might be associated with RES-mediated improvements in serum corticosterone and hippocampal inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers.

AB  - Introduction: Both cannabis use and depressive symptomology increase in prevalence throughout adolescence. Concurrently, the brain is undergoing neurodevelopment in important limbic regions, such as the amygdala. Prior research indicates the amygdala may also be related to cannabis use and depressive symptoms. We aimed to investigate the effects of adolescent cannabis use on amygdala volumes as well as the interaction of cannabis use and amygdala morphometry on depressive symptoms in youth.<br /> Method: Two-hundred-twenty-four participants (ages 12-15), balanced by sex assigned at birth, were selected from a sub-sample of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study based on hair toxicology and self-report measures of cannabis use. Participants positive for cannabinoids in hair and/or self-reported cannabis use were demographically matched to youth with no self-reported or confirmed cannabis use. The guardians of these youth reported depression symptoms on the Child Behavioral Checklist. Linear mixed effect models were run investigating cannabis use group on amygdala volumes bilaterally, controlling for whole brain volume and random effects of scanner type. Additional analyses examined cannabis group status and bilateral amygdala volume on depression symptoms.<br /> Results: Cannabis use was not significantly associated with amygdala volume but was associated with increased depressive symptoms (p<0.01). Cannabis group interacted with amygdala volume, such that individuals with smaller volumes had increased depressive symptoms within the cannabis group (p's<0.01-0.02).<br /> Conclusion: Aberrations in amygdala volume based on cannabis use were not found in early adolescence; however, more depressive symptoms were related to cannabis group. Youth who use cannabis and have smaller amygdala volumes were at increased risk for depressive symptomology, suggesting potential neurovulnerabilities to cannabis use.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), forming symbiosis with most terrestrial plants, strongly modulates root system architecture (RSA), which is the main characteristic of root in soil, to improve plant growth and development. So far, the studies of AMF on tea plant seedlings are few and the relevant molecular mechanism is not deciphered. In this study, the 6-month-old cutting seedlings of tea plant cultivar "Wancha No.4" were inoculated with an AMF isolate, Rhizophagus intraradices BGC JX04B and harvested after 6 months of growth. The indexes of RSA and sugar contents in root were determined. The transcriptome data in root tips of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal cutting seedlings were obtained by RNA-sequence (Seq) analysis. The results showed that AMF significantly decreased plant growth, but increased the sucrose content in root and the higher classes of lateral root (LR) formation (third and fourth LR). We identified 2047 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the transcriptome data, and DEGs involved in metabolisms of phosphorus (42 DEGs), sugar (39), lipid (67), and plant hormones (39) were excavated out. Variation partitioning analysis showed all these four categories modulated the RSA. In phosphorus (P) metabolism, the phosphate transport and release (DEGs related to purple acid phosphatase) were promoted by AMF inoculation, while DEGs of sugar transport protein in sugar metabolism were downregulated. Lipid metabolism might not be responsible for root branching but for AMF propagation. With respect to phytohormones, DEGs of auxin (13), ethylene (14), and abscisic acid (5) were extensively affected by AMF inoculation, especially for auxin and ethylene. The further partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis indicated that pathways of P metabolism and auxin, as well as the direct way of AMF inoculation, were of the most important in AMF promoting root branching, while ethylene performed a negative role. Overall, our data revealed the alterations of genome-wide gene expression in tea plant roots after inoculation with AMF and provided a molecular basis for the regulatory mechanism of RSA (mainly root branching) changes induced by AMF.

AB  - Monitoring sheep's behavior is of paramount importance, because deviations from normal patterns may indicate nutritional, thermal or social stress, changes in reproductive status, health issues, or predator attacks. The night period, despite being a more restful period in which animals are theoretically sleeping and resting, represents approximately half of the life cycle of animals; therefore, its study is of immense interest. Wearable sensors have become a widely recognized technique for monitoring activity, both for their precision and the ease with which the sensorized data can be analyzed. The present dataset consists of data from the sensorization of 18 Serra da Estrela sheep, during the nocturnal period between 18 November 2021 and 16 February 2022. The data contain measurements taken by ultrasound and accelerometry of the height from neck to ground, as well as measurements taken by an accelerometer in the monitoring collar. Data were collected every 10 s when the animals were in the shelter. With the collection of data from various sensors, active and inactive periods can be identified throughout the night, quantifying the number and average time of those periods.

AB  - To explore the protective effect of dietary beta-glucan (BGL) supplementation on intestinal epithelium exposure to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), thirty-two weaned pigs were assigned to four groups. Pigs were fed with a basal diet or basal diet containing 500 mg/kg BGL, and were orally infused with ETEC or culture medium. Results showed BGL supplementation had no influence on growth performance in weaned pigs. However, BGL supplementation increased the absorption of D-xylose, and significantly decreased the serum concentrations of D-lactate and diamine oxidase (DAO) in the ETEC-challenged pigs (p < 0.05). Interestingly, BGL significantly increased the abundance of the zonula occludens-1-(ZO-1) in the jejunal epithelium upon ETEC challenge (p < 0.05). BGL supplementation also increased the number of S-phase cells and the number of sIgA-positive cells, but significantly decreased the number of total apoptotic cells in the jejunal epithelium upon ETEC challenge (p < 0.05). Moreover, BGL significantly increased the duodenal catalase (CAT) activity and the ileal total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity in the ETEC-challenged pigs (p < 0.05). Importantly, BGL significantly decreased the expression levels of critical inflammation related proteins such as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interlukin-6 (IL-6), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in the jejunal and ileal mucosa upon ETEC challenge (p < 0.05). BGL also elevated the propanoic acid content and the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bacillus in the colon upon ETEC challenge (p < 0.05). These results suggested BGL could alleviate the ETEC-induced intestinal epithelium injury, which may be associated with suppressed inflammation and improved intestinal immunity and antioxidant capacity, as well as the improved intestinal macrobiotic.

AB  - IntroductionChronic exposure to social defeat stress (SDS) has been used to investigate the neurobiology of depressive- and anxiety-like responses and mnemonic processes. We hypothesized that these affective, emotional, and cognitive consequences induced by SDS are regulated via glutamatergic neurons located in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), amygdaloid complex, and hippocampus in mice. MethodsHere, we investigated the influence of chronic SDS on (i) the avoidance behavior assessed in the social interaction test, (ii) the anxiety-like behavior (e.g., elevated plus-maze, and open field tests) (iii) depressive-like behaviors (e.g., coat state, sucrose splash, nesting building, and novel object exploration tests), (iv) the short-term memory (object recognition test), (v) & UDelta;FosB, CaMKII as well as & UDelta;FosB + CaMKII labeling in neurons located in the BNST, amygdaloid complex, dorsal (dHPC) and the ventral (vHPC) hippocampus. ResultsThe main results showed that the exposure of mice to SDS (a) increased defensive and anxiety-like behaviors and led to memory impairment without eliciting clear depressive-like or anhedonic effects; (b) increased & UDelta;FosB + CaMKII labeling in BNST and amygdala, suggesting that both areas are strongly involved in the modulation of this type of stress; and produced opposite effects on neuronal activation in the vHPC and dHPC, i.e., increasing and decreasing, respectively, & UDelta;FosB labeling. The effects of SDS on the hippocampus suggest that the vHPC is likely related to the increase of defensive- and anxiety-related behaviors, whereas the dHPC seems to modulate the memory impairment. DiscussionPresent findings add to a growing body of evidence indicating the involvement of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the circuits that modulate emotional and cognitive consequences induced by social defeat stress.

AB  - Several pieces of evidence suggest that the monoaminergic theory of depression cannot fully explain all behavioral and neuroplastic changes observed after antidepressant chronic treatment. Other molecular targets, such as the endocannabinoid system, have been associated with the chronic effects of these drugs. In the present study, we hypothesized that the behavioral and neuroplastic effects observed after repeated treatment with the antidepressants (AD) Escitalopram (ESC) or venlafaxine (VFX) in chronically stressed mice depend on CB1 re-ceptor activation. Male mice submitted to the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm for 21 days were treated with Esc (10 mg/kg) or VFX (20 mg/kg) once a day in the presence or not of AM251 (0.3 mg/kg), a CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist. At the end of the CUS paradigm, we conducted behavior tests to evaluate depressive-and anxiety-like behaviors. Our results demonstrated that chronic blockade of the CB1 receptor does not attenuate the antidepressant-or the anxiolytic-like effects of ESC nor VFX. ESC increased the expression of CB1 in the hippocampus, but AM251 did not change the pro-proliferative effects of ESC in the dentate gyrus or the increased expression of synaptophysin induced by this AD in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that CB1 receptors are not involved in behavioral and hippocampal neuroplastic effects observed after repeated antide-pressant treatment in mice submitted to CUS.

AB  - There is an urgent need to find antidepressants that can be administered for long periods without inducing severe side effects to replace conventional antidepressants that control monoamine levels, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). We sought to determine the antidepressant effects of Fraxinus rhynchophylla Hance (F. rhynchophylla Hance, FX) and its components on a reserpine-induced mouse model. One hour after oral administration of FX (30, 50, and 100 mg/kg), esculin (50 mg/kg), esculetin (50 mg/kg), fraxin (50 mg/kg), and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg), reserpine was delivered intraperitoneally to mice. Behavioral experiments were conducted to measure anxiety and depressive-like behaviors after 10 days of administration. FX and its components increased the number of entries into the center of an open field as well as distance traveled within it and decreased immobility duration in the forced swim and tail suspension tests. Reserpine-induced increases in plasma corticosterone concentrations were attenuated by the administration of FX and its components, which were also found to decrease the reserpine-induced enhancement of mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-12 p40, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, the diminished expressions of hippocampal phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by reserpine were increased by FX and its components. Our results suggest that FX and its components regulate anxiety and depressive-like behaviors through stress hormones, immune regulation, and the activation of neuroprotective mechanisms, further supporting the potential of FX and its components as antidepressants.

AB  - Proteases are a group of industrially valuable enzymes with significant demand owing to their diverse and extensive range of biotechnological applications. This study aimed to purify and optimize protease from oil seeds as oil seeds contain high oil and protein content along with the enzymes responsible for the digestion of these biomolecules. Three indigenous oil seeds including Brassica compestris, Zea mays and Helianthus annus were included in this study and proteases were isolated and characterized by germinating these seeds at different time periods. The partial purification of enzyme was carried out up to 4.8, 2.5 and 2.44-fold from 5-days old germinating oilseeds of MH5, BH5 and SH5. Total protein content (TPC) of 30, 50 and 250 mgmL-1 were obtained for MH5, BH5 and SH5, respectively with maximum precipitation at 60-70% saturation with (NH4)2SO4. The enzyme was observed to be stable up to 50 oC at pH 8.0 using casein as substrate. The enzyme activity was alleviated using Ca2+, Fe2+, Cu2+ and Co2+ except for BH5 where Ca2+ was ineffective in enhancing or reducing enzyme-activity. The specific-activity values of 0.07, 0.094 and 0.02 mgmL-1 were observed for MH5, BH5 and SH5 respectively. The supplementation of enzyme preparation in detergent completely removed the blood stain from a stained cloth providing the basis of enzyme utilization in detergent industry. Moreover, dehairing effects were observed when applied to goat ear expanding the scope of purified enzyme to enhance the quality of leather in tannery industries by promoting the dehairing process of animal skins thereby avoiding environmental pollution.

AB  - In both captive wildlife and production animals is important to develop strategies for population control. Immunization against GnRH is an easy and inexpensive immunocastration method that reduces the concentration of testosterone and decreases sperm quality. However, its effectiveness depends on the species and repetition of the treatment. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a single treatment (initial immunization plus a booster with Improvac) vs repeated treatment (six doses of Improvac) to inhibit testicular function and maintain the contraceptive status during long periods in bucks. Three Dwarf bucks (Capra hircus) received two doses of Improvac, the first on Week 0, and the booster 4 weeks later (single immunization, group SI) while three Dwarf bucks received one dose of Improvac every 6 months during 3 consecutive years (repeated immunization, group RI). The other three Dwarf bucks remained untreated (control bucks, group CON). Bucks from RI had a greater decrease in scrotal circumference, testosterone concentration, male odor intensity, and sperm quality than SI bucks. However, there were no differences between SI and CON bucks in any of the variables studied. Overall, repeated treatment of Improvac decreased the testicular function of Dwarf bucks, although did not produce complete infertility. However, the repetition of the treatment produced more intensive negative effects, indicating that the strength of the effects of Improvac is rapidly lost in bucks.

AB  - Ovariectomized (OVX) rodents show behavioral despair and anxiety-like behaviors. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) possess neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, thereby preventing synaptic loss. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of GLP-1RA, namely liraglutide, on emotional behaviors, and to identify the level of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and BDNF signaling in the hippocampus of OVX rats. Forty female young Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: Control, Control+liraglutide treated, OVX, OVX+fluoxetine, and OVX+liraglutide (150 mu g/kg for 15 days, sc). Open field test and elevated plus-maze test were used to evaluate behaviors that are suggestive of anxiety. A forced swimming test was used to evaluate behavioral despair. At the end of the experiments, blood glucose level and body weight gain were measured. The levels of BDNF, CREB, Nrf2, and lipocalin 2 in the hippocampal tissue were measured by ELISA. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione levels were also evaluated. Statistical analysis was conducted through ANOVA and Bonferroni tests. Seven weeks post-OVX rats exhibited high anxiety related behavior and behavioral despair in comparison with the control groups. These behavioral changes were associated with increased lipocalin 2 and MDA levels in rats. Moreover, BDNF, CREB, and Nrf2 levels decreased significantly in the hippocampus of OVX rats. Liraglutide treatment limited the reduction of BDNF and Nrf2 levels in the hippocampus, maintaining them at the control levels. Liraglutide treatment also prevented the symptoms of behavioral despair and anxiety related behavior. As the main finding of the study GLP-1RA reduced behavioral despair and anxiety level and this may be related to the preservation of BDNF/Nrf2 levels and the decrease in oxidative stress and lipocalin 2 levels in the hippocampus.

AB  - In recent decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that the widespread and highly variable parasite Ichthyophonus hoferi is actually a species complex. Highly plastic morphology and a general lack of defining structures has contributed to the likely underestimate of biodiversity within this group. Molecular methods are a logical next step in the description of these parasites, but markers used to date have been too conserved to resolve species boundaries. Here we use mitochondrial encoded cytochrome-c oxidase (MTCO1) gene sequences and phylogenic analysis to compare Ichthyophonus spp. isolates from several marine and anadromous fish hosts. The resulting phylogeny displays lineage separation among isolates and possible host/niche segregation not previously described. The parasite type that infects Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, Atlantic herring C. harengus, Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, and Pacific staghorn sculpin Oligocottus maculosus (Clade A) is different from that which infects Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepsis (Clade B). MTCO1 sequences confirmed the presence of a more divergent Ichthyophonus sp. isolated from American shad Alosa sapidissima in rivers of eastern North America (Clade C), while American shad introduced to the Pacific Ocean are infected with the same parasite that infects Pacific herring (Clade A). Currently there are no consensus criteria for delimiting species within Ichthyophonidae, but MTCO1 sequences hold promise as a potential species identifying marker and useful epizootiological tool.

AB  - The genus Diaporthe comprises important pathogens, endophytes or saprobes with diverse host associations and worldwide distribution. A new fungus, Diaporthe cha, was collected from symptomatic leaves in Yunnan Province, China. Identification was done using a combination of morphology and comparison of DNA sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer regions with intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS), and the beta-tubulin (TUB), translation elongation factor-1 alpha (TEF), calmodulin (CAL) and histone (HIS) genes. Diaporthe cha is described and illustrated as a new species. It is characterized by fusoid to ellipsoid or clavate alpha conidia and filiform beta conida. Its morphology and phylogenetic relationships with other Diaporthe species is discussed.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hard antler extract (HAE) is a traditional Chinese medicine and has potent antitumor, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities. Previous studies have demonstrated that HAE can inhibit human prostate cancer metastasis and murine breast cancer proliferation. However, the effect of HAE on human breast cancer cells has not been clarified.
   Aim of the study: To investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of HAE on self-renewal of stem-like cells and spontaneous and transforming growth factor (TGF)-81-enhanced wound healing, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells.
   Methods: HAE was prepared from sika deer by sequential enzymatic digestions and the active compounds were determined by HPLC. The effects of HAE on the viability, mammosphere formation, wound healing and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells were determined. The impact of HAE treatment on spontaneous and TGF-81promoted EMT and the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling in breast cancer cells was examined by quantitative RTPCR and western blotting.
   Results: Treatment with HAE at varying concentrations did not change the viability of breast cancer cells. However, HAE at 0.25 or 0.5 mg/mL significantly reduced the number and size of formed mammospheres, and inhibited spontaneous and TGF-81-enhanced wound healing, invasion and EMT in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. TGF-81 treatment significantly decreased I kappa B alpha expression and increased NF-kappa Bp65 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells, indicating that TGF-81 enhanced NF-kappa B signaling. In contrast, HAE treatment attenuated the spontaneous and TGF-81-enhanced NF-kappa B signaling in breast cancer cells. Conclusion: Our data indicated that HAE inhibited the self-renewal of stem-like cells and spontaneous and TGF81-enhanced wound healing, invasion and EMT in breast cancer cells by attenuating the NF-kappa B signaling in vitro.

AB  - The research study was conducted in the sheep farm of the Agricultural Institute - Stara Zagora. It included 45 Ile-deFrance lambs divided into three groups with 15 animals each: one control and two experimental. The lambs from experimental group I were individually supplemented with 8 g Immunobeta prebiotic on a daily basis, whereas lambs from experimental group II received the same amount of prebiotic plus 4 g Zoovit probiotic. The following parameters were monitored - live body weight at the beginning and the end of the experiment, daily weight gain and slaughter age in days. The experiment lasted until a live weight of 23-25 kg was attained. Then 5 male lambs from each group were slaughtered, samples from musculus Longissimus Lumborum were collected and meat chemical composition and technological properties were analyzed. It was demonstrated that the weight gain of lambs from experimental group I was by 21.74% (& Rcy; <= 0.01) higher, and that of lambs from experimental group II: by 17.39% (& Rcy; <= 0.01) higher compared to controls. Both supplemented groups attained slaughter live weight over a shorter period compared to the control group (& Rcy; <= 0.001). The meat WHC was lower in the two experimental groups vs controls, indicating that the loss of moisture from m. LL meat in these groups was higher than that of controls. In summary, the study allowed concluding that the dietary supplementation of lambs with 8 g Immunobeta prebiotic and 4 g Zoovit probiotic + 8 g Immunobeta prebiotic had a beneficial effect on the growth performance of animals.

AB  - Simple Summary According to renowned Chinese medical saint Quan Wan, of the Ming Dynasty, "If you want to keep your child healthy, make him stay hungry occasionally". In addition to lamenting the ancients' theory of health preservation, we also frame this question in the context of insects of more distant origins. How did lace bugs adapt to starvation and low temperatures when they spread around the world? What influence do these abiotic stresses have? Driven by our desire to answer these questions, we designed a study in which nymphs newly born on different hosts were subjected to starvation treatment for differing periods. Origin food was then continuously provided until the end of their life. The total development time, survival, number of eggs, and supercooling capacity were recorded. Overall, our results provide an increased understanding of long-term post-starvation responses of insects to food limitations, particularly in determining survival. Food shortages severely reduce the prospects of insect survival in natural settings, including in the case of herbivorous insects. However, the early starvation experience of some insects has positive effects throughout their entire lifespan. It is important to discuss the effects of refeeding and host plants on the capacity of herbivorous insects to adapt to starvation and low temperatures, considering that starvation resistance is expected to show some degree of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. We tested the relationship between host plant, starvation, and the supercooling capacity of the invasive pest Corythucha marmorata. In particular, we highlighted how early starvation affects the refeeding and recovery phases. Among the various range of hosts, the chrysanthemum lace bug has the fastest growth rate on Helianthus annuus, and the strongest supercooling capacity on Symphyotrichum novi-belgii. Especially, starvation for 2 days increases the rates of survival, development, and number of eggs upon refeeding, in comparison to no starvation. A 3-day starvation period in the nymphal stage significantly increased the supercooling capacity of 5th instar nymphs and adults, as observed in our study.

AB  - Individual methane emissions are a potential breeding goal for selection plans aimed at improving the sustainability of ruminant farming systems. However, a large-scale recording of individual methane emissions is hampered by the high costs of the equipment and the logistics of the experiments. Equations have been developed to predict methane emissions in dairy cattle based on variables such as dry matter intake (DMI), gross energy intake, body weight and milk fatty acids (FAs) profile. No equations are currently available for dairy sheep. The aims of this study were: (i) to estimate the enteric methane yield (eMY, expressed as g/kg of DMI) and enteric methane intensity (eMI, expressed as g/kg of FPCM) of dairy sheep using equations developed for dairy cattle that consider as predictors milk FA; (ii) to evaluate the effect of stage of lactation, parity and month of lambing on eMY and eMI; (iii) to estimate the heritability of eMY and eMI. For this purpose, 964 individual milk samples from Sarda dairy ewes were analysed for milk composition and FA profile. Nine different equations were used to predict eMY and eMI. Values of eMY ranged from 19.4 g/kg to 20.4 g/kg of DMI, whereas values of eMI ranged from 15.1 g/kg to 21.0 g/kg of DMI, respectively. Stage of lactation was an important factor in the variability of eMY (p < .01). Indeed, this trait increased towards the end of lactation. Both eMY and eMI were negatively correlated with milk yield, lactose concentration and urea and positively correlated with fat concentration and NaCl, respectively. Heritability of eMI and eMY estimated using a single trait model was 0.13 & PLUSMN; 0.05 and 0.05 & PLUSMN; 0.04, respectively. The values of heritability estimated for eMY using a bivariate models ranged from 0.10 to 0.16 and they were higher than the value estimated for eMI. Results of the present study, even if based on prediction equations developed for cows, increased the knowledge about the phenotypic and genetic background of methane emissions in Sarda dairy sheep.

AB  - Several studies have reported increased copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) levels in agricultural soils worldwide, mainly due to organic waste and successive leaf fungicide applications in crops. However, the critical transfer thresholds in soils, which can indicate the real risk of environmental contamination and toxicity to plants, remain poorly understood. This study aimed to define the maximum Cu and Zn adsorption capacity (MAC) and threshold (T-Cu and T-Zn) in different soils in Southern Brazil, which present different clay and organic matter (OM) levels. Bw (Oxisol) and A horizon (Inceptisol) samples were used to obtain soils with clay and OM contents ranging from 4 to 70% and from 0.5 to 9.5%, respectively. Cu and Zn adsorption curves were plotted for MAC determination purposes. Based on Cu and Zn MAC values, different concentrations of these elements were applied to the soils for subsequent quantification of available Cu and Zn levels (Mehlich-1 and water). T-Cu in soils with different clay contents ranged from 81 to 595 mg Cu kg(-1), whereas T-Zn, from 195 to 378 mg Zn kg(-1). T-Cu in soils with different OM levels ranged from 97 to 667 mg Cu kg(-1), whereas T-Zn, from 226 to 495 mg Zn kg(-1). T-Cu can be calculated through the equation: T-Cu = 75 x (%CL0.34) x (%OM0.39), whereas T-Zn: T-Zn = 2.7 x (CL) + 126 (by taking into consideration the clay content) and T-Zn = - 9.3 x (%OM)(2) + 92.4 x (%OM) + 66 (by taking into consideration OM content). T-Cu and T-Zn can be used by researchers, inspection bodies, technical assistance institutions, and farmers as safe indicators to monitor the potential for environmental contamination.

AB  - In recent years, there is a growing interest in nutraceutical-rich functional foods for promoting human health. Wild fruits and berries are excellent sources of phytochemicals even though the most deeply studied are the polyphenolic compounds, among them, the major ones such as flavonoids, anthocyanins, or tannins. This review aimed to comprehensively analyze the currently available literature on wild edible fruits and berries, since these fruits are characterized for their high content of polyphenolic compounds. Moreover, both intrinsic (ripening and genetic variability) and extrinsic (environmental conditions: habitat, light, temperature) factors where considered since they affect the polyphenolic content in these fruits. Besides, the therapeutic potential of berries for treating human diseases was assessed through the revision of in vivo and in vitro assays and clinical studies, having in mind that most of these effects are exerted due to their antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, recent challenges and future trends on the research and utilization of wild fruits and berries were addressed to complete the overview of this sustainable source of natural ingredients. Finally, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar were the databases used for the compilation of the information present in this review, selecting the more recent studies and comparing from a critical point of view, the information found. Thus, this review compiled information of berries regarding their polyphenolic content and the variations this suffer depending on different variables; the potential use of the berries for a therapeutic application; and the trends and challenges that the use of berries faces after the research done.

AB  - Paraquat (PQ) is a heterocyclic pesticide that not only damages the testicular development and reduces the quality of semen, but also disturbs the secretion of hormones in the reproductive system. However, the effects of PQ on oocyte maturation and its toxic mechanism have not been yet fully clarified. Here we showed that PQ exposure could have toxic effects on porcine oocyte maturation. PQ exposure with 100 mu M inhibited cumulus cell expansion and significantly reduced the rate of first polar body extrusion during oocyte maturation. PQ-exposed oocytes could not develop to the 2-cell and blastocyst stage. PQ exposure with 100 mu M significantly increased abnormal spindle rate (65.2% +/- 1.0%) and misaligned chromosome rate (63.2% +/- 3.4%) compared to the control group (38.3% +/- 1.0% and 38.4% +/- 1.0%, respectively; P < 0.05). F-actin also exhibited reduced distribution in PQ-exposed oocytes (10.3% +/- 1.0%) compared to the control group (14.4% +/- 1.0%, P < 0.05). In addition, PQ exposure reduced the active mitochondria levels, but apparently increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS), rH2AX, and LC3 (autophagy marker) levels. qPCR analyses showed that PQ exposure caused the aberrant expression of genes associated with cumulus cell expansion, but did not affect the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Taken together, these results indicate that PQ exposure impaired oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation probably through oxidative stress. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nicotine addiction develops predominantly during human adolescence through smoking. Self-administration experiments in rodents verify this biological preponderance to adolescence, suggesting evolutionary-conserved and age-defined mechanisms which influence the susceptibility to nicotine addiction. The hippocampus, a brain region linked to drug-related memory storage, undergoes major morpho-functional restructuring during adolescence and is strongly affected by nicotine stimulation. However, the signaling mechanisms shaping the effects of nicotine in young vs. adult brains remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) emerged recently as modulators of brain neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and addiction. Nevertheless, the age-dependent interplay between miRNAs regulation and hippocampal nicotinergic signaling remains poorly explored. We here combined biophysical and pharmacological methods to examine the impact of miRNA-132/212 gene-deletion (miRNA-132/212(-/-)) and nicotine stimulation on synaptic functions in adolescent and mature adult mice at two hippocampal synaptic circuits: the medial perforant pathway (MPP) to dentate yrus (DG) synapses (MPP-DG) and CA3 Schaffer collaterals to CA1 synapses (CA3-CA1). Basal synaptic transmission and short-term (paired-pulse-induced) synaptic plasticity was unaltered in adolescent and adult miRNA-132/212(-/-) mice hippocampi, compared with wild-type controls. However, nicotine stimulation promoted CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation in mature adult (not adolescent) wild-type and suppressed MPP-DG synaptic potentiation in miRNA-132/212(-/-) mice. Altered levels of CREB, Phospho-CREB, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression were further detected in adult miRNA-132/212(-/-) mice hippocampi. These observations propose miRNAs as age-sensitive bimodal regulators of hippocampal nicotinergic signaling and, given the relevance of the hippocampus for drug-related memory storage, encourage further research on the influence of miRNAs 132 and 212 in nicotine addiction in the young and the adult brain.

AB  - Simple Summary The content of intramuscular fat (IMF) is the main determinant of the nutritional and economic value of sheep meat. Therefore, lipid synthesis in sheep longissimus lumborum (LL) has become an important research focus. MicroRNA-27a (miR-27a) has been shown to play a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte progenitor cells. In this study, we revealed that miR-27a significantly inhibited the formation of lipid droplets by targeting CPT1B to inhibit genes involved in lipid synthesis including PPAR gamma, SCD, LPL, and FABP4. Here, we constructed a miR-27a-CPT1B regulatory network map, which revealed the interaction between miR-27a and CPT1B in lipid synthesis in ovine preadipocytes. MiRNAs are vital regulators and play a major role in cell differentiation, biological development, and disease occurrence. In recent years, many studies have found that miRNAs are involved in the proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of miR-27a and its target gene CPT1B on ovine preadipocytes differentiation in Small-tailed Han sheep (Ovis aries). Down-regulation of miR-27a significantly promoted the production of lipid droplets, while overexpression of miR-27a led to a reduction in lipid droplet production. In addition, inhibition of miR-27a led to a significant increase in the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis, including PPAR gamma, SCD, LPL, and FABP4. Target Scan software predicted that CPT1B is a new potential target gene of miR-27a. Further experiments revealed that CPT1B gene expression and protein levels were negatively correlated with miR-27a expression. Overexpression of miR-27a led to a significant decrease in CPT1B mRNA levels and inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets and vice versa. Moreover, overexpression of CPT1B promoted the synthesis of lipid droplets in ovine preadipocytes. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays confirmed CPT1B to be a miR-27a direct target gene. This study confirmed that miR-27a increases the expression of genes related to lipid synthesis in ovine preadipocytes by targeting CPT1B, thereby promoting the synthesis of lipid droplets. The results of this study can be used to be exploited in devising novel approaches for improving the IMF content of sheep.

AB  - Lignosus rhinocerus has bioactive properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiglycation, and immunomodulatory effects, that are beneficial to the skin. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of cosmeceutical compounds, including linoleates, ascorbic acid dipahnitate, and all-trans-squalene, in the mushroom sclerotium. We further investigated the depigmentation and antiaging activities of L. rhinoceros cultivar TM02 sclerotia cold water extract (TM-CWE). TM-C WE at 10% (v/v) inhibited melanin production at the intro- and extracellular levels of B16-F1 melanoma cells (50.6-53.3%) and downregulated microplahalinia-associated transcription factor, the key protein for melanogenic enzyme expression, at the intracellular level (44.5 +/- 2.6%). The extract also promoted human procollagen type 1 production in HaCat cells by 51.30 +/- 2.87% at 12.5% (v/v). Irritation tests using three-dimensional eye and skin models further indicated that TM-CWE is a nonirritant with > 75% viability. Therefore, L. rhinoceros TM02 demonstrated the capacity to be a beneficial ingredient for skin care application.

TI  - A distinctive edge-graphited hard carbon for advanced sodium-ion batteries
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A

KW  - CAMELLIA-OLEIFERA SHELL
AB  - The commercialization of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as an effective alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has garnered considerable attention. Among the various anodes for SIBs, hard carbon (HC) with expanded carbon layer spacing is the most promising candidate for commercialization. However, the intricate structure of HC can impact the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and cycling performance of the cell, potentially resulting in suboptimal capacity and rate capabilities. Here we find that the waste Camellia semiserrata shell (CSshell) can serve as a precursor for biomass-derived HC material, featuring unique edge-graphitized carbon layer structures formed through direct carbonization, distinct from conventional reported HC structures. Such an edge-graphitized HC material exhibits an exceptional initial reversible capacity of 320.06 mA h g-1 at a current density of 50 mA g-1 and a capacity retention of 93.7% after 1200 cycles at 500 mA g-1. The identification of the edge-graphited HC material, obtained from the waste CSshell, suggests a promising contender for low-cost and eco-friendly anode materials for SIBs.

AB  - Estimating the contribution of demographic parameters to changes in population growth is essential for understanding why populations fluctuate. Integrated population models (IPMs) offer a possibility to estimate the contributions of additional demographic parameters, for which no data have been explicitly collected-typically immigration. Such parameters are often subsequently highlighted as important drivers of population growth. Yet, accuracy in estimating their temporal variation, and consequently their contribution to changes in population growth rate, has not been investigated. To quantify the magnitude and cause of potential biases when estimating the contribution of immigration using IPMs, we simulated data (using northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe population estimates) from controlled scenarios to examine potential biases and how they depend on IPM parameterization, formulation of priors, the level of temporal variation in immigration and sample size. We also used empirical data on populations with known rates of immigration: Soay sheep Ovis aries and Mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus with zero immigration and grey wolf Canis lupus in Scandinavia with near-zero immigration. IPMs strongly overestimated the contribution of immigration to changes in population growth in scenarios when immigration was simulated with zero temporal variation (proportion of variance attributed to immigration = 63% for the more constrained formulation and real sample size) and in the wild populations, where the true number of immigrants was zero or near-zero (kestrel 19.1%-98.2%, sheep 4.2%-36.1% and wolf 84.0%-99.2%). Although the estimation of the contribution of immigration in the simulation study became more accurate with increasing temporal variation and sample size, it was often not possible to distinguish between an accurate estimation from data with high temporal variation versus an overestimation from data with low temporal variation. Unrealistically, large sample sizes may be required to estimate the contribution of immigration well. To minimize the risk of overestimating the contribution of immigration (or any additional parameter) in IPMs, we recommend to: (a) look for evidence of variation in immigration before investigating its contribution to population growth, (b) simulate and model data for comparison to the real data and (c) use explicit data on immigration when possible.

AB  - Maternal separation in early life has a detrimental effect on the physiological and biochemical functions of the brains of offspring and can lead to anxiety-and depression-like behaviors later in life. Resveratrol possesses a variety of pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, and antidepressive effects. In rodents, resveratrol can attenuate anxiety-and depressionlike behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress, estrogen deficiency, and lipopolysaccharide. However, whether resveratrol administration during adolescence can counteract these behaviors when they result from maternal separation is unknown. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were separated from their mothers for 4 h per day from postnatal day 2 (PND 2) to PND 21; starting on PND 61, resveratrol was administered intraperitoneally at 40 mg/(kg/day 1) for 4 weeks. At 3 months of age, anxiety and depression-like behaviors were assessed in the male offspring using a series of tasks consisting of an open field test, an elevated plus maze test, a forced swimming test, and a tail suspension test. The hippocampal levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured by ELISA, while those of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 were determined by western blotting and PCR. The results showed that maternal separation led to increased anxiety-and depression-like behaviors, enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and downregulated the Sirt1/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in the male offspring; however, these effects could be reversed by treatment with resveratrol. Our findings suggested that resveratrol can ameliorate inflammation and anxiety-and depression-like behaviors induced by maternal separation via the activation of the Sirt1/NF-kappa B pathway.

AB  - Terpenes are vital metabolites found in various plants and animals and known to be beneficial in the treatment of various diseases. Previously, our group identified terpenes that increased the survival of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model flies expressing human amyloid beta (A beta) and identified linalool as a neuroprotective terpene against A beta toxicity. Linalool is a monoterpene that is commonly present as a constituent in essential oils from aromatic plants and is known to have anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antihyperlipidemia, antibacterial, and neuroprotective properties. Although several studies have shown the beneficial effect of linalool in AD animal models, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of linalool on AD are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we showed that linalool intake increased the survival of the AD model flies during development in a dose-dependent manner, while the survival of wild-type flies was not affected even at high linalool concentrations. Linalool also decreases A beta-induced apoptosis in eye discs as well as the larval brain. Moreover, linalool intake was found to reduce neurodegeneration in the brain of adult AD model flies. However, linalool did not affect the total amount of A beta 42 protein or A beta 42 aggregation. Rather, linalool decreased A beta-induced ROS levels, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in the brains of AD model flies. Furthermore, linalool attenuated the induction of oxidative stress and gliosis by A beta(1-42) treatment in the rat hippocampus. Taken together, our data suggest that linalool exerts its beneficial effects on AD by reducing A beta 42-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions.

AB  - Simple Summary Veterinary inspections in abattoirs are important in the surveillance of zoonotic diseases. This study is based on veterinary inspection reports providing data about the diseases and welfare issues of 231 million pigs slaughtered in 16 regions of Poland between 2009 and 2019. Over 80 million slaughtered pigs were found with pathological changes that could pose a risk to human health. The most frequently observed changes were abscesses, soiling, faecal or other contaminations, and congestions, together accounting for 77.6% of the total infections. Statistical approaches conducted with the use of long-term data can help identify the most problematic health and welfare issues in slaughterhouses. The results of this study showed that changes related to poor animal welfare (purulent foci, contamination, congestion) and parasitic diseases accounted for the majority of the identified cases of condemnation. Animal and meat inspections in abattoirs are important in the surveillance of zoonotic diseases. Veterinary inspections in abattoirs can provide useful data for the management of health and welfare issues of humans and animals. Using the network analysis and ordination technique, in this study, we analyzed the data from 11 years of veterinary inspections in pig slaughterhouses from 16 regions in Poland. Based on the huge data set of 80,187,639 cases of diseases and welfare issues of pigs, the most frequent livestock diseases were identified to be abscesses, soiling, faecal or other contaminations, and congestions, which together accounted for 77.6% of the total condemnations. Spatial and temporal differences in swine diseases between the Polish regions were recognized using the above-mentioned statistical approaches. Moreover, with the use of a quite novel method, not used yet in preventive veterinary medicine, called a heatmap, the most problematic disease and welfare issues in each region in Poland were identified. The use of statistical approaches such as network analysis and ordination technique allow for identification of the health and welfare issues in slaughterhouses when dealing with long-term inspection data based on a very large number of cases, and then have to be adopted in current veterinary medicine.

AB  - Hot melt adhesives (HMAs) are being widely used in many areas. However, their high activation temperature complicates the operation and restricts their application, especially in medical treatment. In this work, we designed a low-temperature activable oligo-urethane-3 (OU-3) adhesive with a carbon dioxide (CO2) based ester as the soft segment and UPy as the chain extender and terminator. Compared to the known HMAs, its activation temperature could be as low as 60 degrees C. With a glued area of only 3.75 cm(2), its lap shear strength on a stainless steel matrix could be as high as 7.23 MPa. Furthermore, the use of OU-3 as a skin dressing was also evaluated. After being heated using a hair dryer for similar to 10 s, the OU-3 film could be attached to a human elbow instantly and firmly. The skin dressing on the elbow area could be deformed with daily movement, and stably attached to the skin for at least 72 h. Its adhesion strength to pig skin could reach 30.7 kPa, proving its good stability on pig skin. The cytotoxicity, CCK-8, FGF2 level, water absorption and drug release experiments were also carried out to prove that the OU-3 dressing could absorb water while sustainably releasing the carried drugs in a safe way. After immersing in water for 15 min, the dressing automatically detached, which demonstrated good anti-water capability. Moreover, this implied that when its surface was fully wetted, OU-3 could auto-detach from the human skin, which could avoid secondary damage in medical treatment. Therefore, a prototype of an excellent skin dressing was demonstrated. Finally, the degradation of OU-3 in an enzymatic solution was also confirmed.

AB  - Among wildlife species, roe deer stands out as a valuable indicator of environmental pollution due to its ecological significance and role as a game animal. The assessment of poly- and perfluoro substances (PFASs) bioaccumulation is of the utmost importance, relying on the liver and muscles as the main organs of interest. The study concerned the identification of 60 PFAS through a non-target workflow analysis based on HPLC Q-Exactive Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry in a homogeneous group of 18 female roe deer species. The developed strategy allowed us to individuate the 60 PFAS compounds with different levels of confirmation. Apart from seven PFASs identified via analytical standards, the remaining fifty-three features were identified with CL 2 or 3. Moreover, by applying a differential statistic approach, it was possible to distinguish the bioaccumulation patterns in the liver and muscle, identifying 12 PFAS upregulated in the muscle and 20 in the liver. The analysis reveals that specific PFAS compounds present exclusively in either the muscle or in the liver. The study emphasises the specificity of the liver and muscle as significant bioaccumulation sites for PFAS, raising questions about the underlying mechanisms of this process. In conclusion, the presented non-targeted PFAS analysis workflow evidenced promising and reliable results, successfully demonstrating its feasibility in the field of environmental research.

AB  - The saponin beta-aescin from the seed extract of the horse chestnut tree Aesculus hippocastanum has demonstrated a beneficial role in clinical therapy which is in part related to its strong interaction with biological membranes. In this context the present work investigates the self-assembly of nm-sized discoidal lipid nanoparticles composed of beta-aescin and the phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). The discoidal lipid nanoparticles reassemble from small discs into larger discs, ribbons and finally stacks of sheets upon heating from gel-phase to fluid phase DMPC. The morphological transition of the lipid nano-particles is mainly triggered by the phospholipid phase state change. The final morphology depends on the phospholipid-to-saponin ratio and the actual temperature. The study is conducted by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission (TEM) and freeze fracture electron microscopy (FFEM) are used to cover larger length scales. Two different models, representing a disc and ribbon-like shape are applied to the SAXS data, evaluating possible geometries and molecular mixing of the nano-particles. The stacked sheets are analysed by the Caille theory.

AB  - Nonylphenol (NP) is a typical environmental endocrine disruptor with estrogenic effects. It serves as an emulsifier and as the main ingredient of detergents and has become an increasingly common pollutant in both fresh and salt water, vegetables, and fruits. This study aimed to clarify whether NP exposure could lead to cognitive dysfunction and synaptic plasticity impairment, and also explore the mechanism of microRNA (miR) 219a-5p regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in NP-induced synaptic plasticity impairment in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: blank control group (pure corn oil) and NP-exposed group [NP 80 mg/(kg center dot d)], with 15 rats in each group. In vitro, the extracted hippocampal neurons were divided into 6 groups: blank control group, mimics NC group, miR-219 mimics group, NP group (70 mu mol/L NP), NP + mimics NC group, and NP + miR-219 mimics group. In vivo, the content of NP in hippocampal tissues after 90 days of NP exposure was significantly higher in the NP-stained group than in the blank control group. NP exposure could lead to a decrease in the ability to learn and memory, ability to remember, and space spatial memory ability in rats. The dendrites in the NP-stained group were disordered, with few dendritic spines and significantly decreased dendritic spine density. The postsynaptic densities were loosely arranged, the thickness and length of the postsynaptic densities shortened, and the length and width of the synaptic gap increased. Glutamine (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents in hippocampal tissues decreased in the NP-stained group. The expression of miR-219a-5p mRNA decreased in the NP-stained group after 3 months of NP exposure. The expression of NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, nerve growth-associated protein (GAP-43), and Ca/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) mRNA/proteins decreased in the NP-stained group. In vitro, NMDAR protein expression decreased, while GAP-43 and CaMKII protein expression increased in the miR-219 mimics group compared with the control group. The expression levels of NMDAR and GAP-43 and CaMKII proteins were higher in the NP + miR-219 mimics group compared with the NP group. The levels of neurotransmitters Glu and GABA decreased in the NP and NP + mimics NC groups compared with the blank group. Shortened synaptic active band length, decreased thickness of postsynaptic densities, and shortened length of postsynaptic densities were observed in the NP, NP + mimics NC, and NP + miR-219 mimics groups compared with the blank control group. In vivo, NP exposure reduced learning memory capacity and neurotransmitter content in rats and caused a decrease in dendritic spine density and synaptic number density and a decrease in miR-219a-5p expression. In vitro, high expression of miR-219a-5p inhibited the expression of NMDAR, thus reducing the effect of NP on synaptic plasticity impairment in hippocampal neurons. Our study provided a scientific basis for the prevention of cognitive impairment owing to NP exposure and the development of targeted drug treatment strategies.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV) induce similar clinical signs in infected pigs, including hyperthermia, anorexia, hemorrhage, respiratory distress, neurological symptoms, and/or abortions in pregnant sows. The differential diagnosis of these diseases relies on laboratory examinations. In this study, a quadruplex RT-qPCR was established using four pairs of specific primers and probes aimed at the B646L (p72) gene of ASFV, the 5 ' untranslated region (5 ' UTR) of CSFV, the ORF6 gene of PRRSV, and the gB gene of PRV for the detection and differentiation of ASFV, CSFV, PRRSV, and PRV. The assay exhibited great sensitivity with limits of detection (LODs) of 134.585, 139.831, 147.076, and 142.331 copies/reaction for ASFV, CSFV, PRRSV, and PRV, respectively. The assay exclusively identified ASFV, CSFV, PRRSV, and PRV, yielding negative results for the other control swine viruses used in this study. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were not higher than 1.12%, indicating good reproducibility of the assay. The quadruplex RT-qPCR assay was used to analyze 3116 clinical tissue samples from pigs in Guangxi province, China, from April 2023 to September 2024. ASFV, CSFV, PRRSV, and PRV had positivity rates of 10.84% (338/3116), 0.80% (25/3116), 14.92% (465/3116), and 1.38% (43/3116), respectively, demonstrating a coincidence rate of >= 99.45% with the previously described RT-qPCR assays, which were also used to test these same samples. The established assay was rapid, sensitive, and accurate in detecting and differentiating ASFV, CSFV, PRRSV, and PRV.

AB  - Various conditions that affect the muscles, blood arteries, heart, valves, or internal electrical pathways that regulate muscle contraction are referred to as "heart diseases." This work propose a new heart disease prediction model. The three main steps of the suggested framework are feature extraction, proposed dimensionality reduction, and proposed optimal ensemble-based heart disease prediction. Here, the most crucial components of the collected input data were extracted first. For accurate prediction, a significant number of features have been retrieved. Using Normalized Mutual Information induced Principal Component Analysis (NM-PCA), a novel feature dimension reduction technique has been proposed to overcome these problems. The dimensionally reduced features obtained by NM-PCA are simultaneously trained by the SVM, RF, and KNN classifiers. The improved optimized RNN generates the final prediction result. This optimized RNN is trained using the relevant outputs from SVM, RF, and KNN. Deer Updated Moth flame Optimization is used to adjust the weight function of the optimized RNN since it makes the ultimate judgment (DUMFO). After utilizing DUMFO, the RNN's prediction accuracy has greatly increased. The Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (DHO) and the Moth Flame Opti-mization (MFO) algorithms are combined to generate the DUMFO. Finally, using both positive and negative criteria, the performance of the suggested methodology is compared to existing, methodologies. The accuracy of the projected model is 47.3%, 45.2%, 57.8%, 36.8%, 26.3%, 14.7%, 16.8%, 5.12% and 3.15% superior to existing models like DBN, NN, CNN, LSTM, PM-LU, GA, SMO+EC, SSO+EC, BOA+EC, WOA+EC, MFO+EC and DHOA+EC, respectively.

AB  - Childhood psychological trauma appears to sensitize stress-related neuroinflammatory systems to increase later vulnerability for depression and other stress-related mental disorders. Isolation of guinea pig pups from the maternal attachment figure for 3 h in threatening surroundings leads to a sensitization of inflammatory-mediated, depressive-like behavior and fever during later isolations. A previous study found the non-selective COX inhibitor naproxen administered before the initial isolation moderated depressive-like behavior and its sensitization. Here, we examined effects of naproxen given following early isolation. Male and female guinea pig pups surgically implanted with telemetry devices to measure core temperature were isolated for 3 h on 2 consecutive days near weaning (first isolation Day 20-24). Several days later, they began 4 consecutive days of injection with either saline vehicle or 10 or 20 mg/kg naproxen prior to a third isolation in early adolescence, that is, 10 days after their first isolation. Across the first two isolations, depressive-like behavior and fever sensitized. Both doses of naproxen attenuated depressive-like behavior during the third isolation. Fever was unaffected. Results suggest prostaglandin mediation of sensitization of depressive-like behavioral, but not febrile, responses to subsequent isolation. Findings also support further study of anti-inflammatory treatments to mitigate lasting consequences of early-attachment disruption.

AB  - Simple Summary Two recent transmission chains of PRRSV-2-associated cases were documented in this study using field epidemiological and molecular genetic tools. The investigation highlighted the risks associated with the free movement of livestock in the European Union. To minimize this risk of re-infection of PRRS-free herds with PRRSV through animal imports, it is recommended that pigs are transported directly from the exporting holdings without the involvement of transit stations. Alternatively, the transit stations could be converted so that pigs in transit avoid contact with each other, thus preventing exposure to PRRSV infection.Abstract This study reports on the molecular epidemiology of Ingelvac-PRRS-MLV-associated cases in Hungary for the period 2020-2021. Field epidemiology investigations led the experts to conclude that imported pigs, which were shipped through transit stations in Denmark, introduced the vaccine virus. The movement of fatteners and the neglect of disease control measures contributed to the spread of the virus to PRRS-free pig holdings in the vicinity. Deep sequencing was performed to genetically characterize the genes coding for the virion antigens (i.e., ORF2 through ORF7). The study isolates exhibited a range of 0.1 to 1.8% nucleotide sequence divergence from the Ingelvac PRRS MLV and identified numerous polymorphic sites (up to 57 sites) along the amplified 3.2 kilo base pair genomic region. Our findings confirm that some PRRSV-2 vaccine strains can accumulate very high number of point mutations within a short period in immunologically naive pig herds.

AB  - The expression of apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis markers in rat hippocampal cells after long-term intake of excessive fluoride (F-) doses was studied at transcriptional and translational levels. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups given 0.4 (control), 5, 20, and 50 mg/L F- (as NaF) with drinking water over 12 months. Changes in the content of effectors of mitochondrial (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3) and receptor (caspase-8, Fas) pathways of apoptosis, mediators (Ulk-1, Beclin-1) and modulators (AMPK, Akt, mTOR) of autophagy, as well as necroptosis effectors (RIP and MLKL), were assessed by immunoblotting, while the expression of Bcl2, Bax, Casp3, Ulk1, Beclin1, Prkaa1, Akt, and mTor genes-by real-time PCR. In the hippocampus of F--exposed animals, the expression ratio of Bcl2/Bax genes and Bcl-2/Bax proteins decreased, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated, but caspase-8 and Fas receptor levels remained stable. Long-term F- intake had no effect on the content of the autophagy initiator Ulk-1 and protein kinases AMPK, Akt and mTOR, but led to the inhibition of the key autophagy mediator Beclin-1. Expression levels of the necroptosis effectors RIP and MLKL in hippocampal cells of rats exposed to excessive F- doses did not change as well. Thus, long-term exposure to excessive F- was accompanied by the activation of apoptosis, mainly through the mitochondrial pathway, against the background of autophagy suppression.

AB  - Fasciola hepatica is a parasitic trematode that causes fasciolosis in sheep, provoking a decrease in their reproductive capacity, weight gain, meat and milk production, and wool quality. In the pathogenesis of F. hepatica, the penetration and migration of parasitic stages through the liver provoke intense inflammatory immune responses and tissue damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of Fascila hepatica-induced ovine NETs in exposed hepatocytes in vitro, and to analyze whether F. hepatica antigens (FhAg) trigger the release of ovine NETs under hypoxic conditions as well as the roles of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and CD11b in this cellular process in vitro. Here, isolated ovine PMNs were co-cultured with FhAg under hypoxia (5% O2) and NETs were visualized via immunofluorescence analyses, confirming their classical characteristics. The quantification of NETs in response to FhAg in hypoxic conditions significantly enhanced the formation of anchored and cell-free NETs (p < 0.01), and NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) significantly reduced their production (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of NETs on hepatic cells was determined by using a live/dead-staining with Sytox Orange, thereby demonstrating that FhAg-induced NETs are cytotoxic for hepatic cells (p = 0.001). We additionally analyzed PMN supernatants to determine the enzymatic activity of MMP-9, observing that FhAg exposure enhances MMP-9 release in ovine PMNs (p < 0.05) but not in bovine PMNs. Interestingly, by using flow cytometric analysis, we determined that the exposure of PMNs to FhAg does not increase the CD11b surface expression of ovine PMNs. This could be an effect of the activation of other surface receptors or transcription factors involved in F. hepatica-induced NETosis. Consequently, we hypothesize that F. hepatica-induced NETs play a role in the pathogenesis of fasciolosis, contributing to liver tissue damage if released in an uncontrolled manner.

AB  - Hershkovitzia Guimaraes & D'Andretta, 1956 belongs to Nycteribiidae (Diptera), a family of hematophagous and obligate ectoparasites of bats. Hershkovitzia parasitize bats in the Thyropteridae family, which includes only one genus, Thyroptera Spix, 1823. Hershkovitzia species mostly have a one-to-one association pattern with their hosts, except for H. cabala Peterson & Lacey, 1985 and Hershkovitzia autinoae sp. nov., which share the same host. A review is presented of the species known to date, i.e., H. primitiva Guimaraes & D'Andretta, 1956, H. coeca Theodor, 1967, H. inaequalis Theodor, 1967, H. cabala, and H. mariae Hrycyna, Santos, Rebelo & Graciolli, 2022, and a new species, H. autinoae sp. nov., is described herein. A parsimony analysis of Hershkovitzia was carried out based on a matrix of morphological characters. A cophylogenetic analysis of these parasites and their hosts was performed using a phylogeny of Thyroptera based on a modified version of a previously-published character matrix. As a result, both Hershkovitzia and Thyroptera are monophyletic. Hershkovitzia was divided and organized into two morphological groups based on its phylogeny. As the host of H. coeca is not known, five hypothetical coevolutionary scenarios were performed with each species of Thyroptera. For each coevolutionary scenario only one solution was generated, and all scenarios indicate that the hypothetical ancestor of Hershkovitzia emerged together with the hypothetical ancestor of Thyroptera. An identification key to Hershkovitzia species is presented together with schematic drawings of the abdomen, head, and legs of each species.

AB  - Background A growing number of non-dermatophytic moulds and yeasts with the ability to act as human pathogens are reported every year. Dematiaceous fungi cause phaeohyphomycosis which encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from superficial (cutaneous and subcutaneous) to disseminated infections. Such fungal infections are responsible for causing significant morbidity and mortality, frequently in immunocompromised patients and rarely in immunocompetent patients. Objectives To investigate the prevalence of cutaneous mycosis in Jammu district (India) and to isolate and identify the recovered causal agents from the affected skin of the patients. Methods For direct microscopy, 10% KOH was used. Skin samples were collected carefully from the affected areas of suspected patients, followed by the isolation and identification of the causal agents by cultural examination, morphological examination and ITS sequencing. Results Herein, we report and describe three new cases of cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis from District Jammu of Union Territory Jammu and Kashmir, India. The age of the patients under study ranged from 17 to 42 years and the duration of infection from 1 to 2 years. The etiological agents that were recovered from the patients under study were Alternaria alstromeriae, Epicoccum tritici and Phialemonium obovatum. These dematiaceous fungal species were isolated from the skin specimen of immunocompetent hosts. Conclusion Among the three isolated etiological agents, two (Alternaria alstromeriae, Epicoccum tritici) represent new global records and one (Phialemonium obovatum) new record to India as causal agents of cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis. Careful microscopic and mycological examination form the basis of correct diagnosis of such fungal infections in the absence of simple and reliable laboratory tests (serologic or antigen tests).

AB  - Filtered kretek cigarette smoke is a gas that contains solid components ( particulates). Carcinogenic chemicals are present in this type of cigarette smoke. Furthermore, it is said that tobacco has a major negative impact on cerebral structure development, creates addiction, and alters brain activity and function. The purpose of this study was to see how filtered kretek cigarette smoke affected the density of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex. An experimental and control group design was used for the study. Group 1 (6 rats) is the control group, and the rats breathe normally. Group 2 (6 rats) was exposed to filtered kretek cigarette smoke at a rate of one stick per day for three months. Pyramidal cells in the rat cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex were studied. Pyramidal cells were expected to be distributed in the cerebral cortex at the hippocampus area of rats in group 1. In contrast, the density of pyramidal cells decreased in group 2. The number of pyramidal cells in the rat cerebral cortex differed significantly between groups 1 and 2 (p<0.001). Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex in group 1 were normal, whereas Purkinje cells in group 2 were degenerated. The distance between Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex was greater in group 1 than in group 2 (p<0.001). Rats exposed to 1 stick of Kretek cigarette smoke each day for 3 months had lower pyramidal cell density in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The same result happened: one stick of Kretek cigarette smoke each day for three months reduced Purkinje cell density in the cerebellar cortex.

AB  - This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), and Pueraria mirifica herb extract (PME; an alternative source of natural estrogens) on the (i) learning and memory in androgen-deficient male rats, and on the hippocampus expression levels of (ii) mRNA of genes associated with synaptic transmission and structure, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid plaques, and (iii) total and phosphorylated tau proteins. The four-month-old male rats were sham-operated or orchidectomized (ODX). The ODX rats were divided into four groups, and orally treated for 2 months with either 1 mL/d of distilled water or 100 mg/kg/d of PME; or subcutaneously injected with 1 mg/kg/d of DHT or 80 mu g/kg/d of E2. The impairment of spatial learning behavior and memory capacity in the ODX rats was prevented by DHT, E-2, and PME. Recovery of the orchidectomy-induced deterioration of the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of rats was ranked as E-2 >= PME > DHT. Both DHT and PME mitigated the increased Tau3 and Tau4 mRNA levels, and Tau-5 and P-Tau Ser(396) protein levels more than E-2 (DHT >= PME > E-2). Only DHT tended to decrease App mRNA expression level. In conclusion, DHT showed a stronger efficacy for mitigation of the impaired spatial learning behavior and memory capacity in androgen-deficient male rats compared to E-2 and PME, and their mechanisms of action are slightly different.

AB  - The incidence rate of stress ulcers has increased in recent years, with an increase in life pressure, unavoidable trauma and other factors. The therapy of acute stress ulcers has always been an important challenge. Carbon dots (CDs) have been reported to show excellent biological activities, but research on the stress ulcer curative effect of CDs is unprecedented. Here, we prepared a series of semi-carbonized nanodots (SCNDs) from natural plants or herbs as precursors and the as prepared SCNDs were later proved to be effective in the treatment and inhibition of stress gastric ulcers in a rat model. One kind of SCND from edible and medicinal plants, charred Atractylodes macrocephala (SCNDs-1), is demonstrated in detail for its strong anti-stress gastric ulcer effect with inhibition up to 90% and shows extremely high biocompatibility and ultra-low toxicity. These SCNDs lead to the reduction of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress, and the protection of the gastric mucosa. The SCNDs also reduce the excessive neuroendocrine response caused by stress, regulate the energy metabolism and the structure of intestinal flora, improve the damage to the body caused by the stress state, thus alleviating the occurrence of stress-induced gastric ulcers. This work provides new insights into the preparation of carbon nanomaterials from natural plants through a semi-carbonization process and opens new ways to apply bio-active and bio-safe SCNDs in the modern pharmaceutical field.

AB  - Introduction Accurate post-mortem interval (PMI) estimation is essential in forensic investigations. Although various methods for PMI determination have been developed, only an approximate estimation is still achievable, and an accurate PMI indication is still challenging. Therefore, in this study, we employed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics to assess post-mortem changes in porcine blood samples collected with and without the addition of anticoagulant (EDTA). Our study aimed to identify metabolites dependent on the EDTA addition and time (taking into account the biodiversity of the studied organism) and those that are time-dependent but resistant to the addition of an anticoagulant.Methods The experiment was performed on blood samples collected from 16 animals (domestic pig, breed: Polish Large White), 8 with and 8 without EDTA addition. The moment of death (time 0) and 15 additional time points (from 3 to 168 h after death) were selected to examine changes in metabolites' levels in specific time intervals. We employed linear mixed models to study the relationship between metabolite intensities, time and presence of EDTA while accounting for the effect of individual pigs.Results and Discussion We confirmed that the intensity of 16 metabolites (mainly amino acids) significantly depends on PMI and the presence of EDTA. However, the intensity of the ideal biomarker(s) for PMI estimation should be determined only by the time after death and not by external factors such as the presence of the anticoagulant agent. Thus, we identified 41 metabolites with time-dependent intensities that were not susceptible to EDTA presence. Finally, we assessed the performance of these metabolites in a PMI predictive model. Citraconic acid yielded one of the lowest errors in general PMI estimation (32.82 h). Moreover, similar errors were observed for samples with and without EDTA (33.32 h and 32.34 h, respectively). Although the small sample size and information leak in predictive modelling prevent drawing definite conclusions, citraconic acid shows potential as a robust PMI estimator.

AB  - The decarbonization of production chains has focused on a more sustainable future with minor damage to the environment and protection of natural resources through existing waste while promoting economic development. Adopting public policies has encouraged circular approaches such as the waste to energy (WtE). Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been the most studied WtE strategy to help to reach the objectives in the agriculture sector. The swine waste represents an essential source of energy that can be converted into biogas by this treatment. The multiplicity of uses of the AD product (biogas) is strongly related to the environmental viability of the adopted technology. Hence, this study evaluates the environmental viability of five treatment biogas plants using residues from Brazilian swine production through a life cycle assessment (LCA), comparing the generation of electricity and biomethane as critical paths to promote change in the national energy matrix and increase decarbonization in the agricultural sector. Based on the results, both strategies prove to be environmentally favourable for mitigating environmental impacts caused during waste handling. Electricity generation can mitigate 100% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while biomethane production mitigates up to 114% of GHG emissions. Furthermore, the configuration of biogas production plants proves to be an exciting strategy to assist the treatment of waste generated in the context of small productive properties, making the adoption of this treatment economically feasible.

AB  - Intercropping, as a common worldwide cultivation pattern, provides opportunities for sustainable agriculture with fuller use of light, temperature and land resources and greater yield per unit of land. The intercropping impact on crop quality is a current focus. This study found that shading cultivation of purple-fleshed sweet potato can improve the storage root pigment accumulation by more than 20% to increase economic benefits. We performed gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis of storage roots of the anthocyanin-enriched cultivar Jihei-1 under 60% shading and nonshaded treatments. A total of 224 differential metabolites were identified, among which N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, 1-monopalmitin, 4-pyridoxic acid, dodecano, arbutin, tryptophan, citrulline and phenylalanine were significantly upregulated under shading with a more than 10-fold change. Furthermore, metabolic pathway enrichment maps were based on the biological processes and stratification level selected. These metabolites mainly influenced the pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the citrate cycle, organic acid biosynthesis and metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Through tissue-specific dynamic changes in amino acids, soluble sugars, starch and anthocyanins during storage root development, we proposed a variety-specific strategy of purple-fleshed sweet potato in response to prolonged deep shading, that is, utilizing and enhancing broad aboveground-tissue photosynthesis and transferring photosynthates into roots in advance, leading to a rapid increase in storage root anthocyanin synthesis. With comprehensive qPCR, western blot and enzyme activity analyses, we identified three key enzymes, CHS, ANS and 3GT, in purple-fleshed sweet potato storage roots in response to shading, which affect the root anthocyanin content by influencing the flavonoid metabolism pathway. This study provides a theoretical basis for revealing the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis in crops and a guidance for high-quality sweet potato cultivation and nutritional improvement using shade facilities.

AB  - The destructive aphid (Sitobion avenae) of wheat, generally accomplished by chemical pesticides, is responsible for the substantial agricultural damages that occur annually. The present experimental study, a protein elicitor, PeBL1, has been examined for the possibility of inducing a defense response to S. avenae in wheat. In comparison to the positive (Water) and negative 70.58 mu g ml(-1) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) controls, the population growth (intrinsic Increase) rates of S. avenae (second and third generation) with PeBL1-treated wheat seedlings declined. S. avenae preferred control plants for colonizing in an experiment with the host selection compared with the PeBL1-treated wheat plants, with PeBL1 treated wheat seedlings; the nymphal development time of aphid has been extended. In comparison with positive (water) and negative controls, less fecundity was observed with less offspring's in PeBL1-treated wheat seedlings. S. avenae had a harmful surface environment for wheat seedlings treated with PeBL1, caused by trichomes and wax formation. The level of Jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) was significantly higher, and the PeBL1 treated wheat seedlings had significant accumulations. The findings presented that PeBL1 considerably altered the wheat surface structure so that the replication of S. avenae was minimized and colonization was prevented. Defensive processes also include pathway activation (JA, SA, and ET). A biocontrol study for the use of PeBL1 in the protection against S. avenae has been produced in this area.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the efficiency of the production of cloned transgenic Yucatan miniature pigs (YMPs) using two recipient breeds, i.e., YMPs and domestic pigs (DPs), under various embryo transfer conditions. We initially assessed the in vitro developmental competence of embryos obtained via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) from three different transgenic donor cells. No difference was observed among the three groups regarding developmental competence. Furthermore, the cloning efficiency remained consistent among the three groups after the transfer of the SCNT embryos to each surrogate mother. Subsequently, to compare the efficiency of the production of cloned transgenic YMPs between the two recipient breeds using varying parameters, including ovulation status (preovulation and postovulation), duration of in vitro culture (IVC) (incubated within 24 h and 24-48 h), and the number of transferred SCNT embryos (less than and more than 300), we assessed the pregnancy rates, delivery rates, mean offspring counts, and cloning efficiency. Regarding the ovulation status, YMPs exhibited higher pregnancy rates, delivery rates, and cloning efficiency compared with DPs in both statuses. Moreover, the pregnancy rates, delivery rates, and cloning efficiency were affected by the ovulation status in DPs, but not in YMPs. The comparison of IVC duration between groups revealed that YMPs had higher pregnancy rates vs. DPs in both conditions. SCNT embryos cultured for 24-48 h in YMPs yielded higher delivery rates and cloning efficiency compared with those cultured for less than 24 h in DPs. Finally, the analysis based on the number of transferred SCNT embryos showed that both the pregnancy and delivery rates were higher in YMPs vs. DPs. However, the highest average number of offspring was obtained when more than 300 SCNT embryos were transferred into DPs, whereas the cloning efficiency was higher in YMPs vs. DPs. Our results suggest that YMPs are more suitable recipients than are DPs under various conditions for the production of cloned transgenic YMPs.

AB  - N-doped carbon fibers (NCFs) were in situ prepared by Camellia sinensis branches waste through hydrothermal carbonization with urea/ZnCl2 at 160-280 degrees C under 0.8-8.9 MPa. The structural characteristics of NCFs were investigated by elemental analysis, SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, Raman spectra, and BET surface area. The highest N content of NCFs obtained at 280 degrees C was 8.96%, and the main forms of doped N were pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N. Moreover, NCFs were applied to remove metal ions successfully. The results showed that NCF-240 had the maximum adsorption amounts of 106.52, 125.23, and 153.49 mg/g for Cu2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+, respectively, while NCF-280 had the best removal ability on Cr6+ (145.67 mg/g). Finally, it demonstrated that the adsorption behavior of NCFs was well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm models.

AB  - Simple Summary Domestic and non-domestic ruminants indiscriminately ingest plastics, such as hay netting, typically developed from polyethylene. Due to their indigestible nature, plastics accumulate in the rumen when ingested and animal health and production problems arise. Therefore, it is necessary to find biodegradable materials that will break down in the rumen when consumed to replace polyethylene. In pursuit of this, we fed twelve Holstein bull calves capsules containing a biodegradable polymer, polyethylene, or nothing for 30 d and evaluated animal health. At the end of the 30 d, animals were euthanized to evaluate the rumen for potential damage and to characterize polymer residues in rumen contents. No calves presented any signs related to the building up of polymer in the rumen and animal health was not affected by any treatment. Calves that received polyethylene retained 7% of the total dosed material, while calves that received the biodegradable polymer retained less than 1%. The biodegradable residues were fragmented to 10% of their original size. Based on our results, we suggest that agricultural plastics developed from biodegradable polymers may be a potential alternative to conventional plastics in the case of animal ingestion due to their improved ruminal degradation and decreased accumulation in the rumen compared to conventional polyethylene. Due to the occurrence of plastic impaction in ruminants and its deleterious effects on health and production, it is necessary to determine the suitability of biodegradable polymers to replace polyethylene-based agricultural plastics, such as hay netting. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clearance of a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) melt-blend polymer from the rumen when fed to cattle and subsequent animal health. Twelve Holstein bull calves were dosed with an encapsulated 13.6 g of PBSA:PHA (Blend), 13.6 g of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), or four empty gelatin capsules (Control) for 30 d. The feed intake, body weight, and body temperature were evaluated, and hemograms were run on d 0 and d 30. On d 31, calves were euthanized to evaluate gross rumen measurements and pathology, papillae length, and polymer residues in rumen contents. No calves presented any signs related to plastic impaction. The feed intake; body weight; rectal temperature; hematological parameters; gross rumen measurements and pathology; and rumen pH and temperature were not affected by treatments. Calves dosed with LDPE had 27 g of undegraded polymer retained in the rumen while Blend calves had only 2 g of fragmented polymers that were 10% of their original size. Agricultural plastics developed from PBSA:PHA may be a suitable alternative to LDPE-based products in the case of animal ingestion and may reduce the incidence of plastic impaction.

AB  - Early life Western diet (WD) consumption leads to impaired memory function, particularly for processes mediated by the hippocampus. However, the precise critical developmental window(s) during which WD exposure negatively impacts hippocampal function are unknown. Here, we exposed male and female rats to a WD model involving free access to a variety of high-fat and/or high-sugar food and drink items during either the early-adolescent period (postnatal days [PN] 26-41; WD-EA) or late-adolescent period (PN 41-56; WD-LA). Control (CTL) rats were given healthy standard chow throughout both periods. To evaluate long-lasting memory capacity well beyond the early life WD exposure periods, we performed behavioral assessments after both a short (4 weeks for WD-EA, 2 weeks for WD-LA) and long (12 weeks for WD-EA, 10 weeks for WD-LA) period of healthy diet intervention. Results revealed no differences in body weight or body composition between diet groups, regardless of sex. Following the shorter period of healthy diet intervention, both male and female WD-EA and WD-LA rats showed deficits in hippocampal-dependent memory compared to CTL rats. Following the longer healthy diet intervention period, memory impairments persisted in male WD-EA but not WD-LA rats. In contrast, in female rats the longer healthy diet intervention reversed the initial memory impairments in both WD-EA and WD-LA rats. Collectively, these findings reveal that early-adolescence is a critical period of long-lasting hippocampal vulnerability to dietary insults in male but not female rats, thus highlighting developmental- and sexspecific effects mediating the relationship between the early life nutritional environment and long-term cognitive health.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Larvae of the rhinoceros beetle (Allomyrina dichotoma) (ADL) are used ethnopharmacologically to treat gut-related disorders in Korea and China since 1596 and are also approved as a safe novel food with high nutritional value. Aim of the study: We investigated the protective effects of ADL extract against leaky gut disease using a Drosophila model and sought to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Materials and methods: We examined the protective effects of ADL extract (2 mg/mL) against the leaky gut disease using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced leaky gut Drosophila melanogaster model. Results: We found that oral administration of ADL extracts significantly increase the survival rate of DSS-fed Drosophila. Under conditions of DSS-induced gut damage, ADL extract reduced gut cell apoptosis and gut permeability, resulting in the maintenance of gut tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, we observed that oral administration of ADL extract can induce high levels of E-cadherin gene expression and also restored the original membrane localization of DSS-disrupted E-cadherin contiguous with the armadillo. Conclusion: We concluded that ADL extract plays an important role in maintaining gut homeostasis through the up-regulation of E-cadherin and that it may have a protective effect against leaky gut syndrome.

AB  - Amyloid (3 (A(3) is a central contributor to neuronal damage and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A(3 disrupts AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity, a key factor in early AD progression. Numerous studies propose that A(3 oligomers hinder synaptic plasticity, particularly long-term potentiation (LTP), by disrupting GluA1 (encoded by GRIA1) function, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that A(3 mediates the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in lipid raft domains of cultured cells, and GluA1 exhibits preferential localization in lipid rafts via direct binding to GM1. A(3 enhances the raft localization of GluA1 by increasing GM1 in these areas. Additionally, chemical LTP stimulation induces lipid raft-dependent GluA1 internalization in A(3-treated neurons, resulting in reduced cell surface and postsynaptic expression of GluA1. Consistent with this, disrupting lipid rafts and GluA1 localization in rafts rescues A(3-mediated suppression of hippocampal LTP. These findings unveil a novel functional deficit in GluA1 trafficking induced by A(3, providing new insights into the mechanism underlying AD-associated cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Enhancing forage protein is key to sustainable ruminant nutrition. The nutritive value of Hedysarum coronarium L. was investigated by studying different preservation systems (fresh vs. dehydrated pellet vs. hay) (Exp. 1) and morphological fractions (flowers vs. leaves vs. stems) (Exp. 2). For the fresh and pelleted systems, two cuts were used. Proximately, total polyphenols and condensed tannins were detected. In vitro fermentation characteristics were studied by incubating samples with buffered sheep rumen fluid, estimating methane production by volatile fatty acids. Fresh and pelleted sulla were more nutritionally advantageous than hay, in terms of metabolizable energy and protein-to-fiber ratio. Pelleting at the beginning of flowering proved to be a suitable forage for sheep feeding due to protein (15.1% DM), metabolizable energy (9.64 MJ/kg DM), structural carbohydrates (39.5% DM), and total polyphenols (13.5 GAE g/kg DM) content. This cut showed an in vitro fermentation rate (9.86 mL/h), organic matter degradability (55.7%), and volatile fatty acids (87.3 mmoL/g) that were higher (p < 0.05) than hay. Flowers and leaves showed higher (p < 0.05) levels of secondary metabolites than stems as well as lower methane production. These results suggest the potential influence of these compounds in reducing rumen emissions. Dehydration and pelleting resulted in an effective preservation method for maintaining nutrients in sulla forage.

AB  - In intensive farming, piglets are exposed to various challenges that activate intestinal inflammatory processes, negatively affecting animal health and leading to economic losses. To study the role of the inflammatory response on epithelial barrier integrity, co-culture systems that mimic in vivo complexity are more and more preferred over cell monocultures. In this study, an in vitro gut co-culture model consisting of intestinal porcine epithelial cells and porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells was established. The model provides an appropriate tool to study the role of the inflammatory response on epithelial barrier integrity and to screen for feed and food components, exerting beneficial effects on gut health. In the established model, inflammation-like reactions and damage of the epithelial barrier, indicated by a decrease of transepithelial electrical resistance, were elicited by activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells via one of 3 stimuli: lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, or concanavalin A. Two phytogenic substances that are commonly used as feed additives, licorice extract and oregano oil, have been shown to counteract the drop in transepithelial electrical resistance values in the gut co-culture model. The established co-culture model provides a powerful in vitro tool to study the role of intestinal inflammation on epithelial barrier integrity. As it consists of porcine epithelial and porcine blood cells it perfectly mimics in vivo conditions and imitates the inter-organ communication of the piglet gut. The developed model is useful to screen for nutritional components or drugs, having the potential to balance intestinal inflammation and strengthen the epithelial barrier integrity in piglets.

AB  - Simple Summary: Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in animals, accounting for 45-60% of the body weight of meat animals, and the growth and development of skeletal muscle has the most direct impact on lean meat percentage and muscle quality. Therefore, exploring the molecular regulation mechanism of skeletal muscle growth and development is an important basis for improving pig meat production performance, and it has also been a research focus in animal genetics in recent years. In this study, ChIP-seq and other methods were used to explore the transcriptional regulation mechanism of new transcription factor MAMSTR in pig skeletal muscle development, The results of this study can further reveal the regulatory mechanism of pig skeletal muscle growth and development, identify new genes related to pig skeletal muscle growth and development, and provide a better reference for pig-farming practices and breeding of high-quality meat pig breeds.Myocyte enhancer factor-2-activating motif and SAP domain-containing transcriptional regulator (MAMSTR) regulates its downstream through binding in its promoter regions. However, its molecular mechanism, particularly the DNA-binding sites, and coregulatory genes are quite unexplored. Therefore, to identify the genome-wide binding sites of the MAMSTR transcription factors and their coregulatory genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing was carried out. The results showed that MAMSTR was associated with 1506 peaks, which were annotated as 962 different genes. Most of these genes were involved in transcriptional regulation, metabolic pathways, and cell development and differentiation, such as AMPK signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, transcription coactivator activity, transcription coactivator binding, adipocytokine signaling pathway, fat digestion and absorption, skeletal muscle fiber development, and skeletal muscle cell differentiation. Lastly, the expression levels and transcriptional activities of PID1, VTI1B, PRKAG1, ACSS2, and SLC28A3 were screened and verified via functional markers and analysis. Overall, this study has increased our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of MAMSTR during skeletal muscle fibroblast development and provided a reference for analyzing muscle development mechanisms.

AB  - Tedera is a drought-tolerant perennial forage legume introduced in Australia in 2006. In October 2018, T15-1218 Lanza (R), the world's first tedera variety, was released by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development and Meat & Livestock Australia for commercial use. A key agronomic practise for the successful establishment and adoption of tedera is to have a robust herbicide package to control a range of grass and broadleaf weeds well tolerated by tedera. A total of 9 pre-emergent and 44 post-emergent herbicide treatments were evaluated in eight experiments from 2017 to 2021. To control grasses such as annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.), propyzamide and carbetamide can be recommended for pre- or post-emergent applications and butroxydim, clethodim, and haloxyfop for post-emergent applications. The broadleaf pre-emergent herbicides recommended are clopyralid to control emerged capeweed (Arctotheca calendula (L.) Levyns), fomesafen to control pre-emergent wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.), and the double mix of fomesafen + diuron, flumetsulam + diuron, and the triple mix of fomesafen + diuron + flumetsulam to control pre-emergent capeweed, pre- and post-emergent wild radish, and other broadleaf weeds. The most consistently well tolerated post-emergent herbicides by tedera seedlings and adult plants were diflufenican, diuron, flumetsulam, fomesafen, and their two- or three-way mixes that will provide good control of capeweed and wild radish. Desiccants such as paraquat or diquat were also well tolerated by 1-year-old tedera plants that recovered after being desiccated.

AB  - The Darwin-Bateman paradigm predicts that females enhance their fitness by being choosy and mating with high-quality males, while males should compete to mate with as many females as possible. In many species, males enhance their fitness by defending females and/or resources used by females. That is, males directly defend access to mating opportunities. However, paternity analyses have repeatedly shown that females in most species mate polyandrously, which contradicts traditional expectations that male defensive behaviours lead to monandry. Here, in an extensive meta-analysis, encompassing 109 species and 1026 effect sizes from across the animal kingdom, we tested if the occurrence of defensive behaviours modulates sexual selection on females and males. If so, we can illuminate the extent to which males really succeed in defending access to mating and fertilisation opportunities. We used four different indices of the opportunity for sexual selection that comprise pre-mating and/or post-mating episodes of selection. We found, for both sexes, that the occurrence of defensive behaviours does not modulate the potential strength of sexual selection. This implies that male defensive behaviours do not predict the true intensity of sexual selection. While the most extreme levels of sexual selection on males are in species with male defensive behaviours, which indicates that males do sometimes succeed in restricting females' re-mating ability (e.g. elephant seals, Mirounga leonina), estimates of the opportunity for sexual selection vary greatly across species, regardless of whether or not defensive behaviours occur. Indeed, widespread polyandry shows that females are usually not restricted by male defensive behaviours. In addition, our results indicate that post-mating episodes of selection, such as cryptic female choice and sperm competition, might be important factors modulating the opportunity for sexual selection. We discuss: (i) why male defensive behaviours fail to lower the opportunity for sexual selection among females or fail to elevate it for males; (ii) how post-mating events might influence sexual selection; and (iii) the role of females as active participants in sexual selection. We also highlight that inadequate data reporting in the literature prevented us from extracting effect sizes from many studies that had presumably collected the relevant data.

AB  - Vigna unguiculata L. and Phaseolus lunatus L. are legume species of great importance in Mexico's low-input systems such as Milpa. In these production systems both species are attacked by pests, such as Diabrotica spp. that reduce their yield and farmers do not have the supplies for timely pest management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of landrace accessions of V. unguiculata and P. lunatus against damage caused by Diabrotica spp. in field conditions, through leaf morphology traits, to identify indicators that allow the selection of accessions with a lower level of damage. Both legume species were planted in a randomized complete block design. Leaf damage (LD) and leaf morphological traits: leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), Toughness and thickness were determined. Analysis of variance showed differences among accessions for leaf damage and leaf morphological traits. The PCA analysis allowed identifying accessions 17YUCVA, 04CAMCL, 09CAMES, 07CAMCAL and 12CAMCHAM of V. unguiculata with lower LD related to SLA and accession 13QUICH related to Thickness, while in P. lunatus the accessions with lower LD were JMC1357, JMC1297 and JMC1304 related to Toughness. The defensive response differed among the legumes studied. Leaf morphological traits SLA and Thickness in V. unguiculata and Toughness P. lunatus will serve as morphological markers for the selection of resistant genotypes against Diabrotica spp. and accessions with lower LD can be used in breeding programs.

AB  - The high content of cyanogenic glycosides (CG) in cassava tubers affects food safety. CG are involved in the plant growth and development and protect cassava leaves from herbivorous predators. However, the regulatory mechanism of CG biosynthesis remains poorly understood. Here, yeast one-hybrid assays were performed using a mixed cDNA library of cassava tubers and leaves as prey and the promoter of MeCYP79D2 as bait. MeCYP79D2, a cytochrome P450 protein, is the rate-limiting enzyme for CG synthesis in cassava. From this information, a candidate regulator of MeCYP79D2 was selected and identified as transcription factor MePHD1.2. MePHD1.2, located in the nucleus and exhibiting an inhibitory transcription activity directly bound to an AT-rich motif in the promoter of MeCYP79D2. In cassava, the transcriptional activity of MeCYP79D2 was considerably enhanced in mephd1.2 mutant lines leading to increased linamarin and lotaustralin contents. Deletion of MePHD1.2 promoted the production of CGs in cassava and decreased transcription inhibition on MeCYP79D2, exposing a novel regulatory module governing biosynthesis of CGs.

AB  - Simple Summary Wohlfahrtia magnifica, a flesh fly, parasitizes several warm-blooded vertebrates and causes severe traumatic myiasis, detrimental to animal welfare and the livestock industry across Eastern and Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and Western and Northeast Asia. Genetic control has emerged as an effective and promising alternative to insecticides for controlling insect pests. In this study, we isolated and characterized two sex-determination genes, W. magnifica transformer (Wmtra) and W. magnifica transformer2 (Wmtra2). These investigations may contribute to the establishment of genetically modified strains in W. magnifica. For example, the regulated first intron of Wmtra, a key component in the conditional female lethal transgenic systems, can be used to control the sex-specific expression of a pro-apoptotic gene, as developed for myiasis-causing blow flies, Lucilia cuprina and Cochliomyia hominivorax. Additionally, we performed a differential expression gene analysis between adult males and adult females and identified five candidate genes (vasa (vas), nanos (nanos), bicoid (bcd), Bicaudal C (BicC), and innexin5 (inx5)) from the female-biased gene set that could upregulate Cas9 expression in the germline in Cas9-based homing gene drive systems, as established in mosquitoes. In summary, the isolation and characterization of these genes provide a solid foundation for the development of genetic control programs against W. magnifica. Myiasis caused by Wohlfahrtia magnifica is a widespread parasitic infestation in mammals. The infested host suffers from damage as the developing larvae feed on its tissues. For the control of myiasis infestation, genetic methods have been shown to be effective and promising as an alternative to insecticides. Combining genome, isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq), and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, we isolated and characterized two sex-determination genes, W. magnifica transformer (Wmtra) and W. magnifica transformer2 (Wmtra2), whose orthologs in a number of insect pests have been utilized to develop genetic control approaches. Wmtra transcripts are sex-specifically spliced; only the female transcript encodes a full-length functional protein, while the male transcript encodes a truncated and non-functional polypeptide due to the presence of the male-specific exon containing multiple in-frame stop codons. The existence of five predicted TRA/TRA2 binding sites in the male-specific exon and the surrounding intron of Wmtra, as well as the presence of an RNA-recognition motif in WmTRA2 may suggest the auto-regulation of Wmtra by its own protein interacting with WmTRA2. This results in the skipping of the male-specific exon and translation of the full-length functional protein only in females. Our comparative study in dipteran species showed that both the WmTRA and WmTRA2 proteins exhibit a high degree of similarity to their orthologs in the myiasis-causing blow flies. Additionally, transcriptome profiling performed between adult females and adult males reported 657 upregulated and 365 downregulated genes. Functional analysis showed that among upregulated genes those related to meiosis and mitosis Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched, while, among downregulated genes, those related to muscle cell development and aerobic metabolic processes were enriched. Among the female-biased gene set, we detected five candidate genes, vasa (vas), nanos (nanos), bicoid (bcd), Bicaudal C (BicC), and innexin5 (inx5).
   The promoters of these genes may be able to upregulate Cas9 expression in the germline in Cas9-based homing gene drive systems as established in some flies and mosquitoes. The isolation and characterization of these genes is an important step toward the development of genetic control programs against W. magnifica infestation.

AB  - We have previously shown that high runner (HR) mice (from a line genetically selected for increased wheel-running behavior) have distinct, genetically based, neurobiological phenotypes as compared with non-selected control (C) mice. However, developmental programming effects during early life, including maternal care and parent-of-origin-dependent expression of imprinted genes, can also contribute to variation in physical activity. Here, we used cross-fostering to address two questions. First, do HR mice have altered DNA methylation profiles of imprinted genes in the brain compared to C mice? Second, does maternal upbringing further modify the DNA methylation status of these imprinted genes? To address these questions, we cross-fostered all offspring at birth to create four experimental groups: C pups to other C dams, HR pups to other HR dams, C pups to HR dams, and HR pups to C dams. Bisulfite sequencing of 16 imprinted genes in the cortex and hippocampus revealed that the HR line had altered DNA methylation patterns of the paternally imprinted genes, Rasgrf1 and Zdbf2, as compared with the C line. Both fostering between the HR and C lines and sex modified the DNA methylation profiles for the paternally expressed genes Mest, Peg3, Igf2, Snrpn, and Impact. Ig-DMR, a gene with multiple paternal and maternal imprinted clusters, was also affected by maternal upbringing and sex. Our results suggest that differential methylation patterns of imprinted genes in the brain could contribute to evolutionary increases in wheel-running behavior and are also dependent on maternal upbringing and sex.

AB  - Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) and Sitophilus granarius (L.) are major pests of stored wheat, Triticum aestivum (Linn.) and cause huge economic loss to it. This study aimed to evaluate the toxic and repellent effects of Camelina sativa (L.) extract using green synthesis of silver nanoparticles against O. surinamensis and S. granarius. The bioassays were performed by applying three concentrations (5, 10 and 15%) of C. sativa extract and 200, 300 and 500 ppm in case of silver nanoparticles. Mortality was recorded at 24, 48 and 72 h while repellency was noted after 12, 24, and 36 h of the post-treatment. After 72 h of exposure, the highest concentration of C. sativa extract (15%) caused mortality of 43.1 and 35.2% to O. surinamensis and S. granarius, respectively. In repellency bioassays, the extract of C. sativa caused 37.7 and 30.2% repellency against O. surinamensis and S. granarius after exposure period of 36 h. While the highest mortality of 60.1% was observed against O. surinamensis at highest concentration (500 ppm) of the silver nanoparticles of C. sativa extract compared to S. granarius (46.2%) at same concentration after exposure period of 72 h. Highest repellency (42.7%) was observed against O. surinamensis at 500 ppm of the silver nanoparticles of C. sativa extract compared to S. granarius (36.2%) at same concentration after exposure to 36 h. The results revealed that green synthesized silver nanoparticles from C. sativa extract proved effective and can be used as eco-friendly management strategy of O. surinamensis and S. granarius.

AB  - Photobiomodulation (PBM) or the use of red to near-infrared irradiation spectrum, is a non-invasive intervention that produces neurostimulatory effects and reaches benefits in several pathologies as well as in healthy subjects. The main objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of PBM in a rat brain network on basal state and functional activity during the execution of a reversal task. Twenty-eight rats were divided into four groups: control group (n = 7), control photobiomodulation group (n = 8), behavioural group (n = 6) and behavioural photobiomodulation group (n = 7). Reversal memory was assessed using a Morris water maze and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) was used as a brain metabolic activity marker. After five days of PBM, the control photobiomodulation group showed a decrease of CCO levels in the striatum, medial septum, entorhinal, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, mammillary nuclei and VTA. Both behavioural groups performed the task correctly, however, the behavioural photobiomodulation group displayed CCO reduction in some regions involved in the execution of the reversal task: septum, entorhinal, CA1, CA3, central amygdala and supramammilar, along with higher levels in accumbens. These results could show the effect of PBM on active brain networks. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate its effects in different brain networks that are involved in the execution of other memory tasks.

AB  - Simple Summary Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in nerve injury-induced changes, including the cellular redox state, greater disease severity, and reduced function. Most studies have demonstrated that the modulation of oxidative damage to neurons leads to improved survival and functional recovery. Deer antlers are considered a potent natural source of antioxidants. Thus, we examined the neurotherapeutic effect of Cervus elaphus sibericus in the axon regeneration and growth cone reformation of cortical neurons. The effect of three doses of C. elaphus sibericus on cortical neurons was determined in a hydrogen peroxide-induced injury model using immunocytochemistry, flow-cytometry, and real-time PCR. We found that C. elaphus sibericus effectively inhibited neuronal death following hydrogen peroxide-induced injury by significantly inhibiting oxidative stress and consequently promoting neuron repair and axon regeneration in cortical neurons. Cervus elaphus sibericus (CES), commonly known as deer antler, has been used as a medicinal herb because of its various pharmacological activities, including its anti-infective, anti-arthritic, anti-allergic, and anti-oxidative properties. However, the precise mechanisms by which CES functions as a potent anti-oxidative agent remain unknown; particularly, the effects of CES on cortical neurons and its neurobiological mechanism have not been examined. We used primary cortical neurons from the embryonic rat cerebral cortex and hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress and damage in neurons. After post-treatment of CES at three concentrations (10, 50, and 200 mu g/mL), the influence of CES on the neurobiological mechanism was assessed by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. CES effectively prevented neuronal death caused by hydrogen peroxide-induced damage by regulating oxidative signaling. In addition, CES significantly induced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin nerve growth factor, as well as regeneration-associated genes. We also observed newly processing elongated axons after CES treatment under oxidative conditions. In addition, filopodia tips generally do not form a retraction bulb, called swollen endings. Thus, CES shows therapeutic potential for treating neurological diseases by stimulating neuron repair and regeneration.

AB  - Plants can improve their resistance to feeding damage by insects if they have perceived insect egg deposition prior to larval feeding. Molecularanalyses of these egg-mediated defence mechanisms have until now focused on angiosperm species. It is unknown how the transcriptomeof a gymnosperm species responds to insect eggs and subsequent larval feeding. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestrisL.) is known to improve itsdefences against larvae of the herbivorous sawflyDiprion piniL. if it has previously received sawfly eggs. Here, we analysed the transcriptomicand phytohormonal responses of Scots pine needles toD. pinieggs (E-pine), larval feeding (F-pine) and to both eggs and larval feeding (EF-pine). Pine showed strong transcriptomic responses to sawfly eggs and-as expected-to larval feeding. Many egg-responsive genes werealso differentially expressed in response to feeding damage, and these genes play an important role in biological processes related to cell wallmodification, cell death and jasmonic acid signalling. EF-pine showed fewer transcriptomic changes than F-pine, whereas EF-treated angiospermspecies studied so far showed more transcriptional changes to the initial phase of larval feeding than only feeding-damaged F-angiosperms.However, as with responses of EF-angiosperms, EF-pine showed higher salicylic acid concentrations than F-pine. Based on the considerableoverlap of the transcriptomes of E- and F-pine, we suggest that the weaker transcriptomic response of EF-pine than F-pine to larval feedingdamage is compensated by the strong, egg-induced response, which might result in maintained pine defences against larval feeding.

AB  - BackgroundThis study is the first research to investigate the potential of grafting to induce tomato resistance to two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch. TSSM can cause up to 50% yield loss of tomato. The grafting technique permits the rapid adoption of biotic/abiotic stress resistance/tolerance from wild relatives as rootstock while preserving the scion's important horticultural characteristics. Although TSSM resistance is found in wild tomato relatives, particularly those with the Mi-1 gene, its effects as rootstocks on TSSM resistance remain uncertain. Tomato 'Nairouz F1' (lacking Mi-1) grafted onto six interspecific hybrids with Solanum habrochiates (harboring Mi-1/mi-1), including commercial rootstock 'Estamino' and 'Fortamino', along with hybrids between tomato 'VFN-14' and each of S. habrochiates AusTRCF312064 (R312064), AusTRCF312344 (R312344), CGN15391 (R15391), and LA1777 (R1777). In the 2019 and 2020 fall seasons, the grafted and ungrafted plants were assessed in a naturally TSSM-infested field. The population of TSSM movable stages on grafted and ungrafted plants was estimated one week after transplanting, and every two weeks for 11 weeks. To assess antixenosis and antibiosis resistance in tomato grafts, TSSM males and females were reared on leaves of grafts onto R312064 and R15391, along with ungrafted plants. TSSM bio-behaviors and two-sex life table parameters were assessed.ResultsGrafting onto interspecific hybrids, particularly R15391, R312064, and R312344, significantly lowered TSSM populations compared to commercial rootstocks and ungrafted plants. HPLC analysis revealed that grafting induced foliar synthesis of herbivore-repellent (antixenosis) and antibiosis phenolics, viz., chlorogenic acid in all grafts and syringic acid, pyrocatechol, and vanillin in certain grafts. Grafts-R312064 showed delayed TSSM development, lower survival rates, lower fecundity, and higher mortality. Grafts-R312064 also had a longer mean generation time (GT; 23.33 days) and a lower reproductive rate (R0: 14.63), leading to a slower intrinsic population growth rate (rm: 0.115) compared to ungrafted plants and grafts-R15391.ConclusionThe findings suggest tomato grafting onto rootstocks with the Mi-1 gene, particularly R312064, could reduce TSSM populations through induced antixenosis and antibiosis resistance mechanisms.

AB  - With the increase in keeping exotic companion mammals as pets, concerns about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on animal and human health are growing. Guinea pigs, a popular pet in Hong Kong and globally, have limited studies regarding antimicrobial culture and sensitivity results. We reviewed bacteriologic and antimicrobial sensitivity results from clinically ill pet guinea pigs from 2019 to 2023 using data from the City University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Of the 234 clinical samples from 22 veterinary clinics in Hong Kong, 134 (57.3%) showed positive bacterial growth, of which 23 (17.2%) showed mixed bacterial growth. In total, 156 bacterial isolates were identified. Gram-positive bacteria (n = 104, 66.7%) were most commonly recovered, representing 25 bacterial species, most commonly Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Corynebacterium spp. The majority of positive samples were from the integument (43.6%) and urinary tract (33.8%). A total of 85.9% of all isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, with over 40% of isolates exhibiting resistance to three or more antimicrobial agents, and 27.6% were multidrug resistant (resistant to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes). High resistance rates were observed for penicillin (45.6%), gentamicin (43.7%), doxycycline (42.1%), and azithromycin (36.3%). In contrast, isolates were highly susceptible to ceftazidime (84.1%), chloramphenicol (82.6%), ciprofloxacin (72.7%), and marbofloxacin (72.2%). These findings highlight the high frequency of AMR in this population of clinically ill pet guinea pigs in Hong Kong and the need for informed and judicious antimicrobial use.

AB  - Innovations related to animal care in livestock production increasingly rely on the automation of management procedures utilizing machines and robots. However, current solutions incorporate animals mainly passively, e.g. by measuring their health status and predicting their behavior. This approach neglects that animals are able to signal their needs actively and can thus provide information about their environment and cooperate in management tasks. The key to unlock this potential is to establish bidirectional communication between animals and machines. This can be achieved by automatically condition animals to show stimulus-controlled operant behavior. However, this automation of animal learning requires metrics for the learning progress that are applicable in a variety of contexts. We show that the current learning metrics are not transferable in this regard and propose a normalized precision metric as an alternative. This metric was utilized to analyze the learning performance of adult sows in an exemplary signal discrimination task, set in three fundamentally different training conditions. The results demonstrate that the normalized precision metric is unaffected by differences in the distribution of learned events. Moreover, it fulfills basic plausibility criteria for the assessment of animal learning that are not satisfied by other metrics, such as comparable start and end values under different conditions. This provides the precondition for a broader utilization of cooperative livestock farming -a new form of integrating animals in management tasks.

AB  - Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a chemical commonly used as a plasticizer to render polyvinyl chloride products more durable and flexible. Although exposure to DEHP has raised many health concerns due to the identification of DEHP as an endocrine disruptor, it is still used in consumer products, including polyvinyl chloride plastics, medical tubing, car interiors, and children's toys. To investigate the impact of early life exposure to DEHP on the ovary and testes, newborn piglets were orally dosed with DEHP (20 or 200 mg/kg/day) or vehicle control (tocopherol-stripped corn oil) for 21 days. Following treatment, ovaries, testes, and sera were harvested for histological assessment and measurement of steroid hormone levels. In male piglets, progesterone and pregnenolone levels were significantly lower in both treatment groups compared to control, whereas in female piglets, progesterone was significantly higher in the 20 mg group compared to control, indicating sexspecific effects in a non-monotonic manner. Follicle numbers and gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes and apoptotic factors were not altered in treated ovaries compared to controls. In DEHP-treated testes, germ cell migration was impaired and germ cell death was significantly increased compared to controls. Overall, the results of this study suggest that neonatal exposure to DEHP in pigs leads to sex-specific disruption of the reproductive system.

AB  - Lysosomes function not only as degradatory compartments but also as dynamic intracellular calcium ion stores. The transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) channel mediates lysosomal Ca2+ release, thereby participating in multiple cellular functions. The pentameric Ragulator complex, which plays a critical role in the activation of mTORC1, is also involved in lysosomal trafficking and is anchored to lysosomes through its LAMTOR1 subunit. Here, we report that the Ragulator restricts lysosomal trafficking in dendrites of hippocampal neurons via LAMTOR1-mediated tonic inhibition of TRPML1 activity, independently of mTORC1. LAMTOR1 directly interacts with TRPML1 through its N-terminal domain. Eliminating this inhibition in hippocampal neurons by LAMTOR1 deletion or by disrupting LAMTOR1-TRPML1 binding increases TRPML1-mediated Ca2+ release and facilitates dendritic lysosomal trafficking powered by dynein. LAMTOR1 deletion in the hippocampal CA1 region of adult mice results in alterations in synaptic plasticity, and in impaired object-recognition memory and contextual fear conditioning, due to TRPML1 activation. Mechanistically, changes in synaptic plasticity are associated with increased GluA1 dephosphorylation by calcineurin and lysosomal degradation. Thus, LAMTOR1-mediated inhibition of TRPML1 is critical for regulating dendritic lysosomal motility, synaptic plasticity, and learning.

AB  - Sexual conflict, the conflict between the evolutionary interests of females and males over mating, occasionally results in the evolution of traits favourable for one sex and adverse for the other. In this context, males can use sexual coercion to increase their mating success, at the expense of their female targets' mate choice. An increasing number of studies highlight a great diversity of male and female behaviours that serve as strategies and counter-strategies, respectively, to sexual coercion. Previous studies have reviewed the literature on infanticide but not the literature on forced copulation, sexual harassment, intimidation or punishment. This qualitative review synthesises the empirical evidence and draws a unified framework of the ecology of sexual coercion across animals, presenting male sexually coercive strategies and co-evolved female counter-strategies that can reduce coercion and its fitness costs. Using examples from insects to humans, it shows that different strategies of sexual coercion can lead to the evolution of similar counter-strategies. These counter-strategies include female promiscuity, deception of males (e.g. concealed ovulation or pseudo-oestrus), avoidance of certain males and association with others for protection, female aggregation to dilute coercion and ultimately physical resistance by single or allied females. Extending previous work, this review provides compelling evidence of sexually antagonistic coevolution amid sexual coercion. It also calls for future work to clarify, first, which individual traits are linked to greater coercion rates in males and a higher likelihood of receiving coercion in females and, second, any causal relationships between different strategies of sexual coercion and the evolution of different social and mating systems.

AB  - The hippocampus is an important part of the limbic system in the human brain that has essential roles in spatial navigation and cognitive functions. It is still unknown how gene expression changes in single-cell in different spatial locations of the hippocampus of Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to analyze the gene expression features of single cells in different spatial locations of mouse hippocampus, and to explore the effects of gene expression regulation on learning and memory mechanisms. Here, we obtained 74 single-cell samples from different spatial locations in a mouse hippocampus through microdissection technology, and used single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptome sequencing to visualize and quantify the single-cell transcriptome features of tissue sections. The results of differential expression analysis showed that the expression of Sv2b, Neurod6, Grp and Stk32b genes in a hippocampus single cell at different locations was significantly different, and the marker genes of CA1, CA3 and DG subregions were identified. The results of gene function enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated differentially expressed genes Tubb2a, Eno1, Atp2b1, Plk2, Map4, Pex5l, Fibcd1 and Pdzd2 were mainly involved in neuron to neuron synapse, vesicle-mediated transport in synapse, calcium signaling pathway and neurodegenerative disease pathways, thus affecting learning and memory function. It revealed the transcriptome profile and heterogeneity of spatially located cells in the hippocampus of PD for the first time, and demonstrated that the impaired learning and memory ability of PD was affected by the synergistic effect of CA1 and CA3 subregions neuron genes. These results are crucial for understanding the pathological mechanism of the Parkinson's disease and making precise treatment plans.

AB  - The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a key role in the cellular response to DNA damage. In response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), cultured cells exhibit oscillations of p53 levels, which impact gene expression and cell fate. The dynamics of p53 in vivo have only been studied in fixed tissues or using reporters for p53's transcriptional activity. Here we established breast tumors expressing a fluorescent reporter for p53 levels and employed intravital imaging to quantify its dynamics in response to DSB in vivo. Our findings revealed large heterogeneity among individual cells, with most cells exhibiting a single prolonged pulse. We then tested how p53 dynamics might change under high cell confluency, one factor that differs between cell culture and tissues. We revealed that highly confluent cultured breast cancer cells also show one broad p53 pulse instead of oscillations. Through mathematical modeling, sensitivity analysis, and live-cell imaging, we identified low levels of the phosphatase Wip1, a transcriptional target and negative regulator of p53, as a key contributor to these dynamics. Because high cell confluency better reflects the microenvironment of tissues, the impact of cell confluency on p53 dynamics may have important consequences for cancerous tissues responding to DNA damage-inducing therapies.

AB  - The tea leafhopper (Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda, 1952) is the predominant pest infesting tea and causes significant losses in yield. Plants have evolved multiple defense responses to protect themselves from insect herbivores. Camellia tetracocca, a kind of ancient tea with local popularity, is unique to southwest China. This ancient tea is often attacked by the tea leafhopper. However, there are no relevant reports on changes in volatile components and defense signaling pathways after Camellia tetracocca has been attacked by E. onukii. To reveal changes in the responses of the volatile components of C. tetracocca to E. onukii, the headspace sampling technique and GC-MS were adopted to determine and analyze the volatiles. Furthermore, to unveil the defense mechanisms of C. tetracocca in response to E. onukii, transcriptome analysis was applied to damaged tea leaves and healthy leaves. The GC-MS analysis showed significant increases in the linalool and (E)-2-hexenal contents. The transcriptome analysis revealed a set of core pest-responsive genes (3074 upregulated and 5098 downregulated). Most of the enriched pest-responsive genes are mainly involved in plant hormone signal transduction photosynthesis, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. A conjoint analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome indicated that N2-acetylornithine, D-malic acid, theogallin, fucosyllactose, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, fumarprotocetraric acid, and arabinogalactose have a significant correlation with LOC114279735, LOC114317534, LOC114282078, LOC114317768, and LOC114263181. This study lays a foundation for further research on the breeding and cultivation of insect-resistant germplasm resources for C. tetracocca and on the promotion and development of the plant.

AB  - The use of nonrepellent liquid termiticides against subterranean termites has long relied on the assumption that foraging termites in soils could transfer toxicants to nestmates to achieve population control. However, their dose-dependent lethal time can lead to rapid termite mortality in proximity of the treatment, triggering secondary repellency. The current study characterizes the dynamic nature of the "death zone," i.e., the area adjacent to soil termiticides that termites would avoid owing the accumulation of cadavers. Using whole subterranean termite laboratory colonies of Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) with 3 x 15 m foraging distances, fipronil was implemented at 1.5 m, 7.5 m, or 12.5 m away from colony central nests, emulating a corrective action against an termite structural infestation. For treatments at 7.5 m and 12.5 m, the death zone stabilized at an average of similar to 2.56 m away from the treatment after 40 d post-treatment, and colonies suffered as little as 1.5% mortality by 200 d post-treatment. Colonies located 1.5 m away from the treatment minimized the death zone to similar to 1.1 m and suffered as little as 23.5% mortality. Mortality only occurred within the first few days of treatment from initial exposure, as the rapid emergence of the death zone negated further transfer effects among nestmates over time. In some cases, foraging termites were trapped within the infested structure. While technically nonrepellent, fipronil becomes functionally repellent from the rapid mortality onset near the treatment. Even if diligently implemented to successfully protect structures, surrounding termite colonies are minimally impacted by fipronil soil treatments.

AB  - The survivorship of social insects is known to increase with group size, even in situations of stress, such as starvation and exposure to insecticides. However, in termites, studies have been undertaken only with workers, disregarding the possible effect of soldiers. The role of soldiers in the termite colonies goes beyond defense, mainly in Nasutitermes species. It is already known that soldiers initiate the foraging as well as improve the decision-making of food resources. Here, we evaluated the effect of group size and the presence of soldiers on exposure to sublethal doses of the insecticide imidacloprid in Nasutitermes corniger (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae). To do so, toxicity bioassays were undertaken initially to determine the dose of the insecticide required to kill 50% of the N. corniger population (LD50) to be used in the main experiments. Survival bioassays were then carried out with termite groups, with and without soldiers, in different sizes (6, 10, 14, 22, 26, 30 and 60), exposed and nonexposed to insecticide. In general, the mean time to death of termites increases linearly with group size. However, the mean time to death in groups with soldiers was significantly longer only in groups exposed to the insecticide. Our results indicate that soldiers can help to increase the tolerance of nasute termite groups to insecticides, in addition to the group size, as already shown in the previous study. The size of the group and social context could, therefore, modulate behavioral and/or physiological responses that enhance the ability to survive under stressful situations.

AB  - Exposure to light has been demonstrated to stimulate brain regions associated with cognition; however, investigations into its cognitive-enhancing effects have primarily focused on wild-type rodents. This study seeks to elucidate how bright light exposure mitigates cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia by examining its impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and its potential to alleviate sub-chronic MK-801-induced cognitive impairments in mice. Following three weeks of juvenile bright light exposure (5-8 weeks old), significant increases in proliferating neurons (BrdU+) and immature neurons (DCX+ cells) were observed in the dentate gyrus (DG) and lateral ventricle of MK-801-treated mice. Long-term bright light treatment further promoted the differentiation of BrdU+ cells into immature neurons (BrdU+ DCX+ cells), mature neurons (BrdU+ NeuN+ cells), or astrocytes (BrdU+ GFAP+ cells) in the hippocampal DG. This augmented neurogenesis correlated with the attenuation of sub-chronic MK- 801-induced cognitive deficits, as evidenced by enhancements in Y-maze, novel object recognition (NOR), novel location recognition (NLR), and Morris water maze (MWM) test performances. These findings suggest a promising noninvasive clinical approach for alleviating cognitive impairments associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The livestock sector is the main source of income for the inhabitants of many rural areas, but the environmental problems generated by this industry have led to the emergence of new regulations to make the sector more environmentally friendly. The aim was to identify suitable areas where the livestock sector could be developed, complying with all sectoral standards, and classify the outranking suitable municipalities according to socio-economic, sectoral, and environmental factors. Socio-economic, to make it a key sector for the development of rural areas with depopulation problems; sectoral, to avoid generating health risk; and environmental, to avoid risks of water pollution and degradation of natural and forest areas. The results showed that there was a clear correspondence between the most suitable areas for pig farming and areas with depopulation problems or where rural tourism had not been developed. This information allows the design of public management instruments to prioritise the development of the sector in these areas.
   The concentration of livestock production is problematic due to environmental concerns. European regulations are guiding the sector to become increasingly sustainable and, at the same time, maintaining the population in rural areas. The aim was to determine suitable areas in municipalities where livestock is presented as a market option. The methodology applied was based on the combination of multi-criteria methods and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, following three steps: removal of unsuitable zones by sectoral regulations (STEP 1); removal of unsuitable zones due to urban planning, and environmental recommendations (STEP 2); and evaluating the resulting areas depending on the importance of socio-economic, sectoral, and environmental characteristics. This study was based in a Spanish region with ongoing conflicts over land use on the coast but with a high number of rural municipalities at risk of depopulation in the interior. The results showed that 33% of the municipalities of the Valencian Community (VC) had suitable and outranking areas for the development of the swine sector. The 43 municipalities with the highest scores were because of the socio-economic factor and confirmed that suitable livestock development in municipalities with the highest risk of depopulation and low rural tourism activity was a key issue for development.

AB  - 16S rRNA gene sequence is the most common housekeeping genetic marker to study bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy. Therefore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has the potential to identify novel bacteria and diagnose bacteria. This study compared 16S rRNA gene sequencing with conventional PCR for bacterial identification and disease diagnosis. The bacterial community in healthy and diseased hosts was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is more sensitive than conventional PCR in detecting bacteria. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing is adequate to identify novel bacteria. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that most pathogenic bacteria persist in diseased or healthy hosts in different abundance. Pathogenic bacteria, such as well-known chicken pathogen Avibacterium paragallinarum, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, and Gallibacterium anatis, were identified as indicator species of diseased samples. Alpha diversity analysis showed that the healthy group species is significantly higher than in the diseased groups. Beta diversity analysis also demonstrated differences between healthy and infected groups. The study concluded that 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a more sensitive method for detecting pathogens, and microbiota analysis can distinguish between healthy and diseased samples. Eventually, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has represented the potential in human and animal clinical diagnosis and novel bacterial identification.

AB  - Purpose Ehrlichiosis is one of the tick-borne diseases, which is not only neglected in Pakistan but only a few reports have been documented throughout the globe. The purpose of this study is to highlight and report the neglected pathogen from bovines in Pakistan.
   Methods In this study, the pathogen was detected initially based on microscopy, followed by the molecular confirmation and phylogenetic analysis of the pathogen from bovines from south Punjab, Pakistan. The hematological parameters were also assessed in Ehrlichia positive and negative animals. The information of different disease determinants was analyzed by a logistic regression model on SPSS.
   Results The study has reported an 11.98% (23/192) prevalence of Ehrlichiosis from bovines. The prevalence was slightly more in cattle (13.5%) as compared to the buffaloes (10.4%). The previous tick's history and tick control methods were proved to be the key factors with the occurrence of the disease. The isolates from Pakistan Ehrlichia spp. Pakistan/31, 36, and 8 clustered with the isolates from the USA, Nicaraguan, France, South Africa, and Uganda. Platelet count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit were found significantly decreased in Ehrlichia affected animals when compared to the healthy bovines.
   Conclusion This is the first report of ehrlichiosis from bovines in Pakistan and will provide the roadmap for future research

AB  - Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB) is one of the most destructive potato pests that can quickly develop resistance to insecticides. Therefore, new safe and effective control strategies that are less susceptible to the development of resistance by CPB are urgently needed. Due to their complex mode of action, the likelihood of resistance development by target pests is generally low with antifeedants. In the present study, we assessed the effect of secondary metabolites of various Xenorhabdus bacteria species and strains on CPB adult feeding and on larval development. The metabolites were applied in the form of cell free supernatants (CFSs) from Xenorhabdus cultures. In bioassay 1, leaves treated with ten Xenorhabdus cultures were fed to CPB adults, and their feeding was assessed daily for one week. In bioassay 2, CPB egg masses were placed on the leaves treated with five bacterial cultures, and larval development to pupae was monitored. Out of the ten Xenorhabdus cultures tested, two strains exhibited a significant reduction in the feeding behavior of Colorado Potato Beetle adults, with reductions of up to 70% compared to the control. The effect of CFSs on larval development was variable, and when treated with X. khoisanae SGI 197, over 90% of larvae died in the first few days before reaching the 2nd instar, and complete mortality was achieved on the 8th day of the experiment. Our study is the first study to demonstrate the antifeedant effect of Xenorhabdus cultures towards herbivorous beetles, and the metabolites of these bacteria may have potential for CPB control. Clearly, the metabolites produced by X. khoisanae SGI-197 may be a promising tool for CPB larvae control with the potential to significantly decrease damage to potato plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Maintaining the health of sows in pig production poses a persistent and significant challenge that directly impacts sow reproductive performance as well as producer economics. Pectin, a dietary fiber with immense potential, was investigated in this study for its potential to enhance the health of pregnant sows. Throughout gestation, we supplemented the basic diet with 3% of low-ester pectin to examine its potential effects in pregnant sows. We collected and analyzed serum and fecal samples from the sows to evaluate their fecal microbiota, serum metabolites, and cytokines, aiming to provide fundamental data for pectin utilization in animal production.Abstract This study aimed to investigate the effects of the dietary fiber pectin on the gut microbiota and health of parturient sows. A total of 30 parity 5-7, multiparous gestation sows (Large White x Landrace) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups after mating: Con (control, basic diet) and Pec (pectin, 3%). The sows received the two diets during gestation, and all sows were fed the same standard basic diet during lactation. The results of beta-diversity showed that the composition of the gut microbiota was different in the Con and Pec groups. Compared with the sows in the Con group, the Pec sows showed a higher abundance of the gut bacteria Clostridium and Romboutsia and a lower abundance of harmful bacteria (Micrococcaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Dorea, Actinomyces). On the other hand, the SCFA plasma concentration was increased in the Pec group, while pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha) concentrations were decreased. In conclusion, the soluble dietary fiber pectin could improve the reproductive performance and health of sows by increasing the abundance of some commensal bacteria enhancing the metabolite SCFA levels and reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine plasma levels.

AB  - There are efficient sampling methods to accurately estimate behaviour with a moderate or long duration. For short behaviour, observing animals continuously is recommended although there is no recommended minimum observation time. In most studies, sampling method and observation time per day is determined by practical considerations. Thus, this study analysed the validity of behavioural observations in different observation periods using continuous sampling (CS) or time sampling (TS) based on biting behaviour. Tail-biting and ear-biting of weaned piglets in six pens were continuously observed for 12 h per day for 4 days to form a reference. Shorter observation periods of CS and TS were simulated by taking subsets of this reference. The amount of behaviour per hour of each observation period was compared to the reference and to other observation period of the same kind and length. Four different measurements were defined to calculate accuracy scores (AS; 0-1; higher values are better). Comparison to the reference shows better AS for observation periods with longer observation time in total (0.5 h of CS: 0.2; 6 h of CS: 0.6). Additionally, TS covers longer time periods without decreasing AS. However, focus on activity time results in an overestimation of irregular behaviour. Comparing AS among observation periods of the same kind and length show overall low agreement. This study indicated problems of different observation periods of CS and TS to accurately estimate behaviour. Therefore, validity of behavioural observations should be analysed in greater detail to determine optimal sampling methods.

AB  - Simple Summary Neurons produce kisspeptin, a peptide hormone that stimulates the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropin and regulate reproductive development. Granulosa cells exist in the ovaries of female animals, secreting hormone receptors and regulating follicular maturation and hormonal balance. The mechanism of regulation of the function of granulosa cells by kisspeptin is still unclear. miRNA-mRNA sequencing was performed on ovarian granulosa cells treated with kisspeptin in Tan sheep to determine the molecular pathways involved. The sequencing results revealed that eight miRNAs significantly differed between the experimental and control groups. The results also indicated that several miRNAs and their target genes regulate steroid production and cell proliferation. This study's findings will help further explore the molecular mechanism of kisspeptin in the regulation of the function of ovarian granulosa cells in Tan sheep. Kisspeptin is a peptide hormone encoded by the kiss-1 gene that regulates animal reproduction. Our studies revealed that kisspeptin can regulate steroid hormone production and promote cell proliferation in ovarian granulosa cells of Tan sheep, but the mechanism has not yet been fully understood. We speculated that kisspeptin might promote steroid hormone production and cell proliferation by mediating the expression of specific miRNA and mRNA in granulosa cells. Accordingly, after granulosa cells were treated with kisspeptin, the RNA of cells was extracted to construct a cDNA library, and miRNA-mRNA sequencing was performed. Results showed that 1303 expressed genes and 605 expressed miRNAs were identified. Furthermore, eight differentially expressed miRNAs were found, and their target genes were significantly enriched in progesterone synthesis/metabolism, hormone biosynthesis, ovulation cycle, and steroid metabolism regulation. Meanwhile, mRNA was significantly enriched in steroid biosynthesis, IL-17 signaling pathway, and GnRH signaling pathway. Integrative analysis of miRNA-mRNA revealed that the significantly different oar-let-7b targets eight genes, of which EGR1 (early growth response-1) might play a significant role in regulating the function of granulosa cells, and miR-10a regulates lipid metabolism and steroid hormone synthesis by targeting HNRNPD. Additionally, PPI analysis revealed genes that are not miRNA targets but crucial to other biological processes in granulosa cells, implying that kisspeptin may also indirectly regulate granulosa cell function by these pathways. The findings of this work may help understand the molecular mechanism of kisspeptin regulating steroid hormone secretion, cell proliferation, and other physiological functions in ovarian granulosa cells of Tan sheep.

AB  - Categorization is an adaptive cognitive function that allows us to generalize knowledge to novel situations. Converging evidence from neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological studies suggest that categorization is mediated by the basal ganglia; however, there is debate regarding the necessity of each sub-region of the basal ganglia and their respective functions. The current experiment examined the roles of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS; homologous to the head of the caudate nucleus) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS; homologous to the body and tail of the caudate nucleus) in category learning by combining selective lesions with computational modeling. Using a touchscreen apparatus, rats were trained to categorize distributions of visual stimuli that varied along two continuous dimensions (i.e., spatial frequency and orientation). The tasks either required attention to one stimulus dimension (spatial frequency or orientation; 1D tasks) or both stimulus di-mensions (spatial frequency and orientation; 2D tasks). Rats with NMDA lesions of the DMS were impaired on both the 1D tasks and 2D tasks, whereas rats with DLS lesions showed no impairments. The lesions did not affect performance on a discrimination task that had the same trial structure as the categorization tasks, suggesting that the category impairments effected processes relevant to categorization. Model simulations were conducted using a neural network to assess the effect of the DMS lesions on category learning. Together, the results suggest that the DMS is critical to map category representations to appropriate behavioral responses, whereas the DLS is not necessary for categorization.

AB  - Deliberate geophagia or sand-eating behaviour has been widely documented in herbivorous and omnivorous mammals, but never in large felids at captivity. Here we report a case of apparent lethal gastrointestinal impaction from sand intake in a 10-year-old captive Bengal tigress. After 2 days of anorexia and prostration the tigress was admitted to the University Veterinary Hospital with abdominal distension and diarrhoea and died shortly afterwards. A post-mortem examination revealed oesophageal perforation, abundant liquid in the stomach and pyloric obstruction due to the presence of compacted sand and some masses of poultry bones. It is hypothesized that geophagy (of sand) may have been a strategy to alleviate indigestion by consumption of rotten poultry carcasses, but evolved into a compulsive/obsessive-compulsive disorder over time, possibly due to a restricted and barren environment. Zoo animal welfare involves a series of challenges that include an adequate diet in quantity and presentation, as well as complex behaviours such as the motivation to ingest non-food substances under certain contexts during life in captivity.

AB  - The Roman High-(RHA) and Low-(RLA) avoidance rat lines/strains were generated through bidirectional selective breeding for rapid (RHA) vs. extremely poor (RLA) two-way active avoidance acquisition. Compared with RLAs and other rat strains/stocks, RHAs are characterized by increased impulsivity, deficits in social behavior, novelty-induced hyper-locomotion, impaired attentional/cognitive abilities, vulnerability to psychostimulant sensitization and drug addiction. RHA rats also exhibit decreased function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, increased functional activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system and a dramatic deficit of central metabotropic glutamate-2 (mGlu2) receptors (due to a stop codon mutation at cysteine 407 in Grm2-cys407*-), along with increased density of 5-HT2A receptors in the PFC, alterations of several synaptic markers and increased density of pyramidal "thin" (immature) dendntic spines in the PFC. These characteristics suggest an immature brain of RHA rats, and are reminiscent of schizophrenia features like hypofrontality and disruption of the excitation/inhibition cortical balance. RHA rats represent a promising heuristic model of neurodevelopmental schizophrenia-relevant features and comorbidity with drug addiction vulnerability.

AB  - The daily light/dark cycle affects animals' learning, memory, and cognition. Exposure to insufficient daylight illumination negatively impacts emotion and cognition, leading to seasonal affective disorder characterized by depression, anxiety, low motivation, and cognitive impairment in diurnal animals. However, how this affects memory, learning, and cognition in nocturnal rodents is largely unknown. Here, we studied the effect of daytime light illuminance on memory, learning, cognition, and expression of mRNA levels in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex, the higher -order learning centers. Two experiments were performed. In experiment one, rats were exposed to 12 L:12D (12 h light and 12 h dark) with a 10, 100, or 1000 lx daytime light illuminance. After 30 days, various behavioral tests (novel object recognition test, hole board test, elevated plus maze test, radial arm maze, and passive avoidance test) were performed. In experiment 2, rats since birth were raised either under constant bright light (250 lx; LL) or a daily light-dark cycle (12 L:12D). After four months, behavioral tests (novel object recognition test, hole board test, elevated plus maze test, radial arm maze, passive avoidance test, Morris water maze, and Y-maze tests) were performed. At the end of experiments, rats were sampled, and mRNA expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Bdnf), Tyrosine kinase (Trk), microRNA132 (miR132), Neurogranin (Ng), Growth Associated Protein 43 (Gap -43), cAMP Response Element -Binding Protein (Crebp), Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (Gsk3 beta), and Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha) were measured in the hippocampus, cortex, and thalamus of individual rats. Our results show that exposure to bright daylight (100 and 1000 lx; experiment 1) or constant light (experiment 2) compromises memory, learning, and cognition. Suppressed expression levels of these mRNA were also observed in the hypothalamus, cortex, and thalamus. These results suggest that light affects differently to different groups of animals.

AB  - ObjectiveTo identify the genomics underpinning the increased volume of the hippocampus after long-term administration of lithium (Li) in bipolar disorder patients, hypothesizing the possible contribution of cell growth and differentiation pathways to this complication. MethodsRNA-seq profiles of four samples of hippocampal progenitor cells chronically treated with a high dose of Li and three samples chronically treated with the therapeutic dose were retrieved from NCBI-GEO. The raw data underwent filtration, quality control, expression fold change, adjusted significance, functional enrichment, and pharmacogenomic analyses. ResultsCCND1, LOXL2, and PRNP were identified as the genes involved in the drug response and the chronic effects of Li in the hippocampal cells. GSK-3 & beta; was also a hub in the pharmacogenomic network of Li. In addition, ZMPSTE24 and DHX35 were identified as the important genes in lithium therapy. ConclusionsAs shown by gene ontology results, these findings conclude that lithium may increase the size of the hippocampus in bipolar patients by stimulating the generation of new neurons and promoting their differentiation into neuroblasts, neurons, or microglia.

AB  - Fibrosis of the vocal folds poses a substantive clinical challenge potentially underlying the rapid proliferation of direct steroid injections into the upper airway. The variable clinical response to glucocorticoids (GCs) in the vocal folds is likely related to diversity inherent to GCs and patient-specific, and upstream, cell-specific responses to GCs. Broadly, we hypothesize the disparity in clinical outcomes are due to undesirable effects of GCs on resident fibroblasts. Transcriptome analysis identified significant GC-mediated modulation of Hippo signaling, a known regulator of fibrotic gene expression. Subsequent analysis confirmed GC-mediated YAP activation, a transcriptional co-factor in the Hippo signaling pathway. YAP inhibition attenuated ACTA2 expression in GC-treated human vocal fold fibroblasts. Nuclear localization and phosphorylation at Ser211, however, was not affected by YAP inhibition, suggesting nuclear translocation of YAP is indirectly driven by GR. RNA-seq analysis confirmed the influence of GCs on Wnt signaling, and canonical Wnt signaling target genes were upregulated by GCs. These data implicate YAP and its downstream targets as putative mediators of a pro-fibrotic response to GCs. Therapeutic YAP inhibition may ultimately be clinically relevant and warrants further consideration.

AB  - Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) is recognized as a highly efficient biological control agent for several stored-product pests, targeting the late-instar larvae or pupae of various beetle species. Host plant metabolites may significantly affect species at the third trophic level. The life history traits of A. calandrae parasitizing Callosobruchus maculatus, which were reared on seeds from six legume species (broad bean, cowpea, lentil, green gram, chickpea, and soybean), were evaluated under controlled conditions of 27 +/- 2 degrees C, 60 +/- 5 % relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 10:14 (L:D) h. The longest development duration was recorded for soybean (28.56 days), while the shortest was noted for cowpea (12.41 days) and green gram (13.24 days). The parasitoid had the maximum female adult longevity (19.80 days) and fecundity (86.78 eggs) when reared on cowpea, whereas it demonstrated the lowest longevity (5.08 days) and fecundity (13.51 eggs) on soybean. The elevated values of net reproductive rate (R0), intrinsic rate (r), and finite rate (lambda) of A. calandrae were documented for the cohort raised on cowpea, while diminished values were seen on soybean. The life cycle parameters of A. calandrae were associated with the biochemical properties of the examined legume species. The energy stores of fourth instar C. maculatus larvae reared on various legume grains influenced the parasitoid's life history features. The potential correlation between the host plant metabolites and fourth instar larvae's energy reserves of C. maculatus with the life history traits of A. calandrae is explored. The findings could have implications for C. maculatus biological control.

AB  - Plant-mediated indirect interactions (PMIIs) between phytopathogenic fungi and herbivorous insects on shared host plants occur in nature. Knowledge of PMIIs is critical in plant molecular breeding and integrated pest management. We studied the response and chemical mechanism of beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), adults to rose plants, Rosa chinensis Jacquin, infected with rose powdery mildew, Podosphaera pannosa (Wallr.: Fr.) de Bary. Using gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) coupled with electroantennogram (EAG), we found that beet armyworm antennae responded to 8, 11, and 3 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from noninfected roses, mildew-infected roses, and mildew alone, respectively. The EAG analyses showed 11 chemicals (e.g., limonene [1], 2ethyl-1-hexanol [2], linalool [3], nonanal [4], (E)-beta-caryophyllene [5], 1-dodecanol [7], n-hexadecane [9], 1-hexadecanol [11], methyl palmitate [12], 1-octadecanol [14], and n-butyl hexadecanoate [15]) elicited electrophysiological responses of beet armyworm antennae with significant dose-response relationships (P < 0.05). The EAG responses to the three chemicals (3, 11, and 15) were greater than that to the reference chemical [i.e., (E)-2-hexenal] at 0.5, 5.0, and 50.0 mg/ml. Olfactory and ovipositional behavior assays indicated that three chemicals (2, 3, and 5) significantly attracted beet armyworm females and four chemicals (7, 11, 14, and 15) strongly repelled females. Chemicals 2, 3, and 5 from healthy roses appear to be responsible for the attraction of beet armyworm moths to healthy roses, whereas chemicals 7, 11, 14, and 15 from mildew-infected roses play key roles in inhibiting attraction of moths. VOCs from mildew alone did not attract or repel beet armyworm moths.

AB  - BackgroundTrichophyton benhamiae is a common dermatophyte whose natural host is the guinea pig and which causes highly inflammatory skin lesions in humans. The subtilisin 6 (SUB6) of this fungus belongs to a family of 12 SUB genes. Its encoding gene, overexpressed in vivo but not in vitro, has been considered a potentially important virulence factor, but its role in pathogenesis remains to be elucidated.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the role of T. benhamiae SUB6 in virulence in a mouse skin infection model.MethodsTo assess the contribution of SUB6 to virulence, SUB6-deleted (Delta SUB6) and complemented strains were generated by genetic transformation. The pathogenicity of these strains was compared with that of the parental strain in vivo in mice, based on the evolution of skin symptoms, histopathological lesions and molecular analyses targeting the expression of host pro-inflammatory genes and fungal genes encoding subtilisins from the same family as SUB6.ResultsThe Delta SUB6 strain induced superficial skin signs and histopathological inflammatory lesions similar to those caused by the parental strain. Significant overexpression of the SUB1, SUB3, SUB8 and SUB10 genes in the tissues was observed regardless of the strain tested, with no difference between these strains, reflecting the absence of any compensatory mechanism among subtilisins.ConclusionsSUB6 appears to be more of a marker of fungal infection than a virulence factor, at least acting alone.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental disorder, which is closely related to the deficiency of monoamine neurotransmitters. Our previous study suggested that acute treatment with J147, a novel curcumin derivative, produced antidepressant-like effects in mouse model of depression by regulation of 5-HT receptor subtypes. However, it is still unknown whether the antidepressant-like effects of J147 are involved in activation of central monoaminergic system. In this study, a series of classical behavior tests were employed to assess the involvement of monoaminergic system in antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects after sub-acute treatment of mice with J147 for 3 days. The results suggested that J147 at 10 mg/kg significantly reduced the immobility time in both the tail suspension and forced swimming tests, but didn't show effects in the sucrose preference test. Similarly, sub-acute treatment of J147 did not induce amelioration in novelty suppressed feeding test. J147 increased duration and crossing time in the central area, but did not show significant change in rearing counts in the open field test. In neurochemical assays, studies suggested that serotonin and noradrenaline levels were significantly increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus after treatment of J147 by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an electrochemical detector. Moreover, J147-induced significant inhibition of monoamine oxidase A activity. These findings suggest that the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of J147 might be related to the monoaminergic system by the evidence that high dose of J147 inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A activity and increases synaptic monoamines in the mouse brain.

AB  - Cooperation is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom as it aims to maximize benefits through joint action. Selection, however, may also favor competitive behaviors that could violate cooperation. How animals mitigate competition is hotly debated, with particular interest in primates and little attention paid thus far to nonprimates. Using a loose-string pulling apparatus, we explored cooperative and competitive behavior, as well as mitigation of the latter, in semi-wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). Our results showed that elephants first maintained a very high cooperation rate (average = 80.8% across 45 sessions). Elephants applied "block," "fight back," "leave," "move side," and "submission" as mitigation strategies and adjusted these strategies according to their affiliation and rank difference with competition initiators. They usually applied a "fight back" mitigation strategy as a sanction when competition initiators were low ranking or when they had a close affiliation, but were submissive if the initiators were high ranking or when they were not closely affiliated. However, when the food reward was limited, the costly competitive behaviors ("monopoly" and "fight") increased significantly, leading to a rapid breakdown in cooperation. The instability of elephant cooperation as a result of benefit reduction mirrors that of human society, suggesting that similar fundamental principles may underlie the evolution of cooperation across species.

AB  - The postrhinal cortex (POR) serves as a key input area to the hippocampal system. It receives highly processed information from the ventral visual stream and other limbic areas including the retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal areas, and portions of the limbic thalamus. The POR was studied early on by David Bucci and colleagues who first postulated that the POR plays a major role in contextual learning. Here we review a number of approaches and experimental studies that have explored POR's role in contextual processing. We discuss POR lesion studies that monitored deficits in fear conditioning tasks and the effects that these lesions had on processing visual landmark information. We then review the types of spatial correlates encoded by POR cells. A large number of head direction (HD) cells are present, although recent findings suggest that many of them are more accurately characterized as landmark modulated-HD cells as opposed to classic HD cells. A significant number of POR cells are also tuned to egocentric properties of the environment, such as the spatial relationship of the animal to the center of its environment, or the distance between the animal and either the environment's center or its boundaries. We suggest potential frameworks through which these functional cell types might support contextual processing. We then discuss deficits seen in humans who have damage to the homologous parahippocampal cortex, and we finish by reviewing functional imaging studies that found activation of this area while human subjects performed various tasks. A preponderance of evidence suggests that the POR, along with its interactions with retrosplenial cortex, plays a key role in contextual information processing.

AB  - Traditionally, investigations of cognition have been carried out in laboratory conditions, but such conditions provide unnatural and frequently stressful environments for wild-caught animals. Taking the study of cognitive ecology into the wild allows directly assessing animals' abilities in their natural environment and investigate the fitness consequences of variation in specific cognitive abilities, which is one of the main goals of cognitive ecology. However, studying cognition in the wild brings challenges as it is more difficult to implement correct cognitive tasks in such conditions. Here, I discuss some of the recent advances in avian cognitive ecology in the wild, while also highlighting work to illustrate how existing challenges make interpretation of some studies difficult. Overall, bringing the study of cognition to the wild provides unprecedented new opportunities to address many fundamental questions in cognitive ecology, but it requires the proper design and implementation of cognitive tasks to measure specific cognitive abilities.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. Disrupted mitochondrial dynamics (i.e., fusion/fission balance), which are essential for normal mitochondria structure and function, are documented in AD. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a membrane/lipid raft (MLR) scaffolding protein regulates metabolic pathways in several different cell types such as hepatocytes and cancer cells. Previously, we have shown decreased expression of Cav-1 in the hippocampus of 9-month (m) old PSAPP mice, while hippocampal overexpression of neuron-targeted Cav-1 using the synapsin promoter (i.e., SynCav1) preserved cognitive function, neuronal morphology, and synaptic ultrastructure in 9 and 12 m PSAPP mice. Considering the central role of energy production in maintaining normal neuronal and synaptic function and survival, the present study reveals that PSAPP mice exhibit disrupted mitochondrial distribution, morphometry, and respiration. In contrast, SynCav1 mitigates mitochondrial damage and loss and enhances mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, by examining mitochondrial dynamics, we found that PSAPP mice showed a significant increase in the phosphorylation of mitochondrial dynamin-related GTPase protein (DRP1), resulting in excessive mitochondria fragmentation and dysfunction. In contrast, hippocampal delivery of SynCav1 significantly decreased p-DRP1 and augmented the level of the mitochondrial fusion protein, mitofusin1 (Mfn1) in PSAPP mice, a molecular event, which may mechanistically explain for the preserved balance of mitochondria fission/fusion and metabolic resilience in 12 m PSAPP-SynCav1 mice. Our data demonstrate the critical role for Cav-1 in maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology and function through affecting mitochondrial dynamics and explain a molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the previously reported neuroprotective and cognitive preservation induced by SynCav1 in PSAPP mouse model of AD.

AB  - Camellia sinensis L. (Theaceae) leaves have been used as a beverage in both Eastern and Western cultures for a long time, while its root has not been intensively studied. In this study, seven undescribed triterpenoid saponins (1-7) and twelve known saponins (8-19) with different combinations of substituents, such as oxygenated isoprenyl substituents and sugar moieties, and lengths of sugar chains, were isolated from the C. sinensis roots. Their structures were unequivocally determined using one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance data and acid hydrolysis analysis. Investigation of the biological activities of isolated compounds revealed that only those without functional acetyl groups exhibited cytotoxic activities against mouse and human cancer cells (B16F10) and human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) at 50 mu M. Compounds with an aldehyde group at C-23 of aglycone showed immunomodulatory activity against Th1 and Th17 cells at 10 mu M. Ten compounds with biological activities from C. sinensis roots extracts, including three previously undescribed ones (3, 6, and 7), were identified.

AB  - The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an agricultural important polyphagous pest of many crops that causes significant yield loss. In this study, the effect of four herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) (methyl jasmonate, methyl salicylate, indole, and 3-pentanol) with a concentration of 100 mmol/L and two plant probiotic bacteria (PBB) (Bacillus pumilus INR7 and Bacillus velezensis H3), were investigated on life table parameters of T. urticae under laboratory conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% RH, and 16 L: 8D). The T. urticae cohorts were reared on attached leaves of kidney bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) treated with HIPVs and PBBs, separately. The life history data were analysed using age-stage, two-sex life table theory. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) on methyl salicylate (0.1667 +/- 0.0087 day-1) and B. velezensis treatment (0.1640 +/- 0.0099 day-1) was significantly lower than the control group (0.1934 +/- 0.0100 day-1). The finite rate of increase (lambda) ranged from 1.178 +/- 0.0116 day-1 on the B. velezensis to 1.2134 +/- 0.0121 day-1 on the control with a significant difference (P < 0.05). The gross reproduction rate (GRR) on the indole treatment was significantly lower than the other treatments (28.14 +/- 3.66 offspring). Based on the results, methyl salicylate, B. velezensis and indole could be considered resistance inducing materials against T. urticae.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that astrocytes, by releasing and uptaking neuroactive molecules, regulate synaptic plasticity, considered the neurophysiological basis of memory. This study investigated the impact of L-alpha-aminoadipate (L-AA) on astrocytes which sense and respond to stimuli at the synaptic level and modulate hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. L-AA selectivity toward astrocytes was proposed in the early 70's and further tested in different systems. Although it has been used for impairing the astrocytic function, its effects appear to be variable in different brain regions. To test the effects of L-AA in the hippocampus of male C57Bl/6 mice we performed two different treatments (ex vivo and in vivo) and took advantage of other compounds that were reported to affect astrocytes. L-AA superfusion did not affect the basal synaptic transmission but decreased LTP magnitude. Likewise, trifluoroacetate and dihydrokainate decreased LTP magnitude and occluded the effect of L-AA on synaptic plasticity, confirming L-AA selectivity. L-AA superfusion altered astrocyte morphology, increasing the length and complexity of their processes. In vivo, L-AA intracerebroventricular injection not only reduced the astrocytic markers but also LTP magnitude and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory in mice. Interestingly, D-serine administration recovered hippocampal LTP reduction triggered by L-AA (2 h exposure in hippocampal slices), whereas in mice injected with L-AA, the superfusion of D-serine did not fully rescue LTP magnitude. Overall, these data show that both L-AA treatments affect astrocytes differently, astrocytic activation or loss, with similar negative outcomes on hippocampal LTP, implying that opposite astrocytic adaptive alterations are equally detrimental for synaptic plasticity.

AB  - The major and possibly only component of the sex attractant pheromone of the moth Hemileuca nevadensis (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) from southern California was determined to be (E10,Z12)-hexadecadienal (E10,Z12-16:Ald). Detectable quantities of the analogs (E10,Z12)-hexadecadien-1-yl acetate (E10,Z12-16:Ac) and (E10,Z12)-hexadecadien-1-ol (E10,Z12-16:OH) were also present in solvent extracts of sex pheromone glands, and stimulated male antennae in coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detector (GC-EAD) assays. GC-EAD traces from solid phase microextraction (SPME) wipe samples of sex pheromone glands of calling females confirmed the presence of E10,Z12-16:Ald and traces of E10,Z12-16:OH on the gland surface, but E10,Z12-16:Ac was not detected. Despite evidence for the presence of all three compounds in extracts, behavioral responses to synthetic compounds in the field suggested that only E10,Z12-16:Ald is required for optimal attraction.

AB  - It has been proposed that carbon monoxide (CO) is a chemical light carrier that is transferred by the humoral pathway from the retina to the brain. Here, we aimed to study how deeply CO is involved in regulating the expression of Period2 gene (PER2), one of the genes maintaining the intrinsic biological clock. In our in vivo experiment, we studied whether CO may be a chemical signal and is also equivalent to natural light in three groups of pigs: Normal: housed in natural conditions without any procedures, Control: adapted and kept in constant darkness, infused with blank plasma, and CO treated: adapted and kept in constant darkness infused with CO-enriched plasma. After the experiment, the animals were slaughtered at two times of day: 12 p.m. and 12 a.m. Next, hypothalamus samples were collected. Quantitative PCR, the DNA methylation of the promoter sequence containing enhancers (E-box) and a functional analysis of the PER2 promoter was performed. qPCR showed a differential pattern of PER2 mRNA expression at daytime oscillation in the examined groups. Pyrosequencing revealed daytime changes in the methylation level of regulatory sites of the examined sequence. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that E-boxes (CANNTG) drive the expression of the porcine PER2 in vitro. In conclusion, changes in methylation over 24 h may regulate the oscillatory manner of PER2 expression.

AB  - There is limited information on the impact of dietary supplementation with separate rumen-protected (RP) amino acids (AA), or with their combination, on ewes' oxidative status. Sixty ewes were divided into five groups; C: basal diet (control); M: basal diet + 6 g/ewe RP methionine; L: basal diet + 5 g/ewe RP lysine; LML: basal diet + 6 g methionine and 5 g lysine/ewe; and HML: basal diet + 12 g methionine + 5 g lysine/ewe. Milk's fat content increased in RP-AA fed ewes, while that of protein in M and L only. In blood plasma, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was reduced in the M, LML, and HML compared to C-fed ewes. An increase in glutathione transferase activity in the blood plasma of the M and LML compared to the C and HML-fed ewes were found. In milk, lower values of the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) in the LML and HML-fed ewes and of 2,2 '-Azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) in LML only, were found. Lysine increased milk's FRAP values and MDA content. Both L and HML diets increased milk's protein carbonyls content. Methionine improves the organism's oxidative status, without adversely affecting milk's oxidative stability. Lysine dietary inclusion affects negatively the oxidative stability of milk.

AB  - Fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects between 5-10% of all live births. Placental insufficiency is a leading cause of FGR, resulting in reduced nutrient and oxygen delivery to the fetus. Currently, there are no effective in utero treatment options for FGR, or placental insufficiency. We have developed a gene therapy to deliver, via a non-viral nanoparticle, human insulin-like 1 growth factor (hIGF1) to the placenta as a potential treatment for placenta insufficiency and FGR. Using a guinea pig maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) model of FGR, we aimed to understand the transcriptional changes within the placenta associated with placental insufficiency that occur prior to/at initiation of FGR, and the impact of short-term hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment. Using RNAsequencing, we analyzed protein coding genes of three experimental groups: Control and MNR dams receiving a sham treatment, and MNR dams receiving hIGF1 nanoparticle treatment. Pathway enrichment analysis comparing differentially expressed genelists in sham-treated MNR placentas to sham-treated Control revealed upregulation of pathways associated with degradation and repair of genetic information and downregulation of pathways associated with transmembrane transport. When compared to sham-treated MNR placentas, MNR + hIGF1 placentas demonstrated changes to genelists associated with transmembrane transporter activity including ion, vitamin and solute carrier transport. Overall, this study identifies the key signaling and metabolic changes occurring in the placenta contributing to placental insufficiency prior to/at initiation of FGR, and increases our understanding of the pathways that our nanoparticle-mediated gene therapy intervention regulates.

AB  - BACKGROUND The striped stem borer (SSB, Chilo suppressalis) is one of the most destructive insect pests on rice. As a chewing insect, SSB larval feeding causes a dramatic increase in rice defense responses. However, the effects of oral secretions (OSs) during SSB feeding on rice defense remain largely unexplored. RESULTS In this study, based on transcriptome analysis results, treatment with SSB OSs regulated the expression of genes involved in the plant defense-related pathways of calcium, mitogen-activated protein kinases, reactive oxygen species, jasmonic acid (JA), herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), and protease inhibitors. Unsurprisingly, treatment with SSB OSs elicited the accumulation of JA and JA-isoleucine in rice. The defense mechanisms activated by the cascade not only induced the expression of trypsin inhibitors, inhibiting the normal growth of SSB larvae but also induced HIPVs emission, rendering rice attractive to a common larval parasitoid. High-throughput proteome sequencing of SSB OSs led to 534 proteins being identified and 343 proteins with two or more unique peptides being detected. CONCLUSION The study demonstrates that SSB OSs trigger both direct and indirect defense mechanisms in rice, akin to the effects of SSB feeding. It identifies specific proteins in SSB OSs that may influence the interactions between SSB and rice during feeding, providing valuable insights for effectors research.

AB  - BACKGROUNDEpichlo & euml; endophytes provide many benefits to host plants, including enhanced insect resistance. Fungal alkaloids are usually thought to be responsible for the endophyte-conferred herbivore resistance. Nonetheless, the fungal alkaloid profiles and concentrations may vary considerably among grass-endophyte systems. This indicates that apart from fungal alkaloids, additional mechanisms such as endophyte-mediated host defense are likely contributed to endophyte-grass-insect interactions. In this study, we addressed this issue by investigating the effect of Epichlo & euml; on the defense responses of Achnatherum sibiricum against locusts.RESULTSThe results showed that Epichlo & euml; endophytes increased locust resistance of A. sibiricum in both choice and non-choice feeding experiments. In no feeding groups, endophyte infection increased the content of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), chitinase activity, and the biosynthetic gene expression of the relevant pathways. Endophyte infection also increased the content of total phenolics and condensed tannins. These indicators were negatively correlated with leaf consumption. In locust feeding groups, endophyte infection increased trypsin inhibitor activity. Exogenous application of phytohormones further proved that JA and ET reduced the consumption of A. sibiricum by locusts.CONCLUSIONThe present study showed that endophyte-conferred host defense was mainly constitutive, that is, the defense characteristics of host plants were mainly manifested in no feeding groups. Endophyte presence enhanced locust resistance of the host by activating the JA/ET signaling pathway, elevating chitinase activity and phenolic compounds content, thereby improving the defense ability of host plants.

AB  - Louse flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) are specialized ectoparasites of birds, influencing host health and potentially acting as vectors of pathogens. A new species of the genus Ornithomya Latreille, 1802 (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), Ornithomya panovi sp. n., is described from specimens collected in Lazovsky Nature Reserve (Russia). O. panovi sp. n. belongs to the avicularia species-group and is distinguished from other known Ornithomya species inhabiting Russia and Japan by several morphological features: reduction of tergite 4, wing length, ratio of costal vein sections between junctions R1 and R2+3 and between junctions R2+3 and R4+5 and arrangement of wing microtrichia as well as by genetic distances. This discovery expands our knowledge of the region's parasite biodiversity and highlights the need for continued faunistic surveys in the Russian Far East.

AB  - Background: Silicone breast implants (SBIs) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases. In the current study, we aimed to explore the potential association between circulating autoantibodies against the autonomic nervous system and cognitive impairment, memory deficit, and depressive symptoms reported by women with SBIs. Methods: ELISA assays were used to quantify anti-adrenergic receptors (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2), anti-muscarinic receptors (M1-M5), anti-endothelin receptor type A, and anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor titers in the sera of 93 symptomatic female subjects with SBIs and 36 age-matched healthy female controls. Results: A significant difference was detected in the level of autoantibodies against the autonomic nervous system receptors in women with SBIs who reported memory impairment, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbance as compared with both women with SBIs who did not complain of these symptoms or with healthy individuals without SBIs. Conclusions: Clinical symptoms such as depression, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances were found to be associated with dysregulation of the levels of circulating autoantibodies targeting the autonomous nervous system receptors in women with SBIs. These autoantibodies may have diagnostic significance in diseases associated with breast implants.

AB  - The giraffe population is thought to vary seasonally in the Tsavo landscape of Kenya, but little data exists to establish if there indeed exists any variability. This study examined the impact of seasonal variation on the giraffe population in the Tsavo landscape. We conducted road transect counts and found 2683 and 3295 giraffes during the wet and dry seasons, with mean KAI and density of 0.19 +/- 0.01 and 1.20 +/- 0.435/km2, respectively. The giraffe population did not vary significantly between seasons, age and sex. The parks had more giraffes during the wet season compared to the dry season, while the reverse was true for Rombo and Taita ranches. No giraffes were sighted in South Kitui National Reserve.
   On pense que la population de girafes varie selon les saisons dans le paysage de Tsavo au Kenya, mais il existe peu de donnees permettant de determiner s'il y a effectivement une variabilite. Cette etude a analyse les repercussions des variations saisonnieres sur la population de girafes dans le paysage de Tsavo. Nous avons effectue des comptages sur les transects routiers et avons trouve 2683 et 3295 girafes pendant les saisons humides et seches, avec un IAC moyen et une densite de 0.19 +/- 0.01 et 1.20 +/- 0.435/km2, respectivement. La population de girafes n'a pas varie de maniere considerable en fonction des saisons, de l'age et du sexe. Les parcs comptaient plus de girafes pendant la saison des pluies que pendant la saison seche, alors que l'inverse etait vrai pour les ranchs de Rombo et de Taita. Aucune girafe n'a ete observee dans la reserve nationale de South Kitui.

AB  - Secretion of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential for reproduction. Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which coexpress neurokinin B (NKB) and its receptor (NK3R), are believed to be components of the GnRH pulse generator that regulates pulsatile GnRH secretion. We examined the effects of peripheral infusion of senktide, an NK3R selective agonist, on GnRH pulse generator activity by monitoring multiple unit activity (MUA) in the goat ARC. Previous studies have shown that characteristic increases in MUA (MUA volleys) reflect GnRH pulse generator activity. Senktide was infused intravenously or intravaginally for 2 h while recording MUA. Both infusions significantly increased the MUA volley frequency compared with the control. These results demonstrate that peripherally administered senktide acts centrally to sustainably accelerate the neural activity of the GnRH pulse generator throughout the infusion period. This suggests the possibility of practical applications of NK3R agonists for improving reproductive activity in farm animals.

AB  - Self-produced lactic fermentation (SPLF) is a new valued utilization technology, but its impact on gas emission remains unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of replacing the H2SO4 additive with SPLF on greenhouse gas (GHG), and volatile sulfur compound (VSC) emissions from swine slurry storage in a laboratory-scale study. In this study, SPLF is directed toward producing lactic acid (LA) through the anaerobic fermentation of slurry and apple waste under the most suitable conditions, with the LA concentration kept at 10,000-52000 mg COD/L and the pH remaining within 4.5 during the following 90 days of slurry storage. Compared with that in the slurry storage treatment (CK), the GHG emissions decreased by 86% and 87% in the SPLF and H2SO4 groups, respectively. The low pH (i.e., less than 4.5) inhibited the growth of Meth-anocorpusculum and Methanosarcina and resulted in very low mcrA gene copies in the SPLF group, leading to a reduction in CH4 emissions. The methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and H2S emissions in the SPLF group were reduced by 57%, 42%, 22%, and 87% and increased by 2206%, 61%, 173%, and 1856% in the H2SO4 group, respectively. Therefore, SPLF can be an innovative bioacidification technology for effectively reducing GHG and VSC emissions from animal slurry storage.

AB  - Early-stage mammalian embryos survive within a low oxygen tension environment and develop into fully functional, healthy organisms despite this hypoxic stress. This suggests that hypoxia plays a regulative role in fetal development that influences cell mobilization, differentiation, proliferation, and survival. The long-term hypoxic environment is sustained throughout gestation. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which cardiovascular stem cells survive and thrive under hypoxic conditions would benefit cell-based therapies where stem cell survival is limited in the hypoxic environment of the infarcted heart. The current study addressed the impact of long-term hypoxia on fetal Islet-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cell clones, which were isolated from sheep housed at high altitude. The cells were then cultured in vitro in 1% oxygen and compared with control Islet-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells maintained at 21% oxygen. RT-PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and migration assays evaluated adaptation to long term hypoxia in terms of survival, proliferation, and signaling. Non-canonical Wnt, Notch, AKT, HIF-2 alpha and Yap1 transcripts were induced by hypoxia. The hypoxic niche environment regulates these signaling pathways to sustain the dedifferentiation and survival of fetal cardiovascular progenitor cells.

AB  - The antidepressant-like effects of five herbal essential oils (EOs), Jasminum sambac (Linn.) Aiton essential oil (JSEOs), Magnolia denudata Desr. essential oil (MDEOs), Rosa rugosa Thunb. essential oil (RREOs), Aloysia citriodora Ortega ex Pers. essential oil (ACEOs) and Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. essential oil (ABEOs) were evaluated. By virtue of a reserpine-induced depression mouse model, the antidepression activities and mechanisms of these EOs were explored. The results indicated that the inhalation of EOs significantly ameliorated depression-like behaviors in reserpine-induced depression mice, including a decrease in anxiety and immobility time. JSEOs and ABEOs significantly attenuated reserpine-induced depression-like behaviors, particularly the decreased body weight and immobility time, as determined by tail suspension and forced swimming tests. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses indicated that the EOs influenced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serotonin1A (5-HT1A), and inflammatory cytokine levels. ACEOs attenuated reserpine-induced hippocampal and neuronal damage, significantly increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and 5-HT1A levels, and suppressed the inflammatory response. These results provide new insights into the antidepressant effects of herbal EOs and suggest that the five EOs evaluated in this study are potential nutraceuticals for the treatment of depression.

AB  - The soft scale, Pulvinaria floccifera (Westwood 1870) (Hemiptera: Coccidae) is a well-known agricultural and horticultural plant pest; however, there is some confusion surrounding its true taxonomic identity. The type specimens of P. floccifera differ morphologically from specimens described under this name in several recent studies. This confusion has arisen because the original description is too brief, and subsequent redescriptions were based on non-conspecific material. This taxonomically problematic situation has led to further confusion regarding the identity of P. floccifera. Herein, the oldest junior synonym of P. floccifera, i.e., Pulvinaria camelicola Signoret 1873 stat. rev., is revived to confer taxonomic stability to P. floccifera. The revived name, P. camelicola, is applied to a distinct species hitherto misidentified as P. floccifera. Morphological details of the adult female of P. camelicola stat. rev. are updated; and the adult female of P. floccifera is redescribed, based on specimens collected in Japan and some type specimens. A lectotype of P. floccifera are designated to stabilise the species identity. A key to the species of Pulvinaria found in Japan, and a table of diagnostic morphological character states of P. floccifera, P. camelicola stat. rev. and the type species of the genus, P. vitis (Linnaeus 1758), are provided to facilitate further taxonomic revision of the genus in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPhenacoccus solenopsis is a polyphagous invasive mealybug that caused serious damage to crops worldwide. Phloem-sucking hemipterans are known to carry symbiotic microbes in their saliva. However, the role of salivary bacteria of P. solenopsis in modulating plant defenses remains limited. Exploring the impact of salivary bacteria on plant defense responses will contribute to the development of new targets for efficient control of invasive mealybugs. RESULTSSalivary bacteria of the invasive mealybug P. solenopsis can suppress herbivore-induced plant defenses and thus enhance mealybug fitness. Mealybugs treated with an antibiotic showed decreased weight gain, fecundity and survival. Untreated mealybugs suppressed jasmonic acid (JA)-regulated defenses but activated salicylic acid (SA)-regulated defenses in cotton plants. In contrast, antibiotic-treated mealybugs triggered JA-responsive gene expression and JA accumulation, and showed shortened phloem ingestion. Reinoculating antibiotic-treated mealybugs with Enterobacteriaceae or Stenotrophomonas cultivated from mealybug saliva promoted phloem ingestion and fecundity, and restored the ability of mealybugs to suppress plant defenses. Fluorescence in situ hybridization visualization revealed that Enterobacteriaceae and Stenotrophomonas colonize salivary glands and are secreted into the mesophyll cells and phloem vessels. Exogenous application of the bacterial isolates to plant leaves inhibited JA-responsive gene expression and activated SA-responsive gene expression. CONCLUSIONOur findings imply that symbiotic bacteria in the saliva of the mealybug play an important role in manipulating herbivore-induced plant defenses, enabling this important pest to evade induced plant defenses and promoting its performance and destructive effects on crops. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - This study investigates the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the training factors possibly associated with them in a sample of young Italian competitive swimmers. A questionnaire about training information and symptoms was administered to participants during the winter and summer 2021 training seasons. In total, 396 athletes took part in the study. In the winter training subgroup (n = 197), we found significant associations between increasing training hours per session and the presence of nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea (OR = 3.10; p = 0.039) and cough (OR = 3.48; p = 0.015). Total training hours per week were significantly associated with nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea (OR = 1.12; p = 0.010). In the summer group (n = 199), the same factors were not associated with respiratory symptoms. Having an allergy was significantly related to nasal congestion/rhinorrhea in both the logistic models (model 1 OR = 2.69, p = 0.013; model 2 OR = 2.70, p = 0.012), while having asthma significantly increased the risk of coughing (OR = 3.24, p = 0.033). The kind of environment (indoor or outdoor facilities) did not affect the studied symptoms either in summer or winter. Further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanisms involved in the development of respiratory symptoms in swimmers, particularly on how inflammation and remodelling develop and which environmental conditions can favour these processes.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPlant chemical defense can be elicited by signaling chemicals. As yet, the elicitation is mainly known from volatile aboveground signals. Root-secreted belowground signals and their underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This study examined a root-secreted signaling (-)-loliolide to trigger chemical defense in rice and wheat against pests by means of cocultivation and incubation experiments.RESULTSWild-type Arabidopsis (WT) and its root exudates with (-)-loliolide induced the production of defensive metabolites of rice and wheat and reduced the performance of weeds, pathogens and herbivores, while a carotenoid-deficient mutant (szl1-1) and its root exudates without (-)-loliolide had no similar effects. However, the induction and reduction occurred in the szl1-1 root exudates by (-)-loliolide supplementation with the level equal to that of WT. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a significant change in the transcript level of defense-related genes in rice exposure to (-)-loliolide. Furthermore, (-)-loliolide enhanced rice resistance against Rhizoctonia solani through changing reactive oxygen species (ROS) system, and mediating jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and abscisic acid biosynthesis.CONCLUSIONRoot-secreted signaling (-)-loliolide can trigger chemical defense in rice and wheat against their pests. Such perception-dependent chemical defenses provide an intriguing possibility for ecological pest management to increase crop productivity and sustainability. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.
   This study identified the role and mechanisms of a novel root-secreted (-)-loliolide in rice and wheat against their pests, and found (-)-loliolide as a mediator to induce the production of defensive metabolites in rice and wheat, reducing the performance of interacting weeds, soil-borne pathogens and destructive insects. image

AB  - Gonocytes are germline stem cells in the neonatal testis with important potential applications in fertility restoration and transgenesis. Using stepwise experiments, we examined the effects of different media combined with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and/or knockout serum replacement (KSR) on the in vitro proliferation, colony-formation, ultrastructure, and expression of pluripotency markers of porcine gonocytes. Testis cells from 1-wk-old piglets were cultured for 28 days in 6 different culture media (DMEM, DMEM/F12, GMEM, a-MEM, StemPro, and RPMI), each supplemented with 5%, 10%, or 15% FBS and/or 5%, 10%, or 15% KSR. The media and FBS/KSR combination leading to the maximum number of gonocytes, and their colonies were selected for further analyses. KSR supplementation resulted in a reduced somatic cell propagation and increased gonocyte colony formation (P < 0.001). Culturing in DMEM+15%FBS led to the greatest number of gonocytes (P < 0.001), while the largest diameter and greatest number of colonies were formed in DMEM+5%FBS+10%KSR cultures (P < 0.001). Gonocytes and their colonies in DMEM+15%FBS expressed all the examined gonocyte and pluripotency markers. KSR alone did not support gonocyte propagation, likely due to a reduced somatic cell proliferation; however, the combination of FBS and KSR increased gonocyte colony formation and their size.

AB  - Oedema disease (OD) in piglets is one of the most important pathologies, as it causes significant losses due to the high mortality because of the Shiga toxin family, which produces Escherichia coli (STEC) strains. The main toxin responsible for the characteristic pathologies in pigs is Shiga toxin 2 subtype e (Stx2e). Moreover, there is growing evidence that Stx's family of toxins also targets immune cells. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of different concentrations of Stx2e on porcine immune cells. Porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells were pre-incubated with Stx2e, at three different concentrations (final concentrations of 10, 500, and 5000 CD50/mL) and with a negative control group. Cells were then stimulated with polyclonal mitogens: concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, or lipopolysaccharides. Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU (or EdU) incorporation into newly created DNA. The activation of the lymphocyte subsets was assessed by the detection of CD25, using flow cytometry. The toxin significantly decreased mitogen-driven proliferation activity, and the effect was partially dose-dependent, with a significant impact on both T and B populations. The percentage of CD25+ cells was slightly lower in the presence of Stx2e in all the defined T cell subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+, and ?dTCR+)-in a dose-dependent manner. B cells seemed to be the most affected populations. The negative effects of different concentrations of Stx2e on the immune cells in this study may explain the negative impact of the subclinical course of OD.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of tryptophan treatment on aged pig oocytes, focusing on its potential to reduce oxidative stress and improve oocyte quality. An oxidative stress model was induced using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to mimic aging effects on oocytes. Fresh ovaries from young sows were collected, and oocytes were aspirated and cultured for in vitro maturation. Oocytes in the H2O2 and the H2O2+Trp groups were exposed to 100 mu M H2O2 for 30 min, with the H2O2+Trp group receiving an additional 50 mu M tryptophan supplementation. RNA-sequencing was performed to study the underlying mechanism through which tryptophan mitigated the H2O2-induced oxidative stress in oocytes. The results demonstrated that tryptophan supplementation significantly reduced oxidative stress markers such as H2O2 and malonaldehyde (MDA) while restoring key antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) confirming its antioxidant role. Furthermore, tryptophan improved cumulus cell expansion, and oocyte quality, which were compromised by oxidative stress. Transcriptomics study revealed the enrichment of several KEGG pathways, such as P13K-Akt signaling pathways as a critical regulator of cell survival and function, emphasizing the protective effects of tryptophan on oocyte integrity. Moreover, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network identified several hub genes in the tryptophan-treated group compared with H2O2, including TIMP1, CCN2, and MMP12 as key players in ECM remodeling and cellular adhesion, which are critical for restoring oocyte quality. These findings suggest that tryptophan supplementation not only mitigated oxidative stress but also modulated gene expression related to cellular functions and stress response. These results propose that tryptophan could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for improving reproductive outcomes in aging sows and other mammals facing age-related oocyte dysfunction.

AB  - Whereas gunshot injuries in human craniums have been well studied, reliable data on fracture patterns in ballistic long bone trauma remains scarce. Further information useful for forensic trauma interpretation and reconstruction may be retrieved from experimentally produced gunshot fractures. In order to avoid the use of human specimens for experimental research, it is of great interest to determine whether alternative models can reproduce the ballistic fracture patterns of human long bones. To address this question, we shot seven healthy adult human femurs and humeri each, ten samples each of two different polyurethane cylinders from Synbone((R)) and four femurs from female red deer. The specimens were embedded in ballistic gelatin and perpendicularly shot from a distance of 2 m, using a 9-mm full metal jacket projectile at an impact velocity of 360 m/s. The macroscopical appearance of the detailed fracture pattern considering entry, exit and general cortical traits as well as the bullet's energy lost upon impact were compared between the models. Despite some general similarities, neither of the two alternative models entirely reproduced the fracture patterns of human long bones. Comparing the two alternative models, the surrogate model revealed more significant differences to the human fracture than the animal model. This leads to the conclusion that the polyurethane material provides a different failure mechanism than real bone, underpinning the challenge in deploying an accurate analog.

AB  - Doxorubicin (DOX), widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent for various cancers, is limited in its clinical utility by its cardiotoxic effects. Despite its widespread use, the precise mechanisms underlying DOX-induced cardiotoxicity at the cellular and molecular levels remain unclear, hindering the development of preventive and early detection strategies. To characterize the cytotoxic effects of DOX on isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes, focusing on the expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) and their molecular targets associated with endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms such as the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), FOXO1, and GSK3 beta. We isolated Guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes by retrograde perfusion and enzymatic dissociation. We assessed cell morphology, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels, intracellular calcium, and mitochondrial membrane potential using light microscopy and specific probes. We determined the miRNA expression profile using small RNAseq and validated it using stem-loop qRT-PCR. We quantified mRNA levels of some predicted and validated molecular targets using qRT-PCR and analyzed protein expression using Western blot. Exposure to 10 mu M DOX resulted in cardiomyocyte shortening, increased ROS and intracellular calcium levels, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, and changes in specific miRNA expression. Additionally, we observed the differential expression of KATP subunits (ABCC9, KCNJ8, and KCNJ11), FOXO1, SIRT1, and GSK3 beta molecules associated with endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms. Supported by miRNA gene regulatory networks and functional enrichment analysis, these findings suggest that DOX-induced cardiotoxicity disrupts biological processes associated with cardioprotective mechanisms. Further research must clarify their specific molecular changes in DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction and investigate their diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic potential.

AB  - The Hippo pathway is generally understood to inhibit tumor growth by phosphorylating the transcriptional cofactor YAP to sequester it to the cytoplasm and reduce the formation of YAP-TEAD transcriptional complexes. Aberrant activation of YAP occurs in various cancers. However, we found a tumor-suppressive function of YAP in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using cell cultures, xenografts, and patient-derived explant models, we found that the inhibition of upstream Hippo-pathway kinases MST1 and MST2 or expression of a constitutively active YAP mutant impeded ccRCC proliferation and decreased gene expression mediated by the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Mechanistically, the NF-kappa B subunit p65 bound to the transcriptional cofactor TEAD to facilitate NF-kappa B-target gene expression that promoted cell proliferation. However, by competing for TEAD, YAP disrupted its interaction with NF-kappa B and prompted the dissociation of p65 from target gene promoters, thereby inhibiting NF-kappa B transcriptional programs. This cross-talk between the Hippo and NF-kappa B pathways in ccRCC suggests that targeting the Hippo-YAP axis in an atypical manner-that is, by activating YAP-may be a strategy for slowing tumor growth in patients.

AB  - Microbial source tracking (MST) is a critical tool for identifying sources of human and animal fecal pollution in aquatic environments. To enhance human fecal pollution tracking, this study evaluated the performance characteristics of pBI143, a cryptic plasmid recently identified for potential MST applications. Nucleic acid samples from ten animal species were screened for pBI143, revealing its presence in a small number of pigs, cows, dogs, cats, and flying fox fecal samples. Despite minor cross-detection with non-human fecal samples, pBI143 exhibited a high specificity value (up to 0.93). In untreated urban wastewater, pBI143 was consistently detected in all samples, exhibiting higher concentrations than the well-established human Bacteroides HF183 marker gene. Following a wastewater discharge event, pBI143 concentrations were monitored in an urban river and correlated well with both HF183 and enterococci 23S rRNA marker genes. Using conditional probability analysis, the likelihood of human fecal pollution was estimated to be 89.3 % when pBI143 was detected in 50 % of the river water samples. This study demonstrates that pBI143 is a highly abundant and specific human fecal marker for tracking human fecal pollution in environmental waters. Monitoring of pBI143 could significantly improve the accuracy of human fecal source identification in environmental waters, offering valuable insights for public health risk management and pollution mitigation strategies.

AB  - Air pollution has become a serious public health problem and there is evidence that air pollution affects the incidence of allergic rhinitis. To further investigate the effect of ambient air pollutants on the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms, a prospective follow-up study in patients with allergic rhinitis was conducted. A total of 167 allergic rhinitis patients with a mean age of 35.4 years, who were visiting the hospital, were enrolled. The daily symptom severity of allergic rhinitis and the concentrations of six air pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3 and NO2, were collected through follow-up investigations. The impact of ambient air pollutants on symptom severity was assessed via multi-pollutant models. Among several typical ambient air pollutants, we observed correlations of allergic rhinitis symptoms with PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2 and NO2, whereas O3 showed no such correlation. Specifically, PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly associated with sneezing and nasal blockage. NO2 was significantly correlated with symptoms of rhinorrhea, itchy nose and itchy eyes. CO was significantly linked to sneezing and nasal blockage symptoms. These air pollutants not only had a direct impact on allergic rhinitis symptoms but also exhibited a lagging effect. This study indicates that short-term exposure to air pollutants is associated with exacerbation of nasal symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis, leading to a decline in their quality of life.

AB  - The cochlea, an incredibly sensitive sensory system, detects sound waves and converts them into electrical signals the brain recognizes as sound. Damage to cochlear hair cells can release proteins, triggering biological responses that may impair hearing. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics offers insights into protein expression changes in cochlear tissues, improving our understanding of inner ear diseases. In this study, we performed a comprehensive proteomics analysis of whole cochlear tissue extracted from healthy guinea pigs and rats. The study optimized protein extraction protocols and analyzed cochlear protein expression using three biological replicates for each animal model. The results included the identification of 1841 proteins in guinea pigs and 3423 proteins in rats, with a high overlap in cochlear protein expression between the left and right ears-93% in guinea pigs and 89% in rats. The findings validate the assumption that the cochlear tissues from both sides of the ears can be considered biologically equivalent. This experiment provides a comprehensive cochlear proteome for guinea pigs and rats, supporting future studies on inner ear disorders.

AB  - In an increasingly aging society, there is a growing demand for the development of technology related to tissue regeneration. It involves the development of the appropriate biomaterials whose properties will allow the desired biological response to be obtained. Bioactivity is strongly affected by the proper selection of active ingredients. The aim of this study was to produce bioactive hydrogel materials based on hyaluronic acid and collagen modified by the addition of placenta. These materials were intended for use as dressings, and their physicochemical properties were investigated under simulated biological environmental conditions. The materials were incubated in vitro in different fluids simulating the environment of the human body (e.g., simulated body fluid) and then stored at a temperature close to body temperature. Using an FT-IR spectrophotometer, the functional groups present in the composites were identified. The materials with the added placenta showed an increase in the swelling factor of more than 300%. The results obtained confirmed the potential of using this material as an absorbent dressing. This was indicated by pH and conductometric measurements, sorption, degradation, and surface analysis under an optical microscope. The results of the in vitro biological evaluation confirmed the cytosafety of the tested biomaterials. The tested composites activate monocytes, which may indicate their beneficial properties in the first phases of wound healing. The material proved to be nontoxic and has potential for medical use.

AB  - Certain memories resist extinction to continue invigorating maladaptive actions. The robustness of these memories could depend on their widely distributed implementation across populations of neurons in multiple brain regions. However, how dispersed neuronal activities are collectively organized to underpin a persistent memory -guided behavior remains unknown. To investigate this, we simultaneously monitored the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the mouse brain from initial recall to post -extinction renewal of a memory involving cocaine experience. We uncover a higherorder pattern of short-lived beta -frequency (15-25 Hz) activities that are transiently coordinated across these networks during memory retrieval. The output of a divergent pathway from upstream VTA glutamatergic neurons, paced by a slower (4 -Hz) oscillation, actuates this multi -network beta -band coactivation; its closedloop phase -informed suppression prevents renewal of cocaine -biased behavior. Binding brain -distributed neural activities in this temporally structured manner may constitute an organizational principle of robust memory expression.

AB  - The delivery of CRISPR/Cas ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes is gaining attention owing to its high cleavage efficiency and reduced off-target effects. Although RNPs can be delivered into porcine zygotes via electroporation with relatively high efficiency, lipofection-mediated transfection appears to be versatile because of its ease of use, low cost, and adaptation to high-throughput systems. However, this system requires improvements in terms of embryo development and mutation rates. Therefore, this study elucidated the effects of culture methods and reagent combinations on the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing systems by using three lipofection reagents: Lipofectamine (TM) CRISPRMAX (TM) Cas9 Transfection Reagent (CM), Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 Transfection Reagent (LP), and jetCRISPR (TM) RNP Transfection Reagent (Jet). Porcine zona pellucida-free zygotes were incubated for 5 h with Cas9, a guide RNA targeting CD163, and the above lipofection reagents. When examining the effect of culture methods using 4-well (multiple embryo culture) and 25-well plates (single embryo culture) on the efficiency of CM-mediated zygote transfection, the culture of embryos in 25-well plates significantly increased the blastocyst formation rate; however, there was no difference in mutation rates between the 4-well and 25-well plates. When assessing the effects of individual or combined reagents on the efficiency of zygote transfection, the mutation rate was significantly lower for individual LP compared to individual CM- and Jet-mediated transfections. Moreover, combinations of lipofection transfection reagents did not significantly increase the mutation rate or mutation efficiency.

AB  - Weaning is an important period that affects the performance of piglets. However, the regulation of dietary amino acid levels is considered to be an effective way to alleviate the weaning stress of piglets. N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) plays an important role in improving the growth performance and antioxidant capacity of animals. A total of 36 weaned piglets were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, a control group (CON) and a 500 mg/kg NCG group (NCG), and the experiment lasted for 28 days. The results show that the NCG treatment group showed an increased 0-28 days average weight gain and average daily feed intake, and also increased contents of GLU and HDL, and lower SUN in serum, and an upregulation of the expression of the amino acid transporters SNAT2, EAAC1, SLC3A1, and SLC3A2 mRNA in the jejunum (p < 0.05), as well as an increased villus length and VH:CD ratio, and claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 mRNA expression in the jejunum (p < 0.05). The NCG treatment group showed an increased content of GSH-Px in serum and T-AOC and SOD in the jejunum, and a lower content of MDA (p < 0.05); and the upregulation of the mRNA expression related to antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD1, Gpx4, GCLC, GCLM and Nrf2, AhR, CYP1A1) in the jejunal mucosa (p < 0.05). In addition, compared with the control group, the NCG treatment group saw an upregulation in the mRNA expression of IL-10 and a decrease in the expression of IL-1 beta and IL-4 in the jejunal mucosa (p < 0.05). In summary, the results of this study suggest that NCG improved growth performance and jejunal morphology, improved the jejunal transport of amino acids related to the ornithine cycle, and improved the antioxidant capacity in weaned pigs.

AB  - The combined effect of protective agents (helium-neon laser, ibuprofen, mexidol) and 3 Gy of accelerated carbon ions (C-12) on the cognitive abilities of mice was studied. It was shown that the irradiated animals did not exhibit an altered behavior pattern: the level of anxiety was not increased, there was a slower positive dynamics of learning compared to the control, and there was no deficit in the hippocampus-dependent memory. Analysis of variance of learning curves revealed different coefficients of skill acquisition within the experimental groups, with the lowest characteristic for the group irradiated with a dose of 3 Gy C-12 without protective agents. In addition, the analysis of the preference for novelty when testing for recognition of a new object showed that this group of animals has a violation of the nonspatial hippocampus-mediated short-term memory.

AB  - Myocardin, a potent coactivator of serum response factor (SRF), competes with ternary complex factor (TCF) proteins for SRF binding to balance opposing mitogenic and myogenic gene programs in cardiac and smooth muscle. Here we identify a cardiac lncRNA transcribed adjacent to myocardin, named CARDINAL, which antagonizes SRF-dependent mitogenic gene transcription in the heart. CARDINAL-deficient mice show ectopic TCF/SRF-dependent mitogenic gene expression and decreased cardiac contractility in response to age and ischemic stress. CARDINAL forms a nuclear complex with SRF and inhibits TCF-mediated transactivation of the promitogenic gene c-fos, suggesting CARDINAL functions as an RNA cofactor for SRF in the heart.

AB  - Simple Summary Normal early embryonic development is important for ensuring sow fertility. Low quality of in vitro production embryos severely limits extensive application of porcine embryo engineering technologies in animal agriculture and the biomedicine field. Histone H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2 reportedly regulates oocyte maturation and preimplantation embryonic development in mice. However, the specific substrate and function of SETD2 in porcine early embryonic development remains unclear. Here, we show that SETD2 preferentially catalyzes H3K36me3 in porcine early embryos. SETD2 knockdown severely impeded blastocyst cavitation and perturbed normal allocation of inner cell mass and trophectoderm. SETD2 knockdown caused the apoptosis of cells within blastocysts. Therefore, SETD2 is essential for porcine early embryonic development. These findings provide a better understanding of porcine early embryonic development and lay a potential basis for improving the quality of porcine in vitro production embryos. SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2) is a methyltransferase that can catalyze the di- and tri-methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me2/me3). SETD2 frequently mediates H3K36me3 modification to regulate both oocyte maturation and preimplantation embryonic development in mice. However, the specific substrate and function of SETD2 in porcine early embryonic development are still unclear. In this study, SETD2 preferentially catalyzed H3K36me3 to regulate porcine early embryonic development. SETD2 mRNA is dynamically expressed during early embryonic development. Functional studies using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach revealed that the expression levels of SETD2 mRNA were effectively knocked down by siRNA microinjection. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that SETD2 knockdown (KD) did not affect H3K36me2 modification but significantly reduced H3K36me3 levels, suggesting a preferential H3K36me3 recognition of SETD2 in porcine embryos. Furthermore, SETD2 KD significantly reduced blastocyst rate and disrupted allocation between inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) lineage. The expression levels of key genes important for specification of the first two lineages apparently decreased in SETD2 KD blastocysts. SETD2 KD markedly increased the apoptotic percentage of cells within embryos and altered the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. Therefore, our data indicate that SETD2 is essential for porcine early embryonic development.

AB  - Phospholipase C zeta (PLC ) is an important inducer of Ca2++ oscillations in mammalian sperm. To explore the influence of PLC on early embryonic Ca2+ fluctuations during sperm-egg binding, this study used PLC from sheep sperm to construct an early embryonic Ca2+ fluctuation model. First, sheep MII oocytes were cultivated and screened using microinjection technology. Then, a pEGFP-N1-PLC plasmid was constructed to activate oocytes in the test group. Ionomycin combined with 6-Dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP) was used for the control group to explore the effects on early embryonic development and regulation of Ca2+ fluctuations during development. The results demonstrated that both the PLC and ionomycin combined with 6-DMAP activation methods induced sheep oocyte parthenogenetic activation and development in early embryos. In comparisons, the cleavage rate of ionomycin combined with 6-DMAP activation was significantly higher than that of PLC (60.9% +/- 19.4% vs 76.1% +/- 0.7%, respectively; p < 0.001), and the blastocyst rates were 16.2% +/- 0.62% and 21.1% +/- 0.92%, respectively (p < 0.05). Additionally, when comparing the distribution of Ca2+ in early embryos at different stages, Ca2+ in both treatment groups was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, but the temporal pattern of Ca2+ fluctuations differed. PLC resulted in Ca2+ peaks that appeared at the cleavage and morula stages of early embryos, and Ca2+ returned to normal levels at the morula stage. However, the Ca2+ concentration after ionomycin combined with 6-DMAP activation was always much higher than that with PLC , and its single peak appeared later than in the PLC group. In summary, the PLC gene promoted stable regulatory effects on Ca fluctuations at different stages during early embryonic development.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The enzyme phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase facilitates accumulation of seed oil with three hydroxylated acyl groups in Ricinus communis.
   Castor bean (Ricinus communis) seed oil (triacylglycerol [TAG]) is composed of similar to 90% of the industrially important ricinoleoyl (12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoyl) groups. Here, phosphatidylcholine (PC):diacylglycerol (DAG) cholinephosphotransferase (PDCT) from castor bean was biochemically characterized and compared with camelina (Camelina sativa) PDCT. DAGs with ricinoleoyl groups were poorly used by Camelina PDCT, and their presence inhibited the utilization of DAG with "common" acyl groups. In contrast, castor PDCT utilized DAG with ricinoleoyl groups similarly to DAG with common acyl groups and showed a 10-fold selectivity for DAG with one ricinoleoyl group over DAG with two ricinoleoyl groups. Castor DAG acyltransferase2 specificities and selectivities toward different DAG and acyl-CoA species were assessed and shown to not acylate DAG without ricinoleoyl groups in the presence of ricinoleoyl-containing DAG. Eighty-five percent of the DAG species in microsomal membranes prepared from developing castor endosperm lacked ricinoleoyl groups. Most of these species were predicted to be derived from PC, which had been formed by PDCT in exchange with DAG with one ricinoleoyl group. A scheme of the function of PDCT in castor endosperm is proposed where one ricinoleoyl group from de novo-synthesized DAG is selectivity transferred to PC. Nonricinoleate DAG is formed and ricinoleoyl groups entering PC are re-used either in de novo synthesis of DAG with two ricinoleoyl groups or in direct synthesis of triricinoleoyl TAG by PDAT. The PC-derived DAG is not used in TAG synthesis but is proposed to serve as a substrate in membrane lipid biosynthesis during oil deposition.

AB  - Simple Summary Salmonella is an important pathogen in both livestock and humans, therefore much research has been conducted aiming to improve control methods and consequently reduce prevalence. Salmonella monitoring systems have been implemented in swine slaughter plants across Germany to test meat juices or blood of finisher animals being processed. The farms are placed into categories according to the level of Salmonella positivity, which then dictate actions required to be taken by the farmer as well as any price penalties applied to the meat sold. Since the implementation of this monitoring system, the distribution of farms across categories has not drastically altered, indicating that the national Salmonella situation is not necessarily improving. More action seems to be required at the breeding and multiplying levels of production rather than simply monitoring the finisher farms. Improving the diagnostic methods at these early stages of production in sows and nursery pigs, and consequently the control of Salmonella, would aid improvement of the Salmonella situation across the whole pig stock across Germany, including finishing farms. Sock and swab sampling has been demonstrated as a simple, cheap and effective sampling method for other enteric pathogens and therefore may be a useful tool for the diagnosis of Salmonella on swine farms. Availability of an easily accessible diagnostic method for Salmonella may increase investigations into the pathogen on sow farms and consequently improve the control methods implemented and reduce Salmonella positivity at slaughter. Salmonellosis is the second most reported gastrointestinal infection in humans after campylobacteriosis and a common cause of foodborne outbreaks in the European Union (EU). In addition to consumption of contaminated animal-based foods, such as poultry, beef and eggs, pork is an important source of human salmonellosis outbreaks; therefore, Salmonella (S.) control should start in the early stages of pig production. To be able to implement effective control measures to reduce the risk of pigs being infected by Salmonella, it is important to identify the serovars circulating on farm within the different stages of production, including as early as sow and piglet breeding. The aim of the present study was to assess the Salmonella status of sow farms either producing their own finishers or delivering piglets to fattening farms with a known high serological prevalence identified within the QS Salmonella monitoring system. Overall, 97 (92.4%) of 105 investigated piglet-producing farms across Germany tested positive in at least one sample. Salmonella was detected in 38.2% of the sock and 27.1% of the environmental swab samples. S. Typhimurium was the most frequent serovar. In conclusion, sock and environmental swab samples are well suited for non-invasive Salmonella detection in different production units in farrowing farms. To establish a holistic Salmonella control program, all age classes of pig production should be sampled to enable intervention and implementation of countermeasures at an early stage if necessary.

AB  - Introduction Human epidemiological studies suggest that heavy alcohol consumption may lead to earlier onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially in individuals with a genetic predisposition for AD. Alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) during a critical developmental timepoint, such as adolescence, interacts with AD-related pathologies to accelerate disease progression later in life. The current study investigates if voluntary exercise in mid-adulthood can recover memory deficits caused by the interactions between adolescence ethanol exposure and AD-transgenes.Methods Male and female TgF344-AD and wildtype F344 rats were exposed to an intragastric gavage of water (control) or 5 g/kg of 20% ethanol (adolescent intermittent ethanol; AIE) for a 2 day on/off schedule throughout adolescence (PD27-57). At 6 months old, rats either remained in their home cage (stationary) or were placed in a voluntary wheel running apparatus for 4 weeks and then underwent several behavioral tests. The number of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and measure of neurogenesis in the hippocampus were assessed.Results Voluntary wheel running recovers spatial working memory deficits selectively in female TgF344-AD rats exposed to AIE and improves pattern separation impairment seen in control TgF344-AD female rats. There were sex-dependent effects on brain pathology: Exercise improves the integration of recently born neurons in AIE-exposed TgF344-AD female rats. Exercise led to a decrease in amyloid burden in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but only in male AIE-exposed TgF344-AD rats. Although the number of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons was not affected by AD-transgenes in either sex, AIE did reduce the number of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in female rats.Discussion These data provide support that even after symptom onset, AIE and AD related cognitive decline and associated neuropathologies can be rescued with exercise in unique sex-specific ways.

AB  - Astrocytes and microglia are the first cells to react to neurodegeneration, e.g., in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the data on changes in glial support during the most common (sporadic) type of the disease are sparse. Using senescence-accelerated OXYS rats, which simulate key characteristics of sporadic AD, and Wistar rats (parental normal strain, control), we investigated hippocampal neurogenesis and glial changes during AD-like pathology. Using immunohistochemistry, we showed that the early stage of the pathology is accompanied by a lower intensity of neurogenesis and decreased astrocyte density in the dentate gyrus. The progressive stage is concurrent with reactive astrogliosis and microglia activation, as confirmed by increased cell densities and by the acquisition of cell-specific gene expression profiles, according to transcriptome sequencing data. Besides, here, we continued to analyze the anti-AD effects of prolonged supplementation with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1. The antioxidant did not affect neurogenesis, partly normalized the gene expression profile of astrocytes and microglia, and shifted the resting/activated microglia ratio toward a decrease in the activated-cell density. In summary, both astrocytes and microglia are more vulnerable to AD-associated neurodegeneration in the CA3 area than in other hippocampal areas; SkQ1 had an anti-inflammatory effect and is a promising modality for AD prevention and treatment.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Diabetic kidney damage (DKD) is one of the most common complications of diabetes, which is known as a chronic inflammatory kidney disease caused by persistent hyperglycemia. White tea was originally used as a folk medicine to treat measles in ancient China. What arouses our interest is that there is a traditional method to treat diabetes with white tea taken from over 30-year-old tree of Camellia sinensis L. However, there are few reports on the renal protection of white tea.
   Aim of the study: This present study was designed to study the potential protective effects of white tea (WT) and old tree white tea (OTWT) on high-fat-diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic mice to explore the possible mechanism of WT/OTWT against DKD.
   Materials and methods: C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: NC, T2D, WT (400 mg/kg center dot b.w, p. o.), OTWT (400 mg/kg center dot b.w, p.o.). Diabetes was established in all groups except NC group, by six weeks of HFD feeding combined with STZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 times, treatments were administered for six weeks and then all the animals were decapitated; kidney tissues and blood samples were collected for the further analysis, including: levels of insulin, lipid metabolism (TG, TC, HDL, LDL, FFA), antioxidative enzymes (catalase (CAT), super oxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatine, inflammatory cyto-kines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, COX-2, iNOS, MCP-1), advanced glycation end products (AGE), receptor of AGE (RAGE), Nrf2, AMPK, SIRT1, and PGC-1 alpha. H&E, PAS and Masson staining were performed to examine the histopatho-logical alterations of the kidneys. Results: Our data showed that WT and OTWT reversed the abnormal serum lipids (TG, TC, HDL, LDL, FFA) in T2D mice, upregulated antioxidative enzymes levels (CAT, SOD, GPx) and inhibit the excessive production of proinflammatory mediators (including MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IL1 beta, COX-2 and iNOS) by varying degrees, and OTWT was more effective. In histopathology, OTWT could significantly alleviate the accumulation of renal AGE in T2D mice, thereby improving the structural changes of the kidneys, such as glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane thickening and kidney FIbrosis.
   Conclusions: Both WT and OTWT could alleviate the diabetic changes in T2D mice via hypoglycemic, hypolipi-demic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, while OTWT was more evident. OTWT could prominently alleviate the accumulation of AGE in the kidneys of T2D mice, thereby ameliorating the renal oxidative stress and inflammatory damage, which was associated with the activation of SIRT1/AMPK pathway.

AB  - If the brain is deprived of input from one or more senses during development, functional and structural reorganization of the deprived regions takes place. However, little is known about how sensory deprivation affects large-scale brain networks. In the present study, we use data-driven independent component analysis (ICA) to characterize large-scale brain networks in 15 deaf early signers and 24 hearing non-signers based on resting-state functional MRI data. We found differences between the groups in independent components representing the left lateralized control network, the default network, the ventral somatomotor network, and the attention network. In addition, we showed stronger functional connectivity for deaf compared to hearing individuals from the middle and superior temporal cortices to the cingulate cortex, insular cortex, cuneus and precuneus, supramarginal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and cerebellum crus 1, and stronger connectivity for hearing nonsigners to hippocampus, middle and superior frontal gyri, pre- and postcentral gyri, and cerebellum crus 8. These results show that deafness induces large-scale network reorganization, with the middle/superior temporal cortex as a central node of plasticity. Cross-modal reorganization may be associated with behavioral adaptations to the environment, including superior ability in some visual functions such as visual working memory and visual attention, in deaf signers.

AB  - Tea plant [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze], as one of the most important commercial crops, frequently suffers from anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum camelliae. The plant-specific tau (U) class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTU) participates in ROS homeostasis. Here, we identified a plant-specific GST tau class gene from tea plant, CsGSTU45, which is induced by various stresses, including C. camelliae infection, by analyzing multiple transcriptomes. CsGSTU45 plays a negative role in disease resistance against C. camelliae by accumulating H2O2. JA negatively regulates the resistance of tea plants against C. camelliae, which depends on CsGSTU45. CsMYC2.2, which is the key regulator in the JA signaling pathway, directly binds to and activates the promoter of CsGSTU45. Furthermore, silencing CsMYC2.2 increased disease resistance associated with reduced transcript and protein levels of CsGSTU45, and decreased contents of H2O2. Therefore, CsMYC2.2 suppresses disease resistance against C. camelliae by binding to the promoter of the CsGSTU45 gene and activating CsGSTU45. CsJAZ1 interacts with CsMYC2.2. Silencing CsJAZ1 attenuates disease resistance, upregulates the expression of CsMYC2.2 elevates the level of the CsGSTU45 protein, and promotes the accumulation of H2O2. As a result, CsJAZ1 interacts with CsMYC2.2 and acts as its repressor to suppress the level of CsGSTU45 protein, eventually enhancing disease resistance in tea plants. Taken together, the results show that the JA signaling pathway mediated by CsJAZ1-CsMYC2.2 modulates tea plant susceptibility to C. camelliae by regulating CsGSTU45 to accumulate H2O2.

AB  - Discharging the tannery wastewater into the environment is a serious challenge worldwide due to the release of severe recalcitrant pollutants such as oil compounds and organic materials. The biological treatment through enzymatic hy-drolysis is a cheap and eco-friendly method for eliminating fatty substances from wastewater. In this context, lipases can be utilized for bio-treatment of wastewater in multifaceted industrial applications. To overcome the limitations in removing pollutants in the effluent, we aimed to identify a novel robust stable lipase (PersiLipase1) from metagenomic data of tannery wastewater for effective bio-degradation of the oily wastewater pollution. The lipase displayed remarkable thermostability and maintained over 81 % of its activity at 60 degrees C.After prolonged incubation for 35 days at 60 degrees C, the PersiLipase1 still maintained 53.9 % of its activity. The enzyme also retained over 67 % of its activity in a wide range of pH (4.0 to 9.0). In addition, PersiLipase1 demonstrated considerable tolerance toward metal ions and organic solvents (e.g., retaining >70% activity after the addition of 100 mM of chemicals). Hydrolysis of olive oil and sheep fat by this enzyme showed 100 % efficiency. Furthermore, the PersiLipase1 proved to be efficient for biotreatment of oil and grease from tannery wastewater with the hydrolysis efficiency of 90.76 % +/- 0.88. These results demonstrated that the metagenome-derived PersiLipase1 from tannery wastewater has a promising potential for the biodegradation and management of oily wastewater pollution.

AB  - To investigate the effects of molybdenum (Mo) on apoptosis of lymphocytes and changes of peripheral blood in sheep, a total of 20 5-month-old healthy female sheep were randomly divided into five groups of 4 and orally administered with water containing Na(2)MoO(4)middot2H(2)O (0, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg BW/day) for 28 days. Jugular vein blood was taken on the 0th, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day of Mo treatment, respectively. On the 28th day, the spleen and thymus were removed for observing histopathology and apoptosis-r elated DNA damage by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining, respectively. The blood routine indexes were determined by an automatic blood analyzer. Further, the apoptosis of lymphocytes and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results showed that excessive Mo induced apoptosis-r elated DNA damage in the splenocytes and thymocytes and significantly increased the apoptosis indexes of the splenocytes and thymocytes (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the treatment with excessive Mo significantly decreased the MMP (P < 0.01) and promoted apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes (P < 0.01). And the number of WBC, Lymph, Gran, and RBC and the indexes of HGB and HCT were also significantly decreased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while RDW was significantly increased by excessive Mo (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). In conclusion, excessive Mo-induced DNA damage and apoptosis of the lymphocytes changed the RBC-r elated indexes of the peripheral blood in sheep.

AB  - Primary metabolites are ubiquitous in nature and actively involved in growth while secondary metabolites (SMs) are involved in interaction with the environment. In plants terpenes are the largest group of secondary metabolites that play an important role in defense mechanisms against the herbivores and pathogens. Plant secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, phenolics and diterpenes have a great potential against many carci-nogens. Carotenoids provide photoprotection and act as a pigment to absorb light during photosynthesis. Carotenoids are also efficient in the interaction with other organisms as they are phagostimulant and allelo-pathic agent. Flavonoids from the higher plants play a significant role in ultra-violet (UV) filtration, nitrogen fixation, floral pigmentation, and defense mechanisms against many diseases. These secondary metabolites provide protection to plants in a different type of biotic and abiotic stresses. Microorganisms also contain a high number of bioactive metabolites but not all of them. Marine microorganisms are a rich source of second-ary metabolites such as alkaloids, terpenoids, polyketides, isoprenoids and non-isoprenoid and quinones amongst others. These metabolites are anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-tumor in action. Secondary metabolites from fungi have a great therapeutic value as they have antifungal and antibacterial activity against many pathogens. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and Plant growth regulators (PGR) are the key biological entities to enhance the production of bioactive secondary metabolites in plants and can change the plant metabolome in response to various environmental stresses. This review paper will pro-vide a new insight about the role of secondary metabolites in plant defense and the role of microorganisms in modulating the plant metabolome under various environmental stresses and their interactions with other microorganisms and plant growth regulators. & COPY; 2023 SAAB.

AB  - The cationic antimicrobial peptides PGLa and magainin 2 (Mag2) are known for their antimicrobial activity and synergistic enhancement in antimicrobial and membrane leakage assays. Further use of peptides in combinatory therapy requires knowledge of the mechanisms of action of both individual peptides and their mixtures. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), double electron -electron resonance (DEER, also known as PELDOR) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies were applied to study self -assembly and localization of spin -labeled PGLa and Mag2 in POPE/POPG membranes with a wide range of peptide/lipid ratios (P/L) from -1/1500 to 1/50. EPR and DEER data showed that both peptides tend to organize in clusters, which occurs already at the lowest peptide/lipid molar ratio of 1/1500 (0.067 mol%). For individual peptides, these clusters are quite dense with intermolecular distances of the order of -2 nm. In the presence of a synergistic peptide partner, these homo-clusters are transformed into lipid -diluted hetero-clusters. These clusters are characterized by a local surface density that is several times higher than expected from a random distribution. ESEEM data indicate a slightly different insertion depth of peptides in hetero-clusters when compared to homoclusters.

AB  - The tracker based on correlation filter shows excellent performance in tracking accuracy and running speed. However, the models of correlated filter trackers are always updated with fixed weights, which can degrade the tracking performance when the target in a variety of challenging scenarios. In this paper, we present a model adaptive updating method based on a fuzzy system, which can set different updating weights on each frame to effectively deal with the challenging scenarios in the tracking process. Attractively, this method can be perfectly used in all trackers based on correlation filtering. In addition, we combine deep CNN features that can describe target semantics with HOG features that have spatial descriptions. Using their complementarity to target descriptions, we establish HOG-based filter model and CNN-based filter model. To two response maps of the models, we propose a different fusion strategy based on quality measurement of tracking results, which can balance the accuracy and robustness of the tracker. Experiments on OTB-2013, OTB-2015, benchmark videos, and VOT2018 dataset show that our tracker (called MACF) is effective and exhibits competitive results compared with the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers.

AB  - The submerged aquatic weed, Egeria densa Planch. (Hydrocharitaceae) or Brazilian waterweed, is a secondary invader of eutrophic freshwater systems in South Africa, following the successful management of floating aquatic weeds. In 2018, the leaf and stem-mining fly, Hydrellia egeriae Rodrigues-Junior, Mathis & Hauser (Diptera: Ephydridae), was released against E. densa, the first agent released against a submerged aquatic weed in South Africa. During its life stages, the biological control agent is exposed to two environments, air and water. The thermal physiology of both life stages was investigated to optimize agent establishment through fine-tuned release strategies. The thermal physiological limits of H. egeriae encompassed its host plant's optimal temperature range of 10 to 35 degrees C, with lower and upper critical temperatures of 2.6 to 47.0 degrees C, lower and upper lethal temperatures of - 5.6 and 40.6 degrees C for adults, and - 6.3 to 41.3 degrees C for larvae. Results from development time experiments and degree-day accumulation showed that the agent is capable of establishing at all E. densa sites in South Africa, with between 6.9 and 8.3 generations per year. However, cold temperatures (14 degrees C) prolonged the agent's development time to three months, allowing it to only develop through one generation in winter. Predictions obtained from laboratory thermal physiology experiments corroborates field data, where the agent has established at all the sites it was released.

AB  - Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) regulates a variety of physiological processes and plays an important role in emotional behavior. The role of ASM in fear-related behavior has not been investigated so far. Using transgenic mice overexpressing ASM (ASMtg) and ASM deficient mice, we studied whether ASM regulates fear learning and expression of cued and contextual fear in a classical fear conditioning paradigm, a model used to investigate specific attributes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We show that ASM does not affect fear learning as both ASMtg and ASM deficient mice display unaltered fear conditioning when compared to wild-type littermates. However, ASM regulates the expression of contextual fear in a sex-specific manner. While ASM overexpression enhances the expression of contextual fear in both male and female mice, ASM deficiency reduces the expression of contextual fear specifically in male mice. The expression of cued fear, however, is not regulated by ASM as ASMtg and ASM deficient mice display similar tone-elicited freezing levels. This study shows that ASM modulates the expression of contextual fear but not of cued fear in a sex-specific manner and adds a novel piece of information regarding the involvement of ASM in hippocampal-dependent aversive memory.

AB  - Cloprostenol, a synthetic derivative of prostaglandin F-2 alpha, effectively triggers functional and morphological regression of the corpus luteum (luteolysis). In rural Peru, the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) holds significance within the local economy and serves as a valuable protein source. Enhancing reproductive efficiency is crucial to achieve uniformity in weight, age, and litter size across commercial systems. Thus, our study aimed to evaluate the effect of cloprostenol with and without male stimulation on the onset, duration, and intensity of oestrus in Peru guinea pigs. A total of 128 guinea pigs (120 females and eight males) between 8 and 12 months of age, weighing between 800 and 1200 g, were distributed in cages of 15 females per treatment. Cloprostenol sodium (0 [control], 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 mg/animal) was IM administered to the groups with and without male stimulation. Four isolated males in individual cages, different from the one used for the treatment, were considered to detect oestrus. The oestrus intensity was assessed by observing sexual behaviour signs such as restlessness, moaning, attempts to mount, pelvic elevation, loin stretching, and vulvar inflammation. The oestrus was manifested 2 days after the administration of cloprostenol sodium. At a dose of 0.30 mg/animal and with male stimulation, the earliest oestrus was observed at 46.9 h. There was a reduction in the oestrus duration (p < .05) in guinea pigs that received the three doses of cloprostenol sodium compared to the control group. The highest percentages of frank oestrus intensity (66.7%) were strongly associated with the administered doses of cloprostenol sodium (p < .01). In conclusion, the cloprostenol sodium administration was proper for rapid oestrus induction in Peru guinea pigs.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a critical component in the renin-angiotensin system. A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) is the first identified sheddase for common inflammatory cytokines. Changes in ACE2 expression and its biological activity facilitated by ADAM17 are involved in several diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. Herein, the study investigated an innovative viewpoint on cadmium (Cd)-induced neurotoxicity and explored whether ADAM17/ACE2 interplay mediated the Cd-induced brain injury and neuroinflammation. For this aim, 32 adult male Wistar rats were included and randomly grouped. Eight rats served as a control group and the remaining 24 experimental rats were exposed to Cd (5 mg/kg/day, orally, 21 days); assigned as either Cd-alone (Cd group), received ADAM17 inhibitor [TAPI-1, 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal] (Cd/ TAPI-1 group), or received vitamin E, 100 mg/kg/d, orally (Cd/vit E group). Ultimately, the brains were harvested and exposed to biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies for measuring oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, histopathological examination, and for IHC identification of ADAM17, ACE2, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Cd resulted in biochemical disturbances in the inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, degenerative histopathological changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and enhanced ADAM17 and GFAP expression, meanwhile downregulated ACE2 expression. Vitamin E showed a superior effect in maintaining the oxidative/antioxidant-balanced defense system. However, the biochemical and histological changes in the brain were more effectively alleviated by TAPI-1 administration than by the partial improvement made by vitamin E therapy. These observations suggested that oxidative stress was involved in Cdmediated upregulation of ADAM17 and ACE2 shedding. It was concluded that oxidative stress, at least in part, resulted in ADAM17-mediated ACE2 cleavage in the current Cd-induced brain damage.

TI  - Hippocampal engram networks for fear memory recruit new synapses and modify pre-existing synapses in vivo
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY

KW  - DENDRITIC SPINES
KW  - REPRESENTATION
KW  - CELLS
AB  - As basic units of neural networks, ensembles of synapses underlie cognitive functions such as learning and memory. These synaptic engrams show elevated synaptic density among engram cells following contextual fear memory formation. Subsequent analysis of the CA3-CA1 engram synapse revealed larger spine sizes, as the synaptic connectivity correlated with the memory strength. Here, we elucidate the synapse dynamics be-tween CA3 and CA1 by tracking identical synapses at multiple time points by adapting two-photon micro-scopy and dual-eGRASP technique in vivo. After memory formation, synaptic connections between engram populations are enhanced in conjunction with synaptogenesis within the hippocampal network. However, extinction learning specifically correlated with the disappearance of CA3 engram to CA1 engram (E-E) syn-apses. We observed "newly formed"synapses near pre-existing synapses, which clustered CA3-CA1 engram synapses after fear memory formation. Overall, we conclude that dynamics at CA3 to CA1 E-E syn-apses are key sites for modification during fear memory states.

AB  - Background: Peri-ictal MRI abnormalities (PMA) frequently affect the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, pul-vinar of the thalamus, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. In this prospective study, we aimed to charac-terize the spectrum of PMA in a large cohort of patients with status epilepticus. Methods: We prospectively recruited 206 patients with SE and an acute MRI. The MRI protocol included diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and T1-weighted imaging pre-and post-contrast application. Peri-ictal MRI abnormalities were stratified as either neocortical or non-neocortical. Amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum, and corpus cal-losum were regarded as non-neocortical structures. Results: Peri-ictal MRI abnormalities were observed in 93/206 (45%) of patients in at least one MRI sequence. Diffusion restriction was observed in 56/206 (27%) of patients, which was mainly unilateral in 42/56 (75%) affecting neocortical structures in 25/56 (45%), non-neocortical structures in 20/56 (36%) and both areas in 11/56 (19%) of patients. Cortical DWI lesions were located mostly in frontal lobes 15/25 (60%); non-neocortical diffusion restriction affected either the pulvinar of the thalamus or hip-pocampus 29/31 (95%). Alterations in FLAIR were observed in 37/203 (18%) of patients. They were mainly unilateral 24/37 (65%); neocortical 18/37 (49%), non-neocortical 16/37 (43%), or affecting both neocortical and non-neocortical structures 3/37 (8%). In ASL, 51/140 (37%) of patients had ictal hyperperfusion. Hyperperfused areas were located mainly in the neocortex 45/51 (88%) and were unilateral 43/51 (84%). In 39/66 (59%) of patients, PMA were reversible in one week. In 27/66 (41%), the PMA persisted and a second follow-up MRI was performed three weeks later in 24/27 (89%) patients. In 19/24 (79%) PMA were resolved. Conclusions: Almost half of the patients with SE had peri-ictal MRI abnormalities. The most prevalent PMA was ictal hyperperfusion followed by diffusion restriction and FLAIR abnormalities. Neocortex was most frequently affected especially the frontal lobes. The majority of PMAs were unilateral. This paper was presented at the 8th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures held in September 2022.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

They are designated as Byki 1, Peny (Byki 4), Byki 5, Byki 7. Materials from other four sites (Byki 2, Byki 3, Byki 6 and Byki 8) are represented only by surface finds. Radiocarbon uncalibrated dates for major Byki sites are in between 18 and 16000 BP. Late Upper Paleolithic human occupations at Byki sites have been of a short-termed character. Byki site fauna collections are characterized by a dominance of ungulate and fur game species, while the most known LGM sites in the center of Eastern Europe and in the Seim river basin show a clear prevalence of mammoth.
   The Byki sites can be divided into 2 groups in accordance with the features of stone inventory. The sites of Byki-5, 6, 7 (cultural layer II) and Byki-8 are represent lamellar flint industries with a dominance of burins and backed bladelets among tools. This is also characteristic of other LGM sites in the center of Eastern Europe. At the same time, the materials of the sites of Peny, Byki 1, 2, 3 and Byki 7 (cultural layers I, Ib, Ia and Ic) sites are related to Byki archaeological culture. There were already identified the following two tool categories serving as cultural indicators for the discussing archaeological culture: flint triangles of Byki type and bone/antler elongated points of Byki type with a one-sided natural groove. Byki bone/antler points and flint triangles do not correspond to the already known other tool types serving as ?cultural-chronological markers? for various known European Late Upper Paleolithic industries.
   It is suggested that the discussing originality of Byki site artifacts is associated with local characteristics of natural environment and hunting pattern leading to development of some specific and optimal projectile weapons.

AB  - Manures can be treated by solid-liquid separation and more sophisticated, subsequent approaches. These processes generate fertilizers, which may differ in composition and N2O release potential. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of processing-related changes in digestate composition on soil-derived N2O emissions after application to soil. For that purpose, N2O emissions within the first 7 weeks after fertilization with two raw and eight processed digestates (derived from solid-liquid separation, drying and pelletizing of separated solid, and vacuum evaporation of separated liquid) were measured in the field in 2015 and 2016. Additionally, an incubation experiment was run for 51 days to further investigate the effect of subsequent solid and liquid processing on soil-derived N2O release. The results showed that, only in 2016, the separation of digestate into solid and liquid fractions led to a decrease in N2O emissions in the following order: raw digestate > separated liquid > separated solid. N removal during subsequent processing of separated solid and liquid did not significantly influence the N2O emissions after fertilization. In contrast, the concentrated application of the final products led to contradictory results. Within the solid processing chain, utilization of pellets considerably increased the N2O emissions by factors of 2.7 (field, 2015), 3.5 (field, 2016), and 7.3 (incubation) compared to separated solid. Fertilization with N-rich ammonium sulfate solution led to the lowest emissions within the liquid processing chain. It can be concluded that the input of less recalcitrant organic C into the soil plays a greater role in N2O release after fertilization than the input of ammoniacal N. Digestate processing did not generally reduce emissions but apparently has the potential to mitigate N2O emissions substantially if managed properly.

AB  - A large body of evidence indicates functional variations along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. To investi-gate whether and how value and outcome processing vary between the dorsal (DH) and the ventral hippo -campus (VH), we examined neuronal activity and inactivation effects of the DH and VH in mice performing probabilistic classical conditioning tasks. Inactivation of either structure disrupts value-dependent anticipa-tory licking, and value-coding neurons are found in both structures, indicating their involvement in value pro-cessing. However, the DH neuronal population increases activity as a function of value, while the VH neuronal population is preferentially responsive to the highest-value sensory cue. Also, signals related to outcome -dependent value learning are stronger in the DH. VH neurons instead show rapid responses to punishment and strongly biased responses to negative prediction error. These findings suggest that the DH faithfully rep-resents the external value landscape, whereas the VH preferentially represents behaviorally relevant, salient features of experienced events.

AB  - Adverse health effects have been linked with exposure to livestock farms, likely due to airborne microbial agents. Accurate exposure assessment is crucial in epidemiological studies, however limited studies have modelled bioaerosols. This study used measured concentrations in air of livestock commensals (Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus species (spp.)), and antimicrobial resistance genes (tetW and mecA) at 61 residential sites in a livestock -dense region in the Netherlands. For each microbial agent, land use regression (LUR) and random forest (RF) models were developed using Geographic Information System (GIS)-derived livestock -related characteristics as predictors. The mean and standard deviation of annual average concentrations (gene copies/m3) of E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., tetW and mecA were as follows: 38.9 (+/- 1.98), 2574 (+/- 3.29), 20991 (+/- 2.11), and 15.9 (+/- 2.58). Validated through 10 -fold cross -validation (CV), the models moderately explained spatial variation of all microbial agents. The best performing model per agent explained respectively 38.4%, 20.9%, 33.3% and 27.4% of the spatial variation of E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., tetW and mecA. RF models had somewhat better performance than LUR models. Livestock predictors related to poultry and pig farms dominated all models. To conclude, the models developed enable enhanced estimates of airborne livestock -related microbial exposure in future epidemiological studies. Consequently, this will provide valuable insights into the public health implications of exposure to specific microbial agents.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is rich in polyphenolic compounds. Particularly, flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins (PAs) are essential for the flavor and disease-resistance property of tea leaves. The fifth subgroup of R2R3-MYB transcription factors comprises the primary activators of PA biosynthesis. This study showed that subgroup 5 R2R3-MYBs in tea plants contained at least nine genes belonging to the TT2, MYB5, and MYBPA types. Tannin-rich plants showed an expansion in the number of subgroup 5 R2R3-MYB genes compared with other dicotyledonous and monocot plants. The MYBPA-type genes of tea plant were slightly expanded. qRT-PCR analysis and GUS staining analysis of promoter activity under a series of treatments revealed the differential responses of CsMYB5s to biotic and abiotic stresses. In particular, CsMYB5a, CsMYB5b, and CsMYB5e responded to high-intensity light, high temperature, MeJA, and mechanical wounding, whereas CsMYB5f and CsMYB5g were only induced by wounding. Three genetic transformation systems (C. sinensis, Nicotiana tabacum, and Arabidopsis thaliana) were used to verify the biological function of CsMYB5s. The results show that CsMYB5a, CsMYB5b, and CsMYB5e could promote the gene expression of CsLAR and CsANR. However, CsMYB5f and CsMYB5g could only upregulate the gene expression of CsLAR but not CsANR. A series of site-directed mutation and domain-swapping experiments were used to verify functional domains and key amino acids of CsMYB5s responsible for the regulation of PA biosynthesis. This study aimed to provide insight into the induced expression and functional diversity model of PA biosynthesis regulation in tea plants.

AB  - Nanoplastics (NPs) are ubiquitous in daily life, posing potential risks to the environment and human. While their negative effects on parental organisms have been extensively studied, intergenerational effects are still in the early stages of investigation. Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of maternal exposure to an environmentally relevant level of polystyrene NPs (PSNPs, 100 nm) during gestation and lactation (similar to 32 days, 50 mu g/mouse/day) on neurotoxicity mediated by the microbe-gut-brain axis in offspring mice. Maternal PSNPs exposure significantly increased brain TNF-alpha level and microglia by 1.43 and 1.48 folds respectively, compared to control, accompanied by nuclear pyknosis and cell vacuolization in cortex and hippocampus. Targeted neurotransmitter metabolomics analysis revealed dysregulation in dopamine and serotonin metabolism. Specifically, dopamine levels increased significantly from 0.007 ng/L to 0.015 ng/L, while N-acetylseroton and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid decreased significantly from 0.002 and 0.929 ng/L to 0.001 and 0.680 ng/L, respectively. Through a combination of 16S rRNA sequencing and biochemical analysis, we discovered that maternal PSNPs exposure led to a depletion of anti-inflammatory bacteria and an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria resulting in intestinal barrier damage, elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide in blood, and subsequent activation of neuroinflammation. Meanwhile, gut bacteria dysbiosis interfered with communication between gut and brain by dysregulating neurotransmitter synthesis, as evidenced by significant associations between neurotransmitterrelated bacteria (Akkermansia, Family_XIII_AD3011_group, Lachnoclostridium) and dopamine/serotonin related metabolites. Furthermore, transcriptional alterations in dopamine and serotonin related pathways were observed in the enteric nervous system, suggesting abnormal signal transduction from gut to brain contributes to neurotoxicity. This study provides new insights into NPs-induced neurotoxicity within the context of microbe-gut-brain axis and highlights the risk of cerebral dysfunction in offspring with maternal NPs exposure.

AB  - The research study investigates a remediation technique that combines phytoremediation with organo-alkaline amendments on a laboratory scale to address heavy metal contamination in waste from the Kettara mine in Marrakech, Morocco. The experiment involved pots filled with mine tailings mixed with various alkaline inorganic amendments (marble, snail shell, phosphate sludge), with and without organic amendments (sheep manure) in different combinations with Tagetes erecta L. (Aztec Marigold) culture. Key physicochemical parameters and trace metals (copper, lead, zinc) were measured in the tailings before and after treatment, and the metal content of the harvested plants was also analysed. The translocation factor (TF), bioconcentration factor (BCF), and enrichment coefficient (ECf) were evaluated. Results indicated that the initially extremely acidic pH of the tailings (1.23) was neutralised to 7.82 after treatment with alkaline inorganic amendments, enhancing plant viability in the pots. After rehabilitation, the concentrations of copper, zinc, and lead metals were significantly reduced, particularly with the combination of snail shell and phytoremediation, compared to mine tailings alone, which did not encourage any plant growth. Most extracted metals accumulate in the plant's roots, making Tagetes erecta L. (Aztec Marigold) a suitable candidate for phytostabilization of these contaminants.

AB  - Sleep is essential for brain physiology, including nerve repair, neuronal activity, and metabolite clearance. The hippocampus is responsible for short-term memory, long-term memory, and spatial positioning. Herein, we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on protein phosphorylation and related signaling pathways in the mouse hippocampus. The treatment group was sleep deprived for nine hours a day, and at the end of sleep deprivation, we removed the hippocampus for phosphoproteomic analysis. Through this analysis, we identified 65 sites and 27 proteins whose phosphorylation was significantly different between sleep-deprived animals and control animals. Differentially phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) were mainly distributed in the postsynaptic density, cytoplasm, and synapse. They participated in metabolic pathways, endocytosis, oxidative phosphorylation and other processes, and they were associated with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc. Functional analysis of the phosphoproteome shows that sleep deprivation significantly affects the level of protein phosphorylation in the hippocampus of mice. This is the first reported study that has used phosphoproteomics to investigate the effects of sleep deprivation on hypothalamic regions. This study provides data resources that can serve as a valuable reference for sleep mechanism research, sleep disorder treatment, and drug development.

AB  - Pangolins are one of the most threatened mammal groups, as a result of habitat loss and exploitation for their meat, scales, and other body parts. However, there is a lack of quantitative data on pangolin populations; their behaviour and ecology make them challenging to survey. We undertook systematic camera-trap surveys of the 5260 km(2) World Heritage Dja Faunal Reserve, Cameroon, sampling 305 sites in eight grids over 28,277 camera-trap days. We recorded 768 images of giant pangolin in 99 independent detections at 57 sites (RAI = 0.35), and 2282 images in 355 detections (RAI = 1.26) of white-bellied pangolin at 137 sites. Ground-dwelling giant pangolins were largely confined to the core of the Reserve. Semi-arboreal white-bellied pangolins were predominantly distributed in the northeast, east and south of the Reserve. Lower occupancy in the west and northwest could partly be due to pressures from human settlements around the Hydromekin Dam and Sud-Cameroun Hevea rubber plantation. Our study suggests that at the ground-level the two species do not spatially segregate, and both were active throughout the night. We found high diel activity overlap, although there was a significant difference in activity peak times. There was also evidence of white-bellied pangolin possibly exhibiting fine-scale behavioural avoidance of giant pangolin.

AB  - Hexi Corridor is one of the most important base of vegetable producing areas in China. Livestock manure (LM) applied to agricultural field could lead to soil heavy metal (HM) pollution. Previous studies have focused on HM pollution following LM application in acidic polluted soils; however, fewer studies have been conducted in alkaline unpolluted soils. A 4-year field vegetable production experiment was conducted using pig manure (PM) and chicken manure (CM) at five application rates (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 t ha(- 1)) to elucidate potential risks of HMs in an alkaline unpolluted soil in the Hexi Corridor oasis agricultural area and HM uptake by Chinese cabbage. The results showed that LM application caused a significant build-up of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni content in topsoil by 30.6-99.7%, 11.4-51.7%, 1.4-31.3%, 5.6-44.9%, 14%-40.8%, respectively. The Cd, Cu, Zn could potentially exceed the soil threshold in next 8-65 years after 15-60 t ha(- 1) LM application. Under LM treatment, the soil DTPA-extractable Cu, Zn, Fe, the acid-extractable fraction of Cu, Zn, Fe, Cd, Ni, and the Oxidable fraction of Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Cd, Ni significantly increased, but the DTPA-extractable Pb, Cd, the acid-extractable fraction of Pb, and the reducible fraction of Cd significantly decreased. Cu and Zn could migrate to the deeper soil and relatively increase in DTPA-extracted Cu, Zn were found in 20-40 cm soil depth after LM application. The pH and SOM could influence the bioavailability of HMs in soil. The bioaccumulation factor and transfer factor (TF) values were <1 except Mn (TF > 1). HMs in leaf did not approach the threshold for HM toxicity due to the "dilution effect". Recommend the type of manure was the PM and the annual PM application rate was 30 t ha(- 1) to ensure a 20-year period of clean production in alkaline unpolluted Fluvo-aqiuc vegetable soils.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare several culture systems for cat embryos. Domestic cat oocytes were matured in vitro (IVM), fertilized (IVF), and cultured individually or in groups in drops under oil (20 mu L or 50 mu L) and in 16 microwell dishes (Primo Vision (R)). Moreover, the effects of co-culture with a) uncleaved oocytes, b) homospecific and c) heterospecific co-culture with cat and sheep companion embryos were investigated using a time-lapse system. A higher proportion of blastocysts and hatching blastocysts was observed after culture in Primo Vision (R) dishes compared with the classical individual (p < 0.001) and group (p < 0.05) culture systems. Culture of presumptive zygotes 16 hpi and the presence of uncleaved oocytes did not reduce blastocyst development compared with culture of embryos 24 hpi without uncleaved oocytes. Co-culture with later-stage companion cator sheep embryos accelerated development of catembryos. The highest percentage of blastocysts was obtained in the group co-cultured with sheep embryos (54%). Moreover, the blastocyst cavity formed on average 10 h faster in this group than for the control group and for embryos co-cultured with cat embryos. The proportion of hatching blastocysts was similar in the co-cultures with cat and with sheep embryos (20% vs. 22%) and significantly (p < 0.05) than in the control group (12%).(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Archaeological excavations in urban and rural contexts often uncover dark homogeneous anthropogenic deposits, soils and soil horizons, known as Dark Earths, Cultural Layers and Anthrosols. Major scientific questions arise about the processes that lead to the formation of these soils and deposits, as they are often related to a complex combination of environmental, climatic, and anthropogenic factors. Many studies focused on the morphological and physical-chemical investigation of the archaeological remains found as well as the inorganic constituent of the soil. The organic fraction has been only roughly investigated and studies carried out on a molecular level are very limited. However, a more refined investigation of the chemical constituents of these soils can potentially reveal pivotal insights on the archaeological context such as past domestic habits and/or urban organization. It has been demonstrated that, among organic matter constituents, fecal steroids are promising biomarkers to track fecal input in many environmental matrixes such as water, soils, and sediments. In this paper we determine the fecal sterols and stanols content in dark homogeneous anthropogenic deposits and soils found in seven archaeological sites in Italy (from Verona, Como, Florence, Mel and Conegliano) dated from the Late Bronze Age and the Medieval Period, aiming to assess the major contribution of the fecal input using diagnostic fecal indexes obtained from specific fecal sterol proportions. To this purpose, a baseline was established by identifying the fecal fingerprint of domestic herbivores (caprids, ovines, equines and bovines) and omnivores (pigs). Based on their fecal fingerprint, we classified the deposits of seven studied sites into four distinct categories: i) the medieval sites of Verona, presented a strong mixed fecal input from both herbivores and humans; ii) the medieval sites of Como and Florence which showed a similar pattern, with a predominance of human fecal input over livestock; iii) the late medieval soils of Mel and the late bronze age Cultural Layers of Castellar di Leppia (Verona) which exhibited a generally scarce fecal contamination while iv) the final bronze age site of Conegliano (Treviso), a strong fecal contamination from herbivores was detected. These results thus demonstrate that for the Medieval Dark Earth the socio-cultural processes leading to the formation of the Dark Earth differ in terms of sewage and waste management and/or in animal husbandry practices.

AB  - BackgroundInadequate sleep during pregnancy negatively affects the neural development of offspring. Previous studies have focused on the continuous sleep deprivation (CSD) paradigm, but the sleep pattern during late pregnancy is usually fragmented. ObjectiveTo compare the effects of CSD and fragmented sleep deprivation (FSD) in late pregnancy on emotion, cognition, and expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins in offspring mice. MethodsPregnant CD-1 mice were either subjected to 3/6 h of CSD/FSD during gestation days 15-21, while those in the control group were left untreated. After delivery, the offspring were divided into five groups, i.e., control (CON), short or long CSD (CSD3h, CSD6h), and short or long FSD (FSD3h, FSD6h). When the offspring were 2 months old, the anxiety-like behavior level was tested using the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and spatial learning and memory were evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The expression of hippocampal of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1) was determined using RT-PCR and western blotting. ResultsThe CSD6h, FSD3h, and FSD6h had longer latency, fewer center times in the OF test, less open arms time and fewer numbers of entries in the open arms of the EPM, longer learning distance swam and lower memory percentage of distance swam in the target quadrant in the MWM test, and decreased BDNF and increased Syt-1 mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus. Compared to the CSD6h, the FSD3h and FSD6h had longer distance swam, a lower percentage of distance swam in the target quadrant, decreased BDNF, and increased Syt-1 mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus. ConclusionThe results suggested that maternal sleep deprivation during late pregnancy impairs emotion and cognition in offspring, and FSD worsened the cognitive performance to a higher extent than CSD. The observed cognitive impairment could be associated with the expression of altered hippocampal of Bdnf and Syt-1 genes.

AB  - Y We present a similar to 40-year record of environmental change in the Swan Oxbow, Yangtze River, China, inferred from testate amoeba and sedimentary pigment data, combined with remote sensing and analysis of local socio-economic growth. These data indicate there were several distinct phases of aquatic conditions linked to human activities in the region: (1) Between ca. AD 1970 and 1984, there may have been some exchange of water and organic matter between the Swan Oxbow and the main river channel, following initial hydrologic disconnection in 1972. The lake area was relatively large in the early phase after the oxbow first formed, and the trophic state generally increased during that time frame, (2) From ca. AD 1984 to 1992, the lake area was about a third smaller in size, while the human population and GDP increased about 10% and 10x, respectively, compared to values in 1975. The nutrient status (inferred from testate amoeba and pigment data) increased, owing to the greater discharge of nutrients and separation of the Swan Oxbow from the main Yangtze River, which reduced water supply and increased sedimentation in the oxbow, (3) From ca. AD 1992 to 2003, the lake continued to diminish in size, to an area < 20 km(2), except in 1998, when a major flood occurred. The testate amoeba and pigment data suggest that water quality had improved by that time, which probably reflects efforts to control agricultural and industrial activities, including establishment of two national reserves in 1992 and 1993, created to protect the rare Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) and the freshwater Baiji dolphin (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis), (4) From ca. AD 2003 to 2005, the water area remained relatively unchanged, owing to construction of a dam following the 1998 flood. Occurrence of testate amoeba species Difflugia biwae and D. tuberspinifera, however, indicates that water pollution and eutrophication had been controlled in Swan Oxbow. The Swan Oxbow yielded important information about the effects of environmental protection and restoration in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.

AB  - Catechins were diversely accumulated in Thea plants and were crucial for tea flavor, yet the mechanism underlying the diverse catechins distribution in Thea plants remained elusive. We herein collected a total of 19 Thea and 12 non-Thea plants to investigate their catechins distribution and the underlying mechanism. Results showed that the distribution pattern of catechins in cultivated tea plants significantly differs from that of wild relatives. (+)-Gallocatechin gallate (GCG) was detected in over 50% of wild tea plants but was almost undetectable in cultivated tea plants. Conversely, (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was extensively distributed in tea cultivars but accumulated extremely low in a few wild relatives such as Camellia tetracocca and C. ptilophylla. Expression analysis found that the expression of flavonoid 3 ',5 '-hydroxylase (F3 ' 5 ' H) was highly correlated with EGCG accumulation in Thea plants. Yeast one-hybrid and luciferase assays showed that CsMYB1, a key catechins regulator, could bind to the promoter of F3 ' 5 ' H and activate its expression to promote EGCG accumulation in cultivated tea plants; yet it was unable to bind to and activate the promoter of F3 ' 5 ' H of C. tetracocca due to a 14-bp deletion in the promoter, leading to a low content of EGCG. Results also showed that silencing the expression of anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) enhanced the metabolic flux of catechins toward GCG but not EGCG in tea plants, consistent with the observation of high GCG content in C. ptilophylla with low ANS expression. Overall, the results illustrated the mechanism underlying catechins variation in Thea plants and would help to facilitate the utilization of wild tea plants toward future breeding.

AB  - The systemic effects of the artificial sweetener sorbitol on older adult individuals have not been elucidated. We assessed the effects of sorbitol consumption on cognitive and gingival health in a mouse model. Aged mice were fed 5% sorbitol for 3 months before their behavior was assessed, and brain and gingival tissues were collected. Long-term sorbitol consumption inhibited gingival tissue aging in aged mice. However, it caused cognitive decline and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Sorbitol consumption did not affect homeostatic function; however, it may exert effects within the brain, particularly in the hippocampus.

AB  - Simple Summary This study examined changes in piglet fecal microbiomes from birth through weaning and their associations with sows. Samples from eight sows and sixty-three piglets were analyzed, revealing that Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria dominated early piglet microbiomes, which are crucial for intestinal balance during nursing. After weaning, piglets fed solid food had increased levels of Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Succinivibrio, and Prevotella. The study also suggested that the piglet intestinal microbiome is vertically transmitted from the mother. More research is needed to understand the early establishment of piglet intestinal microbiomes by integrating factors related to sows, piglets, and the environment.Abstract The intestinal microbiome plays a crucial role in animal health and growth by interacting with the host, inhibiting pathogenic microbial colonization, and regulating immunity. This study investigated dynamic changes in the fecal microbial composition of piglets from birth through weaning and the relationship between the piglet fecal microbiome and sows. Feces, skin, neonatal oral cavity, and vaginal samples were collected from eight sows and sixty-three piglets, and 16S genome sequencing was performed. The results revealed that Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria dominated the piglet microbiome in the early stages, and Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were crucial for maintaining a balance in the intestinal microbiome during nursing. The abundance of Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Succinivibrio, and Prevotella increased in weaned piglets fed solid feed. Analysis of the microbiome from sows to piglets indicated a shift in the microbiome colonizing piglet intestines, which became a significant constituent of the piglet intestinal microbiome. This study supports the theory that the neonatal intestinal microbiome is vertically transmitted from the mother. Further research is required to integrate factors related to sows, piglets, and their environments to gain a better understanding of the early establishment of the intestinal microbiome in piglets.

AB  - Acute kidney injury, which is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality, affects a significant number of individuals, and can be triggered by multiple factors, such as medications, exposure to toxic chemicals or other substances, disease, and trauma. Because the kidney is a critical organ, understanding and identifying early cellular or gene-level changes can provide a foundation for designing medical interventions. In our earlier work, we identified gene modules anchored to histopathology phenotypes associated with toxicant-induced liver and kidney injuries. Here, using in vivo and in vitro experiments, we assessed and validated these kidney injury-associated modules by analyzing gene expression data from the kidneys of male Hartley guinea pigs exposed to mercuric chloride. Using plasma creatinine levels and cell-viability assays as measures of the extent of renal dysfunction under in vivo and in vitro conditions, we performed an initial range-finding study to identify the appropriate doses and exposure times associated with mild and severe kidney injuries. We then monitored changes in kidney gene expression at the selected doses and time points post-toxicant exposure to characterize the mechanisms of kidney injury. Our injury module-based analysis revealed a dose-dependent activation of several phenotypic cellular processes associated with dilatation, necrosis, and fibrogenesis that were common across the experimental platforms and indicative of processes that initiate kidney damage. Furthermore, a comparison of activated injury modules between guinea pigs and rats indicated a strong correlation between the modules, highlighting their potential for cross-species translational studies.

AB  - With the growing complexity and quantity of machine tools, the emergence of various faults threatens manufacturing process stability. Existing methods often fail to effectively utilize knowledge for fault causality reasoning and maintenance service provision, while the absence of intuitive visual guidance results in low maintenance efficiency and potential misoperations. To address this issue, a novel machine tool fault reasoning and maintenance service recommendation approach through data-knowledge empowered LLMs (Large Language Models) integrated with AR (Augmented Reality)-assisted visible guidance. Firstly, a scene graph is established to analyze fault correlations through semantic associations, enabling comprehensive fault-root cause analysis. Based on this, an industrial LLM is constructed by integrating fault-maintenance scene graphs with foundational Llama 3, employing prompt-based fine-tuning and multi-agent collaborative fault detection. On the one hand, multi-agent collaborative fault detection leverages a network of agents working in tandem to enhance fault identification efficiency. On the other hand, the integration of AR-assisted visual guidance facilitates accurate fault localization and provides maintenance personnel with enhanced operational support, significantly improving maintenance efficiency and accuracy. The comparative experimental results indicate that the proposed industrial LLM demonstrates superior capability in modeling complex node relationships and identifying intricate patterns within large-scale graph datasets, enabling precise maintenance service recommendations. Based on this, a significant advancement in predictive maintenance can be offered for complex machine tools by the proposed comprehensive approach.

AB  - Three new species of 'tetraphyllideans' in the family Serendipeidae are described from cownose rays off Senegal. Duplicibothrium jeannettae n. sp. and Duplicibothrium collosum n. sp. parasitize both Rhinoptera marginata and Rhinoptera peli. Duplicibothrium jillae n. sp. parasitizes R. marginata. Duplicibothrium jeannettae n. sp. and D. jillae n. sp. differ from one another and their described congeners in size, number of proglottids, and locular configuration. The generic assignment of D. collosum n. sp. was initially unclear because its scolex more closely resembles that of Serendip than Duplicibothrium. To help inform generic placement, sequence data were generated for the 28S rDNA gene (D1-D3 region) for the three new species as well as for Duplicibothrium minutum and Duplicibothrium n. sp. 2 from Rhinoptera bonasus off North Carolina, Duplicibothrium n. sp. 3 from Rhinoptera brasiliensis off Belize, Duplicibothrium n. sp. 4 and Duplicibothrium n. sp. 5 from Rhinoptera jayakari off Mozambique, and Duplicibothrium n. sp. 6 from Rhinoptera neglecta off Australia. Comparable data were obtained from GenBank for adults and larvae of Duplicibothrium collected from the Gulf of Mexico. The tree resulting from a maximum likelihood analysis (MLA) placed D. collosum n. sp. robustly within Duplicibothrium; the generic diagnosis is emended accordingly. This raises a question regarding the independence, and thus also validity, of the three genera of the Serendipeidae - a question that must await a molecular analysis that includes Serendip and Glyphobothrium. These results extend the hosts of Duplicibothrium to include R. brasiliensis, R. jayakari, R. marginata, R. neglecta and R. peli, and the distribution to include the western Pacific Ocean, eastern Atlantic Ocean, and western Indian Ocean (Zoobank Registration: 97BB5020-BFFF-4FEA-AE07-B4711D1110FC).

AB  - The Elemental defense hypothesis suggested that metal accumulation in plant tissues could serve as direct defense to reduce herbivore feeding preference as metals are toxic to phytophagous insects. However, the indirectly defensive role of heavy metals on host plant odor selection and oviposition preference of leaf herbivores through the changes in leaf volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is still unknown. In this study, we used a local woody plant species, Populus yunnanensis, to investigate whether soil cadmium (Cd) stress could affect plant VOC production and whether Cdmediated changes in leaf VOC emissions will further influence the host plant odor and oviposition preferences of female adults of a specialist and a generalist herbivore species. The results clearly showed that the soil Cd stress could prominently induce leaf total VOC emissions of P. yunnanensis and such induction was positively correlated with leaf Cd accumulation. Herbivore olfactometer bioassays further demonstrated that the VOCs released by P. yunnanensis under Cd exposure are far less attractive to both of the specialist and generalist female adults compared to control plants, leading to significant reduction in oviposition on Cd-treated plants. Moreover, the host plant odor selection and oviposition preference of the two herbivore species were all negatively correlated with leaf total VOC emissions, which confirmed the defensive role of Cd-induced VOCs for deterring the female insects. The result will extend the existing knowledge of the Elemental defense hypothesis and provide newinsight into predicting the herbivore damage level of poplar species that naturally occurred in metal-polluted habitats.

AB  - Adolescence is characterized by a critical period of maturation and growth, during which regions of the brain are vulnerable to long-lasting cognitive disturbances. Adolescent exposure to nicotine can lead to deleterious neurological and psychological outcomes. Moreover, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been shown to play a functionally distinct role in the development of the adolescent brain. CHRNA2 encodes for the alpha 2 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors associated with CA1 oriens lacunosum moleculare GABAergic interneurons and is associated with learning and memory. Previously, we found that adolescent male hypersensitive CHRNA2L9 ' S/L9 ' mice had impairments in learning and memory during a pre-exposure-dependent contextual fear conditioning task that could be rescued by low-dose nicotine exposure. In this study, we assessed learning and memory in female adolescent hypersensitive CHRNA2L9 ' S/L9 ' mice exposed to saline or a subthreshold dose of nicotine using a hippocampus-dependent task of pre-exposure-dependent contextual fear conditioning. We found that nicotine-treated wild-type female mice had significantly greater improvements in learning and memory than both saline-treated wild-type mice and nicotine-treated CHRNA2L9 ' S/L9 ' female mice. Thus, hyperexcitability of CHRNA2 in female adolescent mice ablated the nicotine-mediated potentiation of learning and memory seen in wild-types. Our results indicate that nicotine exposure during adolescence mediates sexually dimorphic patterns of learning and memory, with wild-type female adolescents being more susceptible to the effects of sub-threshold nicotine exposure. To understand the mechanism underlying sexually dimorphic behavior between hyperexcitable CHRNA2 mice, it is critical that further research be conducted.

AB  - Muskrat musk is considered to be a potential substitute for traditional musk. However, little is known about the similarity between muskrat musk and musk, and whether it is related to muskrat age. In this study, muskrat musk (MR1, MR2, and MR3) were from 1, 2, and 3-year-old muskrats, respectively, and white musk (WM) and brown musk (BM) were picked from male forest musk deer. The results indicated that muskrat musk had higher similarity to WM than BM. Further research showed that RM3 had the highest matched degree with WM. By significantly different metabolite analysis, we found that 52 metabolites continue to increase from 1- to 3-year-old muskrats. In total, 7 and 15 metabolites were significantly decreased in RM1 vs. RM2 and RM2 vs. RM3, respectively. Meanwhile, 30 and 17 signaling pathways were observed from increased and decreased metabolites, respectively. The increased metabolites mainly entailed enrichment in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. In conclusion, muskrat musk from three-year-old muskrat is a relatively good substitute for white musk, and the result also implies that these biological processes of amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis are beneficial to the secretion of muskrat musk.

AB  - The appropriateness of edible formulations of the parasiticide fungi Mucor circinelloides (ovicide) and Dudding-tonia flagrans (larvicide) for the control of helminths affecting animals has been tested in two assays. Firstly, gelatin-based treats were manufactured with a blend of 3 - 6.107 chlamydospores each fungus and provided to three groups of six puppies each passing eggs of Toxocara canis, thrice a week for eight weeks. Feces collected at the end of this period were analyzed during four weeks to estimate the egg viability, the counts of infective eggs and the soil contamination index. The usefulness of the edible formulation comprised checking for the easiness of preparation and administration, the level of acceptance by the targeted animals and the expiration interval. A similar assay was conducted on a group of six captive baboons, but some refused to ingest the gelatins and others did it with difficulty. The second assay consisted of drying the gelatin treats and administering (thrice a week for eight weeks) to other two groups of six pups each infected by T. canis (different from those in assay I), and to six baboons captive in a zoo and passing eggs of Trichuris sp. (this probe on baboons was performed in triplicate at a four-month interval). Feces collected after eight weeks were examined for four weeks as mentioned previously.Viability of eggs of T. canis was significantly halved with the two edible formulations, and 44% reached the infective stage. In the feces of baboons taking dry gelatins, 50% eggs of Trichuris sp. remained viable, and 14% attained infectivity. Soil contamination by these nematodes was 20 and 5%, respectively. It was concluded that gelatin treats containing chlamydospores of a blend of M. circinelloides and D. flagrans offer a highly effective and practical formulation to develop strategies for the biological control of helminths affecting pets. In addition to retaining the high helminthicidal activity, the dehydration of the gelatins provides a very safe edible formulation, easy to store at room temperature and to give to companion animals and captive wild species, thus its admin-istration is strongly advised to reduce the risk of infection by soil-transmitted helminths.

AB  - Corneal fibroblasts are central to normal and abnormal wound healing in the cornea. During the wound healing process, several biochemical and biophysical signals that are present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) play critical roles in regulating corneal fibroblast behavior. The translocation and activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP)-a main transcriptional factor in the Hippo signaling pathway-is one example of mechanotransduction involving these signals. However, how corneal fibroblasts integrate these simultaneous cues is unknown. In this study, we utilized well-defined micropatterns of aligned collagen fibrils and other ECM proteins to explore the effects of cell density, topography, geometric confinement, and ECM composition on the translocation of YAP in corneal fibroblasts. We observed that when human corneal fibroblasts (HTKs) were confined to narrow micropatterns (50 mu m and 100 mu m) of proteins, there was a high degree of cell alignment irrespective of cell seeding density. However, the location of YAP was dependent upon the cell seeding density, ECM composition, and topography. YAP was more nuclear-localized on substrates coated with aligned collagen fibrils or fibronectin as compared to substrates coated with monomeric collagen, random collagen fibrils, or poly-L-Lysine. In addition, we also observed that YAP nuclear localization was significantly reduced when HTKs were cultured on aligned collagen fibrils, monomeric collagen, or fibronectin in the presence of monoclonal blocking antibodies against alpha 5 or beta 1 integrin subunits. Finally, we observed that HTK cells formed fibrillar fibronectin on both monomeric collagen and aligned collagen fibrils. These findings provide new insights into how simultaneous biochemical and biophysical cues affect YAP localization in corneal fibroblasts.

AB  - Altered fear learning is a strong behavioral component of anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent efforts have attempted to combine exposure therapies with drugs that target fear memory retrieval and memory reconsolidation, in order to improve treatment efficacy. The noradrenergic (NA) signaling system is of particular interest, due to its role in regulating the stress response and its involvement in fear and learning processes. Importantly, propranolol (P), a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist, has shown the potential in decreasing exaggerated fear in both humans and animal models. In a previous study, we utilized an activity-dependent tagging murine model to determine the neural mechanisms by which propranolol attenuates learned fear. We found that propranolol acutely decreased memory trace reactivation specifically in the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG), but not in CA3 or CA1. Here, we extended our previous study by investigating whether propranolol additionally altered activity in the hilus, a polymorphic layer that consists of neurons, mossy cells, and GABAergic interneurons. We found that propranolol acutely reduced overall hilar activity in both the dorsal and ventral hilus. Moreover, we report that propranolol significantly altered the activity of parvalbumin (PV)(+) cells in the ventral (vDG), but not dorsal DG (dDG). Together, these results suggest that a beta-adrenergic blockade may affect the activity of excitatory and inhibitory cell types in the hilar layer of the DG, and that these alterations may contribute to manipulating fear memory traces.

AB  - alpha-Ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) is a metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It has a strong antioxidant function and can effectively prevent oxidative damage. Previous studies have shown that alpha-KG exists in porcine follicles, and its content gradually increases as the follicles grow and mature. However, the potential mechanism of supplementation of alpha-KG on porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation (IVM) has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of alpha-KG on the early embryonic development of pigs and the mechanisms underlying these effects. We found that alpha-KG can enhance the development of early pig embryos. Adding 20 mu M alpha-KG to the in vitro culture medium significantly increased the rate of blastocyst formation and the total cell number. Compared with to that of the control group, apoptosis in blastocysts of the supplement group was significantly reduced. alpha-KG reduced the production of reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels in cells. alpha-KG not only improved the activity of mitochondria but also inhibited the occurrence of apoptosis. After supplementation with alpha-KG, pig embryo pluripotency-related genes (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2) and antiapoptotic genes (Bcl2) were upregulated. In terms of mechanism, alpha-KG activates the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway to regulate the expression of antioxidant-related targets, thus combating oxidative stress during the in vitro culture of oocytes. Activated Nrf2 promotes the transcription of Bcl2 genes and inhibits cell apoptosis. These results indicate that alpha-KG supplements have a beneficial effect on IVM by regulating oxidative stress during the IVM of porcine oocytes and can be used as a potential antioxidant for IVM of porcine oocytes.

AB  - The fatty acid content and the localization and expression of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) in the testis of Hu sheep were investigated. A total of 18 six-month-old Hu sheep were divided into small group (S, with left testis weight < 50 g), medium group (M, with left testis weight among 90-110 g), and large group (L, with left testis weight >160 g), which had six individuals each. The expression of PLA(2) in testicular tissues of different sizes was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, and Western blot. The fatty acid profile was detected by gas chromatography. Immunohistochemical labeling determined that PLA(2) protein was expressed in the Leydig and Sertoli cells of testis, and the immunohistochemical average optional density in the S group was significantly greater than the L group (P < 0.05). RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis showed that PLA(2) in the S group was greater than that in the L group (P < 0.05). Docosahexaenoic acid, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and total PUFA content in the testis of the L group were significantly less than those of the S and M groups (P < 0.01). This study showed that PLA(2) content in the S group was greater than that in the L group.

AB  - Background Flycatching bats are species-rare and comprise predominantly horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae). Their hang-and-wait foraging mode and long constant-frequency echolocation calls offer advantages in energetics and prey detection, and may enable them apt to foraging optimally, yet not much is known about the foraging behavior of flycatching bats. Thus we assessed the perch use and foraging performance in the field by one of the largest horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus formosae, and offered insights on their perch time allocation. Results The perching-foraging behaviors of the bats did not differ significantly between forest settings, but the residence and giving-up time, mean attack, and attack rate were higher in the late spring-early summer, whereas the mean capture, capture rate, and attack efficiency were lower in the late summer when volant juveniles joined the nocturnal activity. The bats maintained flycatching and exhibited largely similar attack rates through the night with peak residence time around the midnight, but the capture rate and attack efficiency both reduced toward midnight and then increased toward the hours right before dawn. The attack rate was negatively correlated to the number of perches used and perch switch; by contrast, the capture rate was positively correlated with both factors. The total residence time at a site increased but mean residence time per perch decreased as the number of perches used and perch-switch increased. The giving-up time was inversely correlated to the attack rate and attack efficiency, and decreased with an increasing capture rate. Conclusions The bats increased perch switch at lower attack rates in early spring, but switched less frequently in late spring and prime summer months when insect abundance is higher. By scanning through a broad angular range for prey detection, and switching more frequently among perches, R. formosae foraged with an increased capture rate, and were able to remain at the site longer by slightly reducing their mean residence time per perch. Our results concur with the predictions of optimal foraging theory for patch selection and offer implications for further exploration of the foraging behavior of flycatching horseshoe bats.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for depression based on the monoamine deficiency hypothesis. However, the clinical use of these agents is controversial, in part because of their variable clinical efficacy and in part because of their delayed onset of action. Because of the complexities involved in replicating human disease and clinical dosing in animal models, the scientific community has not reached a consensus on the reasons for these phenomena. In this work, we create a theoretical hippocampal model incorporating escitalopram's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (competitive and non-competitive inhibition, and serotonin transporter (SERT) internalization), inflammation, and receptor dynamics. With this model, we simulate chronic oral escitalopram in mice showing that days to weeks are needed for serotonin levels to reach steady-state. We show escitalopram's chemical efficacy is diminished under inflammation. Our model thus offers mechanisms for how chronic escitalopram affects brain serotonin, emphasizing the importance of optimized dose and time for future antidepressant discoveries.
   A mathematical study of the pharmacological effects of oral chronic escitalopram in serotonin neurotransmission and how these effects are hindered by inflammatory processes.

AB  - Mentha haplocalyx Briq (MHB) and its components have been proven to improve the growth performance of livestock and poultry. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of MHB addition on growth performance, rumen and fecal microbiota, rumen fluid, serum and urine metabolism, and transcriptomics of rumen epithelial cells in meat sheep. Twelve Hu sheep were selected for the experiment and fed with basic diet (CON) and a basal diet supplemented with 80 g/kg DM of Mentha haplocalyx Briq (MHB). The experimental period was 10 weeks with the first 2 weeks as the pre-trial period. The results showed that compared with the CON group, the average daily weight gain of meat sheep in the MHB group increased by 20.1%; the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration significantly increased (p < 0.05); The thickness of the cecal mucosal layer was significantly reduced (p < 0.01), while the thickness of the colonic mucosal layer was significantly increased (p < 0.05), the length of ileal villi significantly increased (p < 0.01), the thickness of colonic mucosal layer and rectal mucosal muscle layer significantly increased (p < 0.05), and the thickness of cecal mucosal layer significantly decreased (p < 0.05); The serum antioxidant capacity has increased. At the genus level, the addition of MHB changed the composition of rumen and fecal microbiota, increased the relative abundance of Paraprevotella, Alloprevotella, Marinilabilia, Saccharibacteria_genera_incertae_sedis, Subdivision5_genera_incertae_sedis and Ornatilinea in rumen microbiota, and decreased the relative abundance of Blautia (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Prevotella, Clostridium XlVb and Parasutterella increased in fecal microbiota, while the relative abundance of Blautia and Coprococcus decreased (p < 0.05). There were significant differences in the concentrations of 105, 163, and 54 metabolites in the rumen, serum, and urine between the MHB group and the CON group (p < 0.05). The main metabolic pathways of the differences were pyrimidine metabolism, taurine and taurine metabolism, glyceride metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (p < 0.05), which had a significant impact on protein synthesis and energy metabolism. The transcriptome sequencing results showed that differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in immune regulation, energy metabolism, and protein modification. Therefore, adding MHB improved the growth performance of lambs by altering rumen and intestinal microbiota, rumen, serum and urine metabolomics, and transcriptome.

AB  - In the process of urbanization, a brisk building boom triggers a series of environmental problems. Construction contractors usually present environmentally fraudulent behaviors, i.e., greenwashing behaviors (GWBs), to legitimize their activities, ultimately hindering the sustainable development of the society. However, the formation mechanism of the contractors' GWBs is still unclear. Through the lens of fraud GONE theory (i.e., greed, opportunity, needs, and exposure), this study applies the multi-group structural equation model (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine the formation mechanisms of GWBs. The results of SEM show the relationships between four fraud factors and GWBs. Additionally, the projects are grouped into three categories: government investment projects, private-public-partnership (PPP) projects, and private investment projects. The results of multi-group SEM reveal that the effects of four fraud factors differ significantly across projects with different investment characteristics. The results of fsQCA suggest that there are three typical driving mechanisms for GWBs. Furthermore, this study develops a project information transparency framework and a "greenwashing tree" to form a systematic understanding of GWBs. Finally, on these bases, this study provides targeted suggestions and policy recommendations for governing contractors' GWBs.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in plants are emerging as new players in biotic stress responses. Pathogen-associated lncRNAs have been broadly identified and functionally characterized in multiple species. However, herbivore-responsive lncRNAs in plants are poorly investigated. Our recent study revealed that lncRNAs also play roles in plant defense against herbivores in wild tobacco. Here, we identified armyworm (AW)-elicited lncRNAs in monocot rice by employing a similar approach. A total of 238 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DE) in AW-treated plants relative to control plants. The cis effect of these DE lncRNAs was predicted. Interestingly, one DE lncRNA was identified from the antisense transcripts of the jasmonate ZIM-domain gene JAZ10.
