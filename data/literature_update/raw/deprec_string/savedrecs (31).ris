AB  - Almost all herbivorous insects feed on plants and use sucrose as a feeding stimulant, but the molecular basis of their sucrose reception remains unclear. Helicoverpa armigera as a notorious crop pest worldwide mainly feeds on reproductive organs of many plant species in the larval stage, and its adult draws nectar. In this study, we determined that the sucrose sensory neurons located in the contact chemosensilla on larval maxillary galea were 100-1000 times more sensitive to sucrose than those on adult antennae, tarsi, and proboscis. Using the Xenopus expression system, we discovered that Gr10 highly expressed in the larval sensilla was specifically tuned to sucrose, while Gr6 highly expressed in the adult sensilla responded to fucose, sucrose and fructose. Moreover, using CRISPR/Cas9, we revealed that Gr10 was mainly used by larvae to detect lower sucrose, while Gr6 was primarily used by adults to detect higher sucrose and other saccharides, which results in differences in selectivity and sensitivity between larval and adult sugar sensory neurons. Our results demonstrate the sugar receptors in this moth are evolved to adapt toward the larval and adult foods with different types and amounts of sugar, and fill in a gap in sweet taste of animals.

AB  - Auxin affects all aspects of plant growth and development, including morphogenesis and adaptive responses. Auxin transmembrane transport is promoted by PIN formation (PIN) and a structurally similar PIN-like (PILS) gene family, which jointly controls the directional transport of the auxin between plant cells, and the accumu-lation of intracellular auxin. At present, there is no study investigating the roles of CslPIN and CslPILS gene family in root development in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). In this study, 8 CslPIN and 10 CslPILS genes were identified in the tea plant, and their evolutionary relationships, physical and chemical properties, conserved motifs, cis-acting elements, chromosome location, collinearity, and expression characteristics were analyzed. The mechanism of CslPIN and CslPILS in the formation of tea adventitious roots (ARs) was studied by the AR in-duction system. Through functional verification, the regulation of CslPIN3 gene on root growth and development of tea plant was studied by over-expression of CslPIN3 in Arabidopsis thaliana and in situ hybridization in Camellia sinensis. The results confirmed CslPIN3 was involved in the regulation of root growth and development as well as auxin accumulation. This study provides a better insight into the regulatory mechanism of CslPIN and CslPILS gene family on the formation of AR in tea plant.

AB  - The devouring of crops by wild herbivores is a major issue in human-wildlife conflict. Although many studies identify the conflict, attempt to estimate the extent of economic loss and its consequences, and suggest some mitigation measures, many fundamental issues remain unaddressed. A number of speculations about the root causes behind the problem have been made, but they have not been treated and tested as alternative hypotheses. In this article, (a) we make a list of alternative hypotheses collected from a wide variety of sources; (b) we evaluate their plausibility, logical integrity and compatibility with existing data; (c) we suggest differential testable predictions; and (d) we discuss their differential implications for mitigation measures. It is important to identify the specific causes of the conflict because the efficacy of mitigation measures crucially depends on the predominant underlying cause. Measures applied without a good understanding of the causal factors might turn out to be ineffective and even counterproductive. Substantial research needs to be focused on differentially testing the predictions of the alternative hypotheses to be able to handle the problem and promote healthy coexistence of wildlife with indigenous people. Although our perceptions of the problem and illustrative examples are in the Indian wildlife context, some of the emerging outcomes will have global importance.

AB  - The frequently repeated administration of alprazolam (Alp), a highly effective benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, in anxiety, insomnia, and other diseases is closely related to many negative adverse reactions that are mainly manifested as memory impairment. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these events are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a proteomic analysis on the hippocampus in mice that received repeated administration of Alp for 24 days. A total of 439 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in mice with repeated administration of Alp compared to the control group, and the GO and KEGG analysis revealed the enrichment of terms related to mitochondrial function, cycle, mitophagy and cognition. In vitro experiments have shown that Alp may affect the cell cycle, reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) to induce apoptosis in HT22 cells, and affect the progress of mitochondrial energy metabolism and morphology in the hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, in vivo behavioral experiments including IntelliCage System (ICS) and nover object recognition (NOR), hippocampal neuronal pathological changes with HE staining, and the expression levels of brain-deprived neuron factor (BDNF) with immunohistochemistry showed a significant decrease in memory consolidation in mice with repeated administration of Alp, which could be rescued by the co-administration of the mitochondrial protector NSI-189. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a link between repeated administration of Alp and mitochondrial dysfunction and that mitochondrial impairment directly causes the attenuation of memory consolidation in mice.

AB  - Most phytophagous insect species exhibit a limited diet breadth and specialize on a few or a single host plant. In contrast, some species display a remarkably large diet breadth, with host plants spanning several families and many species. It is unclear, however, whether this phylogenetic generalism is supported by a generic metabolic use of common host chemical compounds ('metabolic generalism') or alternatively by distinct uses of diet-specific compounds ('multi-host metabolic specialism')? Here, we simultaneously investigated the metabolomes of fruit diets and of individuals of a generalist phytophagous species, Drosophila suzukii, that developed on them. The direct comparison of metabolomes of diets and consumers enabled us to disentangle the metabolic fate of common and rarer dietary compounds. We showed that the consumption of biochemically dissimilar diets resulted in a canalized, generic response from generalist individuals, consistent with the metabolic generalism hypothesis. We also showed that many diet-specific metabolites, such as those related to the particular color, odor, or taste of diets, were not metabolized, and rather accumulated in consumer individuals, even when probably detrimental to fitness. As a result, while individuals were mostly similar across diets, the detection of their particular diet was straightforward. Our study thus supports the view that dietary generalism may emerge from a passive, opportunistic use of various resources, contrary to more widespread views of an active role of adaptation in this process. Such a passive stance towards dietary chemicals, probably costly in the short term, might favor the later evolution of new diet specializations.

AB  - In this study, we added value to lignocellulosic biomass-derived lignin by converting it into antimicrobial nanoparticles using a simple self-assembling method in solution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and zeta potential analyses showed that the self-assembled lignin nanoparticles (SA-LNPs) had a spherical-like morphology, 80 nm average size, and a surface charge of -29 +/- 4 mV. Previous studies have shown that LNPs are toxic to bacteria, though the potential mechanisms of action leading to antimicrobial properties of LNPs are lacking in the literature. Therefore, we conducted a thorough investigation of the antibacterial activity of SA-LNPs using four bacteria strains: Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative) and Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus fermentum (Gram-positive). The antimicrobial assays performed in saline media revealed that SA-LNPs were selectively toxic to Gram-positive bacteria, and no significant antimicrobial effects were found against the Gram-negative strains. Time-kill experiments showed that 25 mu g mL-1 SA-LNPs were able to inactivate more than 90% of the Gram-positive bacteria after 30 min exposure. We conducted in vitro and in vivo assays to evaluate the production of reactive oxidative species (ROS), such as glutathione and 2 ',7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFA). These assays indicated that oxidative stress was not the underlying mechanism involved in the antimicrobial activity of SA-LNPs. This finding corroborates that SA-LNPs could scavenge radicals of 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazin-1-yl (DPPH), confirming their strong antioxidant property. Although direct oxidative stress was ruled out as the probable mechanism of action, we still cannot dismiss an indirect pro-oxidant effect resulting from the SA-LNPs-containing adsorbed ROS coming into direct contact with the cell wall.
   Plant-derived lignin nanoparticles produced through a self-assembly method show selective toxicity against Gram-positive bacteria.

AB  - Despite the observation of diabetes-induced brain tissue damage and impaired learning and memory, the underlying mechanism of damage remains elusive, and effective, targeted therapeutics are lacking. Notably, the NLRP3 inflammasome is highly expressed in the hippocampus of diabetic individuals. Nerolidol, a naturally occurring compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has been identified as a potential therapeutic option for metabolic disorders. However, the ameliorative capacity of nerolidol on diabetic hippocampal injury and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. Network pharmacology and molecular docking was used to predict the signaling pathways and therapeutic targets of nerolidol for the treatment of diabetes. Then established a diabetic rat model using streptozotocin (STZ) combined with a high-fat diet and nerolidol was administered. Morris water maze to assess spatial learning memory capacity. Hematoxylin and eosin and Nissl staining was used to detect neuronal damage in the diabetic hippocampus. Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect the extent of damage to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and synapses. Immunofluorescence was used to detect GFAP, IBA1, and NLRP3 expression in the hippocampus. Western blot was used to detect apoptosis (Bcl-2, BAX, and Cleaved-Caspase-3); synapses (postsynaptic densifying protein 95, SYN1, and Synaptophysin); mitochondria (DRP1, OPA1, MFN1, and MFN2); ER (GRP78, ATF6, CHOP, and caspase-12); NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1); inflammatory cytokines (IL-18, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha); AKT (P-AKT); and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (P-ERK, P-p38, and P-JNK) related protein expression. Network pharmacology showed that nerolidol's possible mechanisms for treating diabetes are the MAPK/AKT pathway and anti-inflammatory effects. Animal experiments demonstrated that nerolidol could improve blood glucose, blood lipids, and hippocampal neuronal damage in diabetic rats. Furthermore, nerolidol could improve synaptic, mitochondrial, and ER damage in the hippocampal ultrastructure of diabetic rats by potentially affecting synaptic, mitochondrial, and ER-related proteins. Further studies revealed that nerolidol decreased neuroinflammation, NLRP3 and inflammatory factor expression in hippocampal tissue while also decreasing MAPK pathway expression and enhancing AKT pathway expression. However, nerolidol improves hippocampal damage in diabetic rats cannot be shown to improve cognitive function. In conclusion, our study reveals for the first time that nerolidol can ameliorate hippocampal damage, neuroinflammation, synaptic, ER, and mitochondrial damage in diabetic rats. Furthermore, we suggest that nerolidol may inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome and affected the expression of MAPK and AKT. These findings provide a new experimental basis for the use of nerolidol to ameliorate diabetes-induced brain tissue damage and the associated disease.

AB  - In Valdichiana, an agricultural area of Tuscany (C Italy), an antique landrace of elephant garlic (A. ampeloprasum L.) locally known as "Aglione della Valdichiana " has been cultivated for a long time, and has been recently recognized as a traditional agri-food product of Tuscany and of Italy. Two methods of cultivation of elephant garlic are currently in use in Valdichiana: conventional and organic, the latter not making use of mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides, even if the cultivation of elephant garlic is a low impact one. This paper aimed at testing if there are differences in the mineral and nutraceutical profiles of elephant garlic cultivated conventionally and organically in the Valdichiana area. Our results indicated only small differences and no evidence of healthier food or superior nutraceutical quality for organically grown elephant garlic.
   In the Valdichiana area (Tuscany, Italy) an ancient native landrace of elephant garlic (Allium ampeloprasum L.), locally known as "Aglione della Valdichiana ", has long been cultivated. The aim of this study was to check whether there are differences in the mineral and nutraceutical profiles of the Aglione della Valdichiana cultivated conventionally and organically. Based on the analysis by ICP-MS of a wide array of major, minor, essential, and non-essential trace elements as well as rare earth elements, and the evaluation of the content of polyphenols, flavonoids, antioxidants, soluble proteins, soluble sugars, and starch, as well as the weight and water content, it was concluded that differences in the mineral and nutraceutical profiles of organically and conventionally grown bulbs were very limited. Only a statistically (p < 0.05) higher concentration of Cd (+2620%), Co (+113%), Mn (+55%), Rb (+180%), and Sb (+180%), as well as glucose (+37%) in conventionally cultivated bulbs emerged. Cadmium was the only element slightly higher than in the "reference plant, " but with a negligible risk (three orders of magnitude lower) for human health based on consumption. It is concluded that we failed to find evidence of healthier food or a higher nutraceutical quality for organically cultivated elephant garlic.

AB  - Sensory ecology and physiology of free-ranging animals is challenging to study but underpins our understanding of decision-making in the wild. Existing non-invasive human biomedical technology offers tools that could be harnessed to address these challenges. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a wearable, non-invasive biomedical imaging technique measures oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration changes that can be used to detect localized neural activation in the brain. We tested the efficacy of fNIRS to detect cortical activation in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and identify regions of the cortex associated with different senses (vision, hearing and touch). The activation of specific cerebral areas in seals was detected by fNIRS in responses to light (vision), sound (hearing) and whisker stimulation (touch). Physiological parameters, including heart and breathing rate, were also extracted from the fNIRS signal, which allowed neural and physiological responses to be monitored simultaneously. This is, to our knowledge, the first time fNIRS has been used to detect cortical activation in a non-domesticated or laboratory animal. Because fNIRS is non-invasive and wearable, this study demonstrates its potential as a tool to quantitatively investigate sensory perception and brain function while simultaneously recording heart rate, tissue and arterial oxygen saturation of haemoglobin, perfusion changes and breathing rate in free-ranging animals.

AB  - Tomato aphid (Myzus persicae) is a destructive insect pest of tomato responsible for huge losses in the production as well in the vegetable industry. In the present in vitro study two protein elicitors, PeaT1 and PeBL1 were considered to study their efficacies to exhibit defense response against tomato aphid. Three different concentrations of both protein elicitors were applied on the tomato seedlings. After the application of PeaT1 and PeBL1, population growth rates of tomato aphid were decreased as compared to the control treatment. In host preference assay, the tomato aphid showed a preference to build a colony on the control as compared to the treated tomato plant, because tomato leaves provided hazardous surface for aphid after the formation of wax and trichome. The concentrations of protein showed significant (p < 0.05) results in life-history traits of the aphid. Jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) showed significant accumulation in tomato seedlings treated with PeaT1 and PeBL1. Elicitors treated plants produced resistance against M. persicae. Our finding suggests that PeaT1 and PeBL1 have shown high potentials against the damage of M. persicae, and both elicitors could be used as novel biological tools against tomato aphid.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications are the main threats to the global disease burden. DM-related cognitive dysfunction is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, similar to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The un-derlying pathophysiology remains unclear, and an effective treatment is unavailable. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is a bioactive ingredient extracted from the plant Ligusticum wallichii, which has anti-diabetic and neuroprotective properties. In this study, streptozotocin (STZ) injection was used to establish a mouse STZ-AD model, and TMP was administered through the lateral ventricle (ICV) to evaluate the effects of TMP on cognitive ability and neurochemical changes and to explore the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Using MWM and Y -maze behavioral paradigms, we observed that TMP protected against STZ-induced learning and memory impairment. STZ promoted the deposition of amyloid plaques, activation of glial cells, loss of neurons and synapses, and reduction of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, TMP restored these aberrations and improved cognitive deficits in STZ-induced diabetic animals. Moreover, TMP attenuated hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress through modulation of the SIRT1/Nrf2/ HO-1 pathway. This evidence shows that TMP exerts its therapeutic effects through multiple pathways. Our study provides new insights into the neuroprotective effects of TMP for the treatment of diabetes-related cognitive failure.

AB  - Simple Summary The bean bug, Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) is a notorious pest of soybean crops in Asia. During the feeding process, the bug secretes a mixture of salivary components, which play critical roles in the insect-plant interactions. In the present study, a total of 136 salivary proteins were identified by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Among them, five proteins (RpSP10.3, RpSP13.4, RpSP13.8, RpSP17.8, and RpSP10.2) were capable of inducing cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, and hormone signal changes, indicating the potential roles of these proteins in eliciting plant defenses. Our results provide a good resource for future functional studies of bug salivary effectors and might be useful in pest management. The bean bug, Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius), is one of the most important soybean pests. It damages soybean leaves and pods with its piercing-sucking mouthparts, causing staygreen-like syndromes in the infested crops. During the feeding process, R. pedestris secretes a mixture of salivary proteins, which play critical roles in the insect-plant interactions and may be responsible for staygreen-like syndromes. The present study aimed to identify the major salivary proteins in R. pedestris saliva by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, and to screen the proteins that potentially induced plant defense responses. Altogether, 136 salivary proteins were identified, and a majority of them were involved in hydrolase and binding. Additionally, R. pedestris saliva contained abundant bug-specific proteins with unknown function. Transient expression of salivary proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves identified that RpSP10.3, RpSP13.4, RpSP13.8, RpSP17.8, and RpSP10.2 were capable of inducing cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, and hormone signal changes, indicating the potential roles of these proteins in eliciting plant defenses. Our results will shed more light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant-insect interactions and are useful for pest management.

AB  - The contribution of mitochondria to the metabolic function of hypoxic NP cells has been overlooked. We have shown that NP cells contain networked mitochondria and that mitochondrial translocation of BNIP3 mediates hypoxia-induced mitophagy. However, whether BNIP3 also plays a role in governing mitochondrial function and metabolism in hypoxic NP cells is not known. BNIP3 knockdown altered mitochondrial morphology, and number, and increased mitophagy. Interestingly, BNIP3 deficiency in NP cells reduced glycolytic capacity reflected by lower production of lactate/H+ and lower ATP production rate. Widely targeted metabolic profiling and flux analysis using 1-2-C-13-glucose showed that the BNIP3 loss resulted in redirection of glycolytic flux into pentose phosphate and hexosamine biosynthesis as well as pyruvate resulting in increased TCA flux. An overall reduction in one-carbon metabolism was noted suggesting reduced biosynthesis. (UC)-C-13-glutamine flux analysis showed preservation of glutamine utilization to maintain TCA intermediates. The transcriptomic analysis of the BNIP3-deficient cells showed dysregulation of cellular functions including membrane and cytoskeletal integrity, ECM-growth factor signaling, and protein quality control with an overall increase in themes related to angiogenesis and innate immune response. Importantly, we observed strong thematic similarities with the transcriptome of a subset of human degenerative samples. Last, we noted increased autophagic flux, decreased disc height index and aberrant COL10A1/collagen X expression, signs of early disc degeneration in young adult bnip3 knockout mice. These results suggested that in addition to mitophagy regulation, BNIP3 plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial function and metabolism, and dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis could promote disc degeneration.

AB  - Simple Summary: The digestive enzymes present in the insect gut play a crucial role in digesting food and extracting essential nutrients. The diverse range of digestive enzymes found in the insect gut serves as a valuable source of functional proteins. With a significant population of herbivorous insects, there has been extensive research on cellulase in the insect gut. This study utilized both culture-independent and culture-dependent methods to investigate the protease resources responsible for digesting animal and plant proteins, laying a solid foundation for future research and utilization of proteases derived from insect sources. An insect's gut microbiome is an essential "organ" in their life cycle, playing a crucial role by aiding food digestion and nutrient absorption. This study employed both culture-independent and culture-dependent methods to explore the protease resources present in the gut of the omnivorous insect Gryllotalpa orientalis. The findings revealed that the gut extract of G. orientalis contained a diverse array of proteases, including cysteine proteases, pepsin, serine proteases, and trypsin, as well as some unidentified proteases. Furthermore, the protease gene htpX, derived from gut bacterium Priestia megaterium DX-3, has been cloned and recombinantly expressed. The recombinant DX-3-htpX protease exhibited a 61.9-fold increase in fermentation level compared to the DX-3 protease. This protease was characterized as a neutral, heat-resistant metalloprotease with an M48 peptidase domain, and it was observed that the binding of Ca2+ to the recombinant protease resulted in the formation of the largest active pocket. This study provides technical support for further development and utilization of functional protein resources in insect gut.

AB  - To navigate effectively, we must represent information about our location in the environment. Traditional research highlights the role of the hippocampal complex in this process. Spurred by recent research highlighting the widespread cortical encoding of cognitive and motor variables previously thought to have localized function, we hypothesized that navigational variables would be likewise encoded widely, especially in the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with volitional behavior. We recorded neural activity from six prefrontal regions while macaques performed a foraging task in an open enclosure. In all regions, we found strong encoding of allocentric position, allocentric head direction, boundary distance, and linear and angular velocity. These encodings were not accounted for by distance, time to reward, or motor factors. The strength of coding of all variables increased along a ventral-to-dorsal gradient. Together, these results argue that encoding of navigational variables is not localized to the hippocampus and support the hypothesis that navigation is continuous with other forms of flexible cognition in the service of action.

AB  - Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a devastating condition with no effective treatment. The management of RAO could potentially be improved through an in-depth understanding of the molecular alterations in the condition. This study combined advanced proteomic techniques and an experimental model to uncover the retinal large-scale protein profile of RAO. In 13 pigs, RAO was induced with an argon laser and confirmed by fluorescein angiography. Left eyes serving as controls received a sham laser without inducing occlusion. Retinal samples were collected after one, three, or six days and analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In RAO, 36 proteins were differentially regulated on day one, 86 on day three, and 557 on day six. Upregulated proteins included clusterin, vitronectin, and vimentin, with several proteins increasing over time with a maximum on day six, including clusterin, vimentin, osteopontin, annexin-A, signal transducer, and the activator of transcription 3. On day six, RAO resulted in the upregulation of proteins involved in cellular response to stress, hemostasis, innate immune response, and cytokine signaling. Downregulated proteins were involved in transmission across chemical synapses and visual phototransduction. This study identified the upregulation of multiple inflammatory proteins in RAO and the downregulation of proteins involved in visual pathways.

AB  - HIV-1 vaccines have been challenging to develop, partly due to the high level of genetic variation in its genome. Thus, a vaccine that can induce cross-reactive neutralization activities will be needed. Studies on the co-evolution of antibodies and viruses indicate that mimicking the natural infection is likely to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). We generated the consensus Env sequence for each time point in subject CH505, who developed broad neutralization activities, and selected five critical time points before broad neutralization was detected. These consensus sequences were designed to express stable Env trimers. Priming with the transmitted/founder Env timer and sequential boosting with these consensus Env trimers from different time points induced broader and more potent neutralizing activities than the BG505 Env trimer in guinea pigs. Analysis of the neutralization profiles showed that sequential immunization of Env trimers favored nAbs with gp120/gp41 interface specificity while the BG505 Env trimer favored nAbs with V2 specificity. The unique features such as consensus sequences, stable Env trimers and the sequential immunization to mimic natural infection likely has allowed the induction of improved neutralization responses.

AB  - The question of the size ratio of the body and the digestive tract (DT) in small phytophagous mammals is considered for the example of gerbils (Gerbillidae), a group of rodents that is exceptionally convenient for studying such relationships due to significant differences in the body weight and the morphological homogeneity of the DT. We analyzed the weight ratios of the body size and the DT and the wet weight of the contents and tissues of the DT in six species of gerbils with a tenfold body weight range (on average, 18 to 175 g) coexisting in the Negev Desert: Psammomys obesus, Meriones crassus, Gerbillus pyramidum, Gerbillus allenbyi, Gerbillus dasyurus, and Gerbillus henleyi. In a number of the studied species of small mammals weighing less than 0.5 kg, no linear relationship was found between the body size and the DT. The allometry of the indicators considered is mainly due to environmental and physiological factors.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and intensity of external parasites in domestic pigeons in Giza, Egypt, from January 2020 to December 2020. A total of 300 domestic pigeons (25 pigeons per month) were examined. The birds were divided into groups based on their age. The oxidative stress parameters; serum zinc concentration, serum malondialdehyde (MDA), and serum Nitric oxide were evaluated in single and mixed external parasitic infestations. The prevalence of external parasites in examined pigeons was 80.3%. The detected parasites were Pseudolynchia canariensis (P. canariensis), Hippobosca equina (H. equina), Columbicola columbae (C. columbae), Menopon gallinae (M. gallinae), Knemidocoptes species (spp.) and Dermanyssus gallinae (D. gallinae); their incidences were 41.6, 26, 7, 5,0.33 and 0.33%, respectively. The highest infestation was recorded in both spring and summer. The incidence of disease was higher in squabs and young birds than in adults. The mixed external parasitic infestation was recorded in this study. The infected birds showed decreased serum zinc concentration and elevated MDA and serum Nitric oxide levels. In conclusion, regular monthly treatment with deltamethrin is recommended as an effective drug in the treatment of the infested birds and succeeded in reducing the incidence of externalparasites in the treated birds; in addition, pigeon management measures must be implemented to reduce the risk of external parasites.

AB  - White, green, and oolong teas are produced from the tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) and are reported to have anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects. The current study aims to investigate the anti-obesity effects of a tea mixture nano-formulation by targeting the AMPK/Sirt-1/GLUT-4 axis in rats. In vitro lipase and & alpha;-amylase inhibition assays were used to determine the active sample, which was then incorporated into a nanoparticle formulation subjected to in vivo anti-obesity testing in rats by measuring the expression level of different genes implicated in adipogenesis and inflammation using qRT-PCR. Moreover, metabolomic analysis was performed for each tea extract using LC/ESI MS/MS coupled to chemometrics in an attempt to find a correlation between the constituents of the extracts and their biological activity. The in vitro pancreatic lipase and & alpha;-amylase inhibition assays demonstrated more effective activity in the tea mixture than the standards, orlistat and acarbose, respectively, and each tea alone. Thus, the herbal tea mixture and its nanoparticle formulation were evaluated for their in vivo anti-obesity activity. Intriguingly, the tea mixture significantly decreased the serum levels of glucose and triglycerides and increased the mRNA expression of GLUT-4, P-AMPK, Sirt-1, and PPAR-& gamma;, which induce lipolysis while also decreasing the mRNA expression of TNF-& alpha; and ADD1/SREBP-1c, thereby inhibiting the inflammation associated with obesity. Our study suggests that the tea mixture nano-formulation is a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of obesity and may also be beneficial in other metabolic disorders by targeting the AMPK/Sirt-1/Glut-4 pathway.

AB  - Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a serious public-health problem. Furthermore, subsequent TBI events can compromise TBI patients' quality of life. TBI is linked to a number of long- and short-term complications such as cerebral atrophy and risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Following direct TBI damage, oxidative stress and the inflammatory response lead to tissue injury-associated neurodegenerative processes that are characteristic of TBI-induced secondary damage. Hidrox (R) showed positive effects in preclinical models of toxic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation; thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Hidrox (R) administration on TBI-induced secondary injury and on the propagation of the AD-like neuropathology. Hidrox (R) treatment reduced histological damage after controlled cortical impact. Form a molecular point of view, hydroxytyrosol is able to preserve the cellular redox balance and protein homeostasis by activating the Nrf2 pathway and increasing the expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes such as HO-1, SOD, Catalase, and GSH, thus counteracting the neurodegenerative damage. Additionally, Hidrox (R) showed anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the activation of the NFkB pathway and related cytokines overexpression. From a behavioral point of view, Hidrox (R) treatment ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction and memory impairment induced by TBI. Additionally, Hidrox (R) was associated with a significant increased number of hippocampal neurons in the CA3 region, which were reduced post-TBI. In particular, Hidrox (R) decreased AD-like phenotypic markers such as beta-amyloid accumulation and APP and p-Tau overexpression. These findings indicate that Hidrox (R) could be a valuable treatment for TBI-induced secondary injury and AD-like pathological features.

AB  - Treatment with melatonin is routinely prescribed for its potent antioxidant and cognitive-promoting effects, nevertheless, it has yet to find neuromodulatory effects in normal and disease conditions. Therefore, to investigate its neuromodulatory mechanisms, melatonin was systemically administered over 10 consecutive days to both intracortical normal saline- and amyloid-beta 1-42 (A beta) peptide-injected rats. At the behavioral level, treatment with melatonin was associated with reduced efficacy in restoring A beta-induced deficit in passive-avoidance memory. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed that melatonin treatment reduced spontaneous and evoked intrinsic excitability in control rats while exerting a reduction of spontaneous, but not evoked activity, in the A beta-injected group. Interestingly, treatment with melatonin enhances after-hyperpolarization in control, but not A beta-injected rats. In contrast, our voltage-clamp study showed that Ih current is significantly enhanced by A beta injection, and this effect is further strengthened by treatment with melatonin in A beta-injected rats. Finally, we discovered that the transcription of melatonin receptors 1 (MT1) and 2 (MT2) is significantly upregulated in the hippocampi of A beta-injected rats. Collectively, our study demonstrates that systemic treatment with melatonin has differential neuromodulation on CA1 neuronal excitability, at least in part, via differential effects on after-hyperpolarization and Ih currents due to A beta-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a respiratory disease in pigs that causes severe economic losses. Currently, live PRRSV vaccines are commonly used but fail to prevent PRRS outbreaks and reinfection. Inactivated PRRSV vaccines have poor immunogenicity, making PRRSV a significant threat to swine health globally. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective PRRSV vaccine. This study used immunoinformatics to predict, screen, design and construct a candidate vaccine that fused B-cell epitopes, CTL- and HTL-dominant protective epitopes of PRRSV strain's GP3 and GP5 proteins. The study identified 12 B-cell epitopes, 6 CTL epitopes and 5 HTL epitopes of GP3 and GP5 proteins. The candidate vaccine was constructed with 50S ribosomal protein L7/L1 molecular adjuvant, which has antigenicity, solubility, stability, non-allergenicity and a high affinity for its target receptor, TLR-3. The C-ImmSim immunostimulation results showed significant increases in cellular and humoral responses (B cells and T cells) and production of TGF-beta, IL-2, IL-10, IFN-gamma and IL-12. The constructed vaccine was stable and immunogenic, and it can effectively induce strong T-cell and B-cell immune responses against PRRSV. Therefore, it is a promising candidate vaccine for controlling and preventing PRRSV outbreaks.

AB  - Delivery of exogenous heat shock protein 90 alpha (Hsp90 alpha) and/or its induced expression in neural tissues has been suggested as a potential strategy to combat neurodegenerative disease. However, within a neurodegenerative context, a pro-inflammatory response to extracellular Hsp90 alpha (eHsp90 alpha) could undermine strategies to use it for therapeutic intervention. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological effects of eHsp90 alpha on microglial cells, the primary mediators of inflammatory responses in the brain. Transcriptomic profiling by RNA-seq of primary microglia and the cultured EOC2 microglial cell line treated with eHsp90 alpha showed the chaperone to stimulate activation of innate immune responses in microglia that were characterized by an increase in NF-kB-regulated genes. Further characterization showed this response to be substantially lower in amplitude than the effects of other inflammatory stimuli such as fibrillar amyloid-beta (fA beta) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Additionally, the toxicity of conditioned media obtained from microglia treated with fA beta was attenuated by addition of eHsp90 alpha. Using a co-culture system of microglia and hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 cells separated by a chamber insert, the neurotoxicity of medium conditioned by microglia treated with fA beta was reduced when eHsp90 alpha was also added. Mechanistically, eHsp90 alpha was shown to activate Nrf2, a response which attenuated fA beta-induced nitric oxide production. The data thus suggested that eHsp90 alpha protects against fA beta-induced oxidative stress. We also report eHsp90 alpha to induce expression of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (Marco), which would permit receptor-mediated endocytosis of fA beta.

AB  - Purpurin, an anthraquinone, has potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in various types of brain damage. In a previous study, we showed that purpurin exerts neuroprotective effects against oxidative and ischemic damage by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the present study, we investigated the effects of purpurin against D-galactose-induced aging phenotypes in mice. Exposure to 100 mM D-galactose significantly decreased cell viability in HT22 cells, and purpurin treatment significantly ameliorated the reduction of cell viability, formation of reactive oxygen species, and lipid peroxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with 6 mg/kg purpurin significantly improved D-galactose-induced memory impairment in the Morris water maze test in C57BL/6 mice and alleviated the reduction of proliferating cells and neuroblasts in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. In addition, purpurin treatment significantly mitigated D-galactoseinduced changes of microglial morphology in the mouse hippocampus and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 & beta;, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-& alpha;. In addition, purpurin treatment significantly ameliorated D-galactose-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and cleavage of caspase-3 in HT22 cells. These results suggest that purpurin can delay aging by reducing the inflammatory cascade and phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal in the hippocampus.

AB  - Simple Summary Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a multifunctional phospholipid, which is abundant in intestinal cells and mucus. It provides mechanical protection to intestinal epithelial cells and underlying tissues, and is essential for the growth and development of newborn individuals. In this study, PE was supplemented to healthy piglets and postnatal growth retardation (PGR) piglets during lactation and after weaning to explore whether PE can alleviate the growth retardation of PGR piglets and its internal mechanism. The results showed that PE could increase the number of goblet cells and MUC2 secretion by regulating the differentiation of goblet cells, ER stress and apoptosis of small intestine, which ultimately improved the intestinal morphology and mucus synthesis and secretion function of PGR piglets and increased their growth performance.Abstract Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a multifunctional phospholipid, is necessary for neonate development. This study aimed to explore the impact of the regulation of exogenous PE on postnatal growth retardation (PGR) by improving intestinal barrier function. Thirty-two neonatal pigs were divided into four groups according to their body weight (BW 2.79 +/- 0.50 kg or 1.88 +/- 0.40 kg) at 7 days old, CON-NBW, PE-NBW, CON-PGR, and PE-PGR. PE was supplemented to NBW piglets and PGR piglets during lactation and post-weaning periods. Compared with the NBW piglets, the growth performance of PGR piglets was lower, while PE improved the poor growth performance. PGR piglets showed injured intestinal morphology, as evidenced by the reduced ratio of villus height to crypt depth (VH/CD) and goblet cell numbers in the jejunum and ileum. PE recovered the intestinal barrier injury by increasing VH/CD and goblet cell numbers. The decreased MUC2 mRNA and protein expressions were observed in the small intestine of PGR piglets, and PE remarkably increased the expression of MUC2. Mechanistically, PE increased the goblet cell differentiation promoting gene spdef mRNA levels and reduced the mRNA expressions involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress in the jejunal and ileal mucosa of PGR piglets. Overall, we found that PE alleviated growth retardation by regulating intestinal health and generalized its application in neonates.

AB  - Periosteum is expected for bone repairing due to excellent regenerative potential. PDCs are the main source of cells for promoting bone repair. However, PDCs from different sites have been confirmed to be site specific due to their distinct embryonic origin and the methods of bone formation. Hippo-YAP pathway is proved to play a critical role in fate decision of mesenchymal stem cells. The effect of Hippo-YAP on PDCs has not been reported so far. Hence, we aim to explore the differences of PDCs from mandible and femur along with their possible responses to YAP signaling. mPDCs and fPDCs were obtained and tested through flow cytometry for identification. Follow-up results illustrated mPDCs was cubic shape and with better proliferation while fPDCs preferred slender cell shape with worse cell viability compared with mPDCs. mPDCs was superior to fPDCs in ALP activity, related mRNA expression and calcium deposits in late stage. Interestingly, downregulation of YAP promoted the ALP activity, related mRNA expression and calcium deposits of fPDCs while hindered that of mPDCs in vitro. Moreover, implant animal model in mandible and femur were constructed for evaluation in vivo. Histological results were similar to the results in vitro. We speculate this may result from their different embryonic origin and the way of bone formation. Taken together, results available suggested that mPDCs may serve as more optimal seed cells for tissue engineering compared with fPDCs; however, considering their different response to YAP signaling, to ensure sufficient YAP expression in mPDCs and appropriate declining YAP expression in fPDCs may establish better osteogenesis.

AB  - Simple Summary Cyclical droughts negatively impact agriculture, with deficits of water availability for the maintenance of crops destined for human food and animal production. Seasonality of forage quantity and quality is a critical obstacle to support domesticated herds over the year. Elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) is a tropical forage widely used for feeding ruminants, mainly in the form of cut-and-carry, which has the potential to increase tropical pasture productivity, due to the large amount of roughage produced per unit of area. Research evaluated the response of tall and dwarf elephantgrass genotypes under irrigation considering its potential for complementing ruminant diets. This study showed that irrigation of elephantgrass, particularly during the dry season, may improve the regularity of forage production with good nutritive value. This two-year study evaluated the effect of Pennisetum purpureum genotypes under rainfed or irrigated conditions, during the dry and rainy seasons, on herbage, leaf, and stem dry matter (DM) accumulation rates, nutritive value, and carbohydrate and protein fractionation. Treatments were tall (Iri 381 and Elefante B) or dwarf (Mott and Taiwan A-146 2.37) genotypes under rainfed or irrigated conditions. Taiwan A-146 2.37 (146 kg DM ha per day) showed similar herbage accumulation rate (HAR) to tall genotypes during the rainy season (124 and 150 kg DM/ha per day, respectively). Dwarf genotypes showed differences in leaf accumulation rate (LAR) (66 and 49 kg DM/ha per day). Mott leaf had less neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (589 g/kg DM) than Taiwan A-146 2.37 (598 g/kg DM), and tall genotypes had generally greater NDF (668 g/kg DM) than the dwarf genotypes. Irrigation increased fiber deposition in the leaf. Stems of all genotypes had lower in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM) (378 g/kg DM) under rainfed conditions in the rainy season. Leaf from irrigated plots had 23% more carbohydrate C fraction (160 g/kg CHO) than those from rainfed plots (122 g/kg CHO). Dwarf genotypes had generally greater nutritive value than tall genotypes. These genotypes show promise under irrigation to fill forage gaps during dry periods.

AB  - Human rhinovirus (HRV) causes the common cold and exacerbates chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite its significant impact on public health, there are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments for HRV infection. Apoptosis is the process through which cells eliminate themselves through the systematic activation of intrinsic death pathways in response to various stimuli. It plays an important role in viral infections and serves as a key immune defense mechanism in the interactions between viruses and the host. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effects of quercetin-3-methyl ether, a flavonoid isolated from Serratula coronata, on human rhinovirus 1B (HRV1B). Quercetin-3-methyl ether significantly inhibited HRV1B replication in HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner, thereby reducing cytopathic effects and viral RNA levels. Time-course and time-of-addition analyses confirmed that quercetin-3-methyl ether exhibited antiviral activity during the early stages of viral infection, potentially targeting the replication and translation phases. Gene expression analysis using microarrays revealed that pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated in quercetin-3-methyl ether-treated cells, suggesting that quercetin-3-methyl ether enhances early apoptosis to counteract HRV1B-induced immune evasion. In vivo administration of quercetin-3-methyl ether to HRV1B-infected mice significantly reduced viral RNA levels and inflammatory cytokine production in the lung tissues. Our findings demonstrated the potential of quercetin-3-methyl ether as a novel antiviral agent against HRV1B, thereby providing a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of HRV1B infections and related complications.

AB  - Objective: Ethanol (Eth) intake is known to cause numerous detrimental effects on the structure and function of the brain, and it is commonly used as a psychostimulant drug by adolescents. Conversely, omega-3 (O-3) can reduce the risk of cognitive decline and promote the maintenance of neurophysiological functions. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of O-3 on behavioral alterations, oxidative stress, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels induced by chronic Eth intake during adolescence in rats. Materials and methods: Adolescent male rats (21 days old) were divided as follows: (1) Vehicle, (2) Eth (Eth in drinking water [20%]), (3-5) Eth + O-3 (50/100/150 mg/kg), and (6) O-3 (150 mg/kg). After 5 weeks, Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tests were performed, and the hippocampal and cortical levels of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory indices were measured. Results: Adolescent Eth intake impairs learning and memory function in MWM and PA tests (groups x day, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). It was shown that Eth induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. O-3 improved learning and impairment induced by Eth by reducing the adverse effects of Eth on the oxidant/antioxidant balance in the hippocampi (for malondialdehyde [MDA]/thiol: p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively) and for superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase (CAT): p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, we found that O-3 prevented the Eth-induced increase of hippocampal IL-6 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: O-3 supplementation acts as an effective approach to prevent learning and memory impairments induced by chronic Eth consumption during adolescence. In this respect, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of O-3 seem to be the main underlying mechanisms of neuroprotection.

AB  - Oxygen deprivation in newborns leads to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, whose hallmarks are oxidative/nitrosative stress, energetic metabolism alterations, nutrient deficiency, and motor behavior disability. Zinc and taurine are known to protect against hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in adults and neonates. However, the combined effect of prophylactic zinc administration and therapeutic taurine treatment on intrauterine ischemia- (IUI-) induced cerebral damage remains unknown. The present work evaluated this issue in male pups subjected to transient IUI (10 min) at E17 and whose mothers received zinc from E1 to E16 and taurine from E17 to postnatal day 15 (PND15) via drinking water. We assessed motor alterations, nitrosative stress, lipid peroxidation, and the antioxidant system comprised of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Enzymes of neuronal energetic pathways, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were also evaluated. The hierarchization score of the protective effect of pharmacological strategies (HSPEPS) was used to select the most effective treatment. Compared with the IUI group, zinc, alone or combined with taurine, improved motor behavior and reduced nitrosative stress by increasing SOD, CAT, and GPx activities and decreasing the GSSG/GSH ratio in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Taurine alone increased the AST/ALT, LDH/ALT, and AST/LDH ratios in the cerebral cortex, showing improvement of the neural bioenergetics system. This result suggests that taurine improves pyruvate, lactate, and glutamate metabolism, thus decreasing IUI-caused cerebral damage and relieving motor behavior impairment. Our results showed that taurine alone or in combination with zinc provides neuroprotection in the IUI rat model.

AB  - Aging is a well-known factor that accelerates brain deterioration, resulting in impaired learning and memory functions. This current study evaluated the potential of an extract of Alternanthera philoxeroides (AP), an edible flavonoid-rich plant, to ameliorate D-galactose-induced brain aging in male mice. Chronic administration of D-galactose (150 mg/kg/day) in mice mimicked the characteristics of aging by accelerating senescence via downregulation of the following telomere-regulating factors: mouse telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTERT) and mouse telomeric repeat-binding factors 1 (mTRF1) and 2 (mTRF2). D-galactose also decreased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), while increasing expression of neuroinflammatory cytokines in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Daily treatment of D-galactose-induced aging mice with AP at 250 and 500 mg/kg/day or vitamin E (100 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the activities of SOD and CAT, as well as expression of mTERT, mTRF1, and mTRF2, which are involved in telomere stabilization, but decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. In the behavioral portion of the study, AP improved aging-related cognitive deficits in short-term memory as shown by the Y-maze task and the novel object recognition test (NORT) and long-term memory as shown by the Morris water maze test (MWMT). The flavones kaempferol-O-glucoside (1), quercetin (2), alternanthin B (3), demethyltorosaflavone D (4), and chrysoeriol-7-O-rhamnoside (5), which could be responsible for the observed effects of AP in the D-galactose-induced aging mice, were identified by HPLC analysis.

AB  - Simple Summary As global meat production is rapidly increasing, it is important to find sustainable sources of meat. Horsemeat is a viable alternative due to its lower environmental impact and high nutritional value. In this study, bioinformatics was used to determine genetic markers (SNPs) that could improve horsemeat production by focusing on orthologous genes related to meat yield in cattle and in QTLs for body weight and body size. Out of 268 markers, 27 SNPs in key genes such as LCORL, LASP1, IGF1R, and MSTN were prioritized. These findings can help small-scale farmers to breed horses with better meat yield. In addition, this information will be valuable for large-scale genetic studies to further evaluate these markers and improve breeding programs. This work lays the foundation for a better understanding of horse genetics and the advancement of horse breeding.Abstract In view of the predicted significant increase in global meat production, alternative sources such as horsemeat are becoming increasingly important due to their lower environmental impact and high nutritional value. This study aimed to identify SNP markers on the GeneSeek (R) Genomic Profiler (TM) Equine (Neogen, Lansing, MI, USA) that are important for horsemeat production traits. First, orthologous genes related to meat yield in cattle and common genes between horses and cattle within QTLs for body size and weight were identified. Markers for these genes were then evaluated based on predicted variant consequences, GERP scores, and positions within constrained elements and orthologous regulatory regions in pigs. A total of 268 markers in 57 genes related to meat production were analyzed. This resulted in 27 prioritized SNP markers in 22 genes, including notable markers in LCORL, LASP1, IGF1R, and MSTN. These results will benefit smallholder farmers by providing genetic insights for selective breeding that could improve meat yield. This study also supports future large-scale genetic analyses such as GWAS and Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP). The results of this study may be helpful in improving the accuracy of genomic breeding values. However, limitations include reliance on bioinformatics without experimental validation. Future research can validate these markers and consider a wider range of traits to ensure accuracy in equine breeding.

AB  - A six-week feeding trial was conducted to assess the safety of single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) derived from camelids against the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) (WSSVvp28 was used as the antigen), focusing on the whole-organism responses and molecular-level changes in juvenile whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Five experimental diets with varying levels of sdAbs were formulated: CON (no sdAb supplementation); SDA(8.2) (8.20% of sdAbs); SDA(16.4) (16.40% of sdAbs); SDA(24.6) (24.60% of sdAbs); and SDA(32.8) (32.80% of sdAbs). In the CON diet, 450 mL of water per kg of diet (45%) was used to form a feed dough, while sdAbs were used to replace the water in the treatment diets. A total of 450 shrimp, with an initial body weight of 3.27 +/- 0.02 g (mean +/- SEM), were randomly distributed in 15 tanks (30 shrimp per tank; three tanks per treatment). Each tank was filled with 30 L of seawater (77 L capacity) in an indoor semi-recirculating system with a constant water flow rate of 1.2 L min(-1). The photoperiod was maintained at 12 h of light and 12 h of dark. The water temperature, pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen were 27.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C, 7.61 +/- 0.01, 34 +/- 1 ppt, and 5.94 +/- 0.04 mg L-1, respectively. During the feeding trial, the shrimp were fed the experimental diet (40% protein and 11% lipid) three times a day for six weeks. Following the feeding trial, an acute cold-water-temperature stress test was conducted by abruptly exposing the shrimp from each treatment to 15 degrees C for 4 h, down from 27 degrees C. The results showed no significant differences in the growth performance (weight gain, feed utilization efficiency, survival, etc.), plasma metabolites (aspartate aminotransferase activity, alanine aminotransferase activity, total protein, and glucose), or antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) among all the experimental diets (p > 0.05). In the acute cold-temperature stress test, there was no significant interaction between sdAb supplementation and temperature stress, nor any main effect from either factor, except for the main effect of temperature stress on the glucose levels, which was significantly higher in shrimp exposed to cold-temperature stress (p < 0.05). The next-generation sequencing of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hepatopancreases of shrimp fed the CON, SDA(16.4), and SDA(32.8) diets, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, indicated that DEGs were significantly enriched in signaling pathways associated with growth, cold stress, and antioxidant systems. Overall, the results from conventional measurements suggest that the use of sdAbs against the WSSV may be safe for juvenile whiteleg shrimp. However, findings from the sophisticated analysis indicate that further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed changes, and to evaluate the long-term effects of sdAb supplementation in shrimp diets.

AB  - Glutaraldehyde (GA)-fixed bovine pericardial patches remain the cardiovascular industry standard despite reports of degradation, thickening, inflammation, calcification and lack of tissue remodelling. Decellularization provides the opportunity to attenuate some of these immune-mediated processes. This study compared the mechanical and morphological integrity of bovine pericardium that is GA-fixated (Glycar (R) patches) or decellularized (BPS), using a proprietary protocol, following implantation in an ovine model. The impact of the processing methods on tissue strength and morphology was assessed prior to implantation. Pericardial patches were then implanted in the descending aorta and main pulmonary artery of juvenile sheep (n = 6 per group) for 180 days, and clinically evaluated using echocardiography. At explanation, patches were evaluated for strength, calcification and biological interaction. Histology demonstrated a wave-like appearance of well-separated collagen fibers for BPS scaffolds that provided pore sizes adequate to promote fibroblast infiltration. The collagen of the Glycar (R) patches showed loss of collagen fiber integrity, making the collagen densely compacted, contributing to insignificant recipient cell infiltration. The clinical performance of both groups was excellent, and echocardiography confirmed the absence of aneurysm formation, calcification and degeneration. Explanted Glycar (R) patches demonstrated cells in abundance within the fibrous encapsulation that separated the implant from the host tissue. More importantly, the fibrous encapsulation also contributed to patch thickening of both the explanted aorta and pulmonary patches. The decellularized pericardial scaffolds demonstrated recellularization, resistance to calcification, re-endothelialization and adequate strength after 180-day implantation. The proprietary decellularization protocol produced pericardial scaffolds that could be considered as an alternative to GA-fixed pericardial patches.

AB  - BackgroundAcute hypobaric hypoxia-induced brain injury has been a challenge in the health management of mountaineers; therefore, new neuroprotective agents are urgently required. Meldonium, a well-known cardioprotective drug, has been reported to have neuroprotective effects. However, the relevant mechanisms have not been elucidated. We hypothesized that meldonium may play a potentially novel role in hypobaric hypoxia cerebral injury.MethodsWe initially evaluated the neuroprotection efficacy of meldonium against acute hypoxia in mice and primary hippocampal neurons. The potential molecular targets of meldonium were screened using drug-target binding Huprot (TM) microarray chip and mass spectrometry analyses after which they were validated with surface plasmon resonance (SPR), molecular docking, and pull-down assay. The functional effects of such binding were explored through gene knockdown and overexpression.ResultsThe study clearly shows that pretreatment with meldonium rapidly attenuates neuronal pathological damage, cerebral blood flow changes, and mitochondrial damage and its cascade response to oxidative stress injury, thereby improving survival rates in mice brain and primary hippocampal neurons, revealing the remarkable pharmacological efficacy of meldonium in acute high-altitude brain injury. On the one hand, we confirmed that meldonium directly interacts with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) to promote its activity, which improved glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism to promote ATP production. On the other hand, meldonium also ameliorates mitochondrial damage by PGK1 translocating to mitochondria under acute hypoxia to regulate the activity of TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) molecular chaperones.ConclusionThese results further explain the mechanism of meldonium as an energy optimizer and provide a strategy for preventing acute hypobaric hypoxia brain injury at high altitudes.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of a numeric model to quantify real-time ultrasonographic (RTU) imaging is a prominent methodfor predicting the expected litter size by training an artificial neural network (ANN) to minimize the error of the prediction measured by metrics, such as root square mean error and mean absolute error. Time of the RTU application is a critical factor for such a prediction. Rated scale values (RSV) obtained from the RTU images relate to the accurate diagnosis of pregnancy and of litter size, suggesting the potential of a generalized use of the model in various farm conditions. Ultimately, the employment of the model in machine learning for an automated prediction of litter size can be used as a routine on-farm procedure for the efficient management of gestating sows. The present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a numerical model, quantifying real-time ultrasonographic (RTU) images of pregnant sows, to predict litter size. The time of the test with the least error was also considered. A number of 4165 pregnancies in Farm 1 and 438 in Farm 2 were diagnosed twice, with the quality of the RTU images translated into rated-scale values (RSV1 and RSV2). When a deep neural network (DNN) was trained, the evaluation of the method showed that the prediction of litter size can be performed with little error. Root square mean error (RMSE) for training, validation with data from Farm 1, and testing on the data from Farm 2 were 0.91, 0.97, and 1.05, respectively. Corresponding mean absolute errors (MAE) were 2.27, 2.41, and 2.58. Time appeared to be a critical factor for the accuracy of the model. The smallest MAE was achieved when the RTU was performed at days 20-22. It is concluded that a numerical, RTU imaging model is a prominent predictor of litter size, when a DNN is used. Therefore, early routinely evaluated RTU images of pregnant sows can predict litter size, with machine learning, in an automated manner and provide a useful tool for the efficient management of pregnant sows.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is one of the common serious complications in sepsis, and the pathogenesis of SAE remains unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been reported to be downregulated in the hippocampus and SIRT1 agonists can attenuated the cognitive dysfunction in septic mice. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a key substrate to maintain the deacetylation activity of SIRT1. As an intermediate of NAD+, beta-Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) has been reported to be promising in treating neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral ischemic injury. Thus we sought to investigate the potential role of NMN in SAE treatment. The SAE model was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in vivo, and neuroinflammation model was established with LPS-treated BV-2 cells in vitro. Memory impairment was assessed by Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests. As a result, the levels of NAD+, SIRT1 and PGC-1a were significantly reduced in the hippocampus of septic mice, while the acetylation of total lysine, phosphorylation of P38 and P65 were enhanced. All these changes induced by sepsis were inverted by NMN. Treating with NMN resulted in improved behavior performance in the fear conditioning tests and Morris water maze. Apoptosis, inflammatory and oxidative responses in the hippocampus of septic mice were attenuated significantly after NMN administration. These protective effect of NMN against memory dysfunction, inflammatory and oxidative injuries were reversed by the SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527. Similarly, LPS-induced activation of BV-2 cells were attenuated by NMN, EX-527 or SIRT1 knockdown could reverse such effect of NMN in vitro. In conclusion, NMN is protective against sepsis-induced memory dysfunction, and the inflammatory and oxidative injuries in the hippocampus region of septic mice. The NAD+/SIRT1 pathway might be involved in one of the mechanisms of the protective effect.

AB  - The protective efficiency of films of biofuel and diesel fuel on steel St3, as well as their compositions with additions of water up to 20%, was studied by electrochemical and gravimetric methods in a 0.5 M NaCl solution and a thermal moisture chamber. Biofuel obtained from substandard camelina oil according to the technology developed at the Federal State Budgetary Scientific Institution VNIITiN that meets the requirements of GOST R 53605-2009 (EN 14214:2003) was used. Diesel fuel complies with GOST 32511-2013 "Diesel fuel EURO". Fuel-water compositions are "water-in-oil" emulsions. Biofuel and watered compositions based on it have a greater protective efficiency than diesel fuel and its compositions with water. So, after 40 days of testing in a thermal moisture chamber, the protective efficiency of biofuel and its compositions with water is 99.0-99.4%, and that for diesel fuel and its compositions is 24.7-21.7%. According to the data of 14 days of gravimetric tests in 0.5 M NaCl solution, the protective efficiency of biofuel compositions Z= 80.9-69.9%, that of diesel fuel is 62.2-59.4%. The anti-corrosion advantage of biodiesel compositions is easy to ascertain based on polarization measurements in chloride solution, without resorting to lengthy gravimetric tests.

AB  - Horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) might help maintain coronaviruses severely affecting human health, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Bats may be more tolerant of viral infection than other mammals due to their unique immune system, but the exact mechanism remains to be fully explored. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, multiple animal species were diseased by coronavirus infection, especially in the respiratory system. Herein, a comparative analysis with single nucleus transcriptomic data of the lungs across four species, including horseshoe bat, cat, tiger, and pangolin, were conducted. The distribution of entry factors for twenty-eight respiratory viruses was characterized for the four species. Our findings might increase our understanding of the immune background of horseshoe bats.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serves as the interface between gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and the innate immune response in respiratory epithelial cells (REC). Herein, we describe a novel biological role of LPS that permits GNB to persist in the respiratory tract through inducing CFTR and mucociliary dysfunction. LPS reduced cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulater (CFTR)-mediated short-circuit current in mammalian REC in Ussing chambers and nearly abrogated CFTR single channel activity (defined as forskolin-activated Cl- currents) in patch clamp studies, effects of which were blocked with toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 inhibitor. Unitary conductance and single-channel amplitude of CFTR were unaffected, but open probability and number of active channels were markedly decreased. LPS increased cytoplasmic and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species resulting in CFTR carbonylation. All effects of exposure were eliminated when reduced glutathione was added in the medium along with LPS. Functional microanatomy parameters, including mucociliary transport, in human sinonasal epithelial cells in vitro were also decreased, but restored with co-incubation with glutathione or TLR-4 inhibitor. In vivo measurements, following application of LPS in the nasal cavities showed significant decreases in transepithelial Cl- secretion as measured by nasal potential difference (NPD) - an effect that was nullified with glutathione and TLR-4 inhibitor. These data provide definitive evidence that LPS-generated reactive intermediates downregulate CFTR function in vitro and in vivo which results in cystic fibrosis-type disease. Findings have implications for therapeutic approaches intent on stimulating Cl- secretion and/or reducing oxidative stress to decrease the sequelae of GNB airway colonization and infection.

AB  - Introduction This study aims to examine the impact of Rukangyin (RKY) and its components, LSQR and QTSS, on various cellular processes and signaling mechanisms in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.Methods Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to five groups according to the administered drugs, including the RKY group, LSQR group, QTSS group, fluorouracil group, and blank control group (n=5 in each group). The serum samples from each group were then used as a medicated medium for the culture of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Cell viability tests, apoptosis detection tests, and migration and invasion tests were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of treated serum. YAP, TAZ, MST1, and LATS1 protein expression and phosphorylation were examined using conventional western blotting methods.Results RKY and its QTSS and LSQR components significantly inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. RKY also significantly blocked cell motility with a comparable effect to that of fluorouracil. All serum groups suppressed YAP and TAZ expressions while increasing p-YAP, p-TAZ, MST1, and LATS1 levels, with RKY showing superior efficacy.Discussion In TNBC cells, RKY appears to enhance the tumor-suppressing signals of the Hippo signaling pathway via MST1, LATS1 activation, while restricting its pro-oncogenic action via YAP and TAZ blockade. However, in vivo and animal model experiments are required to confirm these findings.Conclusion RKY-medicated serum effectively inhibits growth, induces apoptosis, and reduces motility in the MDA-MB-231 cell line of breast cancer. This therapeutic potential of RKY on TNBC cells draws attention to the need for more investigations.

AB  - In this study, we developed a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR MS) approach to assess presumed changes in gangliosidome of a human hippocampus affected by temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in comparison with a normal hippocampus. Gangliosides, membrane glycolipids, are particularly diverse and abundant in the human brain, and participate in ion transport and modulation of neuronal excitability. Changes in structural ganglioside pattern potentially linked to TLE molecular pathogenesis have not been explored in detail. Aiming to characterize TLE-specific gangliosidome, we analyzed the native gangliosides purified from a human hippocampal tissue sample affected by TLE and a control hippocampus using HR MS. Marked differences of ganglioside expression were shown in TLE vs. control, particularly with respect to the sialylation degree of components, discovered as a characteristic feature of TLE. Another major finding is the occurrence of tetrasialofucogangliosides in TLE and species modified by either O-acetylation or CH3COO-. Structural analysis by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS gave rise to fragmentation patterns implying that the GQ1b (d18:1/18:0) isomer is specifically associated with TLE. Further investigation in a larger sample is needed in order to confirm the discovery of ganglioside structures specifically expressed in human TLE and to provide information on the probable role of gangliosides in the molecular events underlying seizures.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects older premutation carriers (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X gene. Despite the high prevalence of the FXTAS disorder, neuropathology studies of individuals affected by FXTAS are limited. We performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in the hippocampus of 26 FXTAS cases and analyzed the tissue microscopically. The major neuropathological characteristics were white matter disease, intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes, and neuron loss. Astrocytes contained more and larger inclusions than neurons. There was a negative correlation between age of death and CGG repeat length in cases over the age of 60. The number of astroglial inclusions (CA3 and dentate gyrus) and the number of CA3 neuronal inclusions increased with elevated CGG repeat length. In the two cases with a CGG repeat size less than 65, FXTAS intranuclear inclusions were not present in the hippocampus, while in the two cases with less than 70 (65-70) CGG repeat expansion, neurons and astrocytes with inclusions were occasionally identified in the CA1 sub-region. These findings add hippocampus neuropathology to the previously reported changes in other areas of the brain in FXTAS patients, with implications for understanding FXTAS pathogenesis.

AB  - Neuron-microglia communication through the fractalkine pathway is a critical factor mediating microglial proliferation, migration, release of mediators, and clearance of cellular debris, as well as the function of neuronal NMDA receptors. Disruption of the fractalkine-mediated microglia-neuron communication is associated with divergent outcomes, from damaging to protective, in different neurological conditions (including schizophrenia and epilepsy). In the present work we explore the impact of the absence of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) after neonatal blockade of NMDA receptors, which induces acute and long-term alterations in behavior, neuronal integrity and excitability. Wild-type (WT) and Cx3cr1-/- (KO) mice of both sexes randomly received either a low (0.5 mg/kg) or high dose (1 mg/kg) of MK-801 (NMDA receptor antagonist) or saline, for five consecutive days, during early postnatal development. Neuronal apoptosis was assessed at a midpoint of the pharmacological protocol. Survival and growth rates were determined up to adulthood when innate behaviors, unconditioned anxiety, contextual memory and seizure susceptibility were evaluated, as well as hippocampal local field potential and sensory gating. CX3CR1 depletion and neonatal MK-801 treatment had a synergistic acute effect, increasing neuronal apoptosis and overall mortality. Both factors independently induced long-lasting impairments in the wide array of behavioral tasks assessed during adulthood. However, low MK-801 dose treatment greatly augmented the mortality of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in WT mice, an effect prevented by CX3CR1 depletion. MK-801 treatment induced a shift in the power spectrum of the hippocampal local field potential towards higher frequencies that was averted in Cx3cr1-/- mice by an opposite shift. Our results reveal that CX3CR1 depletion severely increases the vulnerability to neonatal NMDA antagonism with additional complex interactions regarding cognitive and neurophysiological effects, which should be considered in the context of neuron-microglia miscommunication in many neurological disorders including schizophrenia and epilepsy.

AB  - Eosinophil sombrero vesicles are large tubular carriers resident in the cytoplasm of human eosinophils, identifiable by transmission electron microscopy, and important for immune mediator transport. Increased formation of sombrero vesicles occurs in activated eosinophils in vitro and in vivo. In tissue sites of eosinophilic cytolytic inflammation, extracellular eosinophil sombrero vesicles are noted, but their frequency and significance in eosinophil-associated diseases remain unclear. Here, we performed comprehensive quantitative transmission electron microscopy analyses and electron tomography to investigate the numbers, density, integrity, and 3-dimensional structure of eosinophil sombrero vesicles in different biopsy tissues from 5 prototypic eosinophil-associated diseases (eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis/nasal sinuses, ulcerative colitis/intestines, hypereosinophilic syndrome/skin, dermatitis/skin, and schistosomiasis/rectum). The morphology of extracellular eosinophil sombrero vesicles was also compared with that of cytoplasmic eosinophil sombrero vesicles, isolated by subcellular fractionation from peripheral blood eosinophils. We demonstrated that (i) eosinophil cytolysis, releasing intact sombrero vesicles and membrane-bound granules, is a consistent event in all eosinophil-associated diseases; (ii) eosinophil sombrero vesicles persist intact even after complete disintegration of all cell organelles, except granules (late cytolysis); (iii) the eosinophil sombrero vesicle population, composed of elongated, curved, and typical sombreros, and the eosinophil sombrero vesicle 3-dimensional architecture, diameter, and density remain unchanged in the extracellular matrix; (iv) free eosinophil sombrero vesicles closely associate with extracellular granules; and (v) free eosinophil sombrero vesicles also associate with externalized chromatin during eosinophil ETosis. Remarkably, eosinophil sombrero vesicles appeared on the surface of other cells, such as plasma cells. Thus, eosinophil cytolysis/ETosis can secrete intact sombrero vesicles, alongside granules, in inflamed tissues of eosinophil-associated diseases, potentially serving as propagators of eosinophil immune responses after cell death.
   These findings demonstrate that sombrero vesicles are consistently released in vivo from cytolytic eosinophils and persist as extracellular vesicles in inflamed tissues of eosinophilic diseases.

AB  - MDGA molecules can bind neuroligins and interfere with trans-synaptic interactions to neurexins, thereby impairing synapse development. However, the subcellular localization and dynamics of MDGAs, or their specific action mode in neurons remain unclear. Here, surface immunostaining of endogenous MDGAs and single molecule tracking of recombinant MDGAs in dissociated hippocampal neurons reveal that MDGAs are homogeneously distributed and exhibit fast membrane diffusion, with a small reduction in mobility across neuronal maturation. Knocking-down/out MDGAs using shRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 strategies increases the density of excitatory synapses, the membrane confinement of neuroligin-1, and the phosphotyrosine level of neuroligins associated with excitatory post-synaptic differentiation. Finally, MDGA silencing reduces the mobility of AMPA receptors, increases the frequency of miniature EPSCs (but not IPSCs), and selectively enhances evoked AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Overall, our results support a mechanism by which interactions between MDGAs and neuroligin-1 delays the assembly of functional excitatory synapses containing AMPA receptors.

AB  - Traditionally, research unraveling seasonal neuroplasticity in songbirds has focused on the male song control system and testosterone. We longitudinally monitored the song behavior and neuroplasticity in male and female starlings during multiple photoperiods using Diffusion Tensor and Fixel-Based techniques. These exploratory data-driven whole-brain methods resulted in a population-based tractogram confirming microstructural sexual dimorphisms in the song control system. Furthermore, male brains showed hemispheric asymmetries in the pallium, whereas females had higher interhemispheric connectivity, which could not be attributed to brain size differences. Only females with large brains sing but differ from males in their song behavior by showing involvement of the hippocampus. Both sexes experienced multisensory neuroplasticity in the song control, auditory and visual system, and cerebellum, mainly during the photosensitive period. This period with low gonadal hormone levels might represent a `sensitive window' during which different sensory and motor systems in the cerebrum and cerebellum can be seasonally reshaped in both sexes.

AB  - Background Aflatoxin B (AFB) induces toxicological effects on the liver and immune organs. The whey proteins can modulate the immune response during aflatoxicosis. Our work evaluates the novel polylactic acid-glycolic acid-chitosan-encapsulated bovine and camel whey proteins against AFB-induced thymic and splenic atrophy in rats.Methods and results Seventy adult male Wister albino rats were divided into a control healthy group (G1) and six AFB1-intoxicated groups (G2-G7). One of the following supplements: distilled water, camel whey proteins (CWP), bovine whey proteins, poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)- chitosan-loaded with camel whey protein microparticles (CMP), PLGA-chitosan loaded with bovine whey protein microparticles (BMP), and PLGA-chitosan nanoparticles were administered as prophylactic supplements to AFB1-intoxicated groups. The AFB-treated group showed significantly higher hepatic levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of antioxidants. In the aflatoxicated group, atrophy of the splenic lymphatic nodules and disfigurement in the organisation with an apparent decrease in the thickness of the cortex in the thymus were observed, as well as a decrease in splenic and thymic CD4+T and CD8+T lymphocytes. Moreover, CXCL12 levels were downregulated, whereas tumour necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor kappa B, and cleaved caspase-3 levels were upregulated. CWP, BMP, and CMP supplements markedly decreased oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, as well as significantly raised CXCL12, CD4+T, and CD8+T cells.Conclusions The CWP, BMP, and CMP supplements rescue the liver and immune tissues from the toxic effects of AFB through their antioxidant, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and chemotaxis-enhancing roles.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The traditional Chinese medicine formula Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) has been reported to have estrogen-like effects and therapeutic effects on the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aim of the study: To explore whether the central oxytocin and neuroendocrine system is involved in the modu-lating effects of DSS on the cognition and neuropsychiatric hebaviors in female AD rats, and to investigate the pharmacokinetics of paeoniflorin and ferulic acid in female AD rats with DSS treatment. Material and methods: DSS (1.2, 3.2, 8.6 g/kg/day) was orally administered to ovariectomized (OVX) rats, and saline was orally administered to sham operation rats as control group. The Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and passive avoidance test were conducted for evaluation of learning and memory abilities, while elevated plus maze test and forced swim test were performed to assess anxiety-and depressive-like be-haviors. ELISA kits were used to detect the levels of estrogen (E), estrogen receptor & alpha; (ER & alpha;), oxytocin (OT), oxytocin receptor (OTR), acetylcholine (Ach), acetylcholin esterase (AchE), and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) in the cortex. The concentrations of Ach, glutamate (Glu), & gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 5-hydroxytryp-tamine (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus were assessed by HPLC-MS. The changes of neuronal morphology in the hippocampus were observed by Nissl staining. The pharmacokinetics of paeoniflorin and ferulic acid in OVX rats with DSS treatment were studied by HPLC. Results: In the Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and passive avoidance test, OVX rats showed cognitive impairment. In the elevated plus maze test and forced swim test, the anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors of OVX rats were significant as compared to the control group. Treatment of DSS significantly imporved the cognitive deficits, and ameliorated anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors of OVX rats. The expression of E, ER & alpha;, OT, OTR, AchE and ChAT in the cortex of model group were significantly decreased, and DSS significantly reversed these changes. The concentrations of Ach, Glu, GABA, 5-HT and NE in the hippo-campus of OVX rats were significantly decreased, whereas DSS significantly increased the levels of Ach, Glu, GABA, 5-HT and NE. There was no significant difference in the concentration of DA in the hippocampus among groups. Degenerating neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region were observed in OVX rats, and the number of neurons was decreased. DSS treatment reduced the degenerating neurons, and incresed the number of neurons. The MRT (0 -.), AUC (0 -.), Cmax and t1/2z values of paeoniflorin, and the AUC 0-. and Cmax value of ferulic acid were higher in DSS-treated OVX rats than those in the DSS-treated control rats. Conclusions: DSS improves the learning and memory ability, and attenuates anxiety-and depressive-like be-haviors of OVX rats. The mechanism may be through increasing estrogen, reducing cholinergic damage, and modulating neurotransmitters. The increase in absorption and elimination time of paeoniflorin and ferulic acid in OVX rats may enhance the efficacy of DSS.

AB  - The crude ethanol extract of the whole plant of Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb was investigated for its potential as antidementia, induced by estrogen deprivation, based on in vitro antioxidant activity, beta-amyloid aggregation inhibition and cholinesterase inhibitory activity, as well as in vivo Morris water maze task (MWMT), novel object recognition task (NORT), and Y-maze task. To better understand the effect of the extract, oxidative stress-induced brain membrane damage through lipid peroxidation in the whole brain was also investigated. Additionally, expressions of neuroinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and estrogen receptor-mediated facilitation genes such as PI3K and AKT mRNA in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were also evaluated. These effects were confirmed by the determination of its serum metabolites by NMR metabolomic analysis. Both the crude extract of A. philoxeroides and its flavone constituents were found to inhibit beta-amyloid (A beta) aggregation.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of maternal selenium-enriched yeast (SeY) supplementation during late gestation and lactation on sow performance, transfer of selenium (Se) and redox status, and gut microbiota community, as well as on the gut health of offspring. Seventy pregnant sows on day 85 of gestation were randomly allocated to the following two treatments: (1) sows who were fed a basal diet (basal diet contained 0.3 mg/kg Se as Na2SeO3, n = 35); (2) and sows who were fed a SeY-supplemented diet (basal diet with 0.2 mg/kg Se as SeY, n = 35). The offspring piglets were only cross-fostered within the group on day 3 of lactation (L3) according to the pig farm epidemic prevention policy. The plasma, milk, and feces samples from 10 sows, as well as plasma and intestinal samples per treatment, were collected on L1 and L21, respectively. Our results showed that maternal SeY supplementation increased the first week average weight and ADG of piglets (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the SeY supplementation increased the Se content in the plasma and milk of sows and the plasma of piglets on L1 and L21 (p < 0.05). In addition, in sows, the levels of fat in the milk on L21, the level of IgA, T-AOC, and GSH-Px in the plasma on L21, and the level of T-AOC and GSH-Px in the colostrum were increased, while the MDA content was decreased in the plasma on L1 and in the colostrum and milk on L14 (p < 0.05). In the piglet plasma, the levels of IgA on L1 and L21, GSH-Px on L1, and GSH on L21 were increased, while the MDA content was decreased on L1 (p < 0.05). Maternal SeY supplementation up-regulated the small intestinal protein abundances of MUC1, E-cadherin, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin and activated the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway in weaned offspring piglets. The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that fecal microbiota had distinct separations during lactation, and the relative abundances of unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae, Prevotaceae_UCG-001, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group were increased on L1. Collectively, the current findings suggest that maternal SeY supplementation during late gestation and lactation could improve the piglet's growth performance, Se status, antioxidant capacity and immunoglobulins transfer at the first week of lactation, as well as alter the fecal microbiota composition by increasing antioxidative-related and SCFA-producing microbiota in sows. These changes contributed to enhancing the small intestinal barrier function and activating the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in offspring.

AB  - Appropriate protein sources are vital for the growth, development and health of neonates. Twenty-four 2-day-old piglets were randomly divided into three groups and fed isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets. The experimental diets included a milk replacer with 17.70% whey protein concentrate (WPC group), a milk replacer with 6% spray-dried porcine plasma isonitrogenously substituting WPC (SDPP group), and a milk replacer with 5.13% soy protein isolate isonitrogenously substituting WPC (SPI group). Neonatal piglets were fed milk replacer from postnatal day 2 (PND 2) to day 20 (PND 20). The growth performance, intestinal morphology, activities of digestive enzymes, plasma biochemical parameters, immunity-related genes, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and intestinal microbiota in the colonic chyme were determined. The results showed that SDPP-fed piglets had higher final BW (p = 0.05), ADG (p = 0.05) and F/G (p = 0.07) compared with WPC- and SPI-fed piglets, and SDPP-fed piglets had a lower diarrhea index (p < 0.01) from PND 2 to PND 8. SDPP-fed piglets had an increased ileal villus height (p = 0.04) and ratio of villus height to crypt depth (VCR) (p = 0.02), and increased activities of sucrase (p < 0.01), lactase (p = 0.02) and trypsin (p = 0.08) in the jejunum, compared with WPC- and SPI-fed piglets. Furthermore, SPI-fed piglets had an increased mRNA expression of IL-6 (p < 0.01) and concentration of plasma urea (p = 0.08). The results from LEfSe analysis showed that SDPP-fed piglets had a higher abundance of beneficial Butyricicoccus compared with WPC- and SPI-fed piglets, in which higher abundances of pathogenic bacteria such as Marinifilaceae, Fusobacterium and Enterococcus were observed. Moreover, SDPP-fed piglets had an increased concentration of butyric acid (p = 0.08) in the colonic chyme compared with WPC- and SPI-fed piglets. These results suggest that neonatal piglets fed milk replacer with SDPP partially substituting WPC had improved growth performance and intestinal morphology and function, associated with higher digestive enzyme activity and fewer pathogenic bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND Garlic (Allium sativum L.) and other species of genus Allium are popular vegetables and food seasonings, owing to their spicy flavour and richness in health-promoting compounds. Several local garlic types are still grown on a small scale in different Italian regions, not being however yet properly characterized for their chemical composition. RESULTS In the present investigation ten garlic and four elephant garlic (Allium ampeloprasum L.) populations cultivated in northern and central Italy were evaluated for their alk(en)yl cysteine sulphoxide (ACSO) and volatile compound profiles. Three non-volatile ACSOs (methiin, alliin, and isoalliin) and 27 volatile compounds were identified and quantified. A high and significant within-type variability was detected, with total ACSOs in the range 2759-5756, 4533-15 520, and 6565-10 643 mg kg(-1) of fresh weight (f.w.). in elephant, white and red garlic, respectively. Elephant garlic showed a total sulphoxide content and a relative alliin amount significantly lower than white and red garlic. Remarkable within-type differences were also assessed for volatile compound content, ranging 260-599, 333-981, and 618-845 mg kg(-1) f.w. in elephant, white, and red garlic, respectively. Diallyl trisulphide was the major individual compound, accounting for more than 0.30 mg mg(-1) of volatiles in all the analysed samples. The three garlic types were clearly separated by discriminant analysis of analytical traits. CONCLUSION This study investigated for the first time different Italian garlic and elephant garlic populations with respect to non-volatile and volatile organosulphur compound content, allowing the possibility of selecting garlic accessions according to the bioactive content.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 3 is a newly emerging pathogen of porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD). Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine, resulting in huge economic losses to the pig industry. Porcine circovirus type 3 capsid protein (Cap) can self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs). Therefore, the expression of the recombinant Cap protein is of great significance for the prevention, diagnosis and control of porcine circovirus type 3 associated diseases. In this study, the recombinant Cap protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli by deleting the nuclear localization sequence (NLS). The VLPs were observed by transmission electron microscopy. To evaluate the immunogenicity of the recombinant Cap protein, mice were immunized. As a result, the recombinant Cap protein can induce higher levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. A VLP-based ELISA method was developed for the detection of antibodies. The established ELISA method has good sensitivity, specificity, repeatability and clinical applicability. These results demonstrate the successful expression of the PCV3 recombinant Cap protein and the preparation of recombinant Cap protein VLPs, which can be used for the preparation of subunit vaccines. Meanwhile, the established I-ELISA method lays a foundation for the development of the commercial PCV3 serological antibody detection kit.

AB  - Objective In order to understand the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played in the mechanisms of glyphosate neurotoxicity in neuronal development.
   Methods Perinatal glyphosate exposure (PGE) mouse model was constructed, and a lncRNA microarray was used to study the lncRNA expression changes in the hippocampus tissue of perinatal glyphosate exposure mice. Then we used GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) databases to analyze the function of the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs.
   Results LncRNA microarray analysis revealed that 1759 lncRNAs and 759 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the perinatal glyphosate exposure (PGE) mice group (G group) compared with the normal control mice group (C group). The functions of the DEmRNAs are involved in the cellular response to hormone stimulus. The ceRNA analysis showed that some interaction networks existed, including (ENSMUST00000137546, ENSMUST00000160950)/(miR-34a-3p, miR-130a-3p)/(Il12b, Irf1). Further analysis of the target mRNAs of miRNAs indicated that the possible functions involved the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and calcium signaling pathway, which are involved in perinatal glyphosate exposure-induced neurotoxicity.
   Conclusion The aberrant expression of lncRNAs is related to the perinatal glyphosate-exposed neurotoxicity. These lncRNAs affect the target gene expression level, might by regulating neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. The (ENSMUST00000137546, ENSMUST00000160950)/ (miRNA-34a-5p, miR-130a-3p) / mRNAs (e.g., Il12b, Irf1) interaction network may functions in perinatal glyphosate exposure-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Beta-amyloid (A beta) depresses excitatory synapses by a poorly understood mechanism requiring NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function. Here, we show that increased PSD-95, a major synaptic scaffolding molecule, blocks the effects of A beta on synapses. The protective effect persists in tissue lacking the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, which prevents the confounding synaptic potentiation by increased PSD-95. A beta modifies the conformation of the NMDAR C-terminal domain (CTD) and its interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), producing synaptic weakening. Higher endogenous levels or overexpression of PSD-95 block A beta-induced effects on the NMDAR CTD conformation, its interaction with PP1, and synaptic weakening. Our results indicate that increased PSD-95 protects synapses from A beta toxicity, suggesting that low levels of synaptic PSD-95 may be a molecular sign indicating synapse vulnerability to A beta. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of its depalmitoylation increases PSD-95 at synapses and rescues deficits caused by A beta, possibly opening a therapeutic avenue against Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The selection of gastric digestion parameters in food digestion studies using in vitro models is critical to properly represent structural changes in the stomach. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of digestion in the human gastric simulator (HGS) using generalized in vitro gastric digestion parameters (secretion rate of 4.1 mL min(-1), gastric emptying rate of 5.68 g min(-1)) that were derived from a previous in vivo study using six starch-rich foods. Two of the six foods used in the in vivo study (cooked durum wheat porridge/semolina and pasta) were digested in the HGS for up to 240 min, then the properties of the emptied and remaining digesta were measured. The properties of the in vitro remaining digesta were compared to those measured in vivo (growing pig stomach). The trends in the gastric breakdown rate and mechanisms, dry matter emptying kinetics, and starch hydrolysis of pasta and semolina were similar to those of in vivo. Gastric breakdown and dilution kinetics in vitro and in vivo were well-related but did not have a 1 : 1 correlation, whereas gastric acidification kinetics in the HGS deviated from that observed in vivo. The results suggest that generalized digestion parameters could be used to predict the effect of food structure on in vivo gastric breakdown and emptying, but care should be taken in interpretation of results, as the gastric acidification process was different from what was observed in vivo. This information will help refine in vitro digestion model parameters to provide more physiologically-relevant data in future studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of smoking on brain iron deposition. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 84 middle-aged and elderly people without obvious nervous system diseases and brain trauma were included in this study. Their smoking history was carefully evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to obtain 3DT1 image and ESWAN image. R2* image was obtained by post -processing ESWAN sequence. Computer segmentation technology was used to segment 3DT1 image. After reg-istration, R2* value of each brain area was extracted. The t test and multiple linear regression analysis were used to analyze the relationship between R2* and smoking. RESULTS: Smoking was mainly associated with the increase of R2* in the hippocampus, white matter, and cortex (beta: 0.244, 0.317, and 0.277; p= 0.026, 0.002, and 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSION: Smoking may be related to brain iron deposition. The main brain areas of iron deposition induced by smoking are hippocampus, white matter, and cortex.

AB  - As the world population ages, new molecular targets in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed to combat the expected influx of new AD cases. Until now, the role of RNA structure in aging and neurodegeneration has largely remained unexplored. In this study, we examined human hippocampal postmortem tissue for the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in aging and AD. We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurons with the accumulation of phospho-tau immunostaining contained rG4s, rG4 structure can drive tau aggregation, and rG4 staining density depended on APOE genotype in the human tissue examined. Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation is linked to proteostasis collapse. These morphological findings suggest that further investigation of RNA structure in neurodegeneration is a critical avenue for future treatments and diagnoses.

AB  - Placental health and milk quality are important for maternal reproductive performance during pregnancy and lactation. Lycopene plays an important role in antioxidation, anti-inflammation and regulating lipid metabolism. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of dietary lycopene supplementation in the pig model on reproductive performance, placental health and milk composition during maternal gestation and lactation. In the present study, the litter size of live piglets was increased and the litter size of dead piglets was decreased by lycopene supplementation of the diet of sows. The litter weight at birth and weaning were increased in the lycopene group. Through placental proteomics, we enriched differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), gene ontology (GO) terms, and Kyoto encyclopedia of proteins and genomes (KEGG) pathways involved in immunity, anti-inflammation, antioxidants, and lipid metabolism and transport. Furthermore, in terms of placental health, we analyzed the levels of related enzymes, metabolites and mRNA expression in the placenta. Lycopene was shown to reduce mRNA expression and the levels of placental inflammatory factors, increase the content of immunoglobulin, improve the antioxidant capacity, and improve lipid metabolism and lipid transport in the placenta. In terms of sow milk composition, lycopene increased the levels of immunoglobulins in colostrum and lactose in colostrum and milk. Overall, the results of the present study demonstrate that dietary lycopene supplementation of sows during gestation and lactation improves the reproductive performance to a certain extent; this may be due to lycopene improving the placental health and milk composition of sows.

AB  - Ketamine produces rapid antidepressant action in patients with major depression or treatment-resistant depression. Studies have identified brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), as necessary for the antidepressant effects and underlying ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus. Here, we delete BDNF or TrkB in presynaptic CA3 or postsynaptic CA1 regions of the Schaffer collateral pathway to investigate the rapid antidepressant action of ketamine. The deletion of Bdnf in CA3 or CA1 blocks the ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation. In contrast, ablation of TrkB only in postsynaptic CA1 eliminates the ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation. We confirm BDNFTrkB signaling in CA1 is required for ketamine's rapid behavioral action. Moreover, ketamine application elicits dynamin1-dependent TrkB activation and downstream signaling to trigger rapid synaptic effects. Taken together, these data demonstrate a requirement for BDNF-TrkB signaling in CA1 neurons in ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation and identify a specific synaptic locus in eliciting ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects.

AB  - An acute increase in excitatory synaptic transmission contributes to the rapid antidepressant actions of neuroplastogens, including ketamine and its bioactive metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK). It is hypothesized that drug-induced metaplastic changes in synaptic strength account for therapeutically relevant behavioral adaptations in vivo. Using the plasticity-deficient Wistar Kyoto model of treatment-resistant depression, we demonstrate that (2R,6R)-HNK potentiates glutamatergic transmission, promotes synaptic strength, restores long-term potentiation (LTP), and reverses deficits in hippocampal-dependent synaptic activity and behavior. (2R,6R)-HNK selectively potentiated CA1 pyramidal neuron activity during novelty exploration and restored Schaffer collateral-dependent spatial recognition memory. Prior experience with spatial learning partially occluded LTP in control rats, an effect mimicked in LTP-impaired rats in which spatial learning deficits were reversed by (2R,6R)-HNK. These findings demonstrate that (2R,6R)-HNK exerts rapid neuroplastogenic effects in vivo, which improve cognitive function and promote adaptive changes in synaptic strength at functionally impaired synapses.

AB  - Simple Summary Diseases caused by parasites have introduced serious threats to human health and the development of animal husbandry in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA), such as toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii and neosporosis caused by Neospora caninum. However, information on the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and neosporosis in stray cats and dogs which are the definitive hosts of T. gondii and N. caninum in the QTPA is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a detailed record of the seroprevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum samples and the molecular epidemiology in feces from stray cats and dogs in the plateau area. The results revealed that stray cats and dogs in the QTPA, China present both T. gondii and N. caninum infection through the antibodies and antigen detection of the indirect ELISA tests and qPCRs. The present study suggests the prevalence of acute neosporosis and chronic re-emergence of toxoplasmosis in stray cats and dogs in the testing area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of T. gondii and N. caninum infection in cats and dogs in the QTPA, and the first determination of N. caninum infection in cats in China. In conclusion, stray cats and dogs play key roles in the transmission and prevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum in the plateau area. Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum belong to the Apicomplexan protozoa which is an obligate intracellular parasite, causing toxoplasmosis and neosporosis throughout the world. Cats and dogs are the definitive hosts of these two parasites. However, information on the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and neosporosis in stray cats and dogs in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA) is limited, and little is known about the diversity of the diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform indirect ELISA tests based on recombinant TgSAG1, TgGRA1, NcSAG1 and NcGRA7 proteins to establish a detailed record of the seroprevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum samples and to develop qPCR amplification based on TgB1 and NcNc5 genes to conduct molecular epidemiology in feces from stray cats and dogs in the QTPA. In the current study, a total of 128 cat serum samples were analyzed through serological tests in which 53 (41.4%) and 57 (44.5%) samples were found positive for T. gondii specific-IgG and IgM antibodies, and 2 (1.6%) and 74 (57.8%) samples were confirmed positive for N. caninum specific-IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively. Out of 224 stray dog sera, 59.8% and 58.9% were recorded as positive against anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies, 17.9% and 64.7% were detected positive against Neospora IgG and IgM. On the other hand, 1 of 18 cat fecal samples was successfully amplified within the Ct value of 10 to 30 while no cat was positive for neosporosis. Moreover, a higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis in stray dogs (14.5%, 16/110) than of neosporosis (5.5%, 6/110) with different parasite numbers were found. Further analysis showed that no significant sex differences were found nor between the overall infection rates of T. gondii and N. caninum in this study. This study suggests that stray cats and dogs play key roles in the transmission and prevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum in the plateau area.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Perillae Folium, the leaves and twigs of Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton, has been included in many traditional Chinese medicine herbal formulas to treat depression. However, the precise antidepressant mechanism of the essential oil from Perillae Folium (PFEO) has not been fully investigated. Aim of the study: To assess the effects and potential mechanisms of PFEO on depression using animal models and network pharmacology analysis. Materials and methods: PFEO was intranasally administered to a mouse model of social defeat stress (SDS). The antidepressant effects of PFEO on SDS-induced mice were evaluated using behavioral tests. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot were performed to measure the levels of depression-related biomarkers in the hippocampus and serum of the mice. The chemical compounds of PFEO were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses were conducted to investigate the potential bioactive components of PFEO and the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects. To validate the mechanisms of the bioactive compounds, in vitro models using PC12 and BV2 cells were established and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was evaluated. Results: The intranasal administration of PFEO suppressed SDS-induced depression in mice by increasing the time spent in the social zone and the social interactions in the social interaction test and by decreasing the immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swimming tests. Moreover, the PFEO treatment reduced the SDS-induced anxiety-like behavior, as inferred from the increased activity in the central zone observed in the open field test and in the open arms observed in the elevated plus maze test. PFEO administration recovered the SDS-induced decrease in the levels of 5-HT, NE, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and p-ERK in the hippocampus of mice. Furthermore, the increased serum corticosterone level was also attenuated by the PFEO treatment. A total of 21 volatile compounds were detected in PFEO using GC-MS, among which elemicin (15.52%), apiol (15.16%), and perillaldehyde (12.79%) were the most abundant ones. The PFEO compounds targeted 32 depression-associated genes, which were mainly related to neural cells and neurotransmission pathways. Molecular docking indicated good binding affinities between the bioactive components of PFEO (apiol, beta-caryophyllene, elemicin, and myristicin) and the key targets, including ACHE, IL1B, IL6, MAOB, SLC6A2, SLC6A3, SLC6A4, and tumor necrosis factor. Among the four compounds, beta-caryophyllene, elemicin, and myristicin were more effective in reducing neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Elemicin showed the highest BBB permeability rate. Conclusions: This study shows the antidepressant activities of PFEO in an SDS-induced mouse model and suggests its potential mechanisms of action: regulation of the corticosterone levels, hippocampal neurotransmitters, and ERK signaling. Apiol, beta-caryophyllene, elemicin, and myristicin may be the main contributors to the observed effects induced by PFEO. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and the main PFEO bioactive components.

AB  - Different spatiotemporal abnormalities have been implicated in different neuropsychiatric disorders and anthropometric social traits, yet an investigation in the temporal network modularity with brain tissue transcriptomics has been lacking. We developed a supervised network approach to investigate the genome-wide association study (GWAS) results in the spatial and temporal contexts and demonstrated it in 20 brain disorders and anthropometric social traits. BrainSpan transcriptome profiles were used to discover significant modules enriched with trait susceptibility genes in a developmental stage-stratified manner. We investigated whether, and in which developmental stages, GWAS-implicated genes are coordinately expressed in brain transcriptome. We identified significant network modules for each disorder and trait at different developmental stages, providing a systematic view of network modularity at specific developmental stages for a myriad of brain disorders and traits. Specifically, we observed a strong pattern of the fetal origin for most psychiatric disorders and traits [such as schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and neuroticism], whereas increased co-expression activities of genes were more strongly associated with neurological diseases [such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis] and anthropometric traits (such as college completion, education and subjective well-being) in postnatal brains. Further analyses revealed enriched cell types and functional features that were supported and corroborated prior knowledge in specific brain disorders, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis in AD, myelin sheath in multiple sclerosis and regulation of synaptic plasticity in both college completion and education. Our study provides a landscape view of the spatiotemporal features in a myriad of brain-related disorders and traits.

AB  - Early diagnosis of mucormycosis, a severe and potentially fatal complication in immunocompromised and COVID-19 patients, is crucial for initiating timely antifungal therapy and reducing infection mortality. In this study, the diagnostic performance of a duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was evaluated to detect Mucorales-specific and Rhizopus oryzae-specific targets in 160 clinical samples collected from 112 COVID-19 patients suspected of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (IFRS). During potassium hydroxide (KOH) direct microscopy, non-septate hyphae were observed in 73 out of 160 samples (45.63%); however, using duplex PCR, 82 out of 160 specimens (51.25%) tested positive. Among the positive PCR samples, 67 (81.71%) exhibited a double band (both 175 and 450 base pairs [bp]) indicating the presence of R. oryzae, and 15 (18.29%) showed only a single band (175 bp), suggesting the presence of non-R. oryzae Mucorales. DNAs from 10 microscopically negative samples and 4 samples with septate hyphae in microscopy were successfully amplified in PCR. Considering Calcofluor white fluorescence microscopy as the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of mucormycosis, the duplex PCR assay utilized in this study exhibited a sensitivity of 93.88%, a specificity of 100%, a negative predictive value of 91.18%, and a positive predictive value of 100% for detecting mucormycosis in IFRS specimens. The duplex PCR assay demonstrated higher sensitivity compared to direct examination with KOH (82 vs. 73) and culture (82 vs. 41), enabling rapid detection/identification of Mucorales even in samples with negative culture or in biopsies with only a few hyphal elements.
   Early diagnosis of mucormycosis, a severe complication in COVID-19 patients, is critical for reducing the mortality of the infection. In this study, a sensitive and rapid PCR assay to detect all Mucorales and delineate Rhizopus oryzae was developed and assessed to improve the diagnosis of mucormycosis.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) on reproductive efficiency of synchronized ewes with the sponge and progesterone (P4) injection-based protocols. In study 1, anoestrous ewes (n = 120) were used. Sixty ewes were treated with sponge (S) for 12 days. The injection of eCG (SeCG group, n = 30) or hMG (ShMG, n = 30) was given at the time of sponge removal. Thirty ewes received IM injection of P4, three times every 48 h and the injection of hMG was given 24 h after the third P4 injection (3PhMG group, n = 30), and 30 ewes were used as control group. Pregnancy was diagnosed on day 50 after the release of ram. In study 2, 60 ewes were randomly divided into two equal groups. In the treated group with antibiotics (n = 30), before inserting, the sponges were impregnated with the antibiotic penicillin G sodium (5,000,000 IU) and in the control group (n = 30), there was no added antibiotics. Before inserting and after removing sponges, a vaginal cytology sample was taken with a sterile cotton swab. The number of neutrophils in each sample was counted and analysed. The rate of oestrus and total pregnancy was greater in SeCG (96.7, 93.3%), ShMG (82.8, 93.1%) and 3PhMG (67.9, 89.3%) groups compared with the control group (13.8, 41.4%) (p < .05). No significant difference was found in single, twin and total lambing and pregnancy rates after injection of eCG and hMG during the non-breeding season (p > .05). A higher percentage of control ewes had the vaginal smear with neutrophils more than 50% (96.7% vs. 76.7%; p < .05). In conclusion, a single dose of hMG can induce fertile oestrus in synchronized ewes with P4 administered by either injection or intravaginally. Purulent discharge and percentage of neutrophils were significantly reduced in the synchronized ewes by the impregnated sponges with the antibiotic penicillin.

AB  - The feeding and spawning grounds for seahorses have been lost due to nationwide coastal developments in South Korea. However, little information on the feeding ecology of the Korean seahorse (Hippocampus haema) is currently available. The main objective in this study was to understand the feeding strategy of H. haema on the basis of DNA analysis of the contents of the guts. This is the first study on the feeding ecology of H. haema. Crustaceans were found to be major prey for H. haema in this study. Among the 12 identified species, arthropods were predominantly observed as potential prey of H. haema in this study. The Caprella sp. Was detected in all summer specimens followed by the Ianiropsis sp., whereas isopods were dominant, and amphipods accounted for a small proportion in winter specimens. According to the results in this study, there appears to be a seasonal shift in the major prey of H. haema. Moreover, a potential change in the habitats for adults was further discussed. Since this is a pilot study, further studies should be conducted for a better understanding of the feeding ecology of H. haema.

AB  - Objective Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases. Astaxanthin (AST) can play a neuroprotective role owing to its long-chain conjugated unsaturated double bond, which imparts potent antioxidant, anti-neuroinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate and validate the protective effect of AST on neuronal senescence and apoptosis caused by oxidative stress induced by A beta 25-35 peptide, with the goal of preventing the onset of cognitive dysfunction.
   Methods Alzheimer's disease models comprising ICR mice and PC12 cells were established using A beta 25-35. The Morris water maze test was used to assess mouse behavior. Nissl staining revealed morphological changes in the mouse hippocampal neurons. To elucidate the mechanism of action of AST, ICR mice and PC12 cells were treated with the silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM). Additionally, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate changes in the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in the mouse hippocampus, and SIRT1/PGC-1a signaling pathway proteins were detected. Moreover, the oxidative stress markers in ICR mice and PC12 cells were evaluated. Further, CCK-8 assays, Annexin V/PI double staining, and beta-galactosidase activity assays were performed in PC12 cells to evaluate the anti-senescence and apoptotic effects of AST.
   Results In vivo experiments showed that A beta 25-35 impaired cognitive function, promoted morphological changes in hippocampal neurons, decreased Bcl-2 expression, increased Bax expression, decreased superoxide dismutase and GSH-px levels, and increased reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels. Conversely, AST alleviated the impact of A beta 25-35 in mice, with reversed outcomes. NAM administration reduced SIRT1 and PGC-1a expression in the hippocampus. This decrease was accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and hippocampal neuron atrophy, which were also evident in the mice. Additionally, in vitro experiments showed that A beta 25-35 could promote oxidative stress and induce the senescence and apoptosis of PC12 cells. Nonetheless, AST treatment counteracted this effect by inhibiting oxidative stress and altering the state of PC12 cells. Notably, the A beta + NAM group exhibited the most significant rates of senescence and apoptosis in PC12 cells following NAM treatment.
   Conclusion AST can improve cellular senescence and apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress via the SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway and plays a vital role in inhibiting neuronal senescence and apoptosis and enhancing cognitive ability.

AB  - Parental emotion regulation plays a major role in parent-child interactions, and in turn, neural plasticity in children, particularly during sensitive developmental periods. However, little is known about how parental emotion dysregulation is associated with variation in children's brain structure, which was the goal of this study. Forty-five Black American mother-child dyads were recruited from an intergenerational trauma study; emotion regulation in mothers and their children (age 8-13 years) was assessed. Diffusion-weighted images were collected in children; deterministic tractography was used to reconstruct pathways of relevance to emotion regulation. Metrics of white matter connectivity [fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD)] were extracted for pathways. Socio-economic variables were also included in statistical models. Maternal emotion dysregulation was the strongest predictor of child fornix MD (r = .35, p = .001), indicating that more severe emotion dysregulation in mothers corresponded with lower fornix connectivity in children. Maternal impulsivity was a strong predictor of child fornix MD (r = .51, p < .001). Maternal emotion dysregulation may adversely influence connectivity of the child.s fornix, a hippocampal-striatal pathway implicated in reward processes; these associations remained even after accounting for other socio-environmental factors. Dysregulated maternal emotions may uniquely impact children's adaptation to trauma/stress by affecting networks that support appetitive processing.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a tauopathy characterized by the deposition of amyloid aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and amyloid-(3 peptide (A(3) in the brain. Nevertheless, a soluble, oligomeric forms of Tau and A(3 are considered to be the most neurotoxic species responsible for neurodegenerative processes in AD. The mechanism of action of these oligomers remains largely unclear. Previously, we demonstrated the inhibition of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa) by A(3. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effect of Tau protein on the BKCa activity. Furthermore, since prion protein (PrP) interacts with Tau and the N-terminal fragment of PrP, called N1, can be neuroprotective in tauopathies, we checked whether N1 can also act at the level of BKCa channel. In the studies we used monomers, oligomers and amyloid fibrils of aggregation-prone Tau fragment, called K18, carrying tauopathy-associated mutation - deletion of Lys280 (K18 Delta 280). Additionally, to induce formation of neurotoxic oligomers, K18 Delta 280 was phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). The activity of the plasma membrane BKCa of hippocampal neurons was recorded using single-channel patch-clamp technique in both inside-out and outside-out modes, exposing the cytosolic or extracellular surface of the membrane, respectively. In the outside-out mode - performing the extracellular application of the neurotoxic oligomers of phosphorylated K18 Delta 280, we observed a significant and concentration-dependent decrease in the probability of opening (Po) of BKCa. The Po of BKCa was fully recovered after washing the oligomers out. In the case of the inside-out patch-clamp configuration, we found that the Po of BKCa was not affected by the oligomers. In contrast to the oligomers, the monomers and amyloid fibrils of K18 Delta 280 had no effect on the channel activity, analyzed in inside-out as well as outside-out modes. Noteworthy, upon incubation with N1, the oligomers did not inhibit BKCa channel. The BKCa channel inhibition, dependent on the outside-out membrane orientation, implies specific interaction of the oligomers with the extracellular part of the channel. Moreover, our results suggest that N1 can convert the neurotoxic oligomers of Tau into a form which is not able to inhibit the channel, and indicate novel possible neuroprotective mechanism of PrP action in AD and other tauopathies.

AB  - Invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS) is a rare disease that requires careful attention and prompts management due to its high mortality among pediatric patients with hematological malignancies. This is a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with hematological malignancies treated at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57 357 (CCHE) through the period from 2008 till 2016 with proven IFS. Thirty-four patients were diagnosed with IFS. Five (15%) patients had an invasive rhino-cerebral fungal disease. Mucorales were isolated in 50% (n = 17) patients, Aspergillus in 38% (n = 13) patients, and mixed fungal in 12% (n = 4) patients. Sinuses were the only localized site in (45%). Extra-nasal spread was reported in 20 patients; Sino-pulmonary in 35% (n = 12), sino-cerebral in 15% (n = 5), and sino-orbital in 5% (n = 2) patients. Combined antifungal therapy with surgical debridement was done in 59% of patients with a better outcome when compared to those who received only medical antifungal treatment (P = .01). The overall mortality rate at week 12 was 35% (n = 12), and IFS attributable mortality was 20% (n = 7). IFS with cerebral extension carried the highest mortality rate for both 12-week all-cause (P = .04) and fungal-attributable (P = .01) mortality. Pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies are susceptible to invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS). Surgical debridement, combined with antifungal therapy, improves outcomes among those patients. IFS patients with cerebral extension had a higher risk of mortality. Lay Summary We studied the characteristics of invasive fungal sinusitis in children with hematological malignancies. Mucormycosis was the most common cause. Surgical debridement, combined with anti-fungal therapy, improves outcomes. Patients with rhino-cerebral fungal disease had a higher risk of mortality.

AB  - Microplastic pollution has become a major global concern. Coastal areas are densely populated with human activity, commercial enterprises, and fishing, resulting in high incidences of fish microplastic pollution. It has been shown that microplastics exist in commercial fish in coastal areas of Guangdong, China. Most of the microplastics were less than 1 mm, white and blue fibers. The abundance, type, shape and color of microplastics in gills and in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of eight species of commercial fish in the coastal waters of central and western Guangdong Province were analyzed. The overall abundance of microplastic particles in fish was 6.6 items/individual, with an average of 2.2 particles in gills and 4.4 in the GIT. The GIT of carnivorous fish was less likely to ingest microplastics than that of herbivores or omnivores. Middle-water fish, on the other hand, are less likely to have their gills contaminated with microplastics. These results revealed the degree of microplastic pollution in fish tissues from the central and western coastal areas of Guangdong province. The quantity of microplastics in the GIT of fish in the Pearl River Delta was the highest compared with the surrounding areas.

AB  - Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is a critical gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. SORL1 contributes to the development and progression of this neurodegenerative condition by affecting the transport and metabolism of intracellular beta-amyloid precursor protein. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of SORL1 in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, in this study, we established a mouse model of Sorl1 gene knockout using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 technology. We found that Sorl1-knockout mice displayed deficits in learning and memory. Furthermore, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly downregulated in the hippocampus and cortex, and amyloid beta-protein deposits were observed in the brains of Sorl1-knockout mice. In vitro, hippocampal neuronal cell synapses from homozygous Sorl1-knockout mice were impaired. The expression of synaptic proteins, including Drebrin and NR2B, was significantly reduced, and also their colocalization. Additionally, by knocking out the Sorl1 gene in N2a cells, we found that expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NR2B, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein was also inhibited. These findings suggest that SORL1 participates in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease by regulating the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B/cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein signaling axis.

AB  - The adult dentate gyrus (DG) of rodents hosts a neural stem cell (NSC) niche capable of generating new neurons throughout life. The embryonic origin and molecular mechanisms underlying formation of DG NSCs are still being investigated. We performed a bulk transcriptomic analysis on mouse developing archicortex conditionally deleted for Sox9, a SoxE transcription factor controlling both gliogenesis and NSC formation, and identified Hopx, a recently identified marker of both prospective adult DG NSCs and astrocytic progenitors, as being downregulated. We confirm SOX9 is required for HOPX expression in the embryonic archicortex. In particular, we found that both NSC markers are highly expressed in the cortical hem (CH), while only weakly in the adjacent dentate neuroepithelium (DNE), suggesting a potential CH embryonic origin for DG NSCs. However, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that the embryonic CH, as well as its adult derivatives, lacks stem cell potential. Instead, deletion of Sox9 in the DNE affects both HOPX expression and NSC formation in the adult DG. We conclude that HOPX expression in the CH is involved in astrocytic differentiation downstream of SOX9, which we previously showed regulates DG development by inducing formation of a CH-derived astrocytic scaffold. Altogether, these results suggest that both proteins work in a dose-dependent manner to drive either astrocytic differentiation in CH or NSC formation in DNE.

AB  - Background: As highlighted in the OliveNet (TM) library, Olea europaea consists of a diverse collection of chemical compounds. We have classified over 600 compounds into 13 main classes and 47 subclasses. Various compounds, including oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, have been investigated for their potential beneficial effects in multiple human pathologies. However, the vast majority of compounds remain largely unexplored and approximately 50% are currently non-commercially available.
   Method: Here, we utilise conventional software to characterise the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile of OliveNet (TM) compounds. Molecular docking was performed for assessment of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition and interactions with the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel. Potential hERG ion channel inhibition was calibrated using in vitro patch clamp assays and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were used to examine membrane permeability of a subset of compounds.
   Results: Our findings indicated that 313 out of 675 olive compounds were predicted to be absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Hydroxytyrosol required the least amount of force to pass through the lipid bilayer compared to elenolic acid diglucoside in SMD simulations. Based on the ADMET and molecular docking data, the hERG inhibitory activities of verbascoside, oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol were investigated using patch clamp assays and they were identified as non-inhibitors.
   Conclusions: While the favourable properties of well-known compounds were confirmed, we identified oleuropein aglycone decarboxymethyl dialdehyde acetal form, decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde, acetal of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde, methyl malate-p-hydroxytyrosol ester, hydroxytyrosil elenolate, D-(+)-erythro-1-(4 hydroxy-3-methoxy)-214-phenyl-1,2,3 propantriol, (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol-4 ''-O-methyl ether, and 3-[1-(hydroxymethyl)-(E)-1-propenyl] glutaric acid as potential candidates for synthesis and further evaluation.

AB  - Several mutations on neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) have been shown to cause neurological disorders and contribute to the initiation of epileptic seizures, migraines, or cerebellar degeneration. Analysis of the functional consequences of these mutations mainly uses heterologously expressed mutated channels or transgenic mice which mimic these pathologies, since direct electrophysiological approaches on brain samples are not easily feasible. We demonstrate that mammalian voltage-gated Ca2+ channels from membrane preparation can be microtransplanted into Xenopus oocytes and can conserve their activity. This method, originally described to study the alteration of GABA receptors in human brain samples, allows the recording of the activity of membrane receptors and channels with their native post-translational processing, membrane environment, and regulatory subunits. The use of hippocampal, cerebellar, or cardiac membrane preparation displayed different efficacy for transplanted Ca2+ channel activity. This technique, now extended to the recording of Ca2+ channel activity, may therefore be useful in order to analyze the calcium signature of membrane preparations from unfixed human brain samples or normal and transgenic mice.

AB  - Recently, disease-associated variants of the TUBA4A gene were identified in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we present the neuropathological report of a patient with the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia with a family history of Parkinsonism, harboring a novel frameshift mutation c.187del (p.Arg64Glyfs*90) in TUBA4A. Immunohistochemistry showed abundant TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) dystrophic neurite pathology in the frontal and temporal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, consistent with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The observed pathology pattern fitted best with that of FTLD-TDP Type C. qPCR showed the presence of mutant TUBA4A mRNA. However, no truncated TUBA4A was detected at the protein level. A decrease in total TUBA4A mRNA and protein levels suggests loss-of-function as a potential pathogenic mechanism. This report strengthens the idea that N-terminal TUBA4A mutations are associated with FTLD-TDP. These N-terminal mutations possibly exert their pathogenic effects through haploinsufficiency, contrary to C-terminal TUBA4A mutations which are thought to disturb the microtubule network via a dominant-negative mechanism.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The total flavonoids of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (TFH) exert significant antioxidant effects against hypoxia, which decreases the hematological index of high-altitude polycythemia (HAPC) mice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to explore the targets and pathways of TFH in inhibiting excessive erythropoiesis in HAPC mice. Materials and methods: Comprehensive techniques, including biochemical index detection, morphological examination, proteomics, and western blotting, were used to explore the targets and pathways through which TFH inhibits excessive erythropoiesis in HAPC mice. Results: Gene ontology annotation of differentially expressed proteins identified substantial enrichment in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic processes, mitochondrial assembly, and aerobic oxidation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed enrichment in peroxisome chemicals, carcinogenesis-ROS, and oxidative phosphorylation. Western blotting demonstrated that the expression of Sestrin1 (Sesn1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) increased, whereas that of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) decreased. Conclusions: TFH could promote HIF-2 alpha protein degradation by activating the Sesn1/Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway to scavenge ROS, thereby inhibiting erythropoietin (Epo) production.

AB  - Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is an olive polyphenol with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate the effect of HT treatment on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in primary human respiratory epithelial cells (RECs) isolated from human nasal turbinate. HT dose-response study and growth kinetic study on RECs was performed. Several approaches on HT treatment and TGF beta 1 induction with varying durations and methods was studied. RECs morphology and migration ability were evaluated. Vimentin and E-cadherin immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting [E-cadherin, vimentin, SNAIL/SLUG, AKT, phosphorylated (p)AKT, SMAD2/3 and pSMAD2/3] were performed after 72-h treatment. In silico analysis (molecular docking) of HT was performed to evaluate the potential of HT to bind with the TGF beta receptor. The viability of the HT-treated RECs was concentration-dependent, where the median effective concentration (EC50) was 19.04 mu g/mL. Testing of the effects of 1 and 10 mu g/mL HT revealed that HT suppressed expression of the protein markers vimentin and SNAIL/SLUG while preserving E-cadherin protein expression. Supplementation with HT protected against SMAD and AKT pathway activation in the TGF beta 1-induced RECs. Furthermore, HT demonstrated the potential to bind with ALK5 (a TGF beta receptor component) in comparison to oleuropein. TGF beta 1-induced EMT in RECs and HT exerted a positive effect in modulating the effects of EMT.

AB  - Understanding the physiology and molecular mechanisms of lactogenesis is crucial for enhancing mammalian milk production. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) regulated mammary epithelial cell survival during pregnancy, but its role in lactation maintenance remains unclear. We found that YAP1 was highly expressed in mammary gland across specie, with elevated expression levels during murine gestation and lactation, particularly localized in alveoli epithelial cells. In vivo administration of a YAP1 inhibitor impaired murine milk yield, mammary gland weight, alveolar structure, and mammary epithelial cell dynamics. In vitro, YAP1 positively affected mammary epithelial cell growth and the synthesis of triglyceride and alpha-casein. Notably, the primary lactogenesis hormone Prolactin induced cell growth and triglyceride secretion while enhancing YAP1 expression and activity. In contrast, Melatonin inhibited cell growth and triglyceride synthesis, decreasing YAP1 expression and activity. YAP1 knockdown compromised prolactin induced effects, whereas YAP1 overexpression partially rescued cell functions inhibited by melatonin. Finally, Bioinformatics analyses revealed that YAP1 regulated multiple biological processes related to lactogenesis, including cell cycle, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum, amino acid transport and biosynthesis, etc. These finding indicated that YAP1 is essential for mammary epithelial cells growth and secretion and played an essential role in the lactating endocrine network by mediating key hormone functions.

AB  - Space radiation presents a substantial threat to travel beyond Earth. Relatively low doses of high-energy particle radiation cause physiological and behavioral impairments in rodents and may pose risks to human spaceflight. There is evidence that Fe-56 irradiation, a significant component of space radiation, may be more harmful to males than to females and worsen Alzheimer's disease pathology in genetically vulnerable models. Yet, research on the long-term, sex- and genotype-specific effects of Fe-56 irradiation is lacking. Here, we irradiated 4-month-old male and female, wild-type and Alzheimer's-like APP/PS1 mice with 0, 0.10, or 0.50 Gy of Fe-56 ions (1GeV/u). Mice underwent microPET scans before and 7.5 months after irradiation, a battery of behavioral tests at 11 months of age and were sacrificed for pathological and biochemical analyses at 12 months of age. Fe-56 irradiation worsened amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology, gliosis, neuroinflammation and spatial memory, but improved motor coordination, in male transgenic mice and worsened fear memory in wild-type males. Although sham-irradiated female APP/PS1 mice had more cerebral A beta and gliosis than sham-irradiated male transgenics, female mice of both genotypes were relatively spared from radiation effects 8 months later. These results provide evidence for sex-specific, long-term CNS effects of space radiation.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE) is a frequent medical emergency that can lead to a variety of neurological disorders, including cognitive impairment and abnormal neurogenesis. The aim of the presented study was the in vitro evaluation of potential neuroprotective properties of a new pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives compound C11, as well as the in vivo assessment of the impact on the neurogenesis and cognitive functions of C11 and levetiracetam (LEV) after pilocarpine (PILO)-induced SE in mice. The in vitro results indicated a protective effect of C11 (500, 1000, and 2500 ng/mL) on astrocytes under trophic stress conditions in the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test. The results obtained from the in vivo studies, where mice 72 h after PILO SE were treated with C11 (20 mg/kg) and LEV (10 mg/kg), indicated markedly beneficial effects of C11 on the improvement of the neurogenesis compared to the PILO control and PILO LEV mice. Moreover, this beneficial effect was reflected in the Morris Water Maze test evaluating the cognitive functions in mice. The in vitro confirmed protective effect of C11 on astrocytes, as well as the in vivo demonstrated beneficial impact on neurogenesis and cognitive functions, strongly indicate the need for further advanced molecular research on this compound to determine the exact neuroprotective mechanism of action of C11.

AB  - Prenatal stress (PNS) impairs the circadian rhythm of the sleep/wake cycle. The melatonin (MT) analogue Piromelatine (Pir) was designed for the treatment of insomnia. The present study aimed to explore effects of Pir on circadian rhythmicity, motor activity, and sleep structure in male and female rats with a history of prenatal stress (PNS). In addition, we elucidated the role of MT receptors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to ascertain the underlying mechanism of the drug. Pregnant rats were exposed to different stressors from day seven until birth. Piromelatine (20 mg/kg/day/14 days) was administered to young adult offspring. Home-cage locomotion, electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were conducted for 24 h. Offspring treated with vehicle showed sex-and phase-dependent disturbed circadian rhythm of motor activity and sleep/wake cycle accompanied by elevated rapid eye movement (REM) pattern and theta power and diminished non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and delta power. While Pir corrected the PNS-induced impaired sleep patterns, the MT receptor antagonist luzindol suppressed its effects in male and female offspring. In addition, Pir increased the BDNF expression in the hippocampus in male and female offspring with PNS. Our findings suggest that the beneficial effect of Pir on PNS-induced impairment of sleep/wake cycle circadian rhythm and sleep structure is exerted via activation of MT receptors and enhanced BDNF expression in the hippocampus in male and female offspring.

AB  - In previous studies, we found that dynorphin exerts antiepileptic effect by activating the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). However, the role of neuronal autophagy in dynorphin/KOR-mediated antiepileptic is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of dynorphin's antiepileptic effect by inhibiting autophagy and reducing neuronal apoptosis. Here, a pilocarpine-induced rat model of epilepsy was established and hippocampal neurons were treated with Mg2+-free exposed for epileptiform activity induction. The real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate messenger RNA and protein expression. The TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining and flow cytometry were used to analyze cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Neuron cells viability was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Immunofluorescent staining and green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 immunofluorescence were used to measure autophagy in vivo and in vitro. Results showed that overexpression of prodynorphin alleviated neuronal apoptosis, activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and inhibited neuronal autophagy in epileptic rats. Dynorphin inhibited Mg2+-free-induced seizure-like neuron apoptosis, partially reversing the effect of Mg2+-free on the mTOR signaling pathway and seizure-like neuron autophagy. Further, using rapamycin, we found that dynorphin inhibited Mg2+-free-induced seizure-like neuron autophagy and apoptosis by activating the mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, dynorphin inhibits autophagy by activating the mTOR signaling pathway and has a protective effect on epilepsy acute seizure and epilepsy-induced brain injury.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the cross-talk between mGlu1 and CB1 receptors in modulating GABA hippocampal output in whole-cell voltage clamp recordings in rat hippocampal acute slices, in organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and in gerbils subjected to global ischemia. CB1 receptor expression was studied using immunohistochemistry and the CA1 contents of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) were measured by LC-MS/MS. Our results show that mGlu1 receptor antagonists enhance sIPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells and the basal and ischemic hippocampal release of GABA in vivo in a manner that is mediated by CB1 receptor activation. In hippocampal slices exposed to OGD and in ischemic gerbils, mGlu1 receptor antagonists protected CA1 pyramidal cells against post-ischemic injury and this effect was reduced by CB1 receptor activation. OGD induced a transient increase in the hippocampal content of AEA and this effect is prevented by mGlu1 receptor antagonist. Finally, OGD induced a late disruption of CB1 receptors in the CA1 region and the effect was prevented when CA1 pyramidal cells were protected by mGlu1 antagonists. Altogether, these results suggest a cooperative interaction between mGlu1 receptors and the endocannabinoid system in the mechanisms that lead to post-ischemic neuronal death.

AB  - Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent mode of cell death caused by excessive oxidative damage to lipids. Lipid peroxidation is normally suppressed by glutathione peroxidase 4, which requires reduced glutathione. Cystine is a major resource for glutathione synthesis, especially in cancer cells. Therefore, cystine deprivation or inhibition of cystine uptake promotes ferroptosis in cancer cells. However, the roles of other molecules involved in cysteine deprivation-induced ferroptosis are unexplored. We report here that the expression of gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), an enzyme that cleaves extracellular glutathione, determines the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis at high cell density (HD). In glioblastoma cells expressing GGT1, pharmacological inhibition or deletion of GGT1 suppressed the cell density-induced increase in intracellular glutathione levels and cell viability under cystine deprivation, which were restored by the addition of cysteinylglycine, the GGT product of glutathione cleavage. On the other hand, cystine deprivation induced glutathione depletion and ferroptosis in GGT1deficient glioblastoma cells even at an HD. Exogenous expression of GGT1 in GGT1-deficient glioblastoma cells inhibited cystine deprivation-induced glutathione depletion and ferroptosis at an HD. This suggests that GGT1 plays an important role in glioblastoma cell survival under cystine-limited and HD conditions. We conclude that combining GGT inhibitors with ferroptosis inducers may provide an effective therapeutic approach for treating glioblastoma.

AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that disrupt the open reading frame and thus prevent production of functional dystrophin proteins. Recent advances in DMD treatment, notably exon skipping and AAV gene therapy, have achieved some success aimed at alleviating the symptoms related to progressive muscle damage. However, they do not address the brain comorbidities associated with DMD, which remains a critical aspect of the disease. The mdx52 mouse model recapitulates one of the most frequent genetic pathogenic variants associated with brain involvement in DMD. Deletion of exon 52 impedes expression of two brain dystrophins, Dp427 and Dp140, expressed from distinct promoters. Interestingly, this mutation is eligible for exon skipping strategies aimed at excluding exon 51 or 53 from dystrophin mRNA. We previously showed that exon 51 skipping can restore partial expression of internally deleted yet functional Dp427 in the brain following intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). This was associated with a partial improvement of anxiety traits, unconditioned fear response, and Pavlovian fear learning and memory in the mdx52 mouse model. In the present study, we investigated in the same mouse model the skipping of exon 53 in order to restore expression of both Dp427 and Dp140. However, in contrast to exon 51, we found that exon 53 skipping was particularly difficult in mdx52 mice and a combination of multiple ASOs had to be used simultaneously to reach substantial levels of exon 53 skipping, regardless of their chemistry (tcDNA, PMO, or 2'MOE). Following ICV injection of a combination of ASO sequences, we measured up to 25% of exon 53 skipping in the hippocampus of treated mdx52 mice, but this did not elicit significant protein restoration. These findings indicate that skipping mouse dystrophin exon 53 is challenging. As such, it has not yet been possible to answer the pertinent question whether rescuing both Dp427 and Dp140 in the brain is imperative to more optimal treatment of neurological aspects of dystrophinopathy.

AB  - Purpose: Physical exercise mitigates the effects of aging and cognitive decline. However, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of exercise on age-related memory deficits in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus using bioinformatic analysis and biochemical verification. Methods: Young and aging mice were subjected to natural feeding or treadmill exercise (12 m/min, 8 weeks). Cognitive function was accessed using the Barnes maze and novel object recognition. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify co-expressed genes in different groups and brain regions. The selected genes and pathways were validated using RT-qPCR. Results: Regular exercise significantly ameliorated age-related cognitive deficits. Four up-regulated targets (Ifi27l2a, Irf7, Oas1b, Ifit1) and one down-regulation (Septin2) were reversed by exercise, demonstrating the underlying mechanisms of cognitive functions induced by aging with exercise in the hippocampus and PFC. The Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was inhibited in the neuroinflammation effects of exercise in aging mice in both brain regions. Conclusion: Exercise enhances age-related learning and memory deficits. This beneficial effect may be attributed to the changes in five up/down-regulated genes and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in both the hippocampus and PFC. These findings establish the modulation of neuroinflammation as a pivotal molecular mechanism supporting exercise intervention in the brain aging process.

AB  - Termites build complex nests which are an impressive example of self-organization. We know that the coordinated actions involved in the construction of these nests by multiple individuals are primarily mediated by signals and cues embedded in the structure of the nest itself. However, to date there is still no scientific consensus about the nature of the stimuli that guide termite construction, and how they are sensed by termites. In order to address these questions, we studied the early building behavior of Coptotermes gestroi termites in artificial arenas, decorated with topographic cues to stimulate construction. Pellet collections were evenly distributed across the experimental setup, compatible with a collection mechanism that is not affected by local topography, but only by the distribution of termite occupancy (termites pick pellets at the positions where they are). Conversely, pellet depositions were concentrated at locations of high surface curvature and at the boundaries between different types of substrate. The single feature shared by all pellet deposition regions was that they correspond to local maxima in the evaporation flux. We can show analytically and we confirm experimentally that evaporation flux is directly proportional to the local curvature of nest surfaces. Taken together, our results indicate that surface curvature is sufficient to organize termite building activity and that termites likely sense curvature indirectly through substrate evaporation. Our findings reconcile the apparently discordant results of previous studies.

AB  - The hippocampus contains neurons that correspond to two partially non-overlapping sets of positive and negative engrams, which may be distinguished by molecular, cellular, and projection-specific features.
   The hippocampus is involved in processing a variety of mnemonic computations specifically the spatiotemporal components and emotional dimensions of contextual memory. Recent studies have demonstrated cellular heterogeneity along the hippocampal axis. The ventral hippocampus has been shown to be important in the processing of emotion and valence. Here, we combine transgenic and all-virus based activity-dependent tagging strategies to visualize multiple valence-specific engrams in the vHPC and demonstrate two partially segregated cell populations and projections that respond to appetitive and aversive experiences. Next, using RNA sequencing and DNA methylation sequencing approaches, we find that vHPC appetitive and aversive engram cells display different transcriptional programs and DNA methylation landscapes compared to a neutral engram population. Additionally, optogenetic manipulation of tagged cell bodies in vHPC is not sufficient to drive appetitive or aversive behavior in real-time place preference, stimulation of tagged vHPC terminals projecting to the amygdala and nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not the prefrontal cortex (PFC), showed the capacity drive preference and avoidance. These terminals also were able to change their capacity to drive behavior. We conclude that the vHPC contains genetically, cellularly, and behaviorally segregated populations of cells processing appetitive and aversive memory engrams.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) is an omnipresent mineral element in the environment. The brain is a central target of Al toxicity, being highly susceptible to oxidative damage. Therefore, recognition of drugs or natural products that guard against Al-mediated neuronal cell death is a powerful strategy for prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. This work aimed to explore the potential of a leaf extract from Harrisonia abyssinica to modulate the neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological activities induced experimentally by Al in vivo. Rats subjected to Al treatment displayed a reduction in learning and memory performance in a passive avoidance test accompanied by a decrease in the hippocampal monoamine and glutamate levels in addition to suppression of Bcl2 expression. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta), apoptotic markers (caspase-3 and expression of Bax) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) levels were elevated along with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, histological changes and marked deposition of amyloid beta plaques in the hippocampus region of the brain tissues being observed in Al-treated animals. Concomitant administration of the high dose of H. abyssinica (200 mg/kg b.w.) restored nearly normal levels of all parameters measured, rather than the low dose (100 mg/kg b.w.), an effect that was comparable to the reference drug (rivastigmine). Molecular docking revealed the appropriate potential of the extract components to block the active site of AChE and ERK2. In conclusion, H. abyssinica leaf extract conferred neuroprotection against Al-induced neurotoxic effects, most likely due to its high phenolic and flavonoid content.

AB  - Stress influences episodic memory formation via noradrenaline and glucocorticoid effects on amygdala and hippocampus. A common finding is the improvement of memory for central aspects of a stressful episode. This is putatively related to changes in the neural representations of specific experiences, i.e., their memory traces. Here we show that the memory improvement for objects that were encountered in a stressful episode relates to differences in the neural representations of these objects in the amygdala. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that stress specifically altered the representations of central objects: compared to control objects, they became more similar to one another and more distinct from objects that were not part of this episode. Furthermore, higher similarity of central objects to the main stressor-the faces of the stress inducing committee members-predicted better memory. This suggests that the central objects were closely integrated into a stressor-centered memory representation. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how stress shapes the memory trace and have profound implications for neurocognitive models of stressful and emotional memory.

AB  - The inflammatory mechanisms of environmental pollutants in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have recently been proposed. However, the mechanisms underlying the inflammatory effects of particulate matter (PM) on nasal polyp (NP) tissues remain unknown. Here we investigated the mechanism underlying the inflammatory effects of PM10 on human nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs). We isolated NPDFs from human NP tissues obtained from patients with CRS with NPs (CRSwNP). The NPDFs were exposed to PM10 in vitro. Immunologic characteristics were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and flow cytometry. Additionally, we investigated the effect of NPDF-conditioned media (CM) on the expression of CD4(+) T cell inflammatory mediators. PM10-treated NPDFs significantly upregulated interleukin (IL)-6, IL-4, and IL-33 expression and CXCL1 protein levels than PM10-treated normal tissues. MAP kinase, AP-1, and NF-kB were the primary cell signaling proteins. Immune cells in NPDF-CM had elevated IL-13, IL-17A, and IL-10 expression, but no significant difference in IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-4 expression. Moreover, under a Th2 inducing condition, NPDF-CM-treated CD4(+) T cells had increased expression of IL-13, IL-10, and IL-17, which was reversed on ST2 inhibitor addition. Our study suggests that PM10 exposure could significantly increase the Th2 inflammatory pathway in NP tissues, specifically the IL-33/ST2 pathway-mediated immune response.

AB  - In recent decades, study of the actions of bioactive lipids such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has increased since they are involved in regulating many processes, including self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, embryo development and cancer. Phospholipid phosphatase type 3 (PLPP3) has been shown to be a key player in regulating the balance of these lipids and, in consequence, their signaling. Different lines of evidence suggest that PLPP3 could play a role in endoderm development. To approach this hypothesis, we used mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) as a model to study Plpp3 function in self-renewal and the transition towards differentiation. We found that lack of PLPP3 mainly affects endoderm formation during differentiation of suspension-formed embryoid bodies. PLPP3-deficient ESC strongly decrease the amount of FOXA2-expressing cells and fail to properly downregulate the expression of pluripotency factors when subjected to an endoderm-directed differentiation protocol. Impaired endoderm differentiation correlated with a transient reduction in nuclear localization of YAP1. These phenotypes were rescued by transiently restoring the expression of catalytically active hPLPP3. In conclusion, PLPP3 plays a role in downregulating pluripotency-associated factors and in endodermal differentiation. PLPP3 regulates proper lipid/YAP1 signaling required for endodermal differentiation.

AB  - Endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling is markedly decreased in the hippocampus (Hip) of aged mice, and the genetic deletion of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) leads to an early onset of cognitive decline and age-related histological changes in the brain. Thus, it is hypothesized that cognitive aging is modulated by eCB signaling through CB1. In the present study, we detailed the changes in the eCB system during the aging process using different complementary techniques in mouse brains of five different age groups, ranging from adolescence to old age. Our findings indicate that the eCB system is most strongly affected in middle-aged mice (between 9 and 12 months of age) in a brain region-specific manner. We show that 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) was prominently decreased in the Hip and moderately in caudate putamen (CPu), whereas anandamide (AEA) was decreased in both CPu and medial prefrontal cortex along with cingulate cortex (mPFC+Cg), starting from 6 months until 12 months. Consistent with the changes in 2-AG, the 2-AG synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGL alpha) was also prominently decreased across the sub-regions of the Hip. Interestingly, we found a transient increase in CB1 immunoreactivity across the sub-regions of the Hip at 9 months, a plausible compensation for reduced 2-AG, which ultimately decreased strongly at 12 months. Furthermore, quantitative autoradiography of CB1 revealed that [H-3]CP55940 binding markedly increased in the Hip at 9 months. However, unlike the protein levels, CB1 binding density did not drop strongly at 12 months and at old age. Furthermore, [H-3]CP55940 binding was significantly increased in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEnt), starting from the middle age until the old age. Altogether, our findings clearly indicate a middle-age crisis in the eCB system, which could be a potential time window for therapeutic interventions to abrogate the course of cognitive aging.

AB  - Dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) mechanisms are implicated in psychiatric diseases characterized by cognitive deficits, including schizophrenia, ADHD, and autism. The cellular mechanisms are poorly understood, but impaired neuronal synchronization in cortical networks was proposed to contribute to these deficits. In animal experiments, D4R activation was shown to generate aberrant increased gamma oscillations and to reduce performance on cognitive tasks requiring functional prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) networks. While fast oscillations in the gamma range are important for local synchronization within neuronal ensembles, long-range synchronization between distant structures is achieved by slow rhythms in the delta, theta, alpha ranges. The characteristics of slow oscillations vary between structures during cognitive tasks. HPC activity is dominated by theta rhythm, whereas PFC generates unique oscillations in the 2-4 Hz range. In order to investigate the role of D4R on slow rhythms, cortical activity was recorded in rats under urethane anesthesia in which slow oscillations can be elicited in a controlled manner without behavioral confounds, by electrical stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation. The local field potential segments during stimulations were extracted and subjected to fast Fourier transform to obtain power density spectra. The selective D4R agonist A-412997 (5 and 10 mg/kg) and antagonists L-745870 (5 and 10 mg/kg) were injected systemically and the peak power in the two frequency ranges were compared before and after the injection. We found that D4R compounds significantly changed the activity of both HPC and PFC, but the direction of the effect was opposite in the two structures. D4R agonist enhanced PFC slow rhythm (delta, 2-4 Hz) and suppressed HPC theta, whereas the antagonist had an opposite effect. Analogous changes of the two slow rhythms were also found in the thalamic nucleus reuniens, which has connections to both forebrain structures. Slow oscillations play a key role in interregional cortical coupling; delta and theta oscillations were shown in particular, to entrain neuronal firing and to modulate gamma activity in interconnected forebrain structures with a relative HPC theta dominance over PFC. Thus, the results of this study indicate that D4R activation may introduce an abnormal bias in the bidirectional PFC-HPC coupling which can be reversed by D4R antagonists.

AB  - Due to an increasing number of patients at risk (i.e., those with a highly compromised immune system and/or receiving aggressive chemotherapy treatment), invasive fungal infections (IFI) are increasingly being reported and associated with high mortality rates. Aspergillus spp., particularly A. fumigatus, is the major cause of IFI caused by filamentous fungi around the world followed by Fusarium spp., however, other fungi are emerging as human pathogens. The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiology and prevalence of the non-Aspergillus and non-Fusarium filamentous fungi in human clinical samples over an 11-year period in Qatar using molecular techniques. We recovered 53 filamentous fungal isolates from patients with various clinical conditions. Most patients were males (75.5%), 9.4% were immunocompromised, 20.7% had IFI, and 11.3% died within 30 days of diagnosis. The fungal isolates were recovered from a variety of clinical samples, including the nasal cavity, wounds, respiratory samples, body fluids, eye, ear, tissue, abscess, and blood specimens. Among the fungi isolated, 49% were dematiaceous fungi, followed by Mucorales (30%), with the latter group Mucorales being the major cause of IFI (5/11, 45.5%). The current study highlights the epidemiology and spectrum of filamentous fungal genera, other than Aspergillus and Fusarium, recovered from human clinical samples in Qatar, excluding superficial infections, which can aid in the surveillance of uncommon and emerging mycoses.
   Lay Summary We recovered 53 non-Aspergillus and non-Fusarium filamentous fungal isolates from 53 patients in Qatar. Dematiaceous (black) fungi were the most isolated fungi followed by Mucorales, with the latter group Mucorales being the major cause of invasive infections in this study.

AB  - The brain undergoes ionizing radiation exposure in many clinical situations, particularly during radiotherapy for brain tumors. The critical role of the hippocampus in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced neurocognitive dysfunction is well recognized. The goal of this study is to test the potential contribution of non-targeted effects in the detrimental response of the hippocampus to irradiation and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. C57Bl/6 mice were whole body (WBI) or partial body (PBI) irradiated with 0.1 or 2.0 Gy of X-rays or sham irradiated. PBI consisted of the exposure of the lower third of the mouse body, whilst the upper two thirds were shielded. Hippocampi were collected 15 days or 6 months post-irradiation and a multi-omics approach was adopted to assess the molecular changes in non-coding RNAs, proteins and metabolic levels, as well as histological changes in the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis. Notably, at 2.0 Gy the pattern of early molecular and histopathological changes induced in the hippocampus at 15 days following PBI were similar in quality and quantity to the effects induced by WBI, thus providing a proof of principle of the existence of out-of-target radiation response in the hippocampus of conventional mice. We detected major alterations in DAG/IP3 and TGF-beta signaling pathways as well as in the expression of proteins involved in the regulation of long-term neuronal synaptic plasticity and synapse organization, coupled with defects in neural stem cells self-renewal in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. However, compared to the persistence of the WBI effects, most of the PBI effects were only transient and tended to decrease at 6 months post-irradiation, indicating important mechanistic difference. On the contrary, at low dose we identified a progressive accumulation of molecular defects that tended to manifest at later post-irradiation times. These data, indicating that both targeted and non-targeted radiation effects might contribute to the pathogenesis of hippocampal radiation-damage, have general implications for human health.

AB  - This paper explores the protective effect of alteplase-loaded dextran-polyacrylic acid nanoparticles on hippocampal neurons in stroke rats. We randomly divided 24 stroke rats into sham operation group, stroke group, stroke + alteplase group, stroke + alteplase-loaded dextran-polyacrylic acid nanoparticle intervention group. We used the HE stains method to detect the number of neurons in the hippocampus and calculate the survival rate of neurons under an inverted microscope. The survival rates of neurons in the sham operation group, stroke group, alteplase group, and nanoparticle group were 100%, 11.0%, 16.6%, and 57.6%. The ischemic encephalopathy group and the neuron survival rates of the general enzyme group and the nanoparticle group were lower than that of the sham operation group. The neuron survival rate of the nanoparticle group was higher than that of the stroke group and alteplase group (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the alteplase group and the stroke group.

AB  - There are significant concerns about the risks to human health posed by metal(loid) contamination in dietary fishes in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate heavy metal(loid) contamination in fish and their associated health risks using published data from 2000 to 2022. Additionally, the safe limit of fish consumption was estimated using the target hazard quotient (THQ) followed by computational modelling and artificial neural networks (ANN). Results showed that freshwater and herbivorous fishes pose the least non-cancer risks, whereas saltwater and carnivorous fishes pose the highest non-cancer risks to Bangladeshi consumers. However, freshwater and omnivorous fish consumption pose the highest cancer risks compared to all studied metal(loid)s. In particular, among the heavy metal(loid)s, As, Cr, Hg, and Ni pose significant cancer and non-cancer risks to Bangladeshi consumers. On the contrary, the ANN and Decision tree regression (DTR) characterized the dataset, simulation model, or data testing condition, reaching 94.7% accuracy and allowing us to measure the safest fish consumption limit. The herbivorous fishes are less contaminated and allow greater consumption (175.09 g day-1). Contrarily, the allowable intake rates of carnivorous and omnivorous fishes are 153.05 and 168.63 g day-1, respectively. Besides, the safe consumption rate of saltwater fishes was 156.51 g day-1, which was lower than freshwater (180.59 g day-1) and euryhaline fishes (182.17 g day-1). Therefore, this study will assist fish consumers in selecting less contaminated fish, ensuring safe consumption levels, and ultimately reducing health risks associated with metal(loid) contamination in fish.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Modified Danzhi Xiaoyao San (MDXS) is an effective clinical prescription for depression in China, which was deprived of Danzhi Xiaoyao San in the Ming Dynasty. MDSX has significant implications for the development of new antidepressants, but its pharmacological mechanism has been rarely studied. Aim of the study: To reveal the active components and molecular mechanism of MDXS in treating depression through network pharmacology and experimental verification in vivo and in vitro. Materials and methods: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to identify the chemical components in the MDXS freezedried powder, drug-containing serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Based on the analysis of prototype components in the CSF, the major constituents, potential therapeutic targets and possible pharmacological mechanisms of MDXS in treating depression were investigated using network pharmacological and molecular docking. Then corticosterone (CORT)-induced mice model of depression was established to investigate the antidepressant effects of MDXS. HT22 cells were cultured to verify the neuroprotective effects and core targets of the active components. Results: There were 81 compounds in MDXS freeze-dried powder, 36 prototype components in serum, and 13 prototype components in CSF were identified, respectively. Network pharmacology analysis showed that these 13 prototype components in the CSF shared 190 common targets with depression, which were mainly enriched in MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. PPI analysis suggested that AKT1 and MAPK1 (ERK1/2) were the core targets. Molecular docking revealed that azelaic acid (AA), senkyunolide A (SA), atractylenolide III (ATIII), and tokinolide B (TB) had the highest binding energy with AKT1 and MAPK1. Animal experiments verified that MDXS could reverse CORT-induced depression-like behaviors, improve synaptic plasticity, alleviate neuronal injury in hippocampal CA3 regions, and up-regulate the protein expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT. In HT22 cells, azelaic acid, senkyunolide A, and atractylenolide III significantly protected the cell injury caused by CORT, and up-regulated the protein levels of p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT. Conclusions: These results suggested that MDXS may exert antidepressant effects partially through azelaic acid, senkyunolide A, and atractylenolide III targeting ERK1/2 and AKT.

AB  - Background Spreading depression (SD) is an intriguing phenomenon characterized by massive slow brain depolarizations that affect neurons and glial cells. This phenomenon is repetitive and produces a metabolic overload that increases secondary damage. However, the mechanisms associated with the initiation and propagation of SD are unknown. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that persistent and uncontrolled opening of hemichannels could participate in the pathogenesis and progression of several neurological disorders including acute brain injuries. Here, we explored the contribution of astroglial hemichannels composed of connexin-43 (Cx43) or pannexin-1 (Panx1) to SD evoked by high-K+ stimulation in brain slices.Results Focal high-K+ stimulation rapidly evoked a wave of SD linked to increased activity of the Cx43 and Panx1 hemichannels in the brain cortex, as measured by light transmittance and dye uptake analysis, respectively. The activation of these channels occurs mainly in astrocytes but also in neurons. More importantly, the inhibition of both the Cx43 and Panx1 hemichannels completely prevented high K+-induced SD in the brain cortex. Electrophysiological recordings also revealed that Cx43 and Panx1 hemichannels critically contribute to the SD-induced decrease in synaptic transmission in the brain cortex and hippocampus.Conclusions Targeting Cx43 and Panx1 hemichannels could serve as a new therapeutic strategy to prevent the initiation and propagation of SD in several acute brain injuries.

AB  - Objective. Our previous results showed that icariin (ICA) could inhibit apoptosis and provide neuroprotection against hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in neonatal mice, but the specific mechanism of its neuroprotective effect remains unknown. This study aims at exploring whether ICA plays a neuroprotective role in apoptosis inhibition by regulating autophagy through the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha)/estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) pathway in neonatal mice with HIBD. Methods. A neonatal mouse model of HIBD was constructed in vivo, and an oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) model in HT22 cells from the hippocampal neuronal system was constructed in vitro. The effects of ICA pretreatment on autophagy and the expression of ER alpha and ER beta were detected in vitro and in vivo, respectively. ICA pretreatment was also supplemented with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), ER alpha inhibitor methylpiperidino pyrazole (MPP), and ER beta inhibitor 4-(2-phenyl-5,7-bis (trifluoromethyl) pyrazolo [1,5-a] pyramidin-3-yl) phenol (PHTPP) to further detect whether ICA pretreatment can activate the ER alpha/ER beta pathway to promote autophagy and reduce HIBD-induced apoptosis to play a neuroprotective role against HIBD in neonatal mice. Results. ICA pretreatment significantly promoted autophagy in HIBD mice. Treatment with 3-MA significantly inhibited the increase in autophagy induced by ICA pretreatment, reversed the neuroprotective effect of ICA pretreatment, and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, ICA pretreatment significantly increased the expression levels of the ER alpha and ER beta proteins in HIBD newborn mice. Both MPP and PHTPP administration significantly inhibited the expression levels of the ER alpha and ER beta proteins activated by ICA pretreatment, reversed the neuroprotective effects of ICA pretreatment, inhibited the increase in autophagy induced by ICA pretreatment, and promoted apoptosis. Conclusion. ICA pretreatment may promote autophagy by activating the ER alpha and ER beta pathways, thus reducing the apoptosis induced by HIBD and exerting a neuroprotective effect on neonatal mice with HIBD.

AB  - Oil-tea (Camellia oleifera), a typical oilseed tree, produces high-quality edible vegetable oils that contain rich unsaturated fatty acids and diverse lipid-soluble active compounds such as squalene. Although squalene biosynthesis and its molecular regulation have been studied in several plants, the molecular mechanisms underlying squalene biosynthesis in oil-tea seeds remain uncertain. We investigated and determined squalene accumulation with seed development. We conducted comparative transcriptomic analyses using the RNA-seq technique at the early, fast biosynthesis, and late stages of squalene accumulation with oil-tea seed development and identified 13 squalene biosynthesis key enzyme genes (such as CoHMGR_4, CoAACT_2, CoFPS_1, and CoFPS_2) in developing oil-tea seeds. According to whether the expressions of key enzyme genes were associated with squalene accumulation we found that the precursor IPP of squalene biosynthesis obtained via the MVA pathway was dominant with oil-tea seed development. Based on the gene co-expression analyses, we identified multiple transcription factors potentially involved in regulating squalene biosynthesis such as CoMYC2, CoREM39, CobZIP5, CoERF and CoWRKY. Using yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assay experiments we demonstrated that the transcription factor CoMYC2 could activate the expression of a key enzyme gene CoHMGR_4, suggesting that CoMYC2 might be a critical regulator during squalene biosynthesis in oil-tea seed development. This study gives not only insights into understanding the molecular basis of squalene biosynthesis in oil-tea developing seeds but also provides gene resources for developing genetically improved varieties with higher content of squalene in oil-tea.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder characterized by motor, psychiatric, cognitive, and peripheral symptoms without effective therapy. Evidence suggests that lifestyle factors can modulate disease onset and progression, and environmental enrichment (EE) has emerged as a potential approach to mitigate the progression and severity of neurodegenerative processes. Wild-type (WT) and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) 128 mice were exposed to different EE conditions. Animals from cohort 1 were exposed to EE between postnatal days 21 and 60, and animals from cohort 2 were exposed to EE between postnatal days 60 and 120. Motor and non-motor behavioral tests were employed to evaluate the effects of EE on HD progression. Monoamine levels, hippocampal cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and dendritic arborization were also assessed. Here we show that EE had an antidepressant-like effect and slowed the progression of motor deficits in HD mice. It also reduced monoamine levels, which correlated with better motor performance, particularly in the striatum. EE also modulated neuronal differentiation in the YAC128 hippocampus. These results confirm that EE can impact behavior, hippocampal neuroplasticity, and monoamine levels in YAC128 mice, suggesting this could be a therapeutic strategy to modulate neuroplasticity deficits in HD. However, further research is needed to fully understand EE's mechanisms and long-term effects as an adjuvant therapy for this debilitating condition.

AB  - TEA domain family members (TEADs) play important roles in tumor progression. Till now, the genomic status of TEADs in patients with glioma has not been well investigated. To confirm whether the genomic status of TEADs could affect the prognosis of patients with glioma, the copy number variation (CNV), mutation and expression data of glioma cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas were comprehensively analyzed. Results showed that TEAD CNV frequency in lower grade gliomas (LGGs) was higher than in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that TEAD4 CNV increase was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and diseasefree survival (DFS) in LGGs (OS p = 0.022, HR = 1.444, 95% CI: 1.054-1.978; DFS p = 0.005, HR = 1.485, 95% CI: 1.124-1.962), while not in GBM. Patients with TEAD4 CNV increase showed higher expression level of TEAD4 gene. In LGG patients with IDH mutation, those with higher TEAD4 expression levels had shorter OS and DFS. Integrating TEAD4 CNV increase, IDH mutations, TP53 mutation, ATRX mutation and 1p19q co-deletion would separate patientswith LGGinto four groupswith significant differences in prognosis. These study results suggested that TEAD4 variations were independent predictive biomarkers for the prognosis in patients with LGG with IDH mutation.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) seeds, especially their bran, contain a significant amount of monosaccharides and polysaccharides (gums). A decortication procedure was used for improving gum isolation as well as increasing the efficiency of camelina protein isolation and protein quality. The effects of bran-to-water ratio (1:30, 1:40, and 1:50 g/mL), isolation temperature (25, 50, and 75 degrees C), isolation time (0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 h), and their interactions on gum yield, purity, and rheological properties were studied. Response surface methodology was used to determine the optimal condition for isolating gums from the bran of camelina seed. Gum yield, purity, and viscosity data fit the second-order model (R-2 = 0.995, 0.877, and 0.804) better than the first-order model (R-2 = 0.813, 0.568, and 0.636). Regression results from the second-order model showed that bran-to-water ratio, isolation temperature, and isolation time all had significant effect on gum yield, purity, and viscosity. The optimal gum isolation condition was found to be: bran-to-water ratio: 1:39 g/mL; isolation temperature: 35 degrees C; and isolation time: 1.5 h. Under these conditions, gum yield, purity, and viscosity were 19.08% (w/w), 56.24% (w/w), and 62.80 Pa.s, respectively. The maximum predicted value of all three responses was 0.839. The yield and quality of protein extracted from decorticated endosperm were significantly improved over those from whole seed meal.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zhi-Zi-Chi decoction (ZZCD), a famous classical prescription of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has long been used for depression treatment, but its detailed molecular anti-depression mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. Aim of the study: To explore the antidepressant properties and potential mechanisms of ZZCD in ameliorating depression-like behavior through network pharmacology and in vivo experimental validation. Materials and methods: A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mouse depressive model was established in this present study. The sucrose preference test (SPT) and tail suspension test (TST) were performed to assess the antidepressant effects of ZZCD. In addition, the underlying molecular mechanisms of ZZCD against depression were dissected using an integrated network pharmacology approach, and these predicted results were verified in a mouse depressive model. Subsequently, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, neurotransmitters, genes or proteins associated with potential targets as well as the related proteins of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways were measured using ELISA kits, RT-qPCR, and Western blot. Results: ZZCD effectively ameliorated CUMS-induced depressive behavior of mice. Treatments with ZZCD at doses of 3 and 6 g/kg obviously improved the sucrose preference rate in the SPT and attenuated the accumulated immobility time in the TST of CUMS mice. This was accompanied by a decrease in inflammatory factor levels and restoration of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the hippocampi. The network informatics results revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, AKT1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 might be the potential targets of ZZCD against depression. Correspondingly, an in vivo experiment verified that treatment with ZZCD upregulated the protein expression levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR related to the PI3K/ AKT/mTOR pathway and reversed the mRNA expression levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and AKT1 in the hippocampi. Conclusion: Our research suggested that ZZCD had antidepressant effects in CUMS-induced depressive mice. The mechanisms underlying the effects of ZZCD against depression were associated with the modulation of inflammatory factor levels as well as related genes or protein expression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Accordingly, ZZCD might serve as a clinically promising TCM prescription for depression treatment.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Epimedium brevicornu Maxim. is a traditional medicinal Chinese herb that is enriched with flavonoids, which have remarkably high medicinal value. Icariin (ICA) is a marker compound isolated from the total flavonoids of Epimedium brevicornu Maxim. It has been shown to improve Neurodegenerative disease, therefore, ICA is probably a potential drug for treating AD. Materials and methods: The 6-8-week-old SPF-class male ICR mice were randomly divided into 8 groups for modeling, and then the mice were administered orally with ICA for 21 days. The behavioral experiments were conducted to evaluate if learning and memory behavior were absent in mice, confirming that infusion of Amyloid beta-protein (A beta) (1-42) caused significant memory impairment. The morphological changes and damage of neurons in the mice's brains were observed by HE and Nissl staining. The spinous protrusions (dendritic spines) on neuronal dendrites were investigated by Golgi-Cox staining. The molecular mechanism of ICA was examined by Western Blot. The protein docking of ICA and Donepezil with BDNF were analyzed to determine their interaction. Results: The behavioral experimental results showed that in A beta(1-42)-induced AD mice, the learning and memory abilities were improved after using ICA. At the same time, the low, medium, and high doses of ICA could reduce the content of A beta(1- 42) in the hippocampus of AD mice, repair neuronal damage, enhance synaptic plasticity, as well as increase the expression of BDNF, Tr.B, CREB, Akt, GAP43, PSD95, and SYN proteins in the hippocampus of mice. However, the effect with high doses of ICA is more pronounced. The high-dose administration of ICA has the best therapeutic effect on AD mice. After administering the inhibitor k252a, the therapeutic effect of ICA was reversed. The macromolecular docking results of ICA and BDNF protein demonstrated a strong interaction of -7.8 kcal/mol, which indicates that ICA plays a therapeutic role in AD mice by regulating the BDNF-Tr kappa B signaling pathway. Conclusions: The results confirm that ICA can repair neuronal damage, enhance synaptic plasticity, as well as ultimately improve learning and memory impairment through the regulation of the BDNF-Tr kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Shuxuening injection (SXNI) is a Chinese medicine of Ginkgo biloba L. leaves extract (GBE), which is widely used clinically for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction, but the pharmacological mechanism of its therapeutic effect is not fully understood. Aim of the study: Preclinical studies suggested that inhibition of neuronal apoptosis effectively improves brain damage after ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of SXNI on neuronal apoptosis in post-stroke mice and its underlying mechanism. Materials and methods: A mouse cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) model was constructed by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and treated with 3 mL/kg SXNI. TUNEL and immunohistochemistry experiments were performed on brain slices on the 7th day after stroke. The protein was extracted from the hippocampus region of the brain for western-blot assay. To simulate the in vivo ischemia-reperfusion process, the hippocampal neuron cell line HT-22 was subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro, and 200 mu g/mL SXNI was administered. The HT-22 cells were then studied by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Results: In vivo, SXNI treatment significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry showed that SXNI inhibited the activation of Caspase-3 protein in the hippocampus after ischemic stroke. Western blot analysis further confirmed that SXNI regulated the expression of the antagonizing protein pair Bax and Bcl-2 to exert anti-apoptotic effect in addition to reducing the expression of Cleaved-Caspase-3 in the hippocampus. In vitro, 200 mu g/mL SXNI treatment significantly improved HT-22 apoptosis caused by OGD/R. Further RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry study showed that 200 mu g/mL SXNI inhibited apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by regulating the mRNA and protein expressions of apoptotic molecules Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase3. Conclusions: CIRI can induce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, which is inhibited by SXNI via regulating Bax/Bcl2 and blocking Caspase-3 activation. Therefore, SXNI may be a promising treatment strategy to improve the prognosis of ischemic stroke.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental epoch characterized by massive neural circuit remodeling; thus, the brain is particularly vulnerable to environmental influences during this period. Excessive high-fat diet (HFD) consumption, which is very common among adolescents, has long been recognized as a potent risk factor for multiple mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the influences of HFD consumption in adolescence on emotional health are far from clear. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (CD) or HFD for about 4 weeks from postnatal day (P) 28 to P60, spanning most of the adolescence period, and then subjected to behavioral assessments and histological examinations. HFD mice exhibited elevated levels of depression and anxiety, decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, and excessive microglial activation in the ventral hippocampus. Furthermore, in HFD-fed mice, microglia showed increased DCX+ inclusions, suggesting aberrant microglial engulfment of newborn neurons in HFD-fed adolescents. To our knowledge, this is the first observation suggesting that the negative effects of HFD consumption in adolescence on emotion and neuroplasticity may be attributed at least in part to aberrant microglial engulfment of nascent neurons, extending our understanding of the mechanism underlying HFD-related affective disorders in young people.

AB  - Objectives: Diabetes has a negative effect on learning and memory performance, and it is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and dementia development. The present study aims to investigate the effects of two kinds of endurance exercise including high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) as well as metformin on impaired memory and learning related to streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes in rats.Methods: Forty adult male rats (250 +/- 20 g weight) were divided into five groups (n=8), including control, diabetic, as well as diabetic rats treated with metformin (300 mg/kg), and HIIT (20 m/min), and MICT (15 m/min) exercises. Diabetes was induced by STZ (60 mg/kg, i.p.). Serum glucose concentration and oxidative stress markers (SOD, CAT, thiol, and MDA) in the cortex and hippocampus were determined by colorimetric assay. Behavioral tests were performed with a passive avoidance test.Results: The diabetic groups treated with metformin and both HIIT, and MICT exercises improved the latency and the staying time in the darkroom and lightroom. The entrance frequency into the darkroom also was restored (p < 0.01-p < 0.001). In both HIIT and MICT exercises as well as metformin groups the oxidative stress induced by diabetes has been reversed and attenuation of the serum glucose level has been observed compared to non-treated diabetic ones (p < 0.05-p < 0.001).Conclusions: The results of the present study revealed both HIIT and MICT exercises had protective effects against oxidative stress and behavioral impairments induced by diabetes and these effects were comparable to the effects of metformin.

AB  - Background: EM-2, a natural sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Elephantopus mollis H.B.K., showed a good anti-breast cancer effect when combined with epirubicin (EPI). However, its synergistic sensitization mechanism remains unclear.
   Purpose: This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effect and possible synergistic mechanism of EM-2 with EPI in vivo and in vitro and to provide an experimental basis for the treatment of human breast cancer.
   Methods: Cell proliferation was measured with MTT and colony formation assays. Apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were examined through flow cytometry, and the expression levels of proteins related to apoptosis, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and DNA damage were detected through Western blot analysis. Moreover, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid, and ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine were applied to verify signaling pathways. Breast cancer cell lines were used to evaluate the antitumor functions of EM-2 and EPI in vitro and in vivo.
   Results: We demonstrated that in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells, the IC50 of EPI combined with EM-2 (IC20) was 37.909 and 33.889 times lower than that of EPI alone, respectively. Further study verified that in EPI-resistant lines (MDA-MB-231/EPI), the IC50 of EPI combined with EM-2 (IC20) was 26.305 times lower than that of EPI alone. Mechanistically, EM-2 could reverse the protective effect of EPI against autophagy in SKBR3 and MDAMB-231 cells. EM-2 and EPI could trigger ER stress. When EM-2 and EPI were used in combination, ER stress was continuously activated, and ER stress-mediated apoptosis was induced. Meanwhile, EM-2 combined with EPI promoted DNA damage then induced apoptosis. In vivo, the volume of breast cancer xenografts in the combination group was smaller than that in the control, EM-2, and EPI groups. Immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that the combination of EM-2 and EPI could block autophagy and promote ER stress in vivo.
   Conclusion: EM-2 enhances the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, and EPI-resistant cells to EPI.

AB  - BACKGROUNDSelenium-enriched tea represents an ideal source of selenium supplements, yet its effects on mice with intestinal disorders remain under-documented. Therefore, we have carried out relevant research.METHODSWe determined the main chemical components of selenium-enriched green tea and evaluated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of selenium-enriched green tea extract and changes in intestinal flora of antibiotic-induced intestinal disease mice through BALB/c mouse experiments.RESULTSThe main chemical components of selenium-enriched green tea and green tea are significantly different. Selenium-enriched green tea is characterized by a high selenium content, with tea polyphenols, flavonoids, tea polysaccharides and catechins being the primary constituents. The results of animal experiments indicate that the extract of green tea rich in selenium increased the content of antioxidant factors in the intestines of mice and reduced the levels of intestinal inflammatory factors. This was also confirmed by mRNA gene expression determination. In addition, selenium-enriched green tea extracts can reduce the weight loss and intestinal pathological damage induced by antibiotics, promote the colonization of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the intestinal tract of mice and inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus in the intestinal tract.CONCLUSIONSelenium-enriched green tea has high nutritional content. It demonstrates superior potential in alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses caused by intestinal diseases, and plays a role in regulating the intestinal flora.

AB  - (1) Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and it is now widely accepted that neuroinflammation plays a key role in its pathogenesis. Eriodictyol (Eri) and homoeriodictyol (Horn), dihydroflavonoids extracted from a variety of plants, have been confirmed to display a relationship with neuroprotection. (2) Methods: An AD mouse model was constructed by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of the A beta(25-35) peptide, and Eri and Hom were administered orally for 4 weeks. UPLC-MS/MS was used to determine whether Eri and Hom cross the blood-brain barrier to exert their therapeutic effects. Histological changes in the brain and levels of A beta were evaluated, and Y-maze and new object recognition experiments were conducted to assess the effects of Eri and Hom on A beta(25-35)-induced memory impairment in mice. The levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis in peripheral immune cells and progenitor cells in the hippocampal region were analyzed by flow cytometry and in vitro assays. Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure the expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins and inflammatory factors in the brain. The effect of nigericin (an agonist of the NLRP3 inflammasome) on Eri and Hom intervention in LPS-induced N9 microglia was examined using a High Content Screening System. (3) Results: Eri and Horn reduced neuronal damage in mouse brain tissue, decreased A beta levels in the brain, downregulated oxidative stress and apoptosis levels, and improved learning and memory capacity by crossing the blood-brain barrier to exert its effects. Moreover, Eri and Horn inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorated immune cell disorder. Furthermore, the effect of Eri and Horn on LPS-induced N9 microglia disappeared after the addition of nigericin to agonize NLRP3 receptors. (4) Conclusions: Eri and Horn improved A beta(25-35)-induced memory impairment in mice by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome.

AB  - When you perceive or remember something, other related things come to mind, affecting how these competing items are subsequently perceived and remembered. Such behavioural consequences are believed to result from changes in the overlap of neural representations of these items, especially in the hippocampus. According to multiple theories, hippocampal overlap should increase (integration) when there is high coactivation between cortical representations. However, prior studies used indirect proxies for coactivation by manipulating stimulus similarity or task demands. Here, we induce coactivation in visual cortex more directly using closed-loop neurofeedback from real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While viewing one object, participants were rewarded for activating the representation of another object as strongly as possible. Across multiple real-time fMRI sessions, participants succeeded in using this neurofeedback to increase coactivation. Compared with a baseline of untrained objects, this protocol led to memory integration in behaviour and the brain: the trained objects became harder for participants to discriminate behaviourally in a categorical perception task and harder to discriminate neurally from patterns of fMRI activity in their hippocampus as a result of losing unique features. These findings demonstrate that neurofeedback can be used to alter and combine memories.This article is part of the theme issue 'Neurofeedback: new territories and neurocognitive mechanisms of endogenous neuromodulation'.

AB  - Background: Aging is an inevitable gradual process of the body, which can cause dysfunction or degeneration of the nervous or immune system, thus becoming a critical pathogenic factor inducing neurodegenerative diseases. Previous reports have confirmed that saponins (ginsenosides) derived from Panax ginseng. C.A. Meyer exerted obvious memory-enhancing and anti-aging effects, and the simpler the structure of ginsenosides, the better the biological activity. Ginsenoside Rg2 (Rg2) is a prominent and representative panaxatriol-type ginsenoside produced during ginseng processing, which has been reported to have pretty good neuroprotective activity.
   Purpose: The work was aimed at exploring the therapeutic effects and possible molecular mechanisms of Rg2 by establishing the subacute brain aging model induced by D-galactose (D-gal) in mice.
   Methods: The anti-aging activity of G-Rg2 (10, 20 mg/kg for 4 weeks) was assessed using the D-gal induced brain aging model (800 mg/kg for 8 weeks). The Morris water maze (MWM) and histopathological analysis were used to evaluate the cognitive function and pathological changes of the brain in mice, respectively. The protein expression levels of p53, p21, p16ink4 alpha, IL-6, CDK4, ATG3, ATG5, ATG7, LC3, p62, LAMP2, and TFEB were quantified through western blot analysis. The degree of mitochondrial damage and the number of mitochondrial autophagolysosomes in hippocampal neurons were monitored using TEM analysis.
   Results: The results showed that Rg2 could significantly restore D-gal-induced impaired memory function, choline dysfunction, and redox system imbalance in mice. Rg2 treatment also considerably decreased the over-expression of aging-related proteins such as p53/p21/p16ink4 alpha induced by D-galactose, which demonstrated that Rg2 possessed good anti-aging activity. Meanwhile, Rg2 could evidently reduce the pathological changes caused by D-gal exposure. Moreover, the results from transmission electron microscopy and western blot analysis indicated that Rg2 could delay the brain aging induced by D-gal in mice via promoting the degradation of the autophagy substrate p62 while increasing the protein expression level of LAMP2/TFEB to maintain mitochondrial function.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that Rg2 could postpone brain aging by increasing mitochondrial autophagy flux to maintain mitochondrial function, which greatly enriched the research on the pharmacological activity of ginsenosides for delaying brain aging.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The polyherbal mixture made of Centaurium erythraea aerial parts and Cichorium intybus roots and Potentilla erecta rhizomes has been used for centuries to treat both the primary and secondary complications of diabetes.Aim of the study: As a continuation of our search for the most effective herbal mixture used as an ethno-pharmacological remedy for diabetes, this study aimed to compare the in vitro biological activities of this polyherbal mixture and its individual ingredients, and, most importantly, to validate the ethnopharmacological value of the herbal mixture through evaluation of its phytochemical composition, its potential in vivo toxicity and its effect on diabetes complications. Materials and methods: Phytochemical analysis was performed using HPLC-UV. Antioxidant activity was esti-mated via the DPPH test. Potential cytotoxicity/anticytotoxicity was assessed using an in vitro RBCs anti-hemolytic assay and an in vivo sub-chronic oral toxicity method. Antidiabetic activity was evaluated using an in vitro & alpha;-amylase inhibition assay and in vivo using a chemically induced diabetic rat model. Results: The HPLC-UV analysis revealed the presence of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid deriva-tive, catechin, five catechin derivatives, epicatechin, isoquercetin, hyperoside, rutin, four quercetin derivatives, caffeic acid, and four caffeic acid derivatives in the polyherbal mixture decoction. Treatment with the decoction has shown no toxic effects. The antioxidant and cytoprotective activities of the polyherbal mixture were higher than the reference's ones. Its antidiabetic activity was high in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Fourteen days of treatment with the decoction (15 g/kg) completely normalized blood glucose levels of diabetic animals, while treatments with insulin and glimepiride only slightly lowered glycemic values. In addition, lipid status of treated animals as well as levels of serum AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, urea and MDA were completely normalized. In addition, the polyherbal mixture completely restored the histopathological changes of the liver, kidneys and all four Cornu ammonis regions of the hippocampus. Conclusions: The polyherbal mixture was effective in the prevention of both primary and secondary diabetic complications such as hyperlipidemia, increased lipid peroxidation, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, nephropathy and neurodegeneration.

AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest cigarette smoking as a probable environmental factor for a variety of congenital anomalies, including low bone mass, increased fracture risk and poor skeletal health. Human and animal in vitro models have confirmed hypomineralization of differentiating cell lines with sidestream smoke being more harmful to developing cells than mainstream smoke. Furthermore, first reports are emerging to suggest a differential impact of conventional versus harm-reduction tobacco products on bone tissue as it develops in the embryo or in vitro. To gather first insight into the molecular mechanism of such differences, we assessed the effect of sidestream smoke solutions from Camel (conventional) and Camel Blue (harm-reduction) cigarettes using a human embryonic stem cell osteogenic differentiation model. Sidestream smoke from the conventional Camel cigarettes concentration-dependently inhibited in vitro calcification triggered by high levels of mitochondrially generated oxidative stress, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ATP production. Camel sidestream smoke also induced DNA damage and caspase 9-dependent apoptosis. Camel Blue-exposed cells, in contrast, invoked only intermediate levels of reactive oxygen species insufficient to activate caspase 3/7. Despite the absence of apoptotic gene activation, damage to the mitochondrial phenotype was still noted concomitant with activation of an anti-inflammatory gene signature and inhibited mineralization. Collectively, the presented findings in differentiating pluripotent stem cells imply that embryos may exhibit low bone mineral density if exposed to environmental smoke during development.

AB  - Ethnopharmacologic significance: Cognitive impairment is a serious clinical manifestation of Wilson's disease (WD) in the nervous system. Gandouling (GDL) is a hospital preparation of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Chinese Medicine. Previous studies have found that GDL has an ameliorative effect on cognitive impairment in WD. Aim of the study: We aimed to explore the molecular-level regulatory mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in WD, and provide evidence supporting GDL as a promising candidate drug for the treatment of cognitive impairment in WD. We found that GSK3 beta was significantly up-regulated in the brain tissue of C3HeAtp7Btx-J/J (tx-j) mice in the WD gene mutant model, and the monomer components of GDL could combine well with GSK3 beta. Therefore, in this work, we used Behavioral tests, Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Nissl and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-biotin nick end labeling(TUNEL) staining, Ultrastructural morphological observation by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), bisulfite sequencing (BSP), Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blot, immunofluorescence, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and related methods to study the effects of GDL in tx-j mice and HT22 cell to clarify the effect of GDL on cognitive impairment in WD. Results: In this study, MWM, NOR, H&E, Nissl TUNEL and TEM results showed that GDL could promote the repair of learning and memory function, improve the morphological damage to hippocampal neurons, and maintain mitochondria integrity. In the HT22 cell experiment, the CCK-8 method showed that GDL increased the viability of copper-overloaded cell models. The study found that GSK3 beta may be a target of GDL for the treatment of WD cognitive impairment through network pharmacology. Western blot and qRT-PCR results confirmed that GDL significantly increased the expression of proteins and mRNA in DNMT1, Nrf2, and HO-1. BSP showed that GSK3 beta promoter methylation was lower in the Model group than in the control group, and the promoter methylation of GSK3 beta was further reduced after intraperitoneal injection with decitabine, and GDL could ameliorate this pathology. Conclusion: GDL demonstrates a protective role by inducing GSK3 beta promoter methylatio, regulating the GSK3 beta/ Nrf2 signaling pathway in WD.

AB  - With the ability to survive under drought and chronic hunger, camels display a unique regulation characteristic of lipid metabolism. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 is a peptide hormone that regulates metabolic pathways, especially lipid metabolism, which was considered as a promising therapeutic target for metabolic diseases. To understand the FGF21 expression pattern and its potential relationship with lipid metabolism in camels, this study investigated the distribution and expression of FGF21, receptor FGFR1, and two lipid metabolism markers, leptin and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. The results showed that FGF21 was widely expressed in camel central nerve tissue and peripheral organs but absent in lung and gametogenic tissue, including the testis, epididymis, and ovary. In striated muscle, FGF21 is only present at the fiber junction. FGFR1 is expressed in almost all tissues and cells, indicating that all tissues are responsive to FGF21 and other FGF-mediated signals. Leptin and HSL are mainly located in metabolic and energy-consuming organs. In the CNS, leptin and HSL showed a similar expression pattern with FGFR1. In addition, leptin expression is extremely high in the bronchial epithelium, which may be due to its role in the immune responses of respiratory mucosa, in addition to fat stores and energy balance. This study found that FGF21 showed active expression in the nervous system of camels, which may be related to the adaptability of camels to arid environments and the specific regulation of lipid metabolism. This study showed a special FGF21-mediated fat conversion pattern in camels and provides a reference for developing a potential therapeutic method for fat metabolism disease.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Shenling Baizhu San (SLBZS) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula composed of 10 medicinal herbs, historically used to strengthen the spleen, replenish qi, and alleviate fatigue- related symptoms. SLBZS originates from the 'Taiping Huimin Heji Ju Fang' of the Song Dynasty. Central fatigue (CF), a subtype of fatigue, is considered in TCM to be closely associated with spleen deficiency. However, there is currently a lack of research on SLBZS's therapeutic effects on CF and the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its potential benefits. Aim of the study: This study aims to assess the effects of SLBZS on CF in rats induced by the Modified Multiple Platform Method (MMPM) and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, focusing on mitochondrial biogenesis and SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha pathway regulation. Materials and methods: CF was induced in male Wistar rats using MMPM, involving intermittent sleep deprivation over 21 days. SLBZS was administered at low(LSLBZS), medium(MSLBZS), and high doses(HSLBZS). Chemical components of SLBZS were identified and quantified using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Behavioral tests evaluated physical performance, emotional state, and cognitive function, while serum biochemical markers, mitochondrial morphology, and the protein and gene expression levels of the SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha pathway were analyzed to explore underlying mechanisms. Results: A total of 141 main compounds in SLBZS were identified, comprising various components such as flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, among others. SLBZS significantly improved physical performance, alleviated negative emotions, and enhanced cognitive function in CF rats. Biochemically, SLBZS increased serum ATP levels and reduced fatigue-related markers. Mitochondrial analysis demonstrated that SLBZS reversed mitochondrial degeneration, increased mitochondrial number, and increased mtDNA copy number in the hippocampus. Furthermore, SLBZS upregulated SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha pathway expression at both the protein and gene levels in the hippocampus. Notably, the HSLBZS group demonstrated particularly pronounced effects. Conclusion: SLBZS significantly alleviates CF symptoms enhances mitochondrial function via upregulating the SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha pathway, positioning it as a promising alternative for CF management by addressing both its physiological and symptomatic aspects.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), a fatal neurodegenerative disease, arises due to a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Non-pathogenic wild type HTT (wtHTT) is essential for neurodevelopment as well as many vital cellular functions within the adult brain; however, the consequences of wtHTT reduction in adulthood and particularly in extrastriatal regions of the brain have not been well characterized. Understanding the implications of wtHTT loss is essential as numerous genetic therapies for HD non-specifically reduce the expression levels of both mutant and wtHTT. The aim of the current study was to characterize the effect of wtHTT reduction from the whole cell to synaptic level in primary hippocampal neurons using conventional and super-resolution imaging methods. Our results identified the nucleus as an organelle that is particularly vulnerable to wtHTT reduction, with hippocampal neurons exhibiting increased nuclear size relative to the soma, DNA decompaction and a progressive loss of heterochromatin, and biphasic changes in nuclear pCREB signaling following siRNA-mediated wtHTT knockdown. Other structural assessments including dendritic complexity, spine density and synaptic morphology appeared to be largely unaffected in our wtHTT-lowered cells. These findings highlight the nucleus as an organelle that may be particularly sensitive to huntingtin-lowering in the mammalian brain.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides and hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins. Evidence indicates that AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) share pathophysiological characteristics, including impaired insulin sensitivity. Large-leaf yellow tea (LYT) has been widely recognized for its health benefits, and we previously found that LYT can improve peripheral insulin resistance.
   Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of LYT in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD.
   Methods: HPLC and spectrophotometric methods determined the chemical composition of the LYT extract. 5xFAD mice were treated with LYT supplementation (2 and 4 mg/ml) in drinking water for six months. Barnes and Y mazes were used to evaluate cognitive function, and the open field test assessed anxiety-like behavior. Immunofluorescence, silver, and Nissl staining were used to evaluate the pathological effects of LYT extract. A FRET based assay assessed beta-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity, ELISA measured A beta levels in the brain, and Western blot analyses explored protein expression levels.
   Results: Our results revealed that LYT significantly attenuated memory impairment and anxiety levels and alleviated cerebral neural damage. A reduction of senile plaques was also observed in both the cortex and hippocampus. LYT significantly inhibited the activity of BACE1, which resulted in a lower A beta protein level. In addition, LYT enhanced insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-mediated phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT), further suppressed glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta), and ultimately inhibited hyperphosphorylation of the protein Tau. The inhibitory effect of the LYT extract on the phosphorylation of Tau and BACE1 activity was dose-dependent.
   Conclusion: LYT improves cognitive ability and reduces A beta production by inhibiting BACE1 activity. Decreases of Tau protein hyperphosphorylation upon LYT treatment appear to be associated with the regulation of the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK3 beta axis. Thus, the findings of this study also provide new evidence that LYT regulates insulin signaling pathways within the central nervous system.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Depression is a public health problem. Despite the availability of treatment options, its prevalence is increasing. A high rate of treatment failure is often reported, along with considerable side effects associated with synthetic antidepressants. Therefore, developing effective and safe antidepressants from traditional herbs or natural products as an alternative strategy is warranted to avoid side effects and in-crease drug efficacy. In traditional medicine, cardamom has traditionally been used to treat conditions like asthma, tooth and gum infections, cataracts, nausea, diarrhea, and even depression and anxiety as well as some problems with the heart, kidneys, and digestive system.Aim of the study: The current study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant activity of cardamom oil in a rat model of depression induced by reserpine and compare it with the activity of the antidepressant drug fluoxetine.Materials and methods: Depression-like symptoms were induced in male rats by daily i. p. injection of reserpine (0.2 mg/kg/d for 15 d followed by 0.1 mg/kg/d for 21 d to maintain the depressive state), and the rats were treated with cardamom oil (oral dose = 200 mg/kg/d) for 21 d along with the maintenance dose of reserpine. We performed behavioral tests (forced swimming test and open-field test) and evaluated biochemical markers of depression.Results: Our findings revealed that cardamom oil attenuated depression-like symptoms in reserpine-injected rats by improving the behavioral changes measured by the forced swimming test and the locomotor activities measured by the open-field test. In reserpine-injected rats, cardamom oil exerted antidepressant-like effects by modulating lower levels of brain monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), GSH, and higher oxido-nitrosative stress parameters (malondialdehyde and nitric oxide). Moreover, cardamom oil alleviated depression-like behaviors by lowering monoamine oxidase activity and raising the activities of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase and levels of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the cortex and hippocampus.Conclusion: We recommend the use of cardamom oil as a safe and reliable treatment or an adjuvant for preventing depression-like symptoms in patients suffering from depression.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Invigorating blood circulation to remove blood stasis is a primary strategy in TCM for treating vascular dementia (VaD). Danggui-Shaoyao San (DSS), as a traditional prescription for neuroprotective activity, has been proved to be effective in VaD treatment. However, its precise molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Aim of the study: The specific mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of DSS on VaD was explored by employing network pharmacology as well as in vivo and in viro experiment validation. Materials and methods: We downloaded components of DSS from the BATMAN-TCM database for target prediction. The intersection between the components of DSS and targets, PPI network, as well as GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were then performed. Subsequently, the potential mechanism of DSS predicted by network pharmacology was assessed and validated through VaD rat model induced by 2VO operation and CoCl2-treated PC12 cells. Briefly, the DSS extract were first quantified by HPLC. Secondly, the effect of DSS on VaD was studied using MWM test, HE staining and TUNEL assay. Finally, the molecular mechanism of DSS against VaD was validated by Western blot and RT-QPCR experiments. Results: Through network analysis, 137 active ingredients were obtained from DSS, and 67 potential targets associated with DSS and VaD were identified. GO and KEGG analysis indicated that the action of DSS on VaD primarily involves hypoxic terms and HIF-1 pathway. In vivo validation, cognitive impairment and neuron mortality were markedly ameliorated by DSS. Additionally, DSS significantly reduced the expression of proteins related to synaptic plasticity and neuron apoptosis including PSD-95, SYP, Caspase-3 and BCL-2. Mechanistically, we confirmed DSS positively modulated the expression of HIF-1 alpha and its downstream proteins including EPO, pEPOR, STAT5, EPOR, and AKT1 in the hippocampus of VaD rats as well as CoCl2-induced PC12 cells. HIF-1 inhibitor YC-1 significantly diminished the protection of DSS on CoCl2-induced PC12 cell damage, with decreased HIF-1 alpha, EPO, EPOR expression. Conclusion: Our results initially demonstrated DSS could exert neuroprotective effects in VaD. The pharmacological mechanism of DSS may be related to its positive regulation on HIF-1 alpha/EPO pathway.

AB  - In melanoma, a switch from a proliferative melanocytic to an invasive mesenchymal phenotype is based on dramatic transcriptional reprogramming which involves complex interactions between a variety of signaling pathways and their downstream transcriptional regulators. TGF beta/SMAD, Hippo/YAP/TAZ, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways are major inducers of transcriptional reprogramming and converge at several levels. Here, we report that TGF beta/SMAD, YAP/TAZ, and beta-catenin are all required for a proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch. Loss and gain of function experimentation, global gene expression analysis, and computational nested effects models revealed the hierarchy between these signaling pathways and identified shared target genes. SMAD-mediated transcription at the top of the hierarchy leads to the activation of YAP/TAZ and of p-catenin, with YAP/TAZ governing an essential subprogram of TGF beta-induced phenotype switching. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is situated further downstream and exerts a dual role: it promotes the proliferative, differentiated melanoma cell phenotype and it is essential but not sufficient for SMAD or YAP/TAZ-induced phenotype switching. The results identify epistatic interactions among the signaling pathways underlying melanoma phenotype switching and highlight the priorities in targets for melanoma therapy.

AB  - BackgroundTraumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health concern worldwide. With wide clinical demands, therapies for TBI are far from satisfactory. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) exhibits neuroprotective effects on multiple neurological disorders, which may present a viable therapeutic opportunity in TBI.ObjectiveTo investigate the mechanism of (Dex) in repairing behavioral deficits in a mouse model of TBI.MethodsThis study investigated the potential role of Dex in cerebral TBI using controlled cortical impact (CCI)-injured mice and stretch-damaged HT22 cells. Behavioral tests were used to observe the behavioral changes of mice, the brain edema of mice was measured, and the permeability of blood-brain barrier was detected by Evans blue. Nissl staining was used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampus of the injured brain tissue of mice, and TUNEL staining was used to evaluate the apoptosis of neurons. The effects of Dex on HT22 cells were evaluated by CCK-8, LDH release assay and flow cytometry. Oxidative stress injury-related indicators SOD, GSH-Px, and MDA in brain tissue and cell supernatant were measured. miR-365a-3p and G3BP2 were detected by RT-qPCR, and G3BP2, Bax, Bcl-2 and Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by Western blot. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay were used to verify the targeting relationship between miR-365a-3p and G3BP2.ResultsDex effectively repaired behavioral deficits and improved brain edema, BBB permeability, neuronal apoptosis, and oxidative stress injury in TBI mice in a dose-dependent manner. Dex intervention significantly elevated cell viability and inhibited cytotoxicity, apoptosis and oxidative stress injury in cell injury model. miR-365a-3p was up-regulated by Dex, and miR-365a-3p targeted G3BP2. Silencing miR-365a-3p or overexpressing G3BP2 weakened protective effect of Dex on stretch-induced injury in HT22 cells. Dex activated the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway by mediating the miR-365a-3p/G3BP2 axis.ConclusionDex effectively repairs behavioral deficits in TBI mice, and its effects are associated with the up-regulation of miR-365a-3p to inhibit G3BP2 and regulate the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disease characterized by a supernumerary chromosome 21. Intellectual deficiency (ID) is one of the most prominent features of DS. Central nervous system defects lead to learning disabilities, motor and language delays, and memory impairments. At present, a prenatal treatment for the ID in DS is lacking. Subcutaneous administration of synthetic preimplantation factor (sPIF, a peptide with a range of biological functions) in a model of severe brain damage has shown neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties by directly targeting neurons and microglia. Here, we evaluated the effect of PIF administration during gestation and until weaning on Dp(16)1Yey mice (a mouse model of DS). Possible effects at the juvenile stage were assessed using behavioral tests and molecular and histological analyses of the brain. To test the influence of perinatal sPIF treatment at the adult stage, hippocampus-dependent memory was evaluated on postnatal day 90. Dp(16)1Yey pups showed significant behavioral impairment, with impaired neurogenesis, microglial cell activation and a low microglial cell count, and the deregulated expression of genes linked to neuroinflammation and cell cycle regulation. Treatment with sPIF restored early postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, with beneficial effects on astrocytes, microglia, inflammation, and cell cycle markers. Moreover, treatment with sPIF restored the level of DYRK1A, a protein that is involved in cognitive impairments in DS. In line with the beneficial effects on neurogenesis, perinatal treatment with sPIF was associated with an improvement in working memory in adult Dp(16)1Yey mice. Perinatal treatment with sPIF might be an option for mitigating cognitive impairments in people with DS.

AB  - Intensive livestock production has been subject to increasing public criticism, including a demand for more animal-friendly housing systems and transparency. Since animal welfare is a credence attribute which cannot be evaluated on the product itself, recently various labels have been introduced to help consumers make purchasing decisions according to their animal welfare concerns. However, such labels need to be accompanied by adequate information to reveal full market power. Research on how animal welfare labels should be communicated to improve efficiency is scarce. The aim of our study is therefore to investigate the impact of different information types on the understanding and evaluation, willingness to buy (WTB) and willingness to pay (WTP) for an animal-friendly product. We used a quantitative research approach with four experimental groups (n = 200). Each group (n = 50) was presented with one of four information types that differed regarding their immersive and innovative character and all provided information about the main label criteria: group 1 received text only, group 2 text and stable pictures, group 3 text and a 360 degrees stable video via tablet, group 4 text and a 360 degrees stable video via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Regardless of information type, participants' understanding of the label as well as their evaluation of animal welfare and acceptability of an exemplary stable presented improved after information was given. Furthermore, providing information positively influenced the WTB and WTP. Regarding user experience, stable insights via VR glasses were particularly appreciated, even though more simpler types were considered more favourable in terms of the usage at the point of sale (POS). We conclude that various information types can be promising to communicate certain label criteria. Both higher immersive and innovative as well as more simple information types help to make animal welfare efforts more appreciated and support consumers in decision making.

The results show that DISS improves cognitive ability, decreases the levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha, reduces the expression of NF-kappa B p65, and alleviates A beta deposition and nerve cell damage. DISS can regulate tyrosine kinase B (TrkB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling in the hippocampus. In summary, DISS can significantly alleviate neuroinflammation, spatial learning and memory disorders in AD model mice.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a perennial plant and a strong fluoride (F-) hyperaccumulator, requiring acidic soil for optimal growth and quality. Tea plants readily absorb F- from the growing medium because the soil in which tea is grown is acidic. Environmental factors (soil pH, geological sources, temperature, and rain fall) and human activities are the main contributors to F- in tea. We investigated the total F- content in 100 samples each of CTC and orthodox teas collected from the tea-growing regions of Northeast India. Comparatively, CTC (119.7 mu g/g) tea showed higher F- content than orthodox tea (76.39 mu g/g), with mean fluoride concentrations below European Commission Maximum Residue Limit (400 mg/kg). The non-carcinogenic anthropogenic risk from F- in tea was evaluated using Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) values, which were found to be < 1 for men, women, and children, with children showing higher F- intake from tea than adults. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) identified geogenic sources and industrial drilling as the main contributors to increased F- in tea. Additionally, a geostatistical tool using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and hot-spot analysis was developed to predict the spatial distribution and hot and cold spot patterns of F- in tea. This study significantly enhances the understanding of F- in tea from the Northeast region, indicating that contemporary Northeast Indian tea does not pose any F- related health hazards, though regular monitoring for any elemental contamination remains important for tea quality and production.

AB  - The application of these NIPAm-based temperature-sensitive hydrogels in wearable sensing is limited by the inability to achieve a long-lasting temperature response and adaptive optical regulation due to water loss in the hydrogel, the inability to avoid the phenomenon of detachment due to the external touch, and the mutual interference between temperature and stress signals. Here, sandwich-structured organogel sensors (SOGS) are prepared based on solvent modulation and interfacial fusion cross-linking strategies to achieve asymmetric-adhesion, adaptive optical regulation, and simultaneous sensing of human motion and temperature without interference between the sensing signals. Modulation of temperature-sensitive properties through hydrogen bonding between glycol and amide groups for long-term temperature sensing (10-30 degrees C) and adaptive infrared and ultraviolet regulation. Adhesive conductive organogel is introduced under the temperature-sensitive organogel by an interfacial fusion cross-linking strategy for unilateral interfacial adhesion (67.28 kPa for pig skin) and stress sensing. The intermediate interfacial layer prevents the mutual interference between temperature and stress sensing signals. In conclusion, the solvent modulation strategy provides a new idea for developing novel temperature responsive gels, and the interfacial fusion cross-linking strategy provides a facile method for developing unilaterally adherent, interference-resistant, and multifunctional wearable sensors.

AB  - BackgroundThe core clock gene brain and muscle ARNT like-1 (Bmal1) is involved in the regulation of bone tissue aging. However, current studies are mostly limited to the establishment of the association between Bmal1 and bone senescence, without in-depth exploration of its main upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms.MethodsThe luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR and Western blotting were performed to detect the interaction between miR-155-5p and Bmal1. The effects of miR-155-5p and Bmal1 on the aging and osteogenic differentiation ability of mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were investigated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, beta-gal staining, alkaline phosphatase quantitative assay and alizarin red staining in vitro. The potential molecular mechanism was identified by ChIP-Seq, RNA-seq database analysis and immunofluorescence staining.ResultsThe expression of Bmal1 declined with age, while the miR-155-5p was increased. miR-155-5p and Bmal1 repressed each other's expression, and miR-155-5p targeted the Bmal1. Besides, miR-155-5p inhibited the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, promoted cell apoptosis and senescence, inhibited the expression and nuclear translocation of YAP and TAZ. However, Bmal1 facilitated the osteogenic differentiation and suppressed the aging of BMSCs, meanwhile inactivated the Hippo pathway. Moreover, YAP inhibitors abrogated the positive regulation of aging and osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs by miR-155-5p and Bmal1.ConclusionIn mouse BMSCs, miR-155-5p and Bmal1 regulated the aging and osteogenic differentiation ability of BMSCs mainly through the Hippo signaling pathway. Our findings provide new insights for the interventions in bone aging.

AB  - Some of the statins have been shown to have antidepressant effects, but whether atorvastatin (AV) has antidepressant effects is unknown. This study was to investigate the effect of AV treatment on depressive behaviors. Herein, we show that AV treatment had antidepressant-like effect in physiological conditions and antidepressant effect in depressive state which depended on alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR) expression in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), but not alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 4 beta 2nAchR) expression in vHPC, nor the alpha 7nAChR and alpha 4 beta 2nAchR expression in dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). By using MLA, a selective alpha 7nAChR antagonist, we investigated the role of alpha 7nAChR in AV treatment. Behavior tests demonstrated that MLA abolished the antidepressant effect of AV. Besides, our data showed that AV treatment increased Alt phosphorylation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic related protein synapsin and spinophilin expression. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 reversed AV-induced increase of BDNF expression, newborn neurons and antidepressant behavior effects. Our study suggests that AV plays an antidepressant role by regulating synaptic plasticity of vHPC through PI3K/Akt-BDNF signaling pathway, which may be a good choice for depression treatment.

AB  - Persistent microglial inflammation is a detrimental contributor to the progression of Parkinson disease (PD) pathology and related issues such as impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and cognition. We conducted a 10-week exercise program with MPTP-treated mice to determine whether neuroinflammation can be addressed by aerobic exercise and elucidate its underlying regulatory mechanisms. Ten weeks of exercise significantly reduced PD-related pathology and enhanced AHN and memory. These changes were linked to a reduction in neuronal apoptosis, microglial inflammation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In cultured microglia, fibril alpha-synuclein reduced FNDC5/irisin protein levels and induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1 beta production, which could be diminished by recombinant irisin treatment. Interestingly, "runner serum" isolated from exercising rodents enhanced FNDC5/irisin expression and reduced NLRP3 inflammasome components and IL-1 beta secretion in alpha-synuclein-treated microglia. These effects could be diminished by blocking irisin signaling with cyclo RGDyk or NLRP3 agonist, nigericin sodium salt. Exercise-induced neuroprotective effects were weakened by treatment of MPTP-treated mice with cyclo RGDyk. In contrast, systematic administration of irisin partially replicated the beneficial effects of exercise on PD pathology, AHN, and memory function. As a nonpharmacological strategy, aerobic exercise effectively addresses PD pathology and preserves adult neurogenesis and cognition by mitigating microglial inflammation via mediating irisin/NLRP3 inflammasome pathways.

AB  - Silver selenide quantum dots (Ag2Se QDs) show great advantages in tumor imaging due to their excellent optical performance and good biocompatibility. However, the ultrasmall particle size of Ag2Se QDs allows them to cross the blood-brain barrier, thus potentially affecting the central nervous system. Therefore, risk assessment and response strategies for Ag2Se QDs are important. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework makes it possible to develop risk management strategies based on toxicity mechanisms. In this study, using the AOP framework, we constructed causal mechanism relationship diagrams at different biological levels of Ag2Se QD neurotoxicity. In this framework, excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) triggered Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in microglia was molecular initiation event (MIE). Proinflammatory mediator secretion and microglia activation were key events (KEs) at the cellular level. Neuroinflammation and neuronal damage were KEs at the organ/tissue level. Altered hippocampal physiology was the adverse outcome (AO) at the individual level. Based on the established AOP framework, further studies confirmed that mtROS-activated nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)- mitophagy contributed to weaken the MIE. Molecular docking-assisted molecular biology experiments demonstrated that quercetin (Qu) enhanced this process. This article emphasizes the importance of the AOP in the risk management of nanomaterials. Furthermore, this paper guides the use of natural small-molecule drugs as a strategy to mitigate nanomaterial-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are suitable substrate materials for soft neural interfaces due to their tunable elastic characteristics. The stability and biocompatibility of intracortical SMP probes are demonstrated. In this work, a SMP-based cortical implant capable of recording high-density micro-electrocorticography is utilized in a multimodal neuroimaging scheme. The transparent nature of thiol-ene/acrylate substrate is exploited, and the feasibility of measuring intracranial electroencephalogram and fluorescent GCaMP6 signals with two-photon imaging through the device is presented in mice. The potential influence of the optical properties of the microdevice is investigated using fluorescent microbeads, hippocampal brain slices, and awake animals. It is found that neurites and cell soma can be efficiently detected with sufficient resolution to follow changes in the calcium signal. These chronically implanted devices do not suppress the quality of optical signals exceeding 22 weeks after implantation. These results indicate that thiol-ene/acrylate ECoG is an appropriate tool to combine electrophysiology with two-photon imaging while leveraging the inherent tissue-friendly properties of SMPs.

AB  - Background: Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury induces neuronal ferroptosis and microglial phenotypic shifts, driving post-ischemic neurological deficits. This study examines the regulatory role of the N6methyladenosine (m6A) reader insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) in coordinating these pathological processes through Keap1/Nrf2 signaling. Methods: Cerebral I/R injury was modeled in C57BL/6 mice via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in hippocampal neurons and microglia through oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Proinflammatory microglial polarization was induced by LPS/IFN-gamma stimulation. IGF2BP1's functional impacts were assessed through knockdown and overexpression approaches, with mechanistic evaluations focusing on ferroptosis biomarkers, microglial polarization states, and Keap1/Nrf2 pathway activity. A microglia-neuron coculture system elucidated cellular crosstalk mechanisms. Results: MCAO-operated mice demonstrated upregulated IGF2BP1 expression accompanied by neuronal apoptosis and microglial M1 polarization. IGF2BP1 silencing significantly attenuated OGD/R-induced neuronal ferroptosis, evidenced by reduced iron overload (Fe2+), lipid peroxidation (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) alongside restored glutathione (GSH) levels, while concurrently enhancing GPX4 activity through Keap1/ Nrf2 pathway regulation. This intervention further shifted microglial polarization toward the M2 phenotype, effectively mitigating neuroinflammatory responses. Importantly, the neuroprotective effects of IGF2BP1 knockdown were abolished upon Keap1 overexpression. Co-culture experiments revealed that IGF2BP1-depleted microglia suppressed neuronal ferroptosis via phenotypic reprogramming. In vivo validation confirmed that IGF2BP1 knockdown ameliorated neurological deficits and reduced ferroptosis markers in MCAO-challenged mice. Conclusion: IGF2BP1 serves as a critical regulator of cerebral I/R injury by exacerbating neuronal ferroptosis and sustaining detrimental microglial activation. These findings nominate IGF2BP1 inhibition as a promising strategy for ischemic stroke intervention.

AB  - Clinical studies have shown that female brains are more predisposed to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this disparity remain unknown. In several mouse models of AD, synaptic plasticity dysfunction is an early event and appears before significant accumulation of amyloid plaques and neuronal degeneration. However, it is unclear whether sexual dimorphism at the synaptic level contributes to the higher risk and prevalence of AD in females. Our studies on APP/PS1 (APPSwe/PS1dE9) mouse model show that AD impacts hippocampal long-term plasticity in a sex-specific manner. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by strong tetanic stimulation (STET), theta burst stimulation (TBS) and population spike timing-dependent plasticity (pSTDP) show a faster decay in AD females compared with age-matched AD males. In addition, behavioural tagging (BT), a model of associative memory, is specifically impaired in AD females with a faster decay in memory compared with males. Together with the plasticity and behavioural data, we also observed an upregulation of neuroinflammatory markers, along with downregulation of transcripts that regulate cellular processes associated with synaptic plasticity and memory in females. Immunohistochemistry of AD brains confirms that female APP/PS1 mice carry a higher amyloid plaque burden and have enhanced microglial activation compared with male APP/PS1 mice. Their presence in the diseased mice also suggests a link between the impairment of LTP and the upregulation of the inflammatory response. Overall, our data show that synaptic plasticity and associative memory impairments are more prominent in females and this might account for the faster progression of AD in females.

AB  - Paraoxonase-2 (PON2) enhances mitochondria function and protects against oxidative stress. Stimulating its expression has therapeutic potential for diseases where oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathology, such as Parkinson's disease. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggest that the anti-diabetic drug pioglitazone may provide neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke, but the biochemical pathway(s) responsible has not been fully elucidated. To determine the effect of pioglitazone on PON2 expression we treated male African green monkeys with oral pioglitazone (5 mg/kg/day) for 1 and 3 weeks. We found that pioglitazone increased PON2 mRNA and protein expression in brain following 1 week of treatment, however, by 3 weeks of treatment PON2 expression had returned to baseline. This transient increase was detected in substantia nigra, striatum, hippocampus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex The short-term impact of pioglitazone on PON2 expression in striatum may contribute to the discrepancy in the potency of the drug between short-term animal models and clinical trials for Parkinson's disease. Both PON2 and pioglitazone's receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), possess sex-and brain region-dependent expression, which may play a role in the short-term effect of pioglitazone and provide clues to extending the beneficial effects of PON2 activation.

AB  - Macrophage polarization is a critical process that regulates in inflammation, pathogen defense, and tissue repair. Here we demonstrate that MST1/2, a core kinase of Hippo pathway and a recently identified regulator of inflammation, plays a significant role in promoting M2 polarization. We provide evidence that inhibition of MST1/2, achieved through either gene-knockout or pharmacological treatment, leads to increased M1 polarization in a YAP-dependent manner, resulting in the development of M1-associated inflammatory disorders. Moreover, MST1/2 inhibition also leads to a substantial reduction in M2 polarization, but this occurs through the STAT6 and MEK/ERK signaling. The STAT6 is independent of YAP, but MEK/ERK is dependent of YAP. Consistent with these observations, both MST1/2-conditional knockout mice and wild-type mice treated with XMU-MP-1, a chemical inhibitor of MST1/2, exhibited reduced M2-related renal fibrosis, while simultaneously displaying enhanced LPS-mediated inflammation and improved clearance of MCR3-modified gram-negative bacteria. These findings uncover a novel role of MST1/2 in regulating macrophage polarization and establish it as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of macrophage-related fibrotic diseases.

AB  - While the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is aging, women are disproportionately affected by the disease. Interestingly, the hippocampus and cerebellum exhibit gender-specific cytoarchitecture differences, which are associated with AD, despite the absence of a role in animal reproductive behavior or hormonal signaling. This study investigates the potential association of sex differences associated with AD by interrogating cerebellar and hippocampal volume in preclinical (MCI) as well as clinical phases of AD compared to cognitively normal patients (CN) and in an animal model of AD, the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced sporadic AD model. In order to investigate putative changes in cerebellum and hippocampus in a rat model of AD, we used a STZ-induced sporadic AD model at three different time points (2, 4, and 8 weeks) after surgery in male and female rats. Previous studies have reported hippocampal-dependent changes as well as sex-dependent behavioral and signaling effects in the STZ animal model of sporadic AD while our current study showed involvement of cerebellum-mediated changes. To interrogate the role of cerebellar volume in AD progression within the human context, we analyzed data available through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In a cross-sectional analysis, we observed that levels of peripheral Glial Acidic Fibrillary Protein (GFAP) (astrocytic protein) were associated negatively with cerebellar and hippocampal volumes (beta = -0.002, p-value = 0.04; beta = -6.721, p-value < 0.0001) and were associated with sex specific differences in males. Our analysis identified that the effect on hippocampal volume was earlier in disease stage, reinforcing the relevance of longitudinal alterations of cerebellum and hippocampus volume over time. The STZ animal model of sporadic AD, corroborated the progressive changes in hippocampal volume and more minor and temporally delayed involvement of the cerebellum volume changes which were dependent on sex. This suggests that cerebellar involvement may be secondary to hippocampal neurodegeneration, and both regional differences were dependent on sex. Due to the association with GFAP, our findings may be due to network astrocyte connection spread regardless of primary pathology. Overall, our study uncovers a novel role for cerebellum in AD in a model and in the human context.

TI  - HFE promotes mitotic cell division through recruitment of cytokinetic abscission machinery in hepatocellular carcinoma
T2  - ONCOGENE
LA  - English
AB  - HFE (Hemochromatosis) is a conventional iron level regulator and its loss of function due to gene mutations increases the risk of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Likewise, studies focusing on HFE overexpression in cancers are all limited to linking up these events as a consequence of iron level deregulation. No study has explored any iron unrelated role of HFE in cancers. Here, we first reported HFE as an oncogene in HCC and its undescribed function on promoting abscission in cytokinesis during mitotic cell division, independent of its iron-regulating ability. Clinical analyses revealed HFE upregulation in tumors linking to large tumor size and poor prognosis. Functionally and mechanistically, HFE promoted cytokinetic abscission via facilitating ESCRT abscission machinery recruitment to the abscission site through signaling a novel HFE/ALK3/Smads/LIF/Hippo/YAP/YY1/KIF13A axis. Pharmacological blockage of HFE signaling axis impeded tumor phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Our data on HFE-driven HCC unveiled a new mechanism utilized by cancer cells to propel rapid cell division. This study also laid the groundwork for tumor intolerable therapeutics development given the high cytokinetic dependency of cancer cells and their vulnerability to cytokinetic blockage.

AB  - BackgroundCaffeine (Cf) antagonizes the adenosine receptors and has neuroprotective properties. The effect of Cf has been seen on stress-induced deficits of cognitive. In this study, we have investigated the effect of Cf on learning and memory functions induced by social isolation (SI) stress. Materials and methodsIn the present study, 21-day-old Wistar albino male rats (n = 28) were divided into four groups: the control (C), the SI, the Cf, and the social isolation + caffeine (SICf). Cf (0.3 g/L) was added to the drinking water of the experimental animals for 4 weeks. The learning and memory functions were assessed using the Morris Water Maze Test (MWMT). Following, was performed histopathological evaluation and determined hippocampal gene expression levels by RT-qPCR. ResultsAccording to MWMT findings, the time spent in the quadrant where the platform removed was decreased in the SI group compared with the C (p < 0.05). Histological evaluation showed morphological changes in SI by irregular appearance, cellular edema, and dark pycnotic appearance of nuclei in some neurons. However, it was observed that the histological structure of most of the neurons in the SICf group was similar to the C and Cf groups. Hippocampal SNAP25 expression was decreased in the Cf and SICf groups than in the C group (p < 0.05). The GFAP expression was increased in the SICf group than in the C group (p < 0.05). NR2A increased in the SI and SICf groups compared with C and Cf groups (p < 0.05). NR2B expression decreased in the Cf group compared with C and SI groups (p < 0.05). ConclusionsSI impaired spatial memory and causes morphological changes in adolescent rats, but this effect of isolation was not seen in Cf-treated animals. The effects of SI on NR2A, Cf on NR2B, and SNAP25 are remarkable. Here, we propose that the impaired effect of SI on spatial memory may be mediated by NR2A, but further studies are needed to explain this effect.

AB  - The aberrant upregulation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in a variety of solid cancers contributes to tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes, rendering it an appealing therapeutic target. However, effective therapies to directly target YAP1 remain challenging. In this study, we perform a high-throughput screening and identify Casein kinase II (CK2) as an uncharacterized upstream regulator of YAP1 turnover in cancer cells of ovarian cancer and several other cancer types. Pharmacological inhibition of Casein kinase II by Silmitasertib or genetic depletion of the catalytic subunit of Casein kinase II (CK2 alpha) markedly destabilizes YAP1 and consequently suppresses its oncogenic functions in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we reveal that DUB3 as a bona fide deubiquitinase of YAP1, which functionally links CK2 and YAP1 stability in a variety of human cancers. Mechanistically, CK2 alpha directly phosphorylates DUB3 at Thr495, thereby facilitating DUB3-mediated deubiquitination process of YAP1. On the contrary, the loss of Thr495 phosphorylation by the phosphorylation-defective mutant DUB3 T495A, the cancer-related mutant DUB3 D496H and CK2 inhibition failed to deubiquitinate and stabilize YAP1 effectively. Notably, upregulated expressions of CK2 alpha and DUB3 in ovarian cancer positively correlate with YAP1 overexpression. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the functional significance of the CK2 alpha-DUB3 axis in YAP1 stabilization and YAP1-driven tumor progression, highlighting that strategies to target this axis might be of benefit in the clinical management of ovarian cancer and several other lethal cancers with aberrantly upregulated YAP1.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CI/R) is a complex process that frequently results in neuronal oxidative stress and apoptosis. Dipsacoside B (DB) possesses antimicrobial and detoxifying properties and can improve mitochondrial function. Nevertheless, the potential neuroprotective effects of DB in stroke remain uncertain. This investigation aims to elucidate the impact of DB on CI/R, as well as its underlying regulatory mechanism. In our study, results showed that DB lessened the decrease in cell viability and increase in LDH release in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated HT22 cells. DB attenuated OGD/R-tempted oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. DB enhanced mitophagy in HT22 cells following OGD/R treatment by enhancing the levels of LC3-II/LC3-I, PINK1, and Parkin. Blocking of mitophagy by mdivi-1 or silencing PINK1 abolished the protective effect of DB against OGD/R-induced oxidative stress damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in HT22 cells was found to be dependent on the activation of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, as evidenced by the loss of protection when mitophagy was blocked by mdivi-1 or PINK1 silencing. Additionally, the neuroprotective effects of DB were confirmed in the middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model, indicated by alleviation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, DB attenuated OGD/R-tempted oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in HT22 hippocampal neurons by activating PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy.

AB  - BackgroundObesity dysregulates key biological processes underlying the functional homeostasis, fate decisions, and reparative potential of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Mechanisms directing obesity-induced phenotypic alterations in MSCs remain unclear, but emerging drivers include dynamic modification of epigenetic marks, like 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). We hypothesized that obesity and cardiovascular risk factors induce functionally relevant, locus-specific changes in 5hmC of swine adipose-derived MSCs and evaluated their reversibility using an epigenetic modulator, vitamin-C.MethodsFemale domestic pigs were fed a 16-week Lean or Obese diet (n = 6 each). MSCs were harvested from subcutaneous adipose tissue, and 5hmC profiles were examined through hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq) followed by an integrative (hMeDIP and mRNA sequencing) gene set enrichment analysis. For clinical context, we compared 5hmC profiles of adipose tissue-derived human MSCs harvested from patients with obesity and healthy controls.ResultshMeDIP-seq revealed 467 hyper- (fold change >= 1.4; p-value <= 0.05) and 591 hypo- (fold change <= 0.7; p-value <= 0.05) hydroxymethylated loci in swine Obese- versus Lean-MSCs. Integrative hMeDIP-seq/mRNA-seq analysis identified overlapping dysregulated gene sets and discrete differentially hydroxymethylated loci with functions related to apoptosis, cell proliferation, and senescence. These 5hmC changes were associated with increased senescence in cultured MSCs (p16/CDKN2A immunoreactivity, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase [SA-beta-Gal] staining), were partly reversed in swine Obese-MSCs treated with vitamin-C, and shared common pathways with 5hmC changes in human Obese-MSCs.ConclusionsObesity and dyslipidemia are associated with dysregulated DNA hydroxymethylation of apoptosis- and senescence-related genes in swine and human MSCs, potentially affecting cell vitality and regenerative functions. Vitamin-C may mediate reprogramming of this altered epigenomic landscape, providing a potential strategy to improve the success of autologous MSC transplantation in obese patients.

AB  - Methamphetamine (MA) is a highly addictive drug, and MA use disorder is often comorbid with anxiety and cognitive impairment. These comorbid conditions are theorized to reflect glutamate-related neurotoxicity within the frontal cortical regions. However, our prior studies of MA-sensitized mice indicate that subchronic, behaviorally non-contingent MA treatment is sufficient to dysregulate glutamate transmission in mouse brain. Here, we extend this prior work to a mouse model of high-dose oral MA self-administration (0.8, 1.6, or 3.2 g/L; 1 h sessions x 7 days) and show that while female C57BL/6J mice consumed more MA than males, MA-experienced mice of both sexes exhibited some signs of anxiety-like behavior in a behavioral test battery, although not all effects were concentration-dependent. No MA effects were detected for our measures of visually cued spatial navigation, spatial learning, or memory in the Morris water maze; however, females with a history of 3.2 g/L MA exhibited reversal-learning deficits in this task, and mice with a history of 1.6 g/L MA committed more working-memory incorrect errors and relied upon a non-spatial navigation strategy during the radial-arm maze testing. Relative to naive controls, MA-experienced mice exhibited several changes in the expression of certain glutamate receptor-related proteins and their downstream effectors within the ventral and dorsal areas of the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala, many of which were sex-selective. Systemic pretreatment with the mGlu1-negative allosteric modulator JNJ 162596858 reversed the anxiety-like behavior expressed by MA-experienced mice in the marble-burying test, while systemic pretreatment with NMDA or the NMDA antagonist MK-801 bi-directionally affected the MA-induced reversal-learning deficit. Taken together, these data indicate that a relatively brief history of oral MA is sufficient to induce some signs of anxiety-like behavior and cognitive dysfunction during early withdrawal that reflect, at least in part, MA-induced changes in the corticolimbic expression of certain glutamate receptor subtypes of potential relevance to treating symptoms of MA use disorder.

AB  - Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of individuals worldwide, there are currently no effective treatments available. Recent findings have suggested that non-nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) signaling represents promising therapeutic target for central nervous system disorders, offering potential treatments without the significant side effects associated with the activation of nuclear ERs. Because ER signaling deficiency and autophagy impairment have been linked to AD etiology, the present study aimed to selectively target non-nuclear ERs signaling pathways with PaPE-1 and identify autophagyrelated mechanisms of neuroprotection in a cellular model of AD. The present study demonstrated that PaPE-1 protected mouse cortical neurons from AD pathology, as evidenced by MAP2-specific labeling. Posttreatment with PaPE-1 reversed the amyloid-b (Ab)-evoked decrease in autophagic vesicles level, and increased the expression of autophagy-related mRNAs and proteins, accompanied by hypomethylation of the Atg7 gene. Moreover, posttreatment with PaPE-1 increased the levels of membrane fraction receptors ESR1/ERa and ESR2/ERb, which corresponds to increased Esr1 and Esr2 mRNA expression and DNA hypomethylation of specific genes. In addition to inhibiting DNA methylation of autophagy and ER-related genes, PaPE-1 did not alter global DNA methylation but stimulated HAT activity in Ab-treated cells. In summary, PaPE-1 promoted neuroprotection against Ab-induced toxicity that involved stimulation of autophagy, upregulation of membrane ESR1 and ESR2 and decreased DNA methylation of respective genes. The present study proposes a novel therapeutic approach against AD that is based on the selective activation of non-nuclear ER signaling to overcome Ab-induced autophagy deficits and normalize the epigenetic status of cerebral neurons.

AB  - Cortical network undergoes rewiring everyday due to learning and memory events. To investigate the trends of population adaptation in neocortex overtime, we record cellular activity of large-scale cortical populations in response to neutral environments and conditioned contexts and identify a general intrinsic cortical adaptation mechanism, naming rectified activity-dependent population plasticity (RAPP). Comparing each adjacent day, the previously activated neurons reduce activity, but remain with residual potentiation, and increase population variability in proportion to their activity during previous recall trials. RAPP predicts both the decay of context-induced activity patterns and the emergence of sparse memory traces. Simulation analysis reveal that the local inhibitory connections might account for the residual potentiation in RAPP. Intriguingly, introducing the RAPP phenomenon in the artificial neural network show promising improvement in small sample size pattern recognition tasks. Thus, RAPP represents a phenomenon of cortical adaptation, contributing to the emergence of long-lasting memory and high cognitive functions.
   RAPP phenomenon describes a formula to measure intrinsic adaptation of neuronal population activity, which carries features of both the homeostasis regulation of the original state and the distilling of sparse memory traces in neocortex.

AB  - During space flight, astronauts are exposed to various influences of extreme environments and susceptible to develop depression-like behavior. Thus, this study aims to explore the molecular biological mechanism of the cause of depression-like behavior and reveal the effect of Baoyuan Jieyu Formula (BYJYF) on ameliorating depression-like behavior. Here, rats exposed to simulated long-term spaceflight composite stress (LSCS) reduced the sucrose preference rate (P<0.01), and the time of forced swimming immobility and the number of climbing times were also reduced (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). Moreover, the number of neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus decreased (P<0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.001), the staining became weak, and the Nissl body decreased. Antibody chip detected a total of 854 protein molecules in the hippocampus, of which 51 and 37 proteins were significantly different in the LSCS group and LSCS+BYJYF group, respectively, focusing on signaling pathways such as MAPK and neurotrophin. Western blot was used to verify the related proteins of these two pathways. Conclusively, simulated LSCS can induce depression-like behavior and neuronal damage. BYJYF can reduce neuronal apoptosis, and promote neuron survival by regulating the MAPK and the neurotrophin signaling pathway to protect neurons and combat LSCS.

AB  - Background. Currently, most of the research on breast cancer has been carried out in conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures due to its practical benefits, however, the three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is becoming the model of choice in cancer research because it allows cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, mimicking the native microenvironment of tumors in vivo. Methods. In this work, we evaluated the effect of 3D cell organization on the expression pattern of miRNAs (by Small-RNAseq) and mRNAs (by microarrays) in the breast cancer SKBR3 cell line and analyzed the biological processes and signaling pathways regulated by the differentially expressed protein-coding genes (DE-mRNAs) and miRNAs (DE-microRNAs) found in the organoids. Results. We obtained well-defined cell-aggregated organoids with a grape cluster-like morphology with a size up to 9.2 x 10(5) mu m(3). The transcriptomic assays showed that cell growth in organoids significantly affected (all p < 0.01) the gene expression patterns of both miRNAs, and mRNAs, finding 20 upregulated and 19 downregulated DE-microRNAs, as well as 49 upregulated and 123 downregulated DE-mRNAs. In silico analysis showed that a subset of 11 upregulated DE-microRNAs target 70 downregulated DE-mRNAs. These genes are involved in 150 gene ontology (GO) biological processes such as regulation of cell morphogenesis, regulation of cell shape, regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, morphogenesis of epithelium, regulation of cytoskeleton organization, as well as in the MAPK and AGE-RAGE signaling KEGG-pathways. Interestingly, hsa-mir-122-5p (Fold Change (FC) = 15.4), hsa-mir-369-3p (FC = 11.4), and hsa-mir-10b-5p (FC = 20.1) regulated up to 81% of the 70 downregulated DE-mRNAs. Conclusion. The organotypic 3D cell-organization architecture of breast cancer SKBR3 cells impacts the expression pattern of the miRNAs-mRNAs network mainly through overexpression of hsa-mir-122-5p, hsa-mir-369-3p, and hsa-mir-10b-5p. All these findings suggest that the interaction between cell-cell and cell-ECM as well as the change in the culture architecture impacts gene expression, and, therefore, support the pertinence of migrating breast cancer research from conventional cultures to 3D models.

AB  - Host location plays a pivotal role in the coevolution between insects and plants, particularly for specialist insect herbivores with a limited host range. However, how specialists precisely select the appropriate site for oviposition through gustatory system remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the effects of the gustatory system on the host plant selection of a devastating pest in Citrus spp., Bactrocera minax, by conducting behavioral assays. Through genomic and transcriptomic data analysis as well as RNAi technology, we identified a novel gustatory receptor, BminGR59b, highly expressed in the forelegs of female B. minax, which played a critical role in host plant selection before oviposition decision. Additionally, our results encompassing heterologous expression in Sf9 cells and oviposition behavior assay revealed that n-eicosane is the ligand for BminGR59b. Finally, employing the dual luciferase reporter system alongside yeast one-hybrid techniques and RNAi, we verified that the transcription factor BminCEBP regulated the up-regulation of BminGR59b in sexually matured adults. These findings offer new insights into the close-range host fruit recognition and selection for oviposition in a specialist tephritid fruit fly B. minax, which also sheds light on the transcriptional regulation mechanisms underlying the gustatorymediated oviposition in specialist herbivores for the first time.

AB  - Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

AB  - RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification process that alters the RNA sequence relative to the genomic blueprint. In plant organelles (namely, mitochondria and chloroplasts), the most common type is C-to-U, and the absence of C-to-U RNA editing results in abnormal plant development, such as etiolation and albino leaves, aborted embryonic development and retarded seedling growth. Here, through PREP, RES-Scanner, PCR and RT-PCR analyses, 38 and 139 RNA editing sites were identified from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of Camellia sinensis, respectively. Analysis of the base preference around the RNA editing sites showed that in the -1 position of the edited C had more frequent occurrences of T whereas rare occurrences of G. Three conserved motifs were identified at 25 bases upstream of the RNA editing site. Structural analyses indicated that the RNA secondary structure of 32 genes, protein secondary structure of 37 genes and the three-dimensional structure of 5 proteins were altered due to RNA editing. The editing level analysis of matK and ndhD in six tea cultivars indicated that matK-701 might be involved in the color change of tea leaves. Furthermore, 218 PLS-CsPPR proteins were predicted to interact with the identified RNA editing sites. In conclusion, this study provides comprehensive insight into RNA editing events, which will facilitate further study of the RNA editing phenomenon of the tea plant.

TI  - HFE promotes mitotic cell division through recruitment of cytokinetic abscission machinery in hepatocellular carcinoma
T2  - ONCOGENE
LA  - English
AB  - HFE (Hemochromatosis) is a conventional iron level regulator and its loss of function due to gene mutations increases the risk of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Likewise, studies focusing on HFE overexpression in cancers are all limited to linking up these events as a consequence of iron level deregulation. No study has explored any iron unrelated role of HFE in cancers. Here, we first reported HFE as an oncogene in HCC and its undescribed function on promoting abscission in cytokinesis during mitotic cell division, independent of its iron-regulating ability. Clinical analyses revealed HFE upregulation in tumors linking to large tumor size and poor prognosis. Functionally and mechanistically, HFE promoted cytokinetic abscission via facilitating ESCRT abscission machinery recruitment to the abscission site through signaling a novel HFE/ALK3/Smads/LIF/Hippo/YAP/YY1/KIF13A axis. Pharmacological blockage of HFE signaling axis impeded tumor phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Our data on HFE-driven HCC unveiled a new mechanism utilized by cancer cells to propel rapid cell division. This study also laid the groundwork for tumor intolerable therapeutics development given the high cytokinetic dependency of cancer cells and their vulnerability to cytokinetic blockage.

AB  - The Zika virus received significant attention in 2016, following a declaration by the World Health Organization of an epidemic in the Americas, in which infections were associated with microcephaly. Indeed, prenatal Zika virus infection is detrimental to fetal neural stem cells and can cause premature cell loss and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in newborn infants, collectively described as congenital Zika syndrome. Contrastingly, much less is known about how neonatal infection affects the development of the newborn nervous system. Here, we investigated the development of the dentate gyrus of wild-type mice following intracranial injection of the virus at birth (postnatal day 0). Through this approach, we found that Zika virus infection affected the development of neurogenic regions within the dentate gyrus and caused reactive gliosis, cell death and a decrease in cell proliferation. Such infection also altered volumetric features of the postnatal dentate gyrus. Thus, we found that Zika virus exposure to newborn mice is detrimental to the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. These observations offer insight into the cellular mechanisms that underlie the neurological features of congenital Zika syndrome in children.

AB  - Simple Summary Despite the regional preferences for quail eggs and meat, and the main production being found in Asian countries, the popularity of quail raising has increased and their production has been introduced in many other countries, including the Baltics. A wide distribution around the world encouraged genetic divergence among Japanese quail populations, the formation of different breeds and lines as well as their research. The Estonian quail, a breed developed in Estonia, has also spread in Lithuania. This study aimed to evaluate yolk and albumen colour, as well as the nutritional value of yolk lipids in Estonian quail eggs using diets supplemented with cakes from local oil corns (rapeseed, hemp and camelina seeds). The diet affected the colour as well as the cholesterol content and fatty acid composition of the yolk. All quail groups demonstrated the high lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) of the yolk; however, the negative value of parameter a*, instead of being red, showed a greenish colour. The highest proportions of total saturated (SFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids as well as the lowest monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were found in the yolk lipids of the quail which was fed a mixture supplemented with hemp cake. The lowest and most favourable n-6/n-3 ratio was demonstrated by the quail fed the diet supplemented with camelina. However, the lowest yolk cholesterol content was demonstrated by the quail fed the diet supplemented with rapeseed cake. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementing commercial diets with rapeseed, hempseed and camelina seed cakes on the yolk and albumen colour and nutritional value of yolk lipids in Estonian quail eggs. A total of 585 eggs were used to evaluate egg weight, yolk and albumen pH and colour, proximate yolk composition, cholesterol content and fatty acid composition in the yolk lipids of three Estonian quail groups each fed a diet supplemented with 10% rapeseed, hemp or camelina seed cakes. The higher (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) lightness (L*) of the yolk was detected in the group of quail fed the diet supplemented with rapeseed and camelina cakes compared to the hempseed addition. Meanwhile, the albumen lightness in the rapeseed group was higher (p < 0.01) in comparison to the camelina group. A lower (p < 0.001) yolk negative a* value was estimated in the hemp group than in the groups fed rapeseed and camelina seed cake supplements, while the rapeseed group demonstrated lower (p < 0.001) albumen yellowness (b*) and colour saturation (C) in comparison to the other groups. The highest and lowest proportions of total saturated (SFAs)and monounsaturated (MUFAs) fatty acids, respectively, were found in the yolk lipids of quails fed a mixture supplemented by hemp cake. A higher (p < 0.05) proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was only found in the hemp group compared to the camelina group. The highest and lowest (p < 0.001) n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios were found in the yolk lipids of quail receiving mixtures supplemented with rapeseed and camelina cakes, respectively. The yolk of the quail from the rapeseed group showed more favourable lower and higher (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) atherogenic index (AI) and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic (h/H) ratio compared to the hemp and camelina groups.
   The lower yolk cholesterol content was found in the eggs of the quail fed the diet supplemented with rapeseed cake compared to the eggs of the quail which were fed the diets containing more n-3 PUFAs from the addition of hemp and camelina cakes (p < 0.05 and p < 0.
   01, respectively).

AB  - Systemic perturbations can drive a neuroimmune cascade after surgical trauma, including affecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), activating microglia, and contributing to cognitive deficits such as delirium. Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) is a particularly debilitating complication that renders the brain further vulnerable to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, albeit these molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we have used an orthopedic model of tibial fracture/fixation in APPSwDI/mNos2(-/-) AD (CVN-AD) mice to investigate relevant pathogenetic mechanisms underlying DSD. We conducted the present study in 6-month-old CVN-AD mice, an age at which we speculated amyloid-beta pathology had not saturated BBB and neuroimmune functioning. We found that URMC-099, our brain-penetrant anti-inflammatory neuroprotective drug, prevented inflammatory endothelial activation, breakdown of the BBB, synapse loss, and microglial activation in our DSD model. Taken together, our data link post-surgical endothelial activation, microglial MafB immunoreactivity, and synapse loss as key substrates for DSD, all of which can be prevented by URMC-099.

AB  - There has been growing recognition that major depressive disorder is a serious medical disorder that also affects children. This has been accompanied by an increased use of antidepressant drugs in adolescents; however, not all classes of antidepressants are effective in children and adolescents. There is an increasing need to understand the differences in antidepressant action in different developmental stages. There are some data indicating that the behavioral effect of chronic antidepressant treatment in adult rodents is dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis; however, it is not known which classes of antidepressant drugs induce hippocampal neurogenesis in adolescent rodents. Three classes of antidepressant drugs were tested in two age groups of Sprague Dawley rats, pre-adolescent (postnatal days 11-24) and adolescent (postnatal days 21-34): monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). To address which classes of antidepressant drugs might alter the rate of mitogenesis in neural progenitor cells in an adolescent rodent model, adolescent Sprague Dawley rats were treated with the thymidine analog 5-bromo-deoxy-2 '-uridine (BrdU) on postnatal days 21 and 22 and antidepressant drugs or vehicle for 14 days (postnatal days 21-34). To address which classes of antidepressant drugs might alter the rate of neurogenesis, postnatal day-21 Sprague Dawley rats were treated with antidepressant drugs or vehicle for 14 days (postnatal days 21-34) and BrdU on postnatal days 33 and 34. In both experimental paradigms, BrdU-positive cells in the subgranular zone and the granule cell layer were counted. Newborn neurons were identified in the neurogenic paradigm by identifying cells expressing both the neuronal specific marker NeuN and BrdU using confocal microscopy. Only the SSRI fluoxetine significantly altered the basal mitogenic and neurogenic rates in adolescent rats. Treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) tranylcypromine (TCP) and the TCA desipramine did not alter the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis in the adolescent rats. This is consistent with human clinical observations, where only SSRIs have efficacy for treatment of depression in patients under the age of 18. In pre-adolescent rats, postnatal days 11-24, none of the drugs tested significantly altered the basal mitogenic or neurogenic rates. All of the classes of antidepressant drugs are known to induce hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rats. The mechanisms of action underlying this developmental difference in antidepressant drug action between juveniles and adults are not known.

AB  - Epilepsy is a prevalent and chronic neurological disorder marked by recurring, uncontrollable seizures of the brain. Chronic or repeated seizures produce memory problems and induce damage to different brain regions. Histamine has been reported to have neuroprotective effects. Betahistine is a histamine analogue. The current research investigated the effects of convulsions on the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of adult male albino mice and assessed the possible protective effect of betahistine. Four groups of 40 adult male mice were organized: control, betahistine (10 mg/kg/day), pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (40 mg/kg/ on alternate days), and Betahistine-PTZ group received betahistine 1 h before PTZ. PTZ induced a substantial rise in glutamate level and a considerable decrease in histamine level. Structural changes in the cerebral cortex and cornu ammonis (CA1) of the hippocampus were detected in the pattern of neuron degeneration. Some neurons were shrunken with dark nuclei, and others had faintly stained ones. Focal accumulation of neuroglial cells and ballooned nerve cells of the cerebral cortex were also detected. Cleaved caspase-3, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 showed substantial increases, while synaptophysin expression was significantly reduced. Interestingly, these changes were less prominent in mice pretreated with betahistine. In conclusion, betahistine had shown neuroprotective properties against brain damage induced by convulsions.

AB  - Disruption of the YAP-TEAD protein-protein inter-action is an attractive therapeutic strategy in oncology to suppress tumor progression and cancer metastasis. YAP binds to TEAD at a large flat binding interface (similar to 3500 angstrom 2) devoid of a well-defined druggable pocket, so it has been difficult to design low-molecular-weight compounds to abrogate this protein-protein interaction directly. Recently, work by Furet and coworkers (ChemMedChem 2022, DOI: 10.1002/cmdc.202200303) reported the discovery of the first class of small molecules able to efficiently disrupt the transcriptional activity of TEAD by binding to a specific interaction site of the YAP-TEAD binding interface. Using high-throughput in silico docking, they identified a virtual screening hit from a hot spot derived from their previously rationally designed peptidic inhibitor. Structure-based drug design efforts led to the optimization of the hit compound into a potent lead candidate. Given advances in rapid high-throughput screening and rational approaches to peptidic ligand discovery for challenging targets, we analyzed the pharmacophore features involved in transferring from the peptidic to small-molecule inhibitor that could enable small-molecule discovery for such targets. Here, we show retrospectively that pharmacophore analysis augmented by solvation analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories can guide the designs, while binding free energy calculations provide greater insight into the binding conformation and energetics accompanying the association event. The computed binding free energy estimates agree well with experimental findings and offer useful insight into structural determinants that influence ligand binding to the TEAD interaction surface, even for such a shallow binding site. Taken together, our results demonstrates the utility of advanced in silico methods in structure-based design efforts for difficult-to-drug targets such as the YAP-TEAD transcription factor complex.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia among the elderly in the world. With the increase of human life expectancy, its incidence is also increasing year by year. Tacrine (TAC) is the first acetylcholine inhibitor approved for the treatment of AD. Although TAC has obvious anti-AD activity, it was eventually delisted due to acute liver injury caused by its strong hepatotoxicity. Rosmarinic acid (RA) has shown good activity in both neuroprotection and hepatoprotection. Purpose and Study DesignIn this study, the combination of RA and TAC was explored, and a high dose of d-galactose was used to build an AD mouse model, which was given at the same time for 4 weeks in order to alleviate TAC hepatotoxicity and enhance the intervention of AD in mice through RA. In particular, we pay attention to the key role of A beta and microglia in the pathogenesis of AD, so we evaluate the ability of RA combined with TAC in alleviating chronic neuroinflammation induced by A beta plaque in the brain of AD mice and enhancing the ability of microglia to clear A beta plaque. ResultsThe results show that the combination of RA and TAC has the best intervention effect on AD compared with the single use of the two drugs, and it is basically positively correlated with RA dose. RA + TAC significantly improved body weight, organ index, and behavioral state of AD mice. Further analysis showed that RA + TAC enhanced the antioxidant level of hippocampus and serum of AD mice, alleviated the pathological damage of hippocampus, significantly improved cholinergic system, reduced the expression levels of AB plaque and neurotoxic A beta 1-41 and A beta 1-42 in the brain, and significantly increased the level of neuroprotective protein trigger receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which mediated the phagocytosis of microglia. More importantly, the combination therapy of RA and TAC decreased the expression of M1 microglia marker (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 [Iba-1]), increased the expression of M2 microglia marker Arg-1, and promoted the release of anti-inflammatory compounds. In addition, RA + TAC also inhibited the mRNA expression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B related to neuroinflammation. In the aspect of liver function, RA reduced cell death mediated by Caspase-3 by regulating the expression of bcl-2/bax, alleviated TAC-induced liver injury in mice, and made the serum indexes of ALT, AST, ALP, TBIL, and gamma-GT reflecting liver function closer to the normal range. ConclusionThe combination of RA and TAC shows the potential to reduce the hepatotoxicity of TAC and is expected to enhance its therapeutic effect on AD.

AB  - Objectives: Weaning induces oxidative stress in pigs, increasing the risk of diarrhea and death. Intestinal damage is associated with obstructed intestinal cell cycles. To stop damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has been widely employed. In this study, we examined changes in the intestinal cyclin of weaning piglets and assessed the impact of NAC on intestinal cell cycle arrest and intracellular signaling pathways. Methods: We conducted two animal experiments. In the first, we divided 12 litters of 120 newborn piglets into two groups: a control group and a weaning group. The control piglets were allowed to suckle normally. The weaning group was weaned after 3 weeks and fed a normal diet for piglets. We slaughtered six piglets from the control group and six from the weaning group. We observed cyclin changes and intestinal development at days 0, 1, 4, and 7 after weaning. In the second experiment, we divided 15 litters of 150 piglets that were 2 weeks old into three groups: the control group, the weaning group, and the NAC group. Control piglets were allowed to suckle normally. Piglets in the weaning and NAC groups were weaned when they were 21 days old. The NAC group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 500 mg/kg NAC, and the weaning group was fed the basal diet alone. The experimental period was 14-25 days of age. Four days after weaning, we slaughtered one piglet from each litter. We then analyzed intestinal cell cycle indexes, intestinal oxidative stress, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 phosphorylation. Results: Weaning decreased the piglets' feed intake and daily gain, reduced the serum antioxidant capacity, and increased the intestinal ROS level. Furthermore, the jejunum histology and barrier development of the jejunum exhibited damage after weaning, the microvilli displayed hypoplasia, and the p21 and p27 protein expression levels of the jejunum were significantly elevated. We did not observe any significant differences in cyclin D and E after days 1, 4, and 7 post-weaning compared with the control group. We observed, however, significantly increased cyclin D and E expression, lower ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase phosphorylation; villus atrophy alleviation; decreased p21 and p27 expression; and increased average daily intake of feed and weight gain. Conclusion: This research demonstrates that weaning stress inhibits piglet intestinal proliferation by reducing cyclin D and cyclin E expression. NAC downregulates p21 and p27 through modulating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKase) phosphorylation, thereby promoting cell proliferation. The results indicate that NAC promotes intestinal function and the integrity of enterocytes and holds promise as a new feed additive for animal health.

AB  - Experimental experience suggests that microbial agents including probiotics and prebiotics (representative microbial agents) play a critical role in defending against respiratory virus infection. We aim to systematically examine these agents? effect on respiratory viral infection and encourage research into clinical applications. An electronic literature search was conducted from published data with a combination of a microbial agents search component containing synonyms for microbial agents-related terms and a customized search component for respiratory virus infection. Hazard ratio (HR), risk ratio (RR) and standard deviation (SD) were employed as effect estimates. In 45 preclinical studies, the mortality rates decreased in the respiratory viral infection models that included prebiotics or prebiotics as interventions (HR: 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56?0.87; P=0.002). There was a significant decrease in viral load due to improved gut microbiota (SD: ?1.22; 95% CI: ?1.50 to ?0.94; P<0.001). Concentrations of interferon (IFN)-? (SD: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.33?1.77; P=0.004), IFN-? (SD: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.01?1.65; P=0.05) and interleukin (IL)-12 (SD: 2.42; 95% CI: 0.32?4.52; P=0.02), IL-1? (SD: 0.01; 95% CI: ?0.37 to 0.40; P=0.94) increased, whereas those of TNF-? (SD: ?0.58; 95% CI: ?1.59 to 0.43; P=0.26) and IL-6 (SD: ?0.59; 95% CI: ?1.24 to 0.07; P=0.08) decreased. Six clinical studies had lower symptom scores (SD: ?0.09; 95% CI: ?0.44 to 0.26; P=0.61) and less incidence of infection (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64?1.01; P=0.06). Our research indicates that probiotics and prebiotics pose a defensive possibility on respiratory viral infection and may encourage the clinical application.

AB  - This study compares the antioxidant properties (RSA(DPPH)-DPPH radical scavenging activity, FRAP-ferric reducing activity power, and FIC-ferrous ion-chelating activity), the total phenolics (TP), total flavonoids (TF), and catechin profiles, as well as the caffeine content of Azorean Camellia sinensis green tea collected in seasons of two different years. The RSA(DPPH) showed some variation between 2019 and 2020, and presented, in general, better results in 2020 as well as during the summer seasons. The FRAP was also noted to be at its highest in July and August of the two investigated years (6.64 and 6.40 mu g/mL in 2019 and 5.85 and 5.46 mu g/mL in 2020). According to FIC activity, the August 2019 sample exhibited the highest value (76.18%). The TP varied between 291.14 and 326.93 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of dried extract (DE) in 2019 and between 300.25 and 320.58 mg GAE/g DE in 2020. Concerning the TF, the values varied between 51.85 and 67.93 mg rutin equivalents (RE)/g DE in 2019 and between 50.27 and 69.57 mg RE/g DE in 2020. Epicatechins derivatives, determined by HPLC, presented higher values in all samples from 2020 compared to 2019, and the same was observed for esterified catechins. The epigallocatechin-3-gallate content was also higher in all samples from 2020 (214.52-240.16 mg/g DE) compared to 2019 (140.91-210.83 mg/g DE). Regarding caffeine content (12.86-20.45 mg/g DE in 2019 and 13.19-29.35 mg/g DE in 2020), the samples from April and June exhibited similar values in both years. In general, green tea samples exhibited better results in 2020 than in 2019, with the exception of FIC activity, while the varied TP and TF contents in certain months reflect the impact of climatic variation on tea quality.

AB  - Tea plant trichomes not only contribute to the unique flavor and high quality of tea products but also provide physical and biochemical defenses for tea plants. Transcription factors play crucial roles in regulating plant trichome formation. However, limited information about the regulatory mechanism of transcription factors underlying tea plant trichome formation is available. Here, the investigation of trichome phenotypes among 108 cultivars of Yunwu Tribute Tea, integrated with a transcriptomics analysis of both hairy and hairless cultivars, revealed the potential involvement of CsGeBPs in tea trichome formation. In total, six CsGeBPs were identified from the tea plant genome, and their phylogenetic relationships, as well as the structural features of the genes and proteins, were analyzed to further understand their biological functions. The expression analysis of CsGeBPs in different tissues and in response to environmental stresses indicated their potential roles in regulating tea plant development and defense. Moreover, the expression level of CsGeBP4 was closely associated with a high-density trichome phenotype. The silencing of CsGeBP4 via the newly developed virus-induced gene silencing strategy in tea plants inhibited trichome formation, indicating that CsGeBP4 was required for this process. Our results shed light on the molecular regulatory mechanisms of tea trichome formation and provide new candidate target genes for further research. This should lead to an improvement in tea flavor and quality and help in breeding stress-tolerant tea plant cultivars.

AB  - In the central nervous system, cell-to-cell interaction is essential for brain plassticity and repair, and its alteration is critically involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Neural stem cells are a plentiful source of biological signals promoting neuroplasticity and the maintenance of cognitive functions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an additional strategy for cells to release signals in the surrounding cellular environment or to exchange information among both neighboring and distant cells. In the last years, rising attention has been devoted to the ability of stem cell (SC)-derived EVs to counteract inflammatory and degenerative brain disorders taking advantage of their immunomodulatory capacities and regenerative potential. Here, we review the role of adult neurogenesis impairment in the cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative diseases and describe the beneficial effects of SC-derived EVs on brain plasticity and repair also discussing the advantages of SC-derived EV administration vs SC transplantation in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an important horticultural crop. The quality and productivity of tea plants is always threatened by various adverse environmental factors. Numerous studies have shown that intercropping tea plants with other plants can greatly improve the quality of their products. The intercropping system of Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) and tea plants is an agricultural planting model in which the two species are grown on the same piece of land following a specific spacing and cultivation method. Based on a comparative transcriptome analysis between Chinese chestnut tea intercropped plantations and a pure tea plantation, it was found that the expression levels of the WRKY genes were significantly upregulated under the intercropping pattern. In this study, we cloned a candidate gene, CsWRKY48, and verified its functions in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) via heterologous transformation. The contents of protective enzyme activities and osmoregulatory substances were significantly increased, and the trichomes length and density were improved in the transgenic tobacco lines. This phenotype offered an enhanced resistance to both low temperatures and aphids for transgenic lines overexpressing CsWRKY48. Further analysis indicated that the CsWRKY48 transcription factor might interact with other regulators, such as CBF, ERF, MYC, and MYB, to enhance the resistance of tea plants to biotic and abiotic stresses. These findings not only confirm the elevated resistance of tea plants under intercropping, but also indicate a potential regulatory network mediated by the WRKY transcription factor.

AB  - Recently there has been growing interest in dyeing biomaterials using natural sustainable plant extracts classified as eco-friendly. The microwave-assisted method provides fast heating and energy efficiency, more homogenous heat distribution in dyeing baths, less use of chemicals, and less heat loss, resulting in this method being greener-more sustainable and ecological. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to predict the dyeing properties of fibers, which are often complex and dependent on multiple variables. This saves time and reduces costs compared to trial-and-error methods. This study presents the green dyeing of merino wool fiber with natural dye extracted from Aesculus hippocastanum (horse chestnut) shells using the microwave-assisted method. Before dyeing, the merino wool fiber underwent a pre-mordanted process with aluminum potassium sulfate with different concentrations using the microwave-assisted method. Spectrophotometric analysis of the light, washing, and rubbing fastness of the dyed merino wool fibers was performed. The color strength, light, washing, and rubbing fastness of the dyed merino wool fiber were developed using the pre-mordanting process. After the pre-mordanting process, the light fastness of the samples improved from 1-2 to 3, the color change increased from 2 to 3-4, and the rubbing fastness developed from 2-3 to 4 according to mordant concentration, mordanting time, and dyeing time quantities. The spectrophotometric analysis results indicate that color coordinates vary based on mordant concentration, mordanting, and dyeing duration. Furthermore, the results proved that microwave energy significantly shortened the mordanting and dyeing duration, resulting in an eco-friendly dyeing process. In this investigation, a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model with sigmoid hidden neurons and a linear output neuron was used to predict the color strength dyeing property of merino wool fiber. Experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved a regression value of 0.9 for the color strength dyeing property. As demonstrated, the proposed FFNN model is effective and can be utilized to forecast the color strength dyeing properties of merino wool fiber.

AB  - Line-of-sight occlusion in compact cities commonly reduces the river views of riverfront residents. This study developed a new approach to measure the river-view visibilities of individual dwellings in urban riverfront neighborhood blocks. The objective of this study is to achieve a good integration between the morphology of building groups and the ideal river-view visibility of dwellings, and to provide assistance in building and landscape design through the proposed method. First, a design case of an actual riverside neighborhood block with two initial building layout schemes was selected. The complex layout scheme led to a better building-group morphology than the simple layout scheme. Second, 3D models were built using the Rhinoceros and Grasshopper software platforms, and 3D isovists were generated on the hypothetical River Surface Curve (RSC) equipartition points. Finally, the data from the 3D isovists were used to measure the river-view visibility of each dwelling. The results show that river views were available for all dwellings with the simple layout scheme; however, the complex layout scheme was polarized, with 3% of the dwellings having no river views, and a higher number of dwellings with high-quality river-view visibilities. The optimized layout scheme was based on repeated adjustments of the river-view visibility for all dwellings. The viewpoint clouds of the river views on the dwelling exterior walls are described for facade design guidance. The river-view measurement approach can accurately and efficiently measure the river-view visibility of each dwelling in the block, which can be used in optimizing of neighborhood block design.

AB  - The L-asparaginase enzyme is used in cancer therapy, mainly acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). Commercial enzymes (EcASNase2) cause adverse reactions during treatment, such as immunogenicity. A human enzyme could be a non-immunogenic substitute. However, no candidate was found showing efficient kinetic properties. HASNase1 is an L-asparaginase that comes from the N-terminal domain of a protein called 60 kDa-lysophospholipase and its 3D structure has not been resolved. HASNase1 is homologous to EcASNase1 and gpASNase1, and this last one has shown efficient kinetic properties. Homology modeling was used to find the 3D structure of hASNase1, so one could submit it to Molecular Dynamics (MD), in order to understand structural differences that lead to different catalytic efficiency compared to EcASNase2 and gpASNase1. The interaction potential between L-Asn and active site residues showed that the substrate can rotate in the site when Region1 is open. Region1 residues sequence favors deformations and movements as shown in MD. Region2-A is linear in gpASNase1, and it features a helix portion in hASNase1, which leaves the Tyr308 position projected to the active site ratifying its role in catalytic efficiency. Analysis of Lys188 orientation and movement showed the effect of positive cooperativity in hASNase1. It was found that the presence of Asn at the allosteric site helps, not only in Region1 stabilization, but also in Lys188 stabilization for the maintenance of the triad. Despite structural similarities in hASNase1, gpASNase1, and EcASNase2, there are differences in structural determinants that, in addition to allosterism, may explain the different kinetic properties.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by extracellular beta-amyloid plaques, intraneuronal tau neurofibrillary tangles and excessive neurodegeneration. The mechanisms of neuron degeneration and the potential of these neurons to form new nerve fibers for compensation remain elusive. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of beta-amyloid and tau on new formations of nerve fibers from mouse organotypic brain slices connected to collagen-based microcontact prints. Methods: Organotypic brain slices of postnatal day 8-10 wild-type mice were connected to established collagen-based microcontact prints loaded with polyornithine to enhance nerve fiber outgrowth. Human beta-amyloid(42) or P301S mutated aggregated tau was co-loaded to the prints. Nerve fibers were immunohistochemically stained with neurofilament antibodies. The physiological activity of outgrown neurites was tested with neurotracer MiniRuby, voltage-sensitive dye FluoVolt, and calcium-sensitive dye Rhod-4. Results: Immunohistochemical staining revealed newly formed nerve fibers extending along the prints derived from the brain slices. While collagen-only microcontact prints stimulated nerve fiber growth, those loaded with polyornithine significantly enhanced nerve fiber outgrowth. Beta-amyloid(42) significantly increased the neurofilament-positive nerve fibers, while tau had only a weak effect. MiniRuby crystals, retrogradely transported along these newly formed nerve fibers, reached the hippocampus, while FluoVolt and Rhod-4 monitored electrical activity in newly formed nerve fibers. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that intact nerve fibers can form along collagen-based microcontact prints from mouse brain slices. The Alzheimer's peptide beta-amyloid(42) stimulates this growth, hinting at a neuroprotective function when physiologically active. This "brain-on-chip" model may offer a platform for screening bioactive factors or testing drug effects on nerve fiber growth.

AB  - In recent years, the decline of microglia in the hippocampus has been shown to play a role in the development of depression, and its reversal shows marked antidepressant-like effects. beta-glucan is a polysaccharide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has numerous beneficial effects on the nervous system, including improving axon regeneration and cognition. Considering its immuno-stimulatory activities in cultured microglia and brain tissues, we hypothesize that beta-glucan may be a potential candidate to correct the functional deficiency of microglia and thereby alleviate depression-like behaviors in chronically stressed animals. An expected, our results showed that a single injection of beta-glucan 5 h before behavioral tests at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg, but not at a dose of 5 mg/kg, reversed the depression-like behavior induced by chronic stress in mice in the tail suspension test, forced swimming test, and sucrose preference test. The effect of beta-glucan (20 mg/kg) also showed time-dependent properties that were statistically significant 5 and 8, but not 3, hours after drug injection and persisted for at least 7 days. Fourteen days after beta-glucan injection, no antidepressant-like effect was observed anymore. However, this effect was overcome by a second beta-glucan injection (20 mg/kg) 14 days after the first beta-glucan injection. Stimulation of microglia appeared to mediate the antidepressant-like effect of beta-glucan, because both inhibition of microglia and their depletion prevented the antidepressant-like effect of beta-glucan. Based on these effects of beta-glucan, beta-glucan administration could be developed as a new strategy for the treatment of depression.

AB  - This case report details the successful rehabilitation of a 31-year-old male Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) presenting with an abnormal left forelimb gait following chronic traumatic injury. The elephant exhibited a distinctive circumduction gait with a semicircular arc movement, characterized by limited flexion at the elbow and carpus, along with compensatory proximal shrugging during the swing phase. Diagnostic evaluations revealed joint space narrowing and ligament fibrosis, while biomechanical gait analysis using inertial measurement units highlighted significant asymmetries between affected and unaffected limbs. An interprofessional team developed a comprehensive rehabilitation protocol that integrated peripheral magnetic stimulation, task-specific therapeutic walking with adjustable obstacles, and progressive strengthening exercises. At the eight-week follow-up, improvements were observed in cross-correlation coefficients of limb movement and imaging assessments, indicating enhanced symmetry and structural improvements with reduced fibrosis. However, persistent discrepancies in elbow functions suggest that further targeted rehabilitation may be warranted. This report underscores the potential of a coordinated interprofessional approach to restore functional gait patterns in elephants and offers valuable insights for future rehabilitative strategies in managing complex musculoskeletal injuries in large mammals.

AB  - The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of tissue growth. Multiple Hippo signaling components are regulated via proteolytic degradation. However, how these degradation mechanisms are themselves modulated remains unexplored. Kibra is a key upstream pathway activator that promotes its own ubiquitin-mediated degradation upon assembling a Hippo signaling complex. Here, we demonstrate that Hippo complexdependent Kibra degradation is modulated by cortical tension. Using classical genetic, osmotic, and pharmacological manipulations of myosin activity and cortical tension, we show that increasing cortical tension leads to Kibra degradation, whereas decreasing cortical tension increases Kibra abundance. Our study also implicates Par -1 in regulating Kib abundance downstream of cortical tension. We demonstrate that Par -1 promotes ubiquitin-mediated Kib degradation in a Hippo complex-dependent manner and is required for tension-induced Kib degradation. Collectively, our results reveal a previously unknown molecular mechanism by which cortical tension affects Hippo signaling and provide novel insights into the role of mechanical forces in growth control.

AB  - The long-term impact of stroke on Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, particularly regarding sex-specific differences, remains unknown. Using a longitudinal study design, we investigated transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in 3.5-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) and wild-type mice. In vivo, we assessed behavior, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and structural integrity by neuroimaging, as well as post-mortem myelin integrity (polarized light imaging, PLI), neuroinflammation, and amyloid beta (A beta) deposition. APP/PS1 mice exhibited cognitive decline, white matter degeneration (reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)), and decreased myelin density via PLI. Despite early hypertension, APP/PS1 mice showed only sporadic hypoperfusion. Cortical thickening and hippocampal hypertrophy likely resulted from A beta accumulation and neuroinflammation. Stroke-operated mice retained cognition despite cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophy due to cerebrovascular adaptation, including increased CBF in the hippocampus and thalamus. Stroke did not worsen AD pathology, nor did AD exacerbate stroke outcomes. Sex differences were found: female APP/PS1 mice had more severe A beta deposition, hyperactivity, lower body weight, and reduced CBF but less neuroinflammation, suggesting potential neuroprotection. These findings highlight white matter degeneration and A beta pathology as key drivers of cognitive decline in AD, with stroke-related deficits mitigated by (cerebro)vascular adaptation. Sex-specific therapies are crucial for AD and stroke.

AB  - Opioid use disorders (OUD) and overdoses are ever-evolving public health threats that continue to grow in incidence and prevalence in the United States and abroad. Current treatments consist of opioid receptor agonists and antagonists, which are safe and effective but still suffer from some limitations. Murine and humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have emerged as an alternative and complementary strategy to reverse and prevent opioid-induced respiratory depression. To explore antibody applications beyond traditional heavy-light chain mAbs, we identified and biophysically characterized a novel single- domain antibody specific for fentanyl from a camelid variable- heavy-heavy (VHH) domain phage display library. Structural data suggested that VHH binding to fentanyl was facilitated by a unique domain-swapped dimerization mechanism, which accompanied a rearrangement of complementarity-determining region loops leading to the formation of a fentanyl-binding pocket. Structure-guided mutagenesis further identified an amino acid substitution that improved the affinity and relaxed the requirement for dimerization of the VHH in fentanyl binding. Our studies demonstrate VHH engagement of an opioid and inform on how to further engineer a VHH for enhanced stability and efficacy, laying the groundwork for exploring the in vivo applications of VHH-based biologics against OUD and overdose.

AB  - Involvement of the glutamate system, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction, has long been postulated to be part of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. An important development is provided by recent data that strongly implicate GRIN2A, the gene encoding the NR2A (GluN2A) NMDA receptor subunit, in the aetiology of the disorder. Rare variants and common variants are both robustly associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia. Some of the rare variants are point mutations likely affecting channel function, but most are predicted to cause protein truncation and thence result, like the common variants, in reduced gene expression. We review the genomic evidence, and the findings from Grin2a mutant mice and other models which give clues as to the likely phenotypic impacts of GRIN2A genetic variation. We suggest that one consequence of NR2A dysfunction is impairment in a form of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, producing deficits in short-term habituation and thence elevated and dysregulated levels of attention, a phenotype of relevance to schizophrenia and its cognitive aspects.

AB  - Objective Maternal mood disorders such as postpartum depression (PPD) can negatively affect the lives not only of mothers but also of partners. The purpose of this study investigates emotional behavior and hippocampal apoptosis alterations of the male live with a postpartum depressed female. Methods Pregnant rats in the stress group were exposed to restraint stress (RS). The male rats who shared the same cages were not exposed to RS. To explain the consequences of depressive-like behavior and anxiety, animals were exposed to the forced swim test (FST), open-field test (OFT), and elevated plus maze (EPM). The apoptotic cell number was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt)-mediated dUTP biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Results According to FST, PPD caused more immobility, reduced swimming, and climbing compared to control groups in the stressed female and male (p < 0.05). For the crossing number of squares in the center area, the main effect of the group was significant (p < 0.05). Stressed groups have a higher crossing number of squares in the center area compared to control groups. In the OFT, there was a significant increase in the time spent in the center area in the stress female and male group compared to the control female and male group (p < 0.05). For the EPM, time spent in the close arms was increased in the control male and stress male compared to the stress female group (p < 0.05). Female and male rats with PPD demonstrated apoptosis in neuron and glial cells in the hippocampus. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that RS results in PPD in females. Furthermore, it implicates RS as a potential risk factor for the development of postpartum mood disorder in males. Most of the studies on paternal PPD have been done by using self-report questionnaires. Studies on physiological and hormonal changes during the postpartum period among fathers would provide information on biological factors of depression.

AB  - Sceletium tortuosum (ST) induces antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, purportedly by monoamine regulation, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibition. These multimodal actions have not been demonstrated in an animal model of major depressive disorder. Wistar rats (both sexes) were subjected to 8-week unpredictable chronic mild stress, subsequently receiving saline, a standardized ST extract, Zembrin (R) 25 and 12.5 mg/kg (ZEM25 and ZEM12.5), its primary alkaloid mesembrine (MES), or escitalopram (20 mg/kg) for 36 days. Sucrose preference, open field, Barnes maze, and forced swim tests were performed, with cortico-hippocampal monoamines, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers analyzed post-mortem. Male, but not female rats, presented with increased anhedonia and anxiety but not despair. Males presented with increased hippocampal PDE4B expression, increased dopamine metabolites, and decreased cortical serotonin. In males, ZEM12.5 decreased anhedonia- and anxiety-like behavior, decreased cortical and hippocampal PDE4B, and increased plasma interleukin-10. MES induced a transient decrease in anhedonia-like behavior and increased hippocampal serotonergic and cortical dopaminergic activity, whilst decreasing hippocampal PDE4B. ZEM25 increased plasma interleukin-10 but decreased cortical glutathione, indicating paradoxical anti-inflammatory and prooxidant effects. ZEM12.5 and MES more effectively addressed anxious-depressive-like behavior and stress-induced inflammation and monoaminergic alterations, respectively. Multitargeted actions on monoamines, redox-inflammation, and PDE4 may provide ST with antidepressant effects across multiple symptom domains, although mutually synergistic/antagonistic effects of constituent alkaloids should be considered.

AB  - It has been shown that 5-methylcytosine (m5C), one of the most abundant modifications on RNA, regulates various biological processes. However, the function of m5C modification in the nervous system is still largely unknown. Here, we show that the m5C reader Ybx1 is highly expressed in the developing mouse hippocampus in the central nervous system (CNS). Conditional knockout of Ybx1 in the dentate gyrus (DG) decreases mossy fiber growth and affects short-term memory. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), the mRNA of Ybx1 is enriched in the axons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and can be locally translated. Inhibition of local translation of Ybx1 results in a decrease in axon growth. We further identify 28 target mRNAs of Ybx1 in DRG neurons, including Ttl and Mmp24. Axon-specific knockdown of Ttl and Mmp24 decreases axon growth rate both in DRG and DG. It could be a general mechanism that locally translated Ybx1 regulates axon growth by controlling local translation in both CNS and PNS.

AB  - A well-developed heart is essential for embryonic survival. There are constant interactions between cardiac tissue motion and blood flow, which determine the heart shape itself. Hemodynamic forces are a powerful stimulus for cardiac growth and differentiation. Therefore, it is particularly interesting to investigate how the blood flows through the heart and how hemodynamics is linked to a particular species and its development, including human. The appropriate patterns and magnitude of hemodynamic stresses are necessary for the proper formation of cardiac structures, and hemodynamic perturbations have been found to cause malformations via identifiable mechanobiological molecular pathways. There are significant differences in cardiac hemodynamics among vertebrate species, which go hand in hand with the presence of specific anatomical structures. However, strong similarities during development suggest a common pattern for cardiac hemodynamics in human adults. In the human fetal heart, hemodynamic abnormalities during gestation are known to progress to congenital heart malformations by birth. In this chapter, we discuss the current state of the knowledge of the prenatal cardiac hemodynamics, as discovered through small and large animal models, as well as from clinical investigations, with parallels gathered from the poikilotherm vertebrates that emulate some hemodynamically significant human congenital heart diseases.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The dried rattan stem of Tinospora sinensis (Lour.) Merr. is valued for its efficacy of clearing heat and removing toxicity, calming and soothing the nerves. It is widely used in Tibetan medicine for the treatment of rheumatic and aging diseases. Studies have confirmed its anti-inflammatory and ameliorating effects on Alzheimer's disease; however, the anti-neuroinflammation efficacy and mechanism remain unclear. Aim: This study aimed to explore the anti-neuroinflammation efficacy, major effective ingredients, and potential mechanism of extract of Tinosporae sinenisis (TIS). Methods: UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to identify the compounds of TIS and the plasma components of rats after gastric administration of TIS. C57BL/6 J mice were continuously intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (250 mu g/kg) for 14 d to establish a neuroinflammation model. The effects of TIS (4.5 g/kg, 9 g/kg) on the learning and memory abilities in mice with neuroinflammation was evaluated using spontaneous activity, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze tests. Pathological changes in the hippocampus were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Gene and protein levels of inflammatory factors in the brain were detected using qRT-PCR and ELISA kits. Iba-1 levels in the brain were detected using immunofluorescence to assess the degree of microglial activation. Network pharmacology, based on the components absorbed into plasma of TIS, was used to predict potential targets and pathways. Proteomics was used to study the differentially expressed proteins and related pathways in the brain tissue of mice with neuroinflammation. Finally, correlation analysis was performed on the results of network pharmacology and proteomics, and proteins related the antineuroinflammatory effect of TIS were detected by western blot. Results: A total of 39 compounds were identified in TIS: genipingentiobioside, isocorydin, reticuline, (-)-argemonine, tinosineside A, tinosinenside A, and costunolide were absorbed into the plasma. After continuous intraperitoneal injection of LPS into C57BL/6 J mice, microglia in the brain tissue were activated and the gene and protein levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and iNOS were increased in the brain tissue, suggesting that the neuroinflammation model was successfully established. TIS reduced Iba-1 levels and gene expression and protein levels of inflammatory factors in the brain of mice with neuroinflammation. Furthermore, TIS improved the pathological changes in the hippocampus and learning and memory abilities caused by neuroinflammation. Network pharmacology has predicted that TNF, IL-1 beta, and I kappa BKB are closely related to neuroinflammation. Proteomics identified key differentially expressed proteins, including TNF, NF-kappa B2, NF-kappa BIA, and TLR4. Toll-like receptor (TLR), NF-kappa B, and NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways are involved in neuroinflammationrelated pathways. Correlation analysis revealed TLR, TNF and NLR signaling pathways were closely related to the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of TIS. We observed that TIS alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kappa B/NLRP3 pathway. Conclusion: Thirty-nine compounds were identified from TIS, among which seven were absorbed into the plasma as prototype components. TIS alleviated LPS-induced neuroinflammation in mice, and its mechanism was related to inhibition of TLR4/NF-kappa B/NLRP3 kappa B/NLRP3 signaling pathway.

AB  - Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are forms of synaptic plasticity, thought to be the molecular basis of learning and memory, dependent on dynamic a-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) trafficking. Alteration of endosomal pH negatively affects synaptic transmission and neural development, but it is unclear how pH is involved in AMPAR trafficking. We show that the proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel localizes to early and recycling endosomes in neurons and prevents endosome hyper-acidification. Loss of PAC reduces AMPAR endocytosis during chemical LTD in primary neurons, while basal trafficking and LTP are unaffected. Pyramidal neuron-specific PAC knockout mice have impaired hippocampal LTD, but not LTP, and perform poorly in the Morris water maze reversal test, exhibiting impaired behavioral adaptation. We conclude that proper maintenance of endosomal pH by PAC in neurons is important during LTD to regulate AMPAR trafficking in a manner critical for animal physiology and behavior.

AB  - Intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau) in the brain is associated with cognitive and motor impairments, and ultimately neurodegeneration. We investigate how human pTau affects cells and network activity in the hippocampal formation of the THY-Tau22 tauopathy model mice in vivo. We find that pTau preferentially accumulates in deep-layer pyramidal neurons, leading to neurodegeneration, and we establish that pTau spreads to oligodendrocytes. During goal-directed virtual navigation in aged transgenic mice, we detect fewer high-firing prosubicular pyramidal cells, but the firing population retains its coupling to theta oscillations. Analysis of network oscillations and firing patterns of pyramidal and GABAergic neurons recorded in head-fixed and freely moving mice suggests preserved neuronal coordination. In spatial memory tests, transgenic mice have reduced short-term familiarity, but spatial working and reference memory are surprisingly normal. We hypothesize that unimpaired subcortical network mechanisms maintain cortical neuronal coordination, counteracting the widespread pTau aggregation, loss of high-firing cells, and neurodegeneration.

AB  - Mitochondria in neural progenitors play a crucial role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by being involved in fate decisions for differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mitochondria are related to the genetic regulation of neuronal differentiation in neural progenitors are poorly understood. Here, we show that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by amyloid-beta (A beta) in neural progenitors inhibits neuronal differentiation but has no effect on the neural progenitor stage. In line with the phenotypes shown in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice, A beta-induced mitochondrial damage in neural progenitors results in deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function. Based on hippocampal proteome changes after mitochondrial damage in neural progenitors identified through proteomic analysis, we found that lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A) in neural progenitors epigenetically suppresses differentiation in response to mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial damage characteristically causes KDM5A degradation in neural progenitors. Since KDM5A also binds to and activates neuronal genes involved in the early stage of differentiation, functional inhibition of KDM5A consequently inhibits adult hippocampal neurogenesis. We suggest that mitochondria in neural progenitors serve as the checkpoint for neuronal differentiation via KDM5A. Our findings not only reveal a cell-type-specific role of mitochondria but also suggest a new role of KDM5A in neural progenitors as a mediator of retrograde signaling from mitochondria to the nucleus, reflecting the mitochondrial status.
   Alzheimer's disease: a molecular link with mitochondrial damage Neural Stem cells in the brain that normally generate new neurons throughout life can become dysfunctional due to damage caused by the protein amyloid-beta to mitochondria, the intracellular energy-producing structures. Neuron generation is reduced in Alzheimer's disease, therefore understanding its causes could lead to new treatments. Dong Kyu Kim at Seoul National University, South Korea, and colleagues studied neuron generation in the hippocampus region of mouse brains. They found that the protein amyloid-beta, implicated in causing Alzheimer's, can induce dysfunctional neuron generation by damaging mitochondria in a way that affects the activity of a gene-regulating protein called KDM5A. The research reveals a central role for mitochondria of neural stem cells in neuron generation, and suggests that drugs supporting mitochondrial function might offer a new approach to treat Alzheimer's and perhaps other degenerative brain diseases.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotics on cognitive function and the regulation of cortisol and IL-1 beta in adolescents with depression. All 180 participants were randomly assigned to a study group (treated with probiotics combined with sertraline hydrochloride) and a control group (treated with sertraline hydrochloride). The repetitive Neuropsychological State Test (RBANS) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) were administered to MDD patients. The levels of serum cortisol and IL-1 beta were detected using an ELISA kit. Except for speech function, factors including immediate memory, visual span, attention function, delayed memory, and the RBANS in the study group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The levels of cortisol and interleukin-1 beta in the study group were significantly downregulated compared to those in the control group. Except for speech function, the cortisol level was negatively correlated with the RBANS total score and other factors in the study group. Interleukin-1 beta was also negatively correlated with the RBANS total score and each factor score. Cortisol and interleukin-1 beta were predictors of the RBANS total score, which explained 46.80% of the variance. Cortisol had significant predictive effects on attention function and delayed memory, and interleukin-1 beta had significant predictive effects on visual span and speech function. It could be concluded that probiotics could improve cognitive function in adolescents with depression by regulating cortisol and IL-1 beta levels.

AB  - Stress and circadian systems are interconnected through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to maintain responses to external stimuli. Yet, the mechanisms of how such signals are orchestrated remain unknown. Here, we uncover the gut microbiota as a regulator of HPA-axis rhythmicity. Microbial depletion disturbs the brain transcriptome and metabolome in stress-responding pathways in the hippocampus and amygdala across the day. This is coupled with a dysregulation of the circadian pacemaker in the brain that results in perturbed glucocorticoid rhythmicity. The resulting hyper-activation of the HPA axis at the sleep/ wake transition drives time-of-day-specific impairments of the stress response and stress-sensitive behaviors. Finally, microbiota transplantation confirmed that diurnal oscillations of gut microbes underlie altered glucocorticoid secretion and that L. reuteri is a candidate strain for such effects. Our data offer compelling evidence that the microbiota regulates stress responsiveness in a circadian manner and is necessary to respond adaptively to stressors throughout the day.

AB  - Over the last two decades, animal models have been used to evaluate the physiological and cognitive effects of mobile phone exposure. Here, we used a head-only exposure system in rats to determine whether exposure to 900 MHz GSM electromagnetic fields (EMFs) induces regional changes in neuronal activation as revealed by c-Fos imaging. In a first study, rats were exposed for 2 h to brain average specific absorption rates (BASARs) ranging from 0.5 to 6 W/kg. Changes in neuronal activation were found to be dose-dependent, with significant increases in c-Fos expression occurring at BASAR of 1 W/kg in prelimbic, infralimbic, frontal, and cingulate cortices. In a second study, rats were submitted to either a spatial working memory (WM) task in a radial maze or a spatial reference memory (RM) task in an open field arena. Exposures (45 min) were conducted before each daily training session (BASARs of 1 and 3.5 W/kg). Control groups included sham-exposed and control cage animals. In both tasks, behavioral performance evolved similarly in the four groups over testing days. However, c-Fos staining was significantly reduced in cortical areas (prelimbic, infralimbic, frontal, cingulate, and visual cortices) and in the hippocampus of animals engaged in the WM task (BASARs of 1 and 3.5 W/kg). In the RM task, EMF exposure-induced decreases were limited to temporal and visual cortices (BASAR of 1 W/kg). These results demonstrate that both acute and subchronic exposures to 900 MHz EMFs can produce region-specific changes in brain activity patterns, which are, however, insufficient to induce detectable cognitive deficits in the behavioral paradigms used here.

AB  - Background: Camel milk (CM) has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent against oxidative stress (OS)-related disorders, particularly metabolic syndrome. CM contains bioactive compounds such as lactoferrin, alpha-lactalbumin, and Vitamin C, which contribute to its antioxidant properties. Objective: This review examines the antioxidant properties of CM and its bioactive components in combating OS and managing metabolic syndrome. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted focusing on studies that explored the antioxidant properties of CM and its impact on OS and metabolic syndrome. Results: The findings indicated CM possesses significant antioxidant properties, mainly attributed to its bioactive compounds, which can inhibit the production of various reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby reducing OS. Evidence suggests that CM enhances the body's antioxidative defense, improves insulin sensitivity, and supports liver and kidney function. CM's multifaceted approach shows promise as a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders related to OS. Conclusion: Considering its robust antioxidant qualities and capacity to regulate immune responses while enhancing metabolic health indicators, CM may be a valuable asset in the natural therapeutic repertoire to counter metabolic syndromes. Further clinical trials and research are essential to fully comprehend the therapeutic potential of CM, including dosage, long-term implications, and integration within extensive treatment schemes for metabolic syndromes and associated disorders. Recommendation: The use of CM to reduce OS requires further clinical studies to confirm its benefits and identify key compounds. Standardization of production and processing is essential for quality and safety, and research into potential risks and side effects is needed, especially for those with specific health conditions. Enhancing the accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of production methods is critical. Fortifying camel's milk with vitamins and minerals can improve its nutritional value.

AB  - Salicylic acid (SA) is an important plant hormone and signal required for establishing resistance to diverse pathogens and plant diseases. The abundant polyphenols in tea plants also defend plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. However, whether exogenous SA would increase the resistance of tea plants to adversity and the relationship between SA and polyphenols are still poorly understood. Here, we carried out SA treatment on tea seedlings and performed transcriptome sequencing. SA treatment inhibited the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolic pathways but promoted the lignin metabolic pathways. The increased accumulation of lignin in tea leaves after treating with SA indicated that lignin might coordinate SA, enhance, and improve plant defense and disease resistance. Simultaneously, an SA-inducible flavonoid glucosyltransferase (CsUGT0554) specifically involved in 7-OH site glycosylation was characterized in vitro. These results provided valuable information about the effects of SA on tea seedlings and the molecular basis for SA-mediated immune responses.

AB  - RNA-protein interactions orchestrate hundreds of pathways in homeostatic and stressed cells. We applied an RNA-protein interactome capture method called protein cross-linked RNA extraction (XRNAX) to shed light on the RNA-bound proteome in dysmyelination. We found sets of canonical RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulating alternative splicing and engaged in the cytoplasmic granules to be perturbed at the level of their RNA interactome. We validated these observations for PCBP1 and MBNL1. We show that the number of PCBP1 bodies is markedly increased in the mossy cells of the hippocampus and that the pattern of MBNL1-regulated alternatively spliced exons differs between the myelin-deficient and the wild-type brain, which is likely associated with Mbnl1 splicing perturbation and circular RNA generation from this locus. In the broader perspective, our results demonstrate that, with the application of the RNA-protein interactome approach, we can uncover alterations in RBP functioning in the disease context that are not always directly visible from their mRNA or protein levels.

AB  - Historically, the banking system has been critical to the development of economies by addressing funds efficiently-from customer savings and investors to the productive activities of people and companies, financing consumer goods and current expenses, housing, infrastructure projects and providing liquidity to the market. However, it must be transformed to respond to emerging demands in society for better financial products and services with a positive impact on living conditions and well-being. To achieve this, banks must create economic value-that is to say, banks should create profits in a sustained manner-in order to also create social value and thus generate shared value. The purpose of this study was twofold. The first aim was to identify the main factors that contributed to the majority of Mexican banking profits in the period from 2003 to 2021; the second aim of the study was to provide an innovative metric of banking performance. Using supervised machine learning algorithms and Principal Component Analysis, two prediction models were tested, and two banking performance indices were defined. The findings show that Random Forest is a reliable profit prediction model with a lower mean absolute error between the predicted yearly profit and losses and the actual data. There are no significant ranking position differences between the two performance indices. The first performance index obtained is novel due to its simplicity, since it is built on the basis of five values associated with commercial banking activity. In Mexico, no similar studies have been published. The indicator most widely used by regulators worldwide is the CAMELS index, which is a weighted average of the capital adequacy level, asset quality, management capacity, profitability, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk. Its scale of 1 to 5 is useful for identifying the robustness and solvency of a bank, but not necessarily its capacity to generate profits. This approach might encourage banks to remain aware of their potential to create shared value and to develop competitive strategies to increase benefits for stakeholders.

AB  - Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora) belongs to the Genus Pinus, and its bark contains a great amount of naturally occurring phenolic compounds. Until now, few studies have been conducted to assess the neuroprotective effects of Pinus densiflora bark extract against brain ischemic injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of pre-treatment with the extract in the hippocampus following 5-min transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils. Furthermore, this study examined the anti-inflammatory effect as a neuroprotective mechanism of the extract. Pinus densiflora bark was extracted by pure water (100 degrees C), and this extract was quantitatively analyzed and contained abundant polyphenols, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins. The extract (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) was orally administered once a day for seven days before the ischemia. In the gerbil hippocampus, death of the pyramidal neurons was found in the subfield cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) five days after the ischemia. This death was significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg, not 25 or 50 mg/kg, of the extract. The treatment with 100 mg/kg of the extract markedly inhibited the activation of microglia (microgliosis) and significantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha). In addition, the treatment significantly increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 4 and interleukin 13). Taken together, this study clearly indicates that pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of Pinus densiflora bark extract in gerbils can exert neuroprotection against brain ischemic injury by the attenuation of neuroinflammatory responses.

AB  - Encoding of episodic memories relies on stimulus-specific information processing and involves the left prefrontal cortex. We here present an incidental finding from a simultaneous EEG-TMS experiment as well as a replication of this unexpected effect. Our results reveal that stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with slow repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to enhanced word memory performance. A total of 40 healthy human participants engaged in a list learning paradigm. Half of the participants (N = 20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC, while the other half (N = 20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the vertex and served as a control group. Participants receiving left DLPFC stimulation demonstrated enhanced memory performance compared to the control group. This effect was replicated in a within-subjects experiment where 24 participants received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC and vertex. In this second experiment, DLPFC stimulation also induced better memory performance compared to vertex stimulation. In addition to these behavioural effects, we found that 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC induced stronger beta power modulation in posterior areas, a state that is known to be beneficial for memory encoding. Further analysis indicated that beta modulations did not have an oscillatory origin. Instead, the observed beta modulations were a result of a spectral tilt, suggesting inhibition of these parietal regions. These results show that applying 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC, an area involved in episodic memory formation, improves memory performance via modulating neural activity in parietal regions.

AB  - (1) Background: Over the past 10 years, a number of scientific studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of cannabinoid compounds present in the Cannabis Sativa and Indica plants. However, their role in mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration following cerebral ischemia is yet unclear. (2) Methods: We investigated the effects of Cannabis extracts (Bedrocan, FM2) or selected cannabinoids (Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabigerol) in rat organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of forebrain global ischemia. Cell death in the CA1 subregion of slices was quantified by propidium iodide fluorescence, and morphological analysis and tissue organization were examined by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. (3) Results: Incubation with the Bedrocan extract or THC exacerbated, whereas incubation with the FM2 extract or cannabidiol attenuated CA1 injury induced by OGD. Delta(9)-THC toxicity was prevented by CB1 receptor antagonists, the neuroprotective effect of cannabidiol was blocked by TRPV2, 5-HT1A, and PPAR gamma antagonists. Confocal microscopy confirmed that CBD, but not THC, had a significant protective effect toward neuronal damage and tissue disorganization caused by OGD in organotypic hippocampal slices. (4) Conclusions: Our results suggest that cannabinoids play different roles in the mechanisms of post-ischemic neuronal death. In particular, appropriate concentrations of CBD or CBD/THC ratios may represent a valid therapeutic intervention in the treatment of post-ischemic neuronal death.

AB  - In recent years, erythropoietin (EPO) has emerged as a useful neuroprotective and neurotrophic molecule that produces antidepressant and cognitive-enhancing effects in psychiatric disorders. However, EPO robustly induces erythropoiesis and elevates red blood cell counts. Chronic administration is therefore likely to increase blood viscosity and produce adverse effects in non-anemic populations. Carbamoylated erythropoietin (CEPO), a chemically engineered modification of EPO, is non-erythropoietic but retains the neurotrophic and neurotrophic activity of EPO. Blood profile analysis after EPO and CEPO administration showed that CEPO has no effect on red blood cell or platelet counts. We conducted an unbiased, quantitative, mass spectrometry-based proteomics study to comparatively investigate EPO and CEPO-induced protein profiles in neuronal phenotype PC12 cells. Bioinformatics enrichment analysis of the protein expression profiles revealed the upregulation of protein functions related to memory formation such as synaptic plasticity, long term potentiation (LTP), neurotransmitter transport, synaptic vesicle priming, and dendritic spine development. The regulated proteins, with roles in LTP and synaptic plasticity, include calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type 1 (Camk1), Synaptosomal-Associated Protein, 25 kDa (SNAP-25), Sectretogranin-1 (Chgb), Cortactin (Cttn), Elongation initiation factor 3a (Eif3a) and 60S acidic ribosomal protein P2 (Rplp2). We examined the expression of a subset of regulated proteins, Cortactin, Grb2 and Pleiotrophin, by immunofluorescence analysis in the rat brain. Grb2 was increased in the dentate gyrus by EPO and CEPO. Cortactin was induced by CEPO in the molecular layer, and pleiotrophin was increased in the vasculature by EPO. The results of our study shed light on potential mechanisms whereby EPO and CEPO produce cognitive-enhancing effects in clinical and preclinical studies.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental impairment due to hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) lacks effective biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Based on some cues from published papers, extracellular serine/threonine protein kinase FAM20C was speculated to play a crucial role in the neurodevelopmental impairment of HIBD. In this study, FAM20C was found suppressed in the ischemic hippocampal tissue of HIBD. The inhibition of FAM20C caused by HIBD affected cell differentiation and subsequently caused cognitive impairment. KAP1 was identified as a kinase substrate of FAM20C in the central nervous system. The regulation of the YTHDC1-NCL-KAP1-LINE1 RNA complex by FAM20C was mediated through KAP1 phosphorylation and LINE1 RNA m6A. These alterations consequently modulated the establishment of the H3K9me3 modification on LINE1 DNA, thereby resulting in neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, E2F4, identified as a transcription factor, regulated FAM20C in HIBD. This research has clarified the novel association between FAM20C and HIBD, laying the foundation for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to counteract neurodevelopmental disruptions arising from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

AB  - Background: Severe neurological condition like Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a significantly negative impact on families and society, wherein there is no proven cure. As one of the principal active constituents of Achyranthes bidentata Blume, ecdysterone (ECR) has demonstrated antioxidant and cognitive dysfunction improvement effects. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying the improvement of cognitive dysfunction by ECR remains unclear. This study sought to ascertain whether ECR may allebviate cognitive impairment by reducing oxidative stress via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) antioxidant system through Akt/GSK3 beta pathway. Methods: In terms of the experimental procedure, we determined the neuroprotective benefits of ECR in vivo via a cognitive impairment model of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), we performed procedures such as behavioral testing, biochemical assaying, Nissl and TUNEL stainings, as well as flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Furthermore, we investigated the underlying mechanistic action of ECR by activating PC12 cells with beta-amyloid peptide fragment 25-35 (A beta 25-35). Results: In vivo studies showed that ECR effectively improved cognitive impairment in SAMP8 via enhancement of learning and memory capabilities, but decreased oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuronal damage in the hippocampus. During the in vitro study, we observed that ECR dose-dependently reduced the oxidative stress and apoptosis that were induced in PC12 cells by A beta 25-35. Additionally, the use of Akt inhibitors further established the potential of ECR to control Nrf2 through activation of the Akt/GSK3 beta pathway and protect the PC12 cells from A beta 25-35 induced damage. Conclusions: These findings offer proof that ECR reduces cognitive impairment by triggering the Nrf2 antioxidant system via the Akt/GSK3 beta pathway and offer fresh information on ECR's potential as a promising therapeutic development candidate for AD.

AB  - In most of the world, wheat is one of the main staple foods, and is also widely used in livestock feed. In the current study, we investigated the effects of wheat grain consumption on the rat behavior and neurogenesis markers. Thirty male rats were divided into three equal groups (n = 10). Group 1 was the control group fed with chow diet (Carbohydrates 63%, fat 13% and protein 24%), the Group 2 rats were fed with whole grains and the Group 3 rats were fed with refined grains. After 12 weeks, we measured the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. Also, we evaluated the rat behavior by forced swimming test (FST) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Additionally, we measured serum level of glucose, lipid profile, insulin and cortisol. Weight gain at the end of the study was measured in each group. The rats on a diet of whole and refined grains had low BDNF, NT-3, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin significantly (p < .01) in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex as compared to control rats. Moreover, the MDA increased significantly with significant reduction in GSH versus the control rats. Moreover, in response to grain consumption, the performance in FST showed a significant (p < .01) shortage in the latency of the attempts to escape as well as a significant prolongation (p < .01) in behavioral immobility as compared to control rats with significant (p < .05) prolongation in time spent in closed arm in EPM. An exclusive diet of either whole or refined grain in a rat model induced anxiety and depressive behaviors and negatively affected the BDNF and NT-3 and modulated the level of the neurotransmitters with significant shift in their behavior. Practical applications Grains are considered the major caloric source all over the world that may predispose to the development of chronic diseases. In this research, we evaluated the role of grains in modulating the rate of production of neurogenic factors in rats.

AB  - The current research aims to analyze the shape and structural features of the eggs of the lepidoptera species Melitaea sp. (Lepidoptera, Nympalidae) and develop design solutions through the implementation of a novel strategy of biomimetic design. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the chorion reveals a medial zone that forms an arachnoid grid resembling a ribbed dome with convex longitudinal ribs and concave transverse ring members. A parametric design algorithm was created with the aid of computer-aided design (CAD) software Rhinoceros 3D and Grasshopper3D in order to abstract and emulate the biological model. A series of physical models were manufactured with variations in geometric parameters like the number of ribs and rings, their thickness, and curvature. Selective laser sintering (SLS) technology and Polyamide12 (nylon) material were utilized for the prototyping process. Quasi-static compression testing was carried out in conjunction with finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate the deformation patterns and stress dispersion of the models. The biomimetic ribbed dome appears to significantly dampen the snap-through behavior that is observed in typical solid and lattice domes, decreasing dynamic stresses developed during the response and preventing catastrophic failure of the structure. Increasing the curvature of the ring segments further reduces the snap-through phenomenon and improves the overall strength. However, excessive curvature has a negative effect on the maximum sustained load. Increasing the number and thickness of the transverse rings and the number of the longitudinal ribs also increases the strength of the dome. However, excessive increase in the rib radius leads to more acute snap-through behavior and an earlier failure. The above results were validated using respective finite element analyses.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bacopa monnieri (BM) is commonly employed in the Indian traditional system of medicines, i.e. Ayurveda as a memory booster, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, sedative and anti-epileptic for decades.
   Aim of the study: To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of Bacopa monnieri (BM) in experimental model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Wistar rats and explore its mechanism of action.
   Materials and methods: BacoMind, was evaluated for its neuroprotective effect in valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD. For in-vivo study, the pregnant female Wistar rats were divided in two groups; normal control (NC) and VPA group who received single dose of normal saline (0.9%) or 600 mg/kg dose of VPA respectively on gestation day (G.D) 12.5. After the birth, all pups were segregated according to the sex. All the male pups from the dams were divided into six groups: Group 1 (NC, treated with only 0.9% normal saline, group 2 (VPA, treated 600 mg/kg on G.D12.5 and normal saline from post natal day (PND) 23 to 43), group 3 (risperidone 2.5 mg/kg, PND 23 to 43) and groups 4, 5 and 6 (BM 20, 40, 80 mg/kg, PND 23 to 43). All experimental groups were subjected to batteries of behavior parameters (three chamber sociability test, Morris Water Maze, elevated plus maze, open field and rota rod test), biochemical parameters such as oxidative stress (GSH, SOD, Catalase, MDA), inflammatory cytokines (Il-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha), histopathological examination (cresyl violet staining) of hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. Further, the mRNA as well as protein expression of AMPA receptor was evaluated using RT-PCR and western blot respectively to study the mechanism of neuroprotective effect of BM. The in-silico analysis followed evaluating the binding profile of different constituents of BacoMind with AMPA receptor.
   Results: The results of the in-vivo study indicated BM at 80 mg/kg ameliorated abnormal behavioral paradigms such as social deficits, repetitive behavior, learning and memory impairments, and motor coordination exhibited by the VPA model of ASD in rats. Furthermore, BM was found to have a significant anti-oxidant (increasing GSH, SOD, and catalase and decreasing MDA levels) and anti-inflammatory properties (decreasing IL-1 beta, 6, TNF-alpha). The histopathological score was also found to be significantly improved by BM in a dose dependent manner in both HC and PFC. In addition to this, the up-regulated mRNA as well as protein expression of AMPA receptor was significantly reduced by 80 mg/kg dose of BM in both HC and PFC. Further, the in-silico analysis of different constituents of BacoMind with AMPA receptor demonstrated that luteolin and apigenin showed good binding to both the competitive antagonist binding site, non-competitive antagonist binding site and allosteric modulator site while Bacosaponin C showed good binding to the non-competitive antagonist binding site.
   Conclusion: The present study concluded that BM can be a potential candidate for ameliorating the ASD symptoms in rats and acts via modulating the up-regulated AMPA receptor expression.

AB  - CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy resulting from pathological mutations in the X-linked cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene. Despite significant progress in understanding the neuronal function of CDKL5, the molecular mechanisms underlying CDD-associated epileptogenesis are unknown. Here, we report that acute ablation of CDKL5 from adult forebrain glutamatergic neurons leads to elevated neural network activity in the dentate gyrus and the occurrence of early-onset spontaneous seizures via tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) signaling. We observe increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and enhanced activation of its receptor TrkB in the hippocampus of Cdkl5-deficient mice prior to the onset of behavioral seizures. Moreover, reducing TrkB signaling in these mice rescues the altered synaptic activity and suppresses recurrent seizures. These results suggest that TrkB signaling mediates epileptogenesis in a mouse model of CDD and that targeting this pathway might be effective for treating epilepsy in patients affected by CDKL5 mutations.

AB  - Simple Summary Foals are commonly subjected to surgeries related to umbilical pathologies. Due to side effects of systemic analgesics and the immaturity of their organ systems, it is challenging to provide adequate analgesia. It is in this context that the role of regional anaesthesia allows for the provision of good quality analgesic coverage, reducing the potential complications associated with systemic analgesic drugs such as opioids. Ultrasound-guided locoregional techniques are commonly employed in both human and veterinary medicine to provide accurate, safe, and effective analgesia in the regions of interest. The rectus sheath block provides adequate analgesia in procedures involving the umbilical area in humans and has been described in other species, including dogs, pigs, calves, and lately in adult horses. The aim of this study was to describe an ultrasound-guided periumbilical rectus sheath block in foal cadavers and evaluate the spread of the contrast media injected. The results obtained indicated that this approach could provide analgesia around the umbilical area due to the nerves stained. However, further studies evaluating the clinical efficacy of the rectus sheath block are necessary.Abstract In neonatal equines, pathologies involving umbilical structures are an important cause of morbidity, and surgical removal of urachal remnants is a common procedure in clinical practice. Surgery involving the ventral abdominal wall can cause substantial pain, leading to complications and prolonged recovery. The objectives of this study were to describe a two-point bilateral ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block at the level of the umbilicus and to evaluate the extent of dye distribution in foal cadavers. Ten foal cadavers were included in the study, in which a bilateral two-point ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block was performed-one injection 5 cm cranially and a second one 5 cm caudally to the umbilicus. The injectate consisted of a mixture of iodinated contrast medium and blue dye at a volume of 0.25 mL kg-1 per injection point (total 1 mL kg-1). After the injection, computer tomography and subsequent dissection of the ventral abdominal wall were performed. The extension of the contrast medium, the number of stained nerves, and contamination of the abdominal cavity were evaluated. The cranio-caudal extension of the contrast ranged from 0.8 to 1.4 cm per milliliter of injectate. The most commonly stained ventral branches of spinal nerves were thoracic (Th) nerves 16, 17, and 18 (95%, 85%, and 80% of the nerves, respectively). Abdominal contamination was found in four animals. The results suggest that the block could provide periumbilical analgesia. Further studies with different volumes of injectate and living animals are warranted.

AB  - Plants employ both direct and indirect defense mechanisms to combat herbivorous insects, with volatile emissions playing a critical role in attracting natural enemies of pests. This study investigates the effects of Atailing, a plant immunity inducer, on rice (Oryza sativa) defenses against the striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis, SSB). Behavioral assays revealed that Atailing-treated rice plants significantly enhanced Trichogramma japonicum (the major egg parasitoid of C. suppressalis) attraction, increasing C. suppressalis oviposition parasitism rates (direct, 94.7%; indirect, 131.1%), confirming indirect defense as an active strategy induced by Atailing. GC-MS analysis identified six key functional compounds that significantly attract T. japonicum. Chemical and biological assays demonstrated that the concentrations of salicylic acid (SA) and trypsin inhibitors (TrypPIs) were significantly increased by 30.1% and 13.2%, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of Atailing in modulating volatile emissions to attract natural enemies and provide evidence of its potential as a sustainable pest management tool.

AB  - Ferroptosis and neuroinflammation play crucial roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Forsythoside A (FA), the main constituent of Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl., possesses anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of FA in AD neuropathology using male APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice, A beta(1-42)-exposed N2a cells, erastin-stimulated HT22 cells, and LPS-induced BV2 cells. FA treatment significantly improved mitochondrial function and inhibited lipid peroxidation in A beta(1-42)-exposed N2a cells. In LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, FA treatment decreased the formation of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1 beta, and NO. In male APP/PS1 mice, FA treatment ameliorated memory and cognitive impairments and suppressed A beta deposition and p-tau levels in the brain. Analyses using proteomics, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and western blot revealed that FA treatment significantly augmented dopaminergic signaling, inhibited iron deposition and lipid peroxidation, prevented the activation of IKK/IKB/NF-kappa B signaling, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, and promoted the production of anti-inflammatory factors in the brain. FA treatment exerted anti-ferroptosis and anti-neuroinflammatory effects in erastin-stimulated HT22 cells, and the Nrf2/GPX4 axis played a key role in these effects. Collectively, these results demonstrate the protective effects of FA and highlight its therapeutic potential as a drug component for AD treatment.

AB  - Objective The present study was to clarify the improving effect of artemisinin on diabetes-induced cognitive deficit and the underlying mechanisms in mice. Methods Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mouse models were established by a single dose of STZ injection (100 mg/kg, i.p.). Those animals were then treated with vehicle or artemisinin (40 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 4 weeks. Cognitive performances of the mice were evaluated by novel object recognition, Y maze test and Morris water maze test. After behavioral tests, the expressions of PI3K, Akt, SYN and PSD-95 proteins in the hippocampus were measured by Western blot. Changes in the synaptic ultrastructure of the hippocampalCA1 region were observed by transmission electron microscope. Results Our results indicated that artemisinin significantly ameliorated cognitive deficit in T2DM mice. Furthermore, PI3K and phosphorylated Akt protein levels in the hippocampus of T2DM mice treated with artemisinin were elevated, accompanied with increases in the number of hippocampal neurons, as well as the protein contents of SYN and PSD-95. Meanwhile, synaptic plasticity was also rescued, indicated by an increase in synapse number and synaptic curvature, the thickness of postsynaptic density, and a decrease in the width of synaptic cleft in the hippocampal CA1 region. Conclusion Taken together, these results demonstrate that artemisinin can protect T2DM mice against cognitive decline, at least partially through activating PI3K/Akt pathway to improve synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that artemisinin may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for diabetic cognitive impairment.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that berberine has neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease, including antagonizing tau phosphorylation, and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity and neural cell apoptosis. However, its low bioavailability and adverse reactions with conventional administration limit its clinical application. In this study, we prepared berberine nanoliposomes using liposomes characterized by low toxicity, high entrapment efficiency, and biodegradability, and modified them with lactoferrin. Lactoferrin-modified berberine nanoliposomes had uniform particle size and high entrapment efficiency. We used the lactoferrin-modified berberine nanoliposomes to treat a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease established by injection of amyloid-beta 1-42 into the lateral ventricle. Lactoferrin-modified berberine nanoliposomes inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity and apoptosis in the hippocampus, reduced tau over-phosphorylation in the cerebral cortex, and improved mouse behavior. These findings suggest that modification with lactoferrin can enhance the neuroprotective effects of berberine nanoliposomes in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of terpinen-4-ol (TER) supplementation on the intestinal barrier function of pigs. Five groups of fifty 28-day-old piglets with comparable body weights were randomly assigned to the following groups: the control group (CON), the lipopolysaccharide group (LPS), the low TER group (PLT), the middle TER group (PMT), and the high TER group (PHT). The basal diet was given to the CON and LPS groups, and 30, 60, or 90 mg/kg TER was added to the basal diet for the TER groups. After the 21-day trial period, piglets in the LPS and TER groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mu g/kg body weight of LPS, whereas the piglets in the CON group received an injection of 0.9% normal saline solution. The results showed that LPS stimulation resulted in a decrease (p < 0.05) in the depth of colonic crypts in piglets, which was greater (p < 0.05) in the TER group. Compared with those in the CON group, the number of goblet cells and MUC2 expression were decreased in the colon of piglets in the LPS group, while these parameters were increased in the PMT group (p < 0.05). The malondialdehyde (MDA) content was greater in the colon of the LPS group than in that of the CON group, while the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were lower in the colon of the LPS group; conversely, the MDA content was lower in the colons of the PLT and PMT groups than in those of the LPS group (p < 0.05). TER also reduced (p < 0.05) LPS-induced upregulation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha expression, along with the relative gene expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 in the colon of piglets (p < 0.05). Compared with those in the CON group, the abundances of Firmicutes and UCG-005 in the LPS group were lower (p < 0.05), and those in the TER group were significantly greater than those in the LPS group. Compared with those in the CON group, the abundance of Proteobacteria in the LPS group increased (p < 0.05), while the abundance of Actinobacteria and Phascolarctobacterium increased (p < 0.05) in the colon of the PHT group compared with that in the LPS group. In conclusion, TER effectively improved the intestinal barrier function of the colon in weaning piglets. Based on the results of this study, the appropriate dose of TER in the diets of weaning piglets was 60 mg/kg.

AB  - ContextMenhaden fish oil (FO) is widely recognized for inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses and preserving brain function. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of FO influencing brain cognitive function in diabetic states remain unclear.ObjectiveThis study examines the potential role of FO in suppressing LPS-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in diabetic animals (DA).Materials and methodsThirty male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: i) DA received LPS induction (DA-LPS); ii) DA received LPS induction and 1 g/kg FO (DA-LPS-1FO); iii) DA received LPS induction and 3 g/kg FO (DA-LPS-3FO); iv) animals received normal saline and 3 g/kg FO (NS-3FO) and v) control animals received normal saline (CTRL). Y-maze test was used to measure cognitive performance, while brain samples were collected for inflammatory markers and morphological analysis.ResultsDA received LPS induction, and 1 or 3 g/kg FO significantly inhibited hyperglycaemia and brain inflammation, as evidenced by lowered levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Additionally, both DA-LPS-1FO and DA-LPS-3FO groups exhibited a notable reduction in neuronal damage and glial cell migration compared to the other groups. These results were correlated with the increasing number of entries and time spent in the novel arm of the Y-maze test.Discussion and conclusionThis study indicates that supplementation of menhaden FO inhibits the LPS signaling pathway and protects against neuroinflammation, consequently maintaining cognitive performance in diabetic animals. Thus, the current study suggested that fish oil may be effective as a supporting therapy option for diabetes to avoid diabetes-cognitive impairment.

AB  - The neurotransmitter glutamate plays an essential role in excitatory neurotransmission; however, excessive amounts of glutamate lead to excitotoxicity, which is the most common pathogenic feature of numerous brain disorders. This study aimed to investigate the role of butyl 2-[2-(2-fluorophenyl)acetamido]benzoate (HFP034), a synthesized anthranilate derivative, in the central glutamatergic system. We used rat cerebro-cortical synaptosomes to examine the effect of HFP034 on glutamate release. In addition, we used a rat model of kainic acid (KA)-induced glutamate excitotoxicity to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of HFP034. We showed that HFP034 inhibits 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced glutamate release from synaptosomes, and this inhibition was absent in the absence of extracellular calcium. HFP034-mediated inhibition of glutamate release was associated with decreased 4-AP-evoked Ca2+ level elevation and had no effect on synaptosomal membrane potential. The inhibitory effect of HFP034 on evoked glutamate release was suppressed by blocking P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and protein kinase C (PKC). Furthermore, HFP034 inhibited the phosphorylation of PKC and its substrate, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) in synaptosomes. We also observed that HFP034 pretreatment reduced neuronal death, glutamate concentration, glial activation, and the levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, calpains, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP 78), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and caspase-12 in the hippocampus of KA-injected rats. We conclude that HFP034 is a neuroprotective agent that prevents glutamate excitotoxicity, and we suggest that this effect involves inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release through the suppression of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and PKC/MARCKS pathways.

AB  - As a variety of free radical scavenger, edaravone has shown its potential in producing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in various disease models. However, the underlying mechanism behind the neuroprotective effects of edaravone remained unclear. This study is aimed at determining the effects of edaravone on neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory through a propofol-induced neural injury rat model. Firstly, an observation was made of apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of developing under the influence of propofol. It was found out that propofol could produce inflammatory effects in the hippocampus by enhancing the astrogliosis (GFAP) activation and elevating the level of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Meanwhile, the increase of apoptosis cells and the decrease of neurons (NeuN) were speculated to aggravate neural injury. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that edaravone intervention can reverse the neural apoptosis and inflammation. Additionally, the intraperitoneal injection of edaravone, the intraperitoneal injection of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mimicking small compound (7,8 dihydroxyflavone) and the intracranial injection of the exogenous BDNF were all respectively effective in alleviating the propofol-induced neural apoptosis and inflammation in the hippocampus. It was also found out that edaravone-activated downstream signalling through tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) receptors in astrocyte, microglia and neuron. However, the neural injury of propofol had no impact on long-term learning and memory, except causing a short-term neurotoxicity. In conclusion, edaravone could alleviate the propofol-induced neural injury in developing rats through BDNF/TrkB pathway.

AB  - Background: Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) has attracted increased attention, but its precise mechanism remains to be explored. This study aimed to figure out whether HDAC6 could regulate NLRP3-induced pyroptosis by modulating the functions of HSP70 and HSP90 in microglia to participate in postoperative cognitive dysfunction in aged mice. Methods: Animal models of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in aged mice were established by splenectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia. Morris water maze was used to examine the cognitive function and motor ability. Sixteen-months-old C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into six groups: control group (C group), sham surgery group (SA group), splenectomy group (S group), splenectomy + HDAC6 inhibitor ACY-1215 group (ACY group), splenectomy + HDAC6 inhibitor ACY1215 + HSP70 inhibitor Apoptozole group (AP group), splenectomy + solvent control group (SC group). The serum and hippocampus of mice were taken after mice were executed. The protein levels of HDAC6, HSP90, HSP70, NLRP3, GSDMD-N, cleaved-Caspase-1 (P20), IL -18 were detected by western blotting. Serum IL -18, IL -6 and S1008 were measured using ELISA assay, and cell localization of HDAC6 was detected by immunofluorescence. In vitro experiments, BV2 cells were used to validate whether this mechanism worked in microglia. The protein levels of HDAC6, HSP90, HSP70, NLRP3, GSDMD-N, P20, IL -18 were detected by western blotting and the content of IL -18 in the supernatant was measured using ELISA assay. The degree of acetylation of HSP90, the interaction of HSP70, HSP90 and NLRP3 were analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation assay. Results: Splenectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia in aged mice could prolong the escape latency, reduce the number of crossing platforms, increase the expression of HDAC6 and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome to induce pyroptosis in hippocampus microglia. Using ACY-1215 could reduce the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the pyroptosis of microglia and the degree of spatial memory impairment. Apoptozole could inhibit the binding of HSP70 to NLRP3, reduce the degradation of NLRP3 and reverse the protective effect of HDAC6 inhibitors. The results acquired in vitro experiments closely resembled those in vivo, LPS stimulation led to the pyroptosis of BV2 microglia cells and the release of IL -18 due to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, ACY-1215 showed the anti-inflammatory effect and Apoptozole exerted the opposite effect. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hippocampal HDAC6 promotes POCD by regulating NLRP3-induced microglia pyroptosis via HSP90/HSP70 in aged mice.

AB  - Hippocampal place cells are activated sequentially as an animal explores its environment. These activity sequences are internally recreated ('replayed'), either in the same or reversed order, during bursts of activity (sharp wave-ripples [SWRs]) that occur in sleep and awake rest. SWR-associated replay is thought to be critical for the creation and maintenance of long-term memory. In order to identify the cellular and network mechanisms of SWRs and replay, we constructed and simulated a data-driven model of area CA3 of the hippocampus. Our results show that the chain-like structure of recurrent excitatory interactions established during learning not only determines the content of replay, but is essential for the generation of the SWRs as well. We find that bidirectional replay requires the interplay of the experimentally confirmed, temporally symmetric plasticity rule, and cellular adaptation. Our model provides a unifying framework for diverse phenomena involving hippocampal plasticity, representations, and dynamics, and suggests that the structured neural codes induced by learning may have greater influence over cortical network states than previously appreciated.

AB  - Background: To explore the effect of albiflorin (AL) on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) in rats.
   Methods: A mouse model of diabetic encephalopathy was established by intraperitoneal injection of 1%STZ. Step down test and water maze test were used to test the cognitive function of rats. Congo Red Staining was used to detect the distribution of A beta plaques in the hippocampus of rats. Cytokine levels in serum and hippocampus were measured using ELISA. Serum insulin, oral glucose tolerance (OGTT), serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were measured by commercial kits. And the content of Nrf-2/HO-1/HMGB1/NF-kB in the hippocampus of diabetic rats were detected by western blot.
   Results and Conclusion: Compared with the STZ model group, the average escape latency of rats in the AL group in the Morris water maze test was significantly shortened, and the average number of platform crossings and the ratio of distance/total swimming distance in the target quadrant were increased significantly. Staining of tissue sections and ELISA showed a decrease in A beta plaque density in the hippocampus of rats in the AL group. And serum insulin levels of rats in the ALgroup were significantly reduced and OGTT was improved. In addition, AL could also regulate the Nrf-2/HO-1/HMGB1/NF-kB signal pathway in the hippocampus. Therefore, AL may ameliorate STZ-induced cognitive impairment in rats by regulating oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain.

AB  - Concussions are a current health concern and account for the vast majority of head trauma. While symptoms after a single impact are usually transient, repetitive concussions, as often occur in sports, are responsible for persistent acute and chronic deficits. Here, we used a model of bilateral midline-centered concussions in mice to show that repetitive concussions selectively induce impairments in learning ability compared to single-impact injuries. Since microglial cells and their activation are considered key factors in degenerative pathology after brain trauma, we examined their structure and function after single and repetitive concussions in the cortex underlying the concussions and in the hippocampus. We found that only repetitive concussions led to a significant long-lasting structural activation of microglia and an increase in microglia-mediated engulfment of presynaptic excitatory synapses, while the elimination of inhibitory synapses was not altered. Since the density of excitatory input did not change during the 6-week study period, we hypothesize that there is a turnover of excitatory synapses following repetitive concussion that can be compensated for, anatomically but not behaviorally.

AB  - Parishin C (PaC) is an active ingredient in Gastrodia elata Bl. that has neuroprotective effects. However, research on its role in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation is still limited. This study used LPS-stimulated HT22 cells to investigate the antioxidant properties of PaC. Through the co-culture system of HT22 and BV2 cells, the effect of PaC on neuroinflammation was explored. The current results indicated that PaC can inhibit the levels of reactive oxygen species and peroxides in LPS-stimulated HT22 cells and increase the levels of antioxidant factors. Meanwhile, PaC can also inhibit neuronal ferroptosis and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in BV2 cells. Importantly, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of PaC are achieved by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. The WB and IF results indicated that PaC can promote nuclear translocation of Nrf2, activate downstream antioxidant factors, and thereby regulate inflammatory responses. Inhibition of Nrf2 can significantly inhibit the regulation of PaC on the Nrf2 signaling pathway. These results indicated that PaC can activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation.

AB  - Although biofuels have many benefits, but their production costs are high. This challenge has caused researches to use waste materials and apply technologies to lower the cost of producing these fuels. In this study, a biocompatible heterogeneous catalyst created from calcining camel bones is employed to make biodiesel fuel from non-edible bitter almond oil (BAO). Additionally, using ultrasound technology was one way to increase the effectiveness of the biodiesel synthesis process. Additionally, the effects of the independent variables alcohol to oil molar ratio (6:1, 11:1, and 16:1), reaction time (10, 20, and 30 minutes), ultrasonic power (30, 65, and 100%), catalyst loading (4, 8, and 12 oil wt%), and reaction time (10, 20, and 30 minutes) on the production of methyl ester from BAO were examined. Camel bones were calcined at 400, 700, and 1000 degrees C for 2, 3, and 4 hours. Optimum temperature and time conditions for camel bones calcination with maximum methyl ester production of 88% were obtained at 1000 degrees C and 3 hours after measuring the morphology structure of camel bones catalyst using XRD and TGA methods. The maximum biodiesel conversion rate of 92.3% was obtained using the calcined catalyst with a molar ratio of 11:1, a catalyst loading of 8%, an ultrasonic power of 100%, and a reaction time of 20 minutes. Using the response surface methodology, tests and optimization were performed by Design-Expert software. Biodiesel yield and energy consumption were 88.13% and 248.18 kJ in the optimal conditions suggested by the software with the conditions of maximum production and minimum energy consumption with appropriate weighting. According to the results, waste camel bone can be used as a cost-effective biocompatible source with favorable catalytic activity for biodiesel fuel production.

AB  - Several species of amoebae in the genus Entamoeba forming four-nucleated mature cysts are pathogenic, but their identification is challenging due to a lack of distinctive morphological traits. Furthermore, host species cannot reliably be used as a criterion for identification. In this study, several isolates of four-nucleated cyst-forming Entamoeba species from animals at the Zoo Aquarium of Madrid are genetically identified. Entamoeba cysts were identified through microscopic analysis of faecal samples; none of the animals exhibited symptoms. DNA was extracted, and a fragment of the SSU-rRNA gene was PCR-amplified and sequenced to identify the species. Entamoeba dispar was identified in mantled guerezas (Colobus guereza), lar gibbons (Hylobates lar), greater rheas (Rhea americana) and giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). Entamoeba hartmnanni was detected in mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Entamoeba nuttalli was detected in mandrills; the analysis of sequences available in GenBank revealed that this species has also been detected in human samples. The identification of the Entamoeba species across diverse host species underscores the need for genetic confirmation to prevent misidentifications. These findings expand the known host range of these species and emphasize the importance of regular monitoring to minimize transmission risks, including potential cross-species transmission to/from humans.

AB  - Simple Summary The diets of ornamental aquaculture and aquarium fish usually differ significantly from the diets and types of diets present in natural habitats. These differences can significantly affect the health and welfare of the reared animals. One popular group of aquarium fish is the Anabantoidei fish, which can breathe atmospheric air using an additional respiratory organ-the labyrinth. These fish are commonly bred for both ornamental and consumption purposes. The structure of the digestive system of labyrinth fish such as African bush fish (Ctenopoma acutirostre) and paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis) is currently not known. In the present experiment, the fishes were studied and characterized based on their morphological and histological body structures. The results obtained suggest that although both species are generally regarded as omnivorous, their digestive tract structures have some differences, including the structure of the mouth, mouth cavity and esophagus, which indicate that the African bush fish is much better adapted to carnivorous feeding than the paradise fish. The results obtained will enable better feeding strategies to be developed for these Anabantoidei, thus improving their health in both commercial and domestic breeding.Abstract Anabantidae is a large and diverse group of fish cultured both under aquaculture conditions and as a hobby. These fish share a common structural feature in the form of an additional respiratory organ. Despite the enormous availability of these fish worldwide, little is known about their feeding preferences in husbandry and their influence on homeostasis under both industrial and domestic conditions. This study describes, for the first time, the structure of the digestive tracts of two Anabantoidei fishes: African bush fish (Ctenopoma acutirostre) and paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis). The overall structure of the digestive tract and its histological structure were analyzed and compared in both fish species. Physiological predispositions indicated a predominance of omnivorous fish traits in M. opercularis in contrast to C. acutirostre, which has several morphological traits indicating greater adaptation to carnivory, particularly ichthyophagy. The results obtained will allow further research to be conducted in the future to optimize the nutrition and feeding of these fish and to develop appropriate dietary recommendations.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Febrile seizure is a common neurologic disorder with limited treatment occurring in infants and children under the age of five. Jujuboside B (JuB) is a main bioactive saponin component isolated from the Chinese anti-insomnia herbal medicine Ziziphi Spinosae Semen (ZSS), seed of Ziziphus jujuba Mill, which has been proved to exhibit neuroprotective effects recently.Aim of the study: In this study, we aimed at elucidating the effect of JuB on suppressing febrile seizure and the potential mechanisms. Methods: Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording was used to monitor the severity of febrile seizures. The JuB in the brain was identified by mass spectrometry. Neuronal excitability was investigated using patch clamp.Results: JuB (30 mg/kg) significantly prolonged seizure latency and reduced the severity in hyperthermiainduced seizures model mice. Hippocampal neuronal excitability was significantly decreased by JuB. And JuB significantly reduced the excitatory synaptic transmission mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-iso-xazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), including evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), and miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, JuB also significantly inhibited recombinant GluA1 and GluA2 mediated AMPA current in HEK293 cell and decreased the upregulation of [Ca2+]i induced by AMPA in primary cultured cortex neurons.Conclusions: JuB suppressed the excitability of hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the activity of AMPAR and reducing the intracellular free calcium, thereby relieving febrile seizures.

AB  - Excessive iron levels are believed to contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders by promoting oxidative stress and harmful protein clustering. Novel chelation treatments that can effectively remove excess iron while minimizing negative effects on the nervous system are being explored. This study focuses on the creation and evaluation of innovative nanobubble (NB) formulations, shelled with various polymers such as glycol-chitosan (GC) and glycol-chitosan conjugated with deferoxamine (DFO), to enhance their ability to bind iron. Various methods were used to evaluate their physical and chemical properties, chelation capacity in diverse iron solutions and impact on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Notably, the GC-DFO NBs demonstrated the ability to decrease amyloid-beta protein misfolding caused by iron. To assess potential toxicity, in vitro cytotoxicity testing was conducted using organotypic brain cultures from the substantia nigra, revealing no adverse effects at appropriate concentrations. Additionally, the impact of NBs on spontaneous electrical signaling in hippocampal neurons was examined. Our findings suggest a novel nanochelation approach utilizing DFO-conjugated NBs for the removal of excess iron in cerebral regions, potentially preventing neurotoxic effects.

AB  - Background: Pristimerin (Pri), a natural quinone methide triterpenoid isolated from Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae, exhibits potent antitumor activity against various cancers. However, the mechanism of apoptosis induction by Pri in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its anti-OSCC effect in vivo has not been widely studied.
   Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the anti-OSCC activities of Pri in vitro and in vivo and addressed the potential mechanisms of Pri-induced apoptosis.
   Methods: The effects of Pri on OSCC cells were analyzed by cell viability, colony formation and flow cytometry assays. Western blotting and qRT-PCR assays were chosen to detect the expression of proteins and genes. The anti-OSCC efficacy of Pri in vivo was evaluated by CAL-27 xenografts.
   Results: We showed that Pri inhibited the proliferation of human OSCC cell lines. Additionally, Pri induced apoptosis by upregulating Noxa expression. Furthermore, Pri treatment triggered excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activation and subsequently induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. ROS scavengers and ER stress inhibitors significantly attenuated Pri-induced OSCC cell apoptosis. Finally, Pri suppressed tumor growth in CAL-27 xenografts, accompanied ER stress activation and cell apoptosis.
   Conclusion: These results reveal that Pri suppressed tumor growth and triggered cell apoptosis through ER stress activation in OSCC cells and xenografts, suggesting that Pri may serve as a therapeutic agent for OSCC.

AB  - Alhagi camelorum (AC) is an old plant with a significant therapeutic value throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The overuse of cisplatin (Cis > 50 mg/m(2)) is associated with observed nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, gastrotoxicity, myelosuppression, and allergic reactions. Remedial measures are needed for the protection of nephrotoxicity against cisplatin. Thus, we investigated the nephroprotective effects of AC plant extract to prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in albino Wistar rats. The presence of polyphenols, phenolic compounds, tannins, and saponins was revealed during phytochemical investigation, and a significantly intense antioxidant activity was recorded. There were no toxicological symptoms in the treated rats, and no anatomical, physiological, or histological abnormalities were found compared to the control rats. The results of correcting cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity revealed that the extract has a significant ability to treat kidney damage, with most parameters returning to normal after only three weeks of therapy. It is concluded that co-administration of cisplatin with AC extract showed exceptional nephroprotective effects at a dose of 600 mg/kg for Cis-induced nephrotoxicity.

AB  - Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is key to proteome diversity; however, the biological roles of alternative splicing (AS) in signaling pathways remain elusive. Here, we focus on TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1), a YAP binding factor in the Hippo signaling pathway. Public database analyses showed that expression of YAP-TEAD target genes negatively correlated with the expression of a TEAD1 isoform lacking exon 6 (TEAD1(Delta E6)) but did not correlate with overall TEAD1 expression. We confirmed that the transcriptional activity and oncogenic properties of the full-length TEAD1 isoform were greater than those of TEAD1(Delta E6), with the difference in transcription related to YAP interaction. Furthermore, we showed that RNA-binding Fox-1 homolog 2 (RBFOX2) promoted the inclusion of TEAD1 exon 6 via binding to the conserved GCAUG element in the downstream intron. These results suggest a regulatory mechanism of RBFOX2-mediated TEAD1 AS and provide insight into AS-specific modulation of signaling pathways.

AB  - Objective Spatial working memory (SWM) is an important function in cognitive behavior, and working memory impairment can seriously affect the patient's life and cause great stress to the patient. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) has been shown to regulate working memory function by entrainment of neural oscillations in different frequencies of the brain, but its regulation of working memory-related neural oscillations and their synchronization is not clear. The purpose of this study was to study the effect of iTBS on neural oscillation and synchronization in local and transbrain regions of rats, and to explore the mechanism of iTBS in regulating working memory. Methods Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into four groups according to their age and whether they received iTBS stimulation (AS: adult stimulation group, AC: adult control group, ES: elderly stimulation group, EC: elderly control group). Using the methods of time-frequency distribution, phase synchronization and phase-amplitude coupling analysis, the changes of local field potential signal neural oscillations in the prefrontal and hippocampal brain regions of theta and gamma bands in the process of spatial working memory behavioral tasks in each group of rats were compared and analyzed, and the relationship between the changes of neural oscillations in the two brain regions and the changes in spatial working memory ability of rats was judged based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results With the increase of age, the time taken by the elderly rats to learn the spatial working memory task rules increased significantly (P=0.005 P =0.005 6), and the time taken by iTBS stimulation to learn the SWM task rules in adult rats (P=0.001 P =0.001 1) and elderly rats (P=0.009 P =0.009 0) was shortened. At the same time, compared with adult rats, the time-frequency energy of theta and gamma band neural oscillations in the prefrontal and hippocampal brain regions of elderly rats (theta: P <0.000 1; gamma: P <0.000 1) and phase-amplitude coupling across brain regions (PFC-HPC: P =0.000 2; HPC-PFC: P =0.027 7) decreased to a certain extent, and iTBS stimulation could increase the time-frequency energy of neural oscillations of adult rats (theta: P <0.000 1; gamma: P <0.000 1) and elderly rats (theta: P =0.014 4; gamma: P =0.000 6) and the phase-amplitude coupling effect across brain regions in elderly rats (PFC-HPC: P =0.018 0; HPC-PFC: P =0.022 1). In addition, the time-frequency energy and phase-amplitude coupling of signals in each frequency band of the two brain regions were positively correlated with the behavioral accuracy of rats, while the phase synchronization of theta band and gamma band neural oscillations in the two brain regions during working memory was not correlated with the behavioral accuracy. Conclusion iTBS can enhance SWM ability and cognitive function in elderly rats, and this improvement is associated with increased coupling of time-frequency energy and cross-brain phase amplitude of neural oscillations across theta and gamma bands during SWM tasks. Similarly, in adult rats, iTBS enhances SWM ability and cognitive function by increasing the time-frequency energy of theta and gamma band neural oscillations in both brain regions during SWM tasks. Furthermore, in addition to the main findings, this study provides evidence supporting the state-dependent effects of iTBS stimulation to some extent.

AB  - Pronounced elevation of glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma B (GPNMB) is a common phenomenon in a variety of brain diseases, but the expression patterns, functions, and molecular signaling of GPNMB have not been well studied. Here, we showed that pathological factors, including neuronal degeneration caused by seizures, caspase-3-induced neuronal apoptosis, neuronal debris, and b-amyloid, induced "on-demand"GPNMB expression in hippocampal microglia. Genetic ablation of GPNMB did not affect acute seizures but worsened chronic epileptogenesis. We found that GPNMB functioned in phagocytosis, deficiency of which resulted in defects in both phagocytic engulfment and degradation. GPNMB could be internalized into cells, where it wrapped engulfed pathogenic particles and presented them to lysosomes through interaction with lysosomal vacuolar-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A (ATP6V1A). Activating ATP6V1A was able to rescue GPNMB-deficiency-caused phagocytosis impairment. Thus, microglial GPNMB-ATP6V1A might be a common treatment target of a batch of chronic neurological disorders, and clearing the degenerative neurons might be more valuable than reserving them to protect the brain.

AB  - Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit distinct gut microbiota, which may promote gut-derived inflammation. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic that can modify gut microbiota. The present study investigated the effect of rifaximin on gut microbiota and inflammation status in PD. The study examined the effect of long-term rifaximin treatment on in vivo transgenic PD mice (MitoPark) and short-term rifaximin treatment on patients with PD. Rifaximin treatment caused a significant change in gut microbiota in the transgenic PD mice; in particular, it reduced the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae UCG-001 and increased the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Muribaculum, and Lachnospiraceae UCG-001. Rifaximin treatment attenuated serum interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, claudin-5 and occludin, which indicated the reduction of systemic inflammation and the protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity. The rifaximin-treated MitoPark mice exhibited better motor and memory performance than did the control mice, with lower microglial activation and increased neuronal survival in the hippocampus. In the patients with PD, 7-day rifaximin treatment caused an increase in the relative abundance of Flavonifractor 6 months after treatment, and the change in plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels was negatively associated with the baseline plasma interleukin-1 alpha level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that rifaximin exerted a neuroprotective effect on the transgenic PD mice by modulating gut microbiota. We observed that patients with higher baseline inflammation possibly benefited from rifaximin treatment. With consideration for the tolerability and safety of rifaximin, randomized controlled trials should investigate the disease-modification effect of long-term treatment on select patients with PD.

AB  - Most central nervous diseases are accompanied by astrocyte activation. Autophagy, an important pathway for cells to protect themselves and maintain homeostasis, is widely involved in regulation of astrocyte activation. Reactive astrocytes may play a protective or harmful role in different diseases due to different phenotypes of astrocytes. It is an urgent task to clarify the formation mechanisms of inflammatory astrocyte phenotype, A1 astrocytes. Sestrin2 is a highly conserved protein that can be induced under a variety of stress conditions as a potential protective role in oxidative damage process. However, whether Sestrin2 can affect autophagy and involve in A1 astrocyte conversion is still uncovered. In this study, we reported that Sestrin2 and autophagy were significantly induced in mouse hippocampus after multiple intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, with the elevation of A1 astrocyte conversion and inflammatory mediators. Knockdown Sestrin2 in C8-D1A astrocytes promoted the levels of A1 astrocyte marker C3 mRNA and inflammatory factors, which was rescued by autophagy inducer rapamycin. Overexpression of Sestrin2 in C8-D1A astrocytes attenuated A1 astrocyte conversion and reduced inflammatory factor levels via abundant autophagy. Moreover, Sestrin2 overexpression improved mitochondrial structure and morphology. These results suggest that Sestrin2 can suppress neuroinflammation by inhibiting A1 astrocyte conversion via autophagy, which is a potential drug target for treating neuroinflammation.image

AB  - Clinical studies have found that neonatal sevofiurane exposure can increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction. However, recent studies have found that it can exhibit neuroprotective effects in some situations. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of sevofiurane neonatal exposure in rats. A total of 144 rat pups (72 males and 72 females) were assigned to six groups and separately according to sevofiurane exposure of different times on the seventh day after birth. Blood gas analysis and western blot detection in the hippocampus were conducted after exposure. The Morris water maze test was conducted on the 32nd to 38th days after birth. The expression of PSD95 and synaptophysin in the hippocampus was detected after the Morris water maze test. We found that neonatal exposure to sevofiurane promoted apoptosis in the hippocampus, and Bax and caspase-3 were increased in a dose-dependent manner. The 2-h exposure had the greatest effects on cognitive dysfunction. However, with the extension of exposure time to 6 h, the effects on cognitive function were partly compensated. In addition, sevofiurane exposure decreased synaptogenesis in the hippocampus. However, as the exposure time was extended, the suppression of synaptogenesis was attenuated. In conclusion, neonatal sevofiurane exposure exhibited duration-dependent effects on cognitive function via Bax-caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and bidirectional effects on synaptogenesis in rats.

AB  - Ginsenosides, the primary bioactive constituents of ginseng, are recognized for its potential to mitigate cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Nevertheless, its molecular targets within cerebral tissues remain to be elucidated. First, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) combined with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify potential proteins of ginsenosides intersecting in the disease databases. Secondly, biolayer interferometry (BLI) was used to detect and verify the strongest binding compounds and to predict binding sites through molecular docking. Next, the functional characteristics and molecular properties of these candidate proteins were analyzed by bioinformatics. Finally, the mRNA expression levels of candidate genes in murine hippocampus were quantified via qRT-PCR following PPD treatment. Integration of CETSA proteomic data with the disease database identified three overlapping gens. BLI analysis and molecular docking showed that compound K (CK) and ginsenoside Rh2 were well combined with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). CK and PPD work well with ATXN10. PPD, Rh2 and ANXA2 are well combined. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the target genes were significantly enriched in AMPA glutamate receptors. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that PPD administration modulated the mRNA expression of synaptic proteins, including PSD95, ANXA2, and the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, in murine hippocampal tissue. These results suggest that PSD95, ANXA2 and ATXN10 are potential brain targets of ginsenosides in cognitive impairment. PPD has a good effect on the mRNA expression of PSD95, ANXA2 and GluA1 in the brain of mice with cognitive impairment.

AB  - Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima BL.) is a well-known fruit tree that has been cultivated in East Asia for millennia. Leaves and buds of the plant can become seriously infested by the gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus (GWDK), which results in gall formation and associated significant losses in fruit production. Herbivore-induced terpenes have been reported to play an important role in plant-herbivory interactions, and in this study, we show that upon herbivory by GWDK, four terpene-related compounds were significantly induced, while the concentrations of these four compounds in intact buds were relatively low. Among these compounds, (E)-nerolidol and (E, E)-alpha-farnesene have frequently been reported to be involved in plant herbivory defenses, which suggests direct and/or indirect functions in chestnut GWDK defenses. Candidate terpene synthase (TPS) genes that may account for (E)-nerolidol and (E, E)-alpha-farnesene terpene biosynthesis were characterized by transcriptomics and phylogenetic approaches, which revealed altered transcript levels for two TPSs: CmAFS, a TPS-g subfamily member, and CmNES/AFS, a TPS-b clade member. Both genes were dramatically upregulated in gene expression upon GWDK infestation. Furthermore, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that CmAFS catalyzed the formation of (E, E)-alpha-farnesene, while CmNES/AFS showed dual (E)-nerolidol and (E, E)-alpha-farnesene synthase activity. Biochemical assays of the recombinant CmAFS and CmNES/AFS proteins confirmed their catalytic activity in vitro, and the enzymatic products were consistent with two of the major volatile compounds released upon GWDK-infested chestnut buds. Subcellular localization demonstrated that CmAFS and CmNES/AFS were both localized in the cytoplasm, the primary compartment for sesquiterpene synthesis. In summary, we show that two novel sesquiterpene synthase genes CmAFS and CmNES/AFS are inducible by herbivory and can account for the elevated accumulation of (E, E)-alpha-farnesene and (E)-nerolidol upon GWDK infestation and may be implicated in chestnut defense against GWDK herbivores.

AB  - Only a few studies have investigated olfactory function in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) using psychophysical testing, and there is a scarcity of data regarding taste evaluation in the existing literature. The primary objectives of this study were to assess both smell and taste in patients with OSAS and to explore the correlation between the severity of symptoms and sensory perception. A total of 85 OSAS patients and a control group comprising 81 subjects were enrolled. Initial assessments included anamnesis, nasal endoscopy, and the completion of questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Visual Analogue Scale, Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders, and the importance of olfaction questionnaire). The diagnosis of OSAS was confirmed by polysomnography, while nasal airflow was evaluated using rhinomanometry. Olfaction was assessed using the Sniffin' Sticks test, and the Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) score was calculated. Taste evaluation was conducted in a subgroup of participants (42 patients, 38 controls) using taste strips. The mean TDI score was 31 +/- 5.6 for OSAS patients and 35 +/- 4.6 for controls, indicating a significant difference (P < 0.001). Similarly, the taste score was 7 +/- 3.0 for OSAS patients and 12.6 +/- 3.2 for controls (P < 0.001). No correlations were observed between TDI and Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) (r = -0.12; P = 0.28), as well as between the taste score and AHI (r = -0.31; P = 0.22). However, a weak but significant correlation between TDI score and Epworth Sleepiness Scale was detected (r = -0.05; P = 0.002). The study revealed a significant decrease in sensory perception among patients with OSAS, though open questions persist about the pathophysiology.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) make a crucial contribution to the innate immune response. TLR5 was expressed in embryoid body derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and beta III-tubulin-positive cells under all-trans retinoic acid-treated condition. TLR5 was upregulated during neural differentiation from mESCs and augmented the neural differentiation of mESCs via nuclear factor-kappa B and interleukin 6/CREB pathways. Besides, TLR5 was expressed in SOX2- or doublecortin-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus where adult neurogenesis occurs. TLR5 inhibited the proliferation of adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) by regulating the cell cycle and facilitated the neural differentiation from the adult hippocampal NSCs via JNK pathway. Also, TLR5 deficiency impaired fear memory performance in mice. Our data suggest that TLR5 is a crucial modulator of neurogenesis from mESCs and adult hippocampal NSCs in mice and represents a new therapeutic target in neurological disorders related to cognitive function.

AB  - Drug abuse changes neurophysiological functions at multiple cellular and molecular levels in the addicted brain. Well-supported scientific evidence suggests that drugs negatively affect memory formation, decision-making and inhibition, and emotional and cognitive behaviors. The mesocorticolimbic brain regions are involved in reward-related learning and habitual drug-seeking/taking behaviors to develop physiological and psychological dependence on the drugs. This review highlights the importance of specific drug-induced chemical imbalances resulting in memory impairment through various neurotransmitter receptor-mediated signaling pathways. The mesocorticolimbic modifications in the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) impair reward-related memory formation following drug abuse. The contributions of protein kinases and microRNAs (miRNAs), along with the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation have also been considered in memory impairment underlying drug addiction. Overall, we integrate the research on various types of drug-induced memory impairment in distinguished brain regions and provide a comprehensive review with clinical implications addressing the upcoming studies.

AB  - Lycopus maackianus Makino belongs to the Labiatae family and is used in traditional medicine to manage postpartum edema and boils. However, few studies on its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects have been conducted. Here, the compounds in L. maackianus methanol (MeOH) extract were profiled using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis. The antioxidant activity of L. maackianus MeOH extract was shown to increase in a concentration-dependent manner by investigating the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity. Next, in lipopolysaccharide-treated BV2 cells, L. maackianus extract inactivated the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway, inhibiting nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production and inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression. Furthermore, L. maackianus extract protected against oxidative stress-induced cellular damage in glutamate-stimulated HT22 cells. L. maackianus MeOH extract induced heme oxygenase-1 expression and increased the translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 in the nucleus, thus exhibiting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, the in vivo antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the extract were demonstrated in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model treated with hydrogen peroxide and lipopolysaccharide. MeOH L. maackianus extract showed antioxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory effects by increasing the expression of heme oxygenase-1, establishing its therapeutic potential for neuroinflammatory diseases.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cecropia pachystachya (CP) Tre ' cul is a medicinal plant native to South and Central America with several pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective. Aim of the study: In this study, we investigated the effect of CP extract (200 mg/kg) and its enriched flavonoid fraction (EFF-CP) (50 and 100 mg/kg) in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. Material and methods: CP and EFF-CP were administered intragastrically for 14 days and LPS (250 lig/kg) was administered intraperitoneally from the 8th to the 14th days. LC/DAD/MS analysis showed the presence of isoorientin, orientin, and isovitexin as major compounds. Results: The results demonstrated that CP extract and EFF-CP gave protection against LPS-induced short-term and long-term memory deficits. The treatment with CP and/or EFF-CP protected against LPS-induced increases in reactive species, nitrites, total thiol and lipoperoxidation in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Moreover, CP and EFF-CP restored superoxide dismutase and catalase activities that had been reduced by LPS in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. TNF-alpha levels were increased in the cortex, striatum and hippo-campus in the LPS group, while CP treatment prevented this change in the cerebral cortex. EFF-CP decreased the levels of this cytokine in all structures analyzed at both doses. Conclusion: CP extract and its EFF-CP are important therapeutic targets for the management of neuro-inflammation observed in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Dysregulation of G9a, a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, has been observed in Alzheimer's disease and has been correlated with increased levels of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Likewise, microRNAs are involved in many biological processes and diseases playing a key role in pathogenesis, especially in multifactorial diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, our aim has been to provide partial insights into the interconnection between G9a, microRNAs, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. To better understand the biology of G9a, we compared the global microRNA expression between senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) control mice and SAMP8 treated with G9a inhibitor UNC0642. We found a downregulation of miR-128 after a G9a inhibition treatment, which interestingly binds to the 3 ' untranslated region (3 '-UTR) of peroxisome-proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPARG) mRNA. Accordingly, Pparg gene expression levels were higher in the SAMP8 group treated with G9a inhibitor than in the SAMP8 control group. We also observed modulation of oxidative stress responses might be mainly driven Pparg after G9a inhibitor. To confirm these antioxidant effects, we treated primary neuron cell cultures with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative insult. In this setting, treatment with G9a inhibitor increases both cell survival and antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, up-regulation of PPAR gamma by G9a inhibitor could also increase the expression of genes involved in DNA damage responses and apoptosis. In addition, we also described that the PPAR gamma/AMPK axis partially explains the regulation of autophagy markers expression. Finally, PPAR gamma/GADD45 alpha potentially contributes to enhancing synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis after G9a inhibition. Altogether, we propose that pharmacological inhibition of G9a leads to a neuroprotective effect that could be due, at least in part, by the modulation of PPAR gamma-dependent pathways by miR-128.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematode infections (GINs) in ruminants are a major constraint to efficient livestock production worldwide. Currently, only a limited number of anthelmintic drugs are available for the control of these infections, but their widespread use in preventive deworming campaigns and the incorrect administration of the drugs are responsible for the emergence of resistance. Therefore, new anthelmintic drugs are urgently needed. However, drug discovery methods for new anthelmintics based on GINs isolated from ruminants often have low throughput. In this study, a screening of five commercial collections of chemical compounds, including one collection of anti-infective drugs, three plant-based natural product collections, and one collection from the FDA-approved Chinese Pharmacopoeia, with a total of 2228 molecules, have been carried out in a high-throughput format. In the single slot screen, 32 compounds (1.44% success rate) achieved a >70% motility inhibition rate. Of these, 10 are known anthelmintic drugs, while the remaining 22 were tested against Haemonchus contortus and a resistant strain of Teladorsagia circumcincta. Four compounds (two flavonoids, chalcone and trans-chalcone), and two anti-infectives (octenidine and tolfenpyrad), showed anthelmintic activity with EC50 values below 20 mu M, and were further tested for their safety against HepG2 spheroids and mouse intestinal organoids. Trans-chalcone and chalcone emerged as promising candidates for future development, showing selective indexes > 5, while tolfenpyrad and octenidine require careful evaluation due to their toxicity profiles.

AB  - Generalization from past experience is an important feature of intelligent systems. When faced with a new task, one efficient computational approach is to evaluate solutions to earlier tasks as candidates for reuse. Consistent with this idea, we found that human participants (n = 38) learned optimal solutions to a set of training tasks and generalized them to novel test tasks in a reward-selective manner. This behavior was consistent with a computational process based on the successor representation known as successor features and generalized policy improvement (SF&GPI). Neither model-free perseveration or model-based control using a complete model of the environment could explain choice behavior. Decoding from functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that solutions from the SF&GPI algorithm were activated on test tasks in visual and prefrontal cortex. This activation had a functional connection to behavior in that stronger activation of SF&GPI solutions in visual areas was associated with increased behavioral reuse. These findings point to a possible neural implementation of an adaptive algorithm for generalization across tasks.

AB  - Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on cognitive function of vascular dementia (VD) rats and its mechanism. Methods VD rat model was established by modified two-vessel occlusion (2-VO). After modeling, TEAS and electroacupuncture (EA) were used to stimulate Baihui and Zusanli points of rats respectively for 14 d. After treatment, novel object recognition test, Morris water maze test, and Y maze test were used to evaluate the spatial memory and learning ability of rats. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the morphology of hippocampal neurons. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of hippocampal mitochondria. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to detected the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, MDA and ROS in serum of rats. Western blot was used to detect the expression of PGC-1 alpha, TFAM, HO-1, NQO1 proteins in the hippocampus, Keap1 protein in the cytoplasm and Nrf2, NRF1 proteins in the nucleus. Results After treatment for 14 d, compared to the model group, the escape latency of VD rats decreased, while the discrimination index, the times of rats crossing the original platform area, the residence time in the original platform quadrant, and the percentage of alternation increased. TEAS can improve the structure of hippocampal neurons and mitochondria of VD rats, showing that neurons were arranged more regularly and distributed more evenly, nuclear membrane and nucleoli were clearer, and mitochondrial swelling were reduced, mitochondrial matrix density were increased, and mitochondrial cristae were more obvious. The levels of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT in serum increased significantly, while the concentration of MDA and ROS decreased. TEAS also up-regulated the expression levels of PGC-1 alpha TFAM, NQO1 and HO-1 proteins in the hippocampus and Nrf2, NRF1 proteins in the nucleus, but down-regulated the Keap1 protein in the cytoplasm. Conclusion TEAS can improve cognition, hippocampal neurons and mitochondrial structure of VD rats, and the effect is better than EA. The mechanism may be the activation of PGC-1 alpha mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant stress, which also provides a potential therapeutic technology and experimental basis for the treatment of VD.

AB  - Little is known about the neural basis of lower- and higher-order olfactory functions such as odor memory, compared with other sensory systems. The aim of this study was to explore neural networks and correlates associated with 3 functions: passive smelling (PS), odor encoding (OE), and in particular odor recognition memory (ORM). Twenty-six healthy participants were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging conducted across 3 sessions, one for each function. Independent component analysis revealed a difference between sessions where a distinct ORM component incorporating hippocampus and posterior cingulate showed delayed triggering dissociated from odor stimulation and recognition. By contrasting Hit for ORM (target odors correctly recognized as old) and a combination of PS and detected odors from OE, we found significantly lower activations in amygdala, piriform cortex, insula, thalamus, and the inferior parietal lobule. Region of interest analysis including anterior insula, posterior cingulate gyrus, dentate gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, amygdala, and piriform cortex demonstrated that Hit were associated with lower activations compared with other memory responses. In summary, our findings suggest that successful recognition of familiar odors (odor familiarity) is associated with neural suppression in the above mentioned regions of interest. Additionally, network including the hippocampus and posterior cingulate is engaged in a postrecognition process. This process may be related to incidental encoding of less familiar and more novel odors (odor novelty) and should be subject for future research.

AB  - The synthesis of melatonin (MLT) physiologically decreases during aging. Treatment with MLT has shown anxiolytic, hypnotic, and analgesic effects, but little is known about possible age-dependent differences in its efficacy. Therefore, we studied the effects of MLT (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) on anxiety-like behavior (open field (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPMT), three-chamber sociability, and marble-burying (MBT) tests), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-dorsal hippocampus (dHippo) circuit in adolescent (35-40 days old) and adult (three-five months old) C57BL/6 male mice. MLT did not show any effect in adolescents in the OFT and EPMT. In adults, compared to vehicles, it decreased locomotor activity and time spent in the center of the arena in the OFT and time spent in the open arms in the EPMT. In the MBT, no MLT effects were observed in both age groups. In the three-chamber sociability test, MLT decreased sociability and social novelty in adults, while it increased sociability in adolescents. Using local field potential recordings, we found higher mPFC-dHippo synchronization in the delta and low-theta frequency ranges in adults but not in adolescents after MLT treatment. Here, we show age-dependent differences in the effects of MLT in anxiety paradigms and in the modulation of the mPFC-dHippo circuit, indicating that when investigating the pharmacology of the MLT system, age can significantly impact the study outcomes.

AB  - Activated mitophagy and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) has been reported to protect against mitochondrial dysfunction, which is closely related to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Honokiol (HKL, C18H18O2) is a kind of natural extraction from bark of Magnolia officinalis with anti-AD effect, and our study aims to explore the effect of HKL on mitophagy and UPRmt in AD. Briefly, male APP/PS1 mice and A beta oligmer (A beta O)treated primary hippocampal neurons were respectively used to mimic AD in vivo and in vitro. It was determined that HKL significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment and synaptic damages in APP/PS1 mice. Besides, the activated mitophagy and UPRmt together with inhibited oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial dynamic disorder were further validated in hippocampus of HKL-treated APP/PS1 mice. Meanwhile, HKL-treated mice displayed much higher hippocampal expression and activity of mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). Therefore, SIRT3 knockdown was further achieved in primary hippocampal neurons by effective shRNA, and we determined that HKL improved synaptic damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy and UPRmt in A beta O-treated primary hippocampal neurons in a SIRT3-dependent manner. In summary, our study validates the protective effect of HKL on AD, and highlights that HKL exerts anti-AD effect by activating mitophagy and UPRmt.

AB  - Accurate evaluation of motor energy efficiency under off-condition operation can provide an important basis for an energy-saving upgrade of the motor and the elimination of backward motors. By considering the power quality, motor characteristics and load characteristics, a motor energy efficiency evaluation system with seven indexes and 10 grades was constructed. An improved elephant herding optimization method combined with a support vector machine rating model is proposed, it achieved an accuracy higher than 98%. Considering the slow convergence speed and low convergence precision of the standard elephant herding optimization (EHO) method, it is easy to fall into the local optimum problem. To improve population initialization, chaotic mapping and adversarial learning were used to achieve EHO with population diversity and global search capability. Group learning and elite retention have been added to improve the local development ability of the algorithm. The improved EHO has been compared with other intelligent optimization algorithms by using 12 benchmark functions, and the results show that the improved algorithm has better optimization performance.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most frequently diagnosed neurological diseases, but the neurobiological basis of the disease remains poorly understood. Immunophenotyping CBA mice brain (NeuN and caspase-8) in parallel with hippocampal neurons' functional status and survival rate assessment during acute epileptic PTZ-induced seizures is of particular interest. The aims of this study were to investigate the involvement of NeuN and caspase-8 in cell cycle regulation and the death of hippocampal neurons during PTZ-induced seizures in mice and to assess the therapeutic efficacy of Myricetin in the aforementioned experimental settings. Male CBA mice (n = 340) were divided into six groups to investigate the neuroprotective and antiepileptic effects of Myricetin and Valproic Acid in the PTZ-induced seizure model. Group I (control, n = 20) received a single intraperitoneal injection of NaCl 0.9% solution. Group II (PTZ only, n = 110) received a single intraperitoneal 45 mg/kg PTZ to induce seizures. Group III (Myricetin + PTZ, n = 90) was administered Myricetin orally at 200 mg/kg for 5 days, followed by a PTZ injection. Group IV (Valproic Acid + PTZ, n = 80) received intraperitoneal Valproic Acid at 100 mg/kg for 5 days, followed by PTZ. Group V (Myricetin + NaCl, n = 20) received Myricetin and NaCl. Group VI (Valproic Acid + NaCl, n = 20) received Valproic Acid and NaCl. Seizure severity was monitored using the modified Racine scale. Behavioral assessments included sensorimotor function tests, motor coordination using the rotarod test, and cognitive function via the Morris water maze. Brain tissues were collected and analyzed for oxidative stress markers, including malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH). Blood samples were analyzed for cytokine levels (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha). Histological studies involved H&E and Nissl staining to evaluate general histopathology and neuronal density. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted using antibodies against NeuN and caspase-8 to assess neuronal cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. PTZ-induced seizures caused significant oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to neuronal damage. Biochemical analyses showed elevated levels of MDA, SOD, GSH, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluations revealed a significant increase in caspase-8-positive neurons and a decrease in NeuN-positive neurons in the hippocampus and other brain regions, correlating with seizure severity. Myricetin and Valproic Acid treatments reduced oxidative stress markers and neuronal damage. Both treatments resulted in moderate neuronal protection, with fewer damaged neurons observed in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and other brain areas compared to the PTZ-only group. Summarizing, Myricetin administration showed promising neuroprotective effects. It significantly reduced oxidative stress markers, including MDA, and restored antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and GSH), suggesting its antioxidative potential. Myricetin also effectively attenuated the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, indicating strong anti-inflammatory properties. Behavioral assessments revealed that Myricetin improved cognitive and motor functions in PTZ-treated mice, with notable reductions in seizure severity and mortality rates. Histological analyses supported these behavioral findings, with Nissl staining showing reduced neuronal damage and NeuN staining indicating better preservation of neuronal integrity in Myricetin-treated groups.
   Additionally, caspase-8 staining suggested a significant reduction in neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - In recent years, it has become an acknowledged fact that noise exposure can lead to cognitive impairments, and researchers have shown increasing interest in this area. However, the detrimental impact of noise exposure on Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models might be considerably greater than on ordinary model mice, yet the mechanisms by which noise exposure affects the hippocampus in these models have been scarcely investigated. This study we used 4D Label-free proteomics to identify distinctive differentially expressed proteins in the hippocampus of AD model mice following noise exposure. Among these proteins, the presence of Cathepsin S (CTSS) cannot be disregarded. Utilizing experimental techniques such as Western blot, immunofluorescence, and rt-qPCR, we confirmed the expression of CTSS in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after noise exposure. Additionally, we examined downstream molecules including P53,BCL-2, BAX, and CASPASE3 using KEGG pathway analysis. The results indicated an elevation in CTSS expression, a reduction in the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2, and an increase in the expression of BAX and cleaved CASPASE3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that noise exposure potentially heightens apoptosis within the hippocampus through upregulating CTSS expression, subsequently posing a threat to AD model animals.

AB  - Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were reported to play a crucial role in neurotransmitter release, dendritic resonance phenomena and integration, and the regulation of gene expression. In the septohippocampal system, high- and low-voltage-activated (HVA, LVA) Ca2+ channels were shown to be involved in theta genesis, learning, and memory processes. In particular, HVA Ca(v)2.3 R-type and LVA Ca(v)3 T-type Ca2+ channels are expressed in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS-DBB), hippocampal interneurons, and pyramidal cells, and ablation of both channels was proven to severely modulate theta activity. Importantly, Ca(v)3 Ca2+ channels contribute to rebound burst firing in septal interneurons. Consequently, functional impairment of T-type Ca2+ channels, e.g., in null mutant mouse models, caused tonic disinhibition of the septohippocampal pathway and subsequent enhancement of hippocampal theta activity. In addition, impairment of GABA A/B receptor transcription, trafficking, and membrane translocation was observed within the septohippocampal system. Given the recent findings that amyloid precursor protein (APP) forms complexes with GABA B receptors (GBRs), it is hypothesized that T-type Ca2+ current reduction, decrease in GABA receptors, and APP destabilization generate complex functional interdependence that can constitute a sophisticated proamyloidogenic environment, which could be of potential relevance in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The age-related downregulation of T-type Ca2+ channels in humans goes together with increased A beta levels that could further inhibit T-type channels and aggravate the proamyloidogenic environment. The mechanistic model presented here sheds new light on recent reports about the potential risks of T-type Ca2+ channel blockers (CCBs) in dementia, as observed upon antiepileptic drug application in the elderly.

AB  - We have previously found that long-term effects of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields in 5xFAD mice with severe late-stage Alzheimer's disease reduced both amyloid-beta deposition and glial activation, including microglia. To examine whether this therapeutic effect is due to the regulation of activated microglia, we analyzed microglial gene expression profiles and the existence of microglia in the brain in this study. 5xFAD mice at the age of 1.5 months were assigned to sham- and radiofrequency electromagnetic fields-exposed groups and then animals were exposed to 1950 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields at a specific absorption rate of 5 W/kg for 2 hours/day and 5 days/week for 6 months. We conducted behavioral tests including the object recognition and Y-maze tests and molecular and histopathological analysis of amyloid precursor protein/amyloid-beta metabolism in brain tissue. We confirmed that radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure for 6 months ameliorated cognitive impairment and amyloid-beta deposition. The expression levels of Iba1 (pan-microglial marker) and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R; regulates microglial proliferation) in the hippocampus in 5xFAD mice treated with radiofrequency electromagnetic fields were significantly reduced compared with those of the sham-exposed group. Subsequently, we analyzed the expression levels of genes related to microgliosis and microglial function in the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields-exposed group compared to those of a CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397)-treated group. Both radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and PLX3397 suppressed the levels of genes related to microgliosis (Csf1r, CD68, and Ccl6) and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta. Notably, the expression levels of genes related to microglial function, including Trem2, Fcgr1a, Ctss, and Spi1, were decreased after long-term radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure, which was also observed in response to microglial suppression by PLX3397. These results showed that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields ameliorated amyloid-beta pathology and cognitive impairment by suppressing amyloid-beta deposition-induced microgliosis and their key regulator, CSF1R.

AB  - Background: Bromelain is a complex mixture of protease enzyme extract from the fruit or stem of the pineapple plant and it has a history of folk medicine use. It is known to have a wide range of biological actions and it is most commonly used as an anti-inflammatory agent, though scientists have also discovered its potential as an anticancer and antimicrobial agent, it has been reported to have positive effects on the respiratory, digestive, circulatory systems and potentially on the immune system.
   Objective: This study was designed to investigate the antidepressant potential of Bromelain in the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model of depression.
   Methods: We studied the antioxidant activity, and neuroprotective effect of Bromelain by analyzing the fear and anxiety behavior, antioxidants, and neurotransmitter levels, and also by analyzing the histopathological changes. Adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into 5 groups, Control; Bromelain; CUS; CUS + Bromelain, CUS + fluoxetine. Animals of the CUS group, CUS + Bromelain group, and CUS + Fluoxetine group were exposed to CUS for 30 days. Animals of the Bromelain group and CUS + Bromelain group were treated orally with 40 mg/kg Bromelain throughout the period of CUS whereas, the positive control group was treated with fluoxetine.
   Results: Results showed a significant decrease in oxidative stress marker (lipid peroxidation), and the stress hormone cortisol, in Bromelain- treated CUS-induced depression. Bromelain treatment in CUS has also resulted in a significant increase in neurotransmitter levels, which indicates the efficacy of Bromelain to counteract the monamine neurotransmitter changes in depression by increasing their synthesis and reducing their metabolism. In addition, the antioxidant activity of Bromelain prevented oxidative stress in depressed rats. Also, hematoxylin and eosin staining of hippocampus sections has revealed that Bromelain treatment has protected the degeneration of nerve cells by chronic unpredictable stress exposure.
   Conclusion: This data provides evidence for the antidepressant-like action of Bromelain by preventing neurobehavioral, biochemical, and monoamine alterations.

AB  - Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are recommended to treat heart failure (HF) with the benefit of mitigating cognitive impairment in HF patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether SGLT2i can improve cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in rats with myocardial infarction (MI) through attenuating inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain. Male rats (n = 8/group) underwent either a sham operation or MI induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. MI rats with ejection fraction <50 % were divided into three groups to receive either a vehicle, SGLT2i (Dapagliflozin, 1 mg/kg), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (Enalapril, 10 mg/kg, positive control) for four weeks. Cardiac function, cognitive function, synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine density, and brain biochemical changes were assessed at the end of the protocol. MI rats exhibited cardiac dysfunction, hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment, impaired synaptic plasticity, and loss of dendritic spines. Brain oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction were also observed in MI rats. Treatment with SGLT2i and ACEi improved cardiac function but failed to attenuate cognitive impairment, synaptic dysplasticity, and loss of dendritic spine density in MI rats. A decrease in brain glutamate level was found following MI, which can be restored by SGLT2i and ACEi. Only SGLT2i partially improved brain mitochondrial function. In summary, SGLT2i enhanced glutamate levels and partially improved mitochondrial function in the brain; however, these changes were insufficient to improve cognitive function in MI rats.

AB  - The present work focused on examining the function of rumen-protected L-arginine (RP-Arg) or N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) in jejunal oxidative resistance, integrity and immune function in the ovine foetal model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Thirty-two twin-bearing Hu ewes at d 35 of gestation were randomised as 4 treatment groups (n = 8 each): Control (CON), received 100% of the recommended National Research Council (NRC) for pregnancy; Restricted (RES), received 50% of the recommended NRC for pregnancy; RES + ARG, RES ewes added with 20 g/d of RP-Arg; or RES + NCG treatment, RES ewes added with 5 g/d of NCG. Foetal jejunal samples were collected on d 110 of pregnancy and were assayed for biomarkers of oxidative damage, integrity and immune function. The villus height was elevated (p < .05) within the jejunum of the foetuses of RES ewes subjected to dietary NCG or Arg supplementation relative to the RES group. RES + NCG or RES + ARG feeding decreased (p < .05) foetal jejunal tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin (IL)-6 levels and elevated (p < .05) foetal jejunal superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (p < .05) in relative to RES group. The Arg/NCG supplementation downregulated (p < .05) expression of gene and proteins associated with inflammatory response (TNF-alpha), upregulated (p < .05) genes and proteins associated with antioxidation (catalase and SOD2) and integrity (claudin-1) relative to those within foetal jejunum of RES group. In conclusion, Arg and NCG supplementation of RES ewes alleviates foetal jejunal oxidative stress, improves integrity, and promotes foetal intestinal development in the ovine foetus with IUGR.

AB  - Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is common and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and 4 have been implied in the development of POCD. The role of TLR2, a major brain TLR, in POCD is not clear. High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a delayed inflammatory mediator and may play a role in POCD. The interaction between HMGB1 and TLRs in the perioperative period is not known. We hypothesize that TLR2 contributes to the development of POCD and that HMGB1 regulates TLR2 for this effect. To test these hypotheses, 6- to 8-week old male mice were subjected to right carotid artery exposure under isoflurane anesthesia. CU-CPT22, a TLR1/TLR2 inhibitor, at 3 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before surgery and 1 day after surgery. Glycyrrhizin, a HMGB1 antagonist, at 200 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before surgery. Mice were subjected to Barnes maze and fear conditioning tests from 1 week after surgery. Hippocampus and cerebral cortex were harvested 6 hr or 12 hr after the surgery for Western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescent staining, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. There were neuroinflammation and impairment of learning and memory in mice with surgery. Surgery increased the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 but not TLR9 in the brain of CD-1 male mice. CU-CPT22 attenuated surgery-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Similarly, surgery induced neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in C57BL/6J mice but not in TLR2(-/-) mice. TLR2 staining appeared in neurons and microglia. Surgery increased HMGB1 in the cell nuclei of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Glycyrrhizin ameliorated this increase and the increase of TLR2 in the hippocampus after surgery. Surgery also increased the amount of tlr2 DNA precipitated by an anti-HMGB1 antibody in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that TLR2 contributes to surgery-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. HMGB1 up-regulates TLR2 expression in the hippocampus after surgery to facilitate this contribution. Thus, TLR2 and HMGB1 are potential targets for reducing POCD.

AB  - Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human-like qualities to non-human entities, can influence comprehension of the surrounding world. Going beyond previous research on the general assessment of anthropomorphism, the current study aimed to explore how anthropomorphising a specific animal species influences public acceptance of livestock keeping practices. Specifically, we focused on welfare-infringing practices that limit animals' freedom, describe disruptive procedures, social isolation, or other stressful situations. Lacking experience in livestock keeping, it is likely that people project their own preferences to animals when judging livestock keeping practices. Questionnaire data from a sample of the Swiss German public (N = 1232) were analysed regarding their acceptance of livestock keeping practices, as well as anthropomorphism for three animals: cattle, pigs, and poultry. We showed that judgement of livestock keeping was related to an anthropomorphic view of animals. This takes two opposite directions: (1) anthropomorphising was connected to a more critical view of livestock keeping practices and (2) the attribution of more cognitive capabilities to cattle and poultry was associated with a higher acceptance of welfare-infringing livestock keeping practices. The tendency to anthropomorphise was species-dependent, with the two mammals eliciting a higher tendency to anthropomorphise than poultry. The results suggest that the tendency to anthropomorphise plays a significant role in shaping the public's opinion on livestock keeping. We argue that, when activating the tendency to anthropomorphise in the media, advertisements, or political publicity (e.g. by highlighting human-like features), a certain level of caution should be taken to avoid undesirable outcomes.

AB  - Author summary Poly-pharmacology (using multiple drugs to treat disease) has been proposed for improving cardiac anti-arrhythmic therapy for at least two decades. However, the specific arrhythmia contexts in which polytherapy is likely to be both safe and effective have remained elusive. Type 1 short QT syndrome (SQT1) is a rare form of cardiac arrhythmia that results from mutations to the human Ether-a-go-go Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel. Functionally, these mutations are remarkably consistent in that they permit the channel to open earlier during each heart beat. While hundreds of compounds are known to inhibit hERG channels, the specific effect of SQT1 mutations that allows for early channel opening also limits the ability of most of those compounds to correct SQT1 dysfunction. Here, we have applied a suite of ventricular cardiomyocyte computational models to ask whether polytherapy may offer a more effective therapeutic strategy in SQT1, and if so, what the likely characteristics of that strategy are. Our analyses suggest that simultaneous induction of late sodium current and partial hERG blockade offers a promising strategy. While no activators of late sodium current have been clinically approved, several experimental compounds are available and may provide a basis for interrogating this strategy. The method presented here can be used to compute optimal drug combinations provided that the effect of each drug on every relevant ion channel is known.
   Mutations are known to cause perturbations in essential functional features of integral membrane proteins, including ion channels. Even restricted or point mutations can result in substantially changed properties of ion currents. The additive effect of these alterations for a specific ion channel can result in significantly changed properties of the action potential (AP). Both AP shortening and AP prolongation can result from known mutations, and the consequences can be life-threatening. Here, we present a computational method for identifying new drugs utilizing combinations of existing drugs. Based on the knowledge of theoretical effects of existing drugs on individual ion currents, our aim is to compute optimal combinations that can 'repair' the mutant AP waveforms so that the baseline AP-properties are restored. More specifically, we compute optimal, combined, drug concentrations such that the waveforms of the transmembrane potential and the cytosolic calcium concentration of the mutant cardiomyocytes (CMs) becomes as similar as possible to their wild type counterparts after the drug has been applied. In order to demonstrate the utility of this method, we address the question of computing an optimal drug for the short QT syndrome type 1 (SQT1). For the SQT1 mutation N588K, there are available data sets that describe the effect of various drugs on the mutated K+ channel. These published findings are the basis for our computational analysis which can identify optimal compounds in the sense that the AP of the mutant CMs resembles essential biomarkers of the wild type CMs. Using recently developed insights regarding electrophysiological properties among myocytes from different species, we compute optimal drug combinations for hiPSC-CMs, rabbit ventricular CMs and adult human ventricular CMs with the SQT1 mutation. Since the 'composition' of ion channels that form the AP is different for the three types of myocytes under consideration, so is the composition of the optimal drug.

AB  - Background: Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for similar to 85% of all lung carcinomas. Trans-3,5,4 '-trimethoxystilbene (TMS) shows strong anti-tumor activity and induces tumor cell apoptosis. However, its function and mechanism in NSCLC still require investigation.
   Methods: PMA was used to treated THP-1 cells for macrophage differentiation. The abundance and m6A modification of circPACRGL were examined with qRT-PCR and MeRIP. Colony forming, transwell, wound healing, and Western blotting assays were applied to analyze proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT. Macrophage polarization was determined through flow cytometry analysis of M1 and M2 markers. The interplay between circPACRGL, IGF2BP2 and YAP1 was validated by RNA pull-down and RIP assays. Mice received subcutaneous injection of NSCLC cells as a mouse model of subcutaneous tumor.
   Results: CircPACRGL was upregulated in NSCLC cells, but it was reduced by TMS treatment. CircPACRGL depletion blocked proliferation, migration, and invasion in H1299 and H1975 cells. TMS suppressed these malignant behaviors, but it was abolished by circPACRGL overexpression. In addition, NSCLC-derived exosomes delivered circPACRGL into THP-1 cells to promote its M2 polarization, but TMS inhibited these effects by downregulating exosomal circPACRGL. Mechanically, exosomal circPACRGL bound to IGF2BP2 to improve the stability of YAP1 mRNA and regulate Hippo signaling in polarized THP-1 cells. TMS inhibited NSCLC growth via suppressing Hippo signaling and M2 polarization in vivo.
   Conclusion: TMS restrains M2 polarization and NSCLC progression by reducing circPACRGL and inhibiting exosomal circPACRGL-mediated Hippo signaling. Thus, these findings provide a novel mechanism underlying NSCLC progression and potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - In this study, we explored the intricate relationship between Pannexin 1 (PANX1) and the Hippo signaling pathway effector, Yes-associated protein (YAP). Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed a significant positive correlation between PANX1 mRNA and core Hippo components, Yes-associated protein 1 [YAP], Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif [TAZ], and Hippo scaffold, Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1 [IQGAP1], in invasive cutaneous melanoma and breast carcinoma. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PANX1 expression is upregulated in invasive melanoma cell lines and is associated with increased YAP protein levels. Notably, our investigations uncovered a previously unrecognized interaction between endogenous PANX1 and the Hippo scaffold protein IQGAP1 in melanoma cells. Moreover, our findings revealed that IQGAP1 exhibits differential expression in melanoma cells and plays a regulatory role in cellular morphology. Functional studies involving PANX1 knockdown provided compelling evidence that PANX1 modulates YAP protein levels and its cotranscriptional activity in melanoma and breast carcinoma cells. Importantly, our study highlights the potential therapeutic significance of targeting PANX1. Pharmacological inhibition of PANX1 using selective FDA-approved inhibitors or PANX1 knockdown reduced YAP levels in melanoma cells. Furthermore, our Clariom (TM) S analysis unveiled key genes implicated in cell proliferation, such as neuroglin1 (NRG1), beta-galactoside binding protein and galectin-3 (LGALS3), that are affected in PANX1-deficient cells. In summary, our investigation delves into the intricate interplay between PANX1 and YAP in the context of invasive melanoma, offering valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for effective treatment.

AB  - BackgroundThis study focused on examining the predatory potential of Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi Esben-Peterson (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) against different developmental stages of the red spider mite (RSM) Oligonychus coffeae Nietner (Acarina: Tetranychidae) infesting tea crops, under both free-choice and no-choice scenarios at three different temperature gradients: 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 30 degrees C. Additionally, this study aimed to investigate the functional response parameters of the three larval instars of C. z. sillemi at different developmental stages of O. coffeae at varying population densities.ResultsThe predatory potential of C. z. sillemi significantly increased with higher temperatures and predator stages and decreased with the prey stage in both free-choice and no-choice conditions. In both experimental regimes, all three larval instars showed maximum predation at 25 and 30 degrees C. All three instars exhibited a significant preference for O. coffeae eggs compared to other stages. The functional response data also indicated that the first, second, and third instars of C. z. sillemi displayed type II functional responses towards each life stage of O. coffeae when offered individually. They showed significantly different attack rates (a) and handling times (Th) for the various life stages of O. coffeae. Eggs were more frequently attacked, with less handling time, by all three predatory stages of C. z. sillemi. Among the three predatory stages, the third instar larvae of C. z. sillemi showed the highest functional response ratio on eggs (FRR = 1173.35), followed by larvae (872.19), nymphs (287.11), and adults (276.57). The theoretical maximum consumption (T/Th) of C. z. sillemi also supported the results obtained for a/Th, indicating that the predatory efficiency of C. z. sillemi decreased with the advancement of the prey stage.ConclusionsIn conclusion, third-instar larvae of C. z. sillemi consumed significantly higher amounts of all prey stages of O. coffeae at temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees C in both free- and no-choice conditions. The functional response results suggest that all three larval instars of C. z. sillemi exhibited a type-II response and are efficient regulators of O. coffeae populations. These findings may lead to the development of biocontrol pest management strategies against O. coffeae, by incorporating C. z. sillemi as a potential natural enemy.

AB  - Background. Neuroinflammation-induced phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) deposition in central nervous system contributes to neurodegenerative disorders. Propofol possesses neuroprotective properties. We investigated its impacts on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated p-Tau deposition in neurons. Methods. Mouse hippocampal neurons were exposed to propofol followed by TNF-alpha. Cell viability, p-Tau, mitophagy, reactive oxygen species (ROS), NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), antioxidant enzymes, and p62/Keap1/Nrf2 pathway were investigated. Results. TNF-alpha promoted p-Tau accumulation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. TNF-alpha (20 ng/mL, 4 h) inhibited mitophagy while increased ROS accumulation and NLRP3 activation. It also induced glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) while inhibited protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) phosphorylation. All these effects were attenuated by 25 mu M propofol. In addition, TNF-alpha-induced p-Tau accumulation was attenuated by ROS scavenger, NLRP3 inhibitor, GSK3 beta inhibitor, or PP2A activator. Besides, compared with control neurons, 100 mu M propofol decreased p-Tau accumulation. It also decreased ROS and NLRP3 activation, modulated GSK3 beta/PP2A phosphorylation, leaving mitophagy unchanged. Further, 100 mu M propofol induced p62 expression, reduced Keap1 expression, triggered the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and upregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, which was abolished by p62 knockdown, Keap1 overexpression, or Nrf2 inhibitor. Consistently, the inhibitory effect of 100 mu M propofol on ROS and p-Tau accumulation was mitigated by p62 knockdown, Keap1 overexpression, or Nrf2 inhibitor. Conclusions. In hippocampal neurons, TNF-alpha inhibited mitophagy, caused oxidative stress and NLRP3 activation, leading to GSK3 beta/PP2A-dependent Tau phosphorylation. Propofol may reduce p-Tau accumulation by reversing mitophagy and oxidative stress-related events. Besides, propofol may reduce p-Tau accumulation by modulating SOD and HO-1 expression through p62/Keap1/Nrf2 pathway.

AB  - The post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) is a crucial scaffolding protein participating in the organization and regulation of synapses. PSD95 interacts with numerous molecules, including neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. The functional dysregulation of PSD95 as well as its abundance and localization has been implicated with several neurological disorders, making it an attractive target for developing strategies able to monitor PSD95 accurately for diagnostics and therapeutics. This study characterizes a novel camelid single-domain antibody (nanobody) that binds strongly and with high specificity to rat, mouse, and human PSD95. This nanobody allows for more precise detection and quantification of PSD95 in various biological samples. We expect that the flexibility and unique performance of this thoroughly characterized affinity tool will help to further understand the role of PSD95 in normal and diseased neuronal synapses.

AB  - Chronic sinusitis (CS) is characterized by sinonasal inflammation, mucus overproduction, and edematous mucosal tissue. CS impacts one in seven adults and estimates suggest up to 15% of the general U.S. population may be affected. This research sought to assess a potential role for receptors for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), an inflammatory receptor expressed in tissues exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS). Human sinus tissue sections were stained for RAGE and S100s, common RAGE ligands. Wild-type mice and mice that over-express RAGE in sinonasal epithelium (RAGE TG) were maintained in room air (RA) or exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS) via a nose-only delivery system five days a week for 6 weeks. Mouse sections were stained for RAGE and tissue lysates were assayed for cleaved caspase 3, cytokines, or matrix metalloproteases. We discovered increased RAGE expression in sinus tissue following SHS exposure and in sinuses from RAGE TG mice in the absence of SHS. Cleaved caspase-3, cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-3, and TNF-alpha), and MMPs (-9 and -13) were induced by SHS and in tissues from RAGE TG mice. These results expand the inflammatory role of RAGE signaling, a key axis in disease progression observed in smokers. In this relatively unexplored area, enhanced understanding of RAGE signaling during voluntary and involuntary smoking may help to elucidate potential therapeutic targets that may attenuate the progression of smoke-related CS.

AB  - Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is characterized by the presence of neurological symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) before 65 years of age. Mutations in pathological genes, including amyloid protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2), were associated with EOAD. Seventy-six mutations in PSEN2 have been found around the world, which could affect the activity of gamma-secretase in amyloid beta processing. Here, a heterozygous PSEN2 point mutation from G to A nucleotide change at position 166 (codon 56; c.166G>A, Gly56Ser) was identified in a 64-year-old Korean female with AD with progressive cognitive memory impairment for the 4 years prior to the hospital visit. Hippocampal atrophy was observed from magnetic resonance imaging-based neuroimaging analyses. Temporal and parietal cortex hypometabolisms were identified using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. This mutation was at the N-terminal portion of the presenilin 2 protein on the cytosolic side. Therefore, the serine substitution may have promoted AD pathogenesis by perturbing to the mutation region through altered phosphorylation of presenilin. In silico analysis revealed that the mutation altered protein bulkiness with increased hydrophilicity and reduced flexibility of the mutated region of the protein. Structural changes were likely caused by intramolecular interactions between serine and other residues, which may have affected APP processing. The functional study will clarify the pathogenicity of the mutation in the future.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is linked to increased morbidity and mortality rates in patients with sepsis. Increased cytokine production and neuronal apoptosis are implicated in the pathogenesis of the SAE. Neuroinflammation plays a major role in sepsis-induced brain injury. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an inhibitor of thioredoxin, is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. However, whether the TXNIP is involved in the sepsis-induced brain injury and the underlying mechanism is yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study was aimed at elucidating the effects of TXNIP knockdown on sepsis-induced brain injury and cognitive decline in mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected intraperitoneally to induce sepsis brain injury in mice. The virus-carrying control or TXNIP shRNA was injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain 4 weeks before the LPS treatment. The histological changes in the hippocampal tissues, encephaledema, and cognitive function were detected, respectively. Also, the 7-day survival rate was recorded. Furthermore, the alterations in microglial activity, oxidative response, proinflammatory factors, apoptosis, protein levels (TXNIP and NLRP3 inflammasome), and apoptosis were examined in the hippocampal tissues. The results demonstrated that the TXNIP and NLRP3 inflammasome expression levels were increased at 6, 12, and 24 h post-LPS injection. TXNIP knockdown dramatically ameliorated the 7-day survival rate, cognitive decline, brain damage, neuronal apoptosis, and the brain water content, inhibited the activation of microglia, downregulated the NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway, and reduced the oxidative stress and the neuroinflammatory cytokine levels at 24 h post-LPS injection. These results suggested a crucial effect of TXNIP knockdown on the mechanism of brain injury and cognitive decline in sepsis mice via suppressing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Thus, TXNIP might be a potential therapeutic target for SAE patients.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) regulates mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level to affect both their amounts and the protein function. However, little is known about the roles of AS in regulation of biosynthesis of amino acids, flavonoids, and volatile compounds in tea plants. In this study, we used Iso-seq and transcriptome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify AS events, and analyzed the expression of respective mRNAs in tea plants under drought (DS), heat stress (HS), and their combination (HD). By RT-PCR, we validated the AS events in nine genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids and flavonoids. The genes accumulating AS transcripts under DS, HS, and HD conditions included those encoding for anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), dihydrofavonol-4-reductase-like (DFRA), and chalcone isomerase (CHI). Similarly, genes directly or indirectly involved in the biosynthesis of volatile compounds such as lipoxygenase (LOX), terpenoid/terpene synthase (TPS), and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) also had AS events. Our study revealed that AS might specifically regulate the biosynthesis of amino acids in tea plants under stressful conditions. Moreover, we suggest that the AS events within the ANR and DFRA transcripts might play an important role in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis under DS, HS, and HD conditions. This study improved our understanding of the genetic drivers of the changes in the content of bioactive ingredients of tea plants subjected to abiotic stresses.

AB  - Objective: Glutamate mediated excitotoxicity, such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, synaptic loss and neuronal death, is ubiquitous in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous study found that 15 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could reduce cortical excitability. The purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect of higher frequency rTMS on 3xTg-AD model mice and further explore the mechanisms of rTMS.
   Methods: First, WT and 3xTg-AD model mice received 25 Hz rTMS treatment for 21 days. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the cognitive function. The levels of A beta and neuroinflammation were assessed by ELISA and immunofluorescence. Oxidative stress was quantified by biochemical assay kits. Brain glucose metabolism was assessed by F-18-FDG PET. Apoptosis was assessed by western blot and TUNEL staining. Synaptic plasticity and PI3K/Akt/GLT-1 pathway related protein expression were assessed by western blot. Next, to explore the activity of PI3K/Akt in the therapeutic effect of rTMS, 3xTg-AD model mice were given LY294002 intervention and rTMS treatment for 21 days, the experimental method was the same as before.
   Results: We found that 25 Hz rTMS could improve cognitive function of 3xTg-AD model mice, reduce hippocampal A beta 1-42 levels, ameliorate oxidative stress and improve glucose metabolism. rTMS alleviated neuroinflammatory response, enhanced synaptic plasticity and reduced neuronal loss and cell apoptosis, accompanied by activation of PI3K/Akt/GLT-1 pathway. After administration of PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002, 25 Hz rTMS could not improve the cognitive function and reduce neuron damage of 3xTg-AD model mice, nor could it upregulate the expression of GLT-1, indicating that its therapeutic and protective effects required the involvement of PI3K/Akt/GLT-1 pathway.
   Conclusion: rTMS exerts protective role for AD through regulating multiple pathological processes. Meanwhile, this study revealed the key role of PI3K/Akt/GLT-1 pathway in the treatment of AD by rTMS, which might be a new target.

AB  - The worldwide incidence of neuropathic pain is around 7-8% and is associated with significant and disabling comorbidities (sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety). It is now known that cellular ageing of microglia contributes to neurodegenerative diseases, mood disorders, and, even if with less evidence, chronic pain. The aim of this work was to investigate in vitro and in vivo the senolytic activity of rosmarinic acid (RA) to be exploited for the management of NP symptoms. BV2 cells were stimulated with LPS 500 ng/mL for 24 h. Treatment with RA 1 mu M improved cell viability and reduced IL-1s release leading to an attenuation of neuroinflammation. We then moved on to test the efficacy of RA in reducing microglial senescence. In our model, BV2 cells were stimulated with LPS 500 ng/mL every 72 h for 4 h/day, over a period of 10 days. RA 1 mu M reduced the expression of the beta-galactosidase enzyme, reduced the release of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, increased cell viability, and reduced the presence of nuclear foci of senescence (SAHF), well-known cellular senescence markers. In the Spared Nerve Injury (SNI) model, 28 days from surgery, repeated oral administration of RA 5 mg/kg reduced hyperalgesia and NP-associated symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. A reduction of senescence markers was detected on both hippocampal and spinal samples of SNI-treated mice. This study represents a starting point for investigating the role of microglial senescence as a possible pharmacological target in controlling symptoms related to the more advanced stages of peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Background - Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is an important pathophysiological mechanism of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The heterogeneous effects of CCH complicate establishing single target therapies against VCI and its more severe form, vascular dementia (VaD). Intermittent fasting (IF) has multiple targets and is neuroprotective across a range of disease conditions including stroke, but its effects against CCH-induced neurovascular pathologies remain to be elucidated. We therefore assessed the effect of IF against CCH-associated neurovascular pathologies and investigated its underlying mechanisms.
   Methods - Male C57BL/6NTac mice were subjected to either ad libitum feeding (AL) or IF (16 hours of fasting per day) for 4 months. In both groups, CCH was experimentally induced by the bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) method. Sham operated groups were used as controls. Measures of leaky microvessels, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, protein expression of tight junctions, extracellular matrix components and white matter changes were determined to investigate the effect of IF against CCH-induced neurovascular pathologies.
   Results - IF alleviated CCH-induced neurovascular pathologies by reducing the number of leaky microvessels, BBB breakdown and loss of tight junctional proteins. In addition, IF mitigated the severity of white matter lesions, and maintained myelin basic protein levels, while concurrently reducing hippocampal neuronal cell death. Furthermore, IF reduced the CCH-induced increase in levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and its upstream activator MT1-MMP, which are involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix that is a core component of the BBB. Additionally, we observed that IF reduced CCH-induced increase in the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde, and increased antioxidant markers glutathione and superoxide dismutase. Overall, our data suggest that IF attenuates neurovascular damage, metalloproteinase and oxidative stress-associated pathways, and cell death in the brain following CCH in a mouse model of VCI.
   Conclusion - Although IF has yet to be assessed in human patients with VaD, our data suggest that IF may be an effective means of preventing the onset or suppressing the development of neurovascular pathologies in VCI and VaD.

AB  - Introduction: In the early stage of embryonic development, the neural tube (NT) cannot be closed properly due to some complex factors, including environmental factors, genetic factors, and the relationship between various factors, leading to the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs).Methods: In this study, we induced a mouse model of NTDs by feeding mice with a low-folate diet and intraperitoneally injecting them with 1.5 mg/kg methotrexate on E7.5. Fetal mice were achieved at E13.5, and we extracted proteins from brain tissues with trypsin digestion. After enzymatic digestion, peptides were labeled with TMT/iTRAQ and separated in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for subsequent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) analysis. We used gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation to analyze proteomic changes and analyze the functional enrichment of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the NTD mice tissues.Results: A low-folate-induced mouse model was successfully constructed. Folate was used as a sensitizing agent, and the teratogenicity rate of the NTD fetal mice increased to 36.5% when the concentration of methotrexate was at 1.5 mg/kg. Mass spectrometry was used to identify 6,614 proteins, and among them, 5,656 proteins were quantified. In the following proteomic analysis, GO classification and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were conducted, and heatmaps were drawn for differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The main pathways associated with NTDs, such as the Hedgehog, Wnt, p53, and Hippo signaling pathways and the one-carbon pool mediated by folate, can be identified through a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. It was also found that the regulation of ribosomal proteins, such as RPL13 and RPL14, which are upregulated in NTDs, has a certain impact on neural tube development.Discussion: Our results revealed proteomic changes in the tissues of low-folate-induced NTD mice. Validation showed that ribosomal proteins play a regulatory role during the development of NTDs and provides new ideas for the pathogenesis and preventive measures of NTDs.

AB  - Recent studies have established that exosomes (EXs) derived from follicular fluid (FF) can promote oocyte development. However, the specific sources of these EXs and their regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. It is universally acknowledged that oocyte development requires signal communication between granulosa cells (GCs) and oocytes. However, the role of GC-secreted EXs and their functions are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of porcine granulosa-cell-derived exosomes (GC-EXs) in oocyte development. In this study, we constructed an in vitro model of porcine GCs and collected and identified GC-EXs. We confirmed that porcine GCs can secrete EXs and investigated the role of GC-EXs in regulating oocyte development by supplementing them to cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) cultured in vitro. Specifically, GC-EXs increase the cumulus expansion index (CEI), promote the expansion of the cumulus, alleviate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increase mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), resulting in improved oocyte development. Additionally, we conducted small RNA sequencing of GC-EXs and hypothesized that miR-148a-3p, the highest-expressed microRNA (miRNA), may be the key miRNA. Our study determined that transfection of miR-148a-3p mimics exerts effects comparable to the addition of EXs. Meanwhile, bioinformatics prediction, dual luciferase reporter gene assay, and RT-qPCR identified DOCK6 as the target gene of miR-148a-3p. In summary, our results demonstrated that GC-EXs may improve oocyte antioxidant capacity and promote oocyte development through miR-148a-3p by targeting DOCK6.

AB  - Ischemic stroke, one of the most universal causes of human mortality and morbidity, is pathologically characterized by inflammatory cascade, especially during the progression of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. F-Box Protein 3 (FBXO3), a substrate-recognition subunit of SKP1-cullin 1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ligase complexes, has recently been proven to be severed as an underlying pro-inflammatory factor in pathological processes of diverse diseases. Given these considerations, the current study aims at investigating whether FBXO3 exerts impacts on inflammation in cerebral I/R injury. In this study, first, it was verified that FBXO3 protein expression increased after a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and was specifically expressed in neurons other than microglia or astrocytes. Meanwhile, in mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 cells, the elevation of FBXO3 protein was observed after oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment. It was also found that interference of FBXO3 with siRNA significantly alleviated neuronal damage via inhibiting the inflammatory response in I/R injury both in vivo and in vitro. The FBXO3 inhibitor BC-1215 was used to confirm the pro-inflammatory effect of FBXO3 in the OGD/R model as well. Furthermore, by administration of FBXO3 siRNA and BC-1215, FBXO3 was verified to reduce the protein level of Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2), likely through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), to aggravate cerebral I/R injury. Collectively, our results underline the detrimental effect FBXO3 has on cerebral I/R injury by accelerating inflammatory response, possibly through ubiquitylating and degrading HIPK2. Despite the specific interaction between FBXO3 and HIPK2 requiring further study, we believe that our data suggest the therapeutic relevance of FBXO3 to ischemic stroke and provide a new perspective on the mechanism of I/R injury.

AB  - The unpredictable nature of the loads and non-linearity of the components of microgrid systems make optimal scheduling more complex. In this paper, a deterministic optimal load-scheduling problem is developed for microgrids operating in both islanding and grid-connected mode under different energy scenarios. Various cases are considered in this research, based on the interaction and dynamic behavior of the microgrid, considering electric vehicles (EVs) in the scenario. The aim of this research is to minimize the overall cost of microgrid operations. The concept of dynamic pricing has also been introduced in order to optimize the energy cost for the consumers. For ensuring the stability of the microgrids, a load variance index has been considered, and the fuzzy-based approach has been used for cost and load variance minimization to reduce the operation cost without compromising the stability of the microgrid. The grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations of EVs are integrated into the microgrid, which would help in valley filling and peak shaving of the loads during the off-peak and peak hours, respectively. In order to solve the proposed complex combinatorial optimization problem, elephant herding optimization (EHO) is modified and implemented. The performance of the proposed improved EHO (IEHO) is first tested on the latest CEC test functions. The results obtained by IEHO after 100 different trials are compared with the latest published methods and are found to be better based on the average value and the standard deviation for different CEC test functions. In addition, the simulation results obtained by particle swarm optimization (PSO), EHO, and proposed IEHO on a microgrid test system for different scenarios with all cases reveal that the proposed model with a mix of energy resources in the dynamic load dispatch environment bring the maximum benefits of microgrid systems. Furthermore, the results obtained from the simulation verifies that if free trade of power is allowed between the microgrids and the main grid, the process of power generation can be more economical, and further introduction of dynamic pricing into the scenario proves to be even cheaper. The implementation of the G2V and V2G operations of EVs operations in the proposed scenario not only helped in cost minimization but also helped in stabilizing the grid.

AB  - Background Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating from bile duct epithelial cells. Since tumor metastasis is associated with poor prognosis and short-term survival of patients, there is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches for CCA. Because of that reason, we aimed to investigate effect of SAHA which is known as HDAC inhibitor on extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line (TFK-1). Methods Cell cycle was measured by Muse Cell Analyzer. YAP, TAZ, TGF-beta protein levels were determined by western-blotting method. TEAD (1-3), TIMP2 and TIMP3 genes level were determined by real-time PCR analysis. Results We have seen the positive effects of SAHA on the TFK-1 cell line as it reduces cell viability and arresting cells in the G0/G1 phase. We also observed the negative effects of SAHA, as it increases the expression levels of YAP, TAZ, TGF-beta protein and TEAD (1-3) gene. We also found that SAHA reduced the expression levels of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in TFK-1 cells, but was not statistically significant. Conclusions Although observing its antiproliferative effects, these negative effects may be related to the cells being resistant to the drug or the remaining cells having a more aggressive phenotype. Therefore, we think that caution should be exercised in the use of this drug for CCA treatment.

AB  - In this work the effect of changing extracellular potassium concentration ([K+](o)) on spontaneous and evoked burst activity of glutamatergic neurons in the mouse hippocampus was investigated using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. It was shown that the increase of [K+](o) from 3 to 8.5 mM (potassium load): (1) induced spontaneous tonic and pacemaker burst activity in CA1 pyramidal cells (20% and 10% of total cells, respectively) but did not result in the emergence of pacemaker granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG). (2) Similarly, potassium load increased the evoked burst activity of CA1 pyramidal cells and, paradoxically, suppressed the burst activity of DG granule cells over the entire range of current steps from 10 to 200 pA. (3) Potassium load caused a rightward shift of the current-voltage (I/V) curves in both cell types, decreasing the reversal potential E-rev and increasing the slope of the I/V curves (amplitudes of inward currents at voltages from -100 mV to -70 mV) in the CA1 and DG neurons 2-3- and 4-5-fold, respectively. (4) Potassium load produced an opposite effect on outward currents, causing a significant increase in current amplitude in pyramidal cells and a decrease in granule cells (at membrane voltages above 0 mV). The inward and outward currents of DG neurons were 4-4.5 times higher than those of CA1 neurons. The possible involvement of potassium-activated and other potassium-conducting channels in different excitability responses of glutamatergic CA1 and DG neurons under potassium load is discussed. The high sensitivity of CA1 pyramidal cells to potassium load compared to DG granule cells may play an important role in hyperexcitation of neuronal networks during epileptogenesis.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effect of music in pain perception and the molecular mechanism. Methods: Mice were separated to control, music, music + inhibitor, and saline group. Percentage pain reduction of mice in each group was determined. The contents of 5-HT, Glu, and NE in cerebrospinal fluid of mice in the four groups were determined by HPLC. FISH was used to analyze the distribution characteristics of GRIK5 in hippocampal tissues. The protein expressions of GRIK5, NMDA 1, and TRPC1 in the hippocampal tissues were determined via western blot. Results: Mice exposed to music showed a higher percentage of pain reduction compared to model animals, while injection of GRIK5 inhibitor weakened the effect of music. It increased the contents of 5-HT, Glu, and NE in mouse models of depression. The fluorescence signal in music group was significantly stronger than saline group. Music remarkably increased the expression of GRIK5, DLG4, NMDA 1, and TRPC1 proteins when compared with saline group. Conclusion: Music promoted the secretion of Glu. The glutaminergic pathway sensed Glu, subsequently activated GRIK5, DLG4, and NMDA 1 proteins to excite dopaminergic neurons, and finally promoted the production of 5-HT.

AB  - Because immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are effective for a subset of melanoma patients, identification of melanoma subtypes responsive to ICIs is crucial. We performed clustering analyses to identify immune subtypes of melanoma based on the enrichment levels of 28 immune cells using transcriptome datasets for six melanoma cohorts, including four cohorts not treated with ICIs and two cohorts treated with ICIs. We identified three immune subtypes (Im-H, Im-M, and Im-L), reproducible in these cohorts. Im-H displayed strong immune signatures, low stemness and proliferation potential, genomic stability, high immunotherapy response rate, and favorable prognosis. Im-L showed weak immune signatures, high stemness and proliferation potential, genomic instability, low immunotherapy response rate, and unfavorable prognosis. The pathways highly enriched in Im-H included immune, MAPK, apoptosis, calcium, VEGF, cell adhesion molecules, focal adhesion, gap junction, and PPAR. The pathways highly enriched in Im-L included Hippo, cell cycle, and ErbB. Copy number alterations correlated inversely with immune signatures in melanoma, while tumor mutation burden showed no significant correlation. The molecular features correlated with favorable immunotherapy response included immune-promoting signatures and pathways of PPAR, MAPK, VEGF, calcium, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Our data recapture the immunological heterogeneity in melanoma and provide clinical implications for the immunotherapy of melanoma. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The accuracy of peak streamflow simulation is often lower than that of normal streamflow simulation, posing a significant challenge. This study introduces stochastic resonance (SR) to enhance simulation accuracy, utilizing its ability to leverage noise energy to improve correlations between streamflow and meteorological factors. The proposed SR-LSTM model, validated across major Chinese basins, demonstrates that SR effectively enhances the accuracy of streamflow simulations. By using SR, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency increased from 0.70 to 0.79, and the kling-gupta efficiency improved from 0.69 to 0.82. Furthermore, this study utilizes the global Caravan streamflow data set (including CAMELES, CAMELESBR, CAMELESAUS, and LamaH) comprising 1,244 station data points to validate the applicability of SR-LSTM. Results indicate that SR improves accuracy at approximately 70% of 1,244 stations, particularly in regions with high-quality data. Comparative analysis shows that incorporating SR enhances the performance of deep learning models, highlighting its potential for improving both global and peak streamflow simulation accuracy. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SR in enhancing streamflow simulation accuracy.

AB  - Low-ozone doses cause alterations in the oxidation-reduction mechanisms due to the increase in reactive oxygen species, alter cell signaling, and produce deleterious metabolic responses for cells. Adenosine 5'triphosphate (ATP) can act as a mediator in intercellular communication between neurons and glial cells. When there is an increase in extracellular ATP, a modification is promoted in the regulation of inflammation, energy metabolism, by affecting the intracellular signaling pathways that participate in these processes. The objective of this work was to study changes in the P2X7 receptor, and their relationship with the inflammatory response and energy metabolism, in a model of progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of rats chronically exposed to low-ozone doses. Therefore, 72 male rats were exposed to low-ozone doses for different periods of time. After exposure to ozone was finished, rats were processed for immunohistochemical techniques, western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and histological techniques for periodic acid-Schiff staining. The results showed immunoreactivity changes in the amount of the P2X7 protein. There was an increase in phosphorylation for glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-beta) as treatment continued. There were also increases in 27 interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) and a decrease in interleukin 10 (IL-10). Furthermore, neuronal glycogen was found at 30 and 60 days, and an increase in caspase 3. An increase in mRNA was also shown for the P2X7 gene at 60 days, and GSK3-beta at 90 days of exposure. In conclusion, these results suggest that repeated exposure to low-ozone doses, such as those that can occur during highly polluted days, causes a state of oxidative stress, leading to alterations in the P2X7 receptors, which promote changes in the activation of signaling pathways for inflammatory processes and cell death, converging at a progressive neurodegeneration process, as may be happening in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Brain aging is the most important risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, and abnormal apoptosis is linked to neuronal dysfunction. Specifically, studies have found that exercise effectively inhibits hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, while the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the impact of aerobic exercise on hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in aging mice and the potential involvement of DAPK1 and its downstream pathways based on recent data that DAPK1 may be associated with neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases. Senescent mice were subjected to 8 weeks of Aerobic training. Following behavioral testing, hippocampal samples were examined histologically and biochemically to detect pathological changes, neuronal apoptosis, and mRNA and protein levels. We found that the exercise intervention improved spatial memory and alleviated neuronal apoptosis in the brain. Notably, exercise down-regulated DAPK1 expression and inhibited Fas death receptor transactivation and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the hippocampus. These results shed new light on the protective effect of regular exercise against brain aging though modulating the DAPK1 pathway.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) comprise a range of early age-onset neurodevelopment disorders with genetic heterogeneity. Most ASD related genes are involved in synaptic function, which is regulated by mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) and its precursor proBDNF in a diametrically opposite manner: proBDNF inhibits while mBDNF potentiates synapses. Here we generated a knock-in mouse line (BDNFmet/leu) in which the conversion of proBDNF to mBDNF is attenuated. Biochemical experiments revealed residual mBDNF but excessive proBDNF in the brain. Similar to other ASD mouse models, the BDNFmet/leu mice showed reduced dendritic arborization, altered spines, and impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus. They also exhibited ASD-like phenotypes, including stereotypical behaviors and deficits in social interaction. Moreover, the plasma proBDNF/mBDNF ratio was significantly increased in ASD patients compared to normal children in a case-control study. Thus, deficits in proBDNF to mBDNF conversion in the brain may contribute to ASD-like behaviors, and plasma proBDNF/mBDNF ratio may be a potential biomarker for ASD.

AB  - Objective: To explore the role of polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1-like 1 (PKHD1L1) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Methods: Bioinformatics tools were utilized to examine the clinical profile of PKHD1L1 and chromobox protein homolog 7 (CBX7) in LUAD. The Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, Transwell, and wound-healing assays were carried out to assess the proliferative, apoptotic, invasive, and migrative capacities of the cells. Furthermore, the interrelation between PKHD1L1 and CBX7 was validated using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. A LUAD mice model was constructed by subcutaneous injection of A549 cells. Finally, immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate CBX7 and Ki67 expression. Results: PKHD1L1 was downregulated in LUAD and predicted dismal outcomes in patients with LUAD. PKHD1L1 upregulation repressed the proliferative, invasive, and migrative capabilities of A549 cells and exacerbated the apoptotic rate. Additionally, PKHD1L1 may bind to CBX7 and positively modulate CBX7 expression. CBX7 deletion partly abrogated the effects of PKHD1L1 upregulation on the cellular biological activities in A549 cells. Furthermore, the PKHD1L1/CBX7 axis regulates the Hippo signaling pathway in A549 cells. PKHD1L1 restricted tumor growth in LUAD xenograft mice; this was partly abolished by CBX7 knockdown. Conclusion: PKHD1L1 can hinder LUAD progression by regulating CBX7-mediated Hippo signaling.

AB  - The menopause transition is a vulnerable period for developing both psychiatric and metabolic disorders, and both can be enhanced by stressful events worsening their effects. The present study aimed to evaluate whether a cafeteria diet (CAF) combined with chronic variable stress (CVS) exacerbates anxious- or depressive-like behavior and neuronal activation, cell proliferation and survival, and microglia activation in middle-aged ovariectomized (OVX) rats. In addition, body weight, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and corticosterone as an index of metabolic changes or hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, and the serum pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-beta, and TNF alpha were measured. A CAF diet increased body weight, lipid profile, and insulin resistance. CVS increased corticosterone and reduced HDL. A CAF produced anxiety-like behaviors, whereas CVS induced depressive-like behaviors. CVS increased serum TNF alpha independently of diet. A CAF and CVS separately enhanced the percentage of Iba-positive cells in the hippocampus; the combination of factors further increased Iba-positive cells in the ventral hippocampus. A CAF and CVS increased the c-fos-positive cells in the hippocampus; the combination of factors increased the number of positive cells expressing c-fos in the ventral hippocampus even more. The combination of a CAF and CVS generates a slight neuroinflammation process and neuronal activation in a hippocampal region-specific manner and differentially affects the behavior.

AB  - Objective Environmental enrichment is used to treat social, communication, and behavioral deficits and is known to modify the expression of synaptic receptors. We compared the effects of environmental enrichment in the expression of glutamate and endocannabinoid receptors, which are widely expressed in the cerebellar cortex. These two receptors interact to regulate neuronal function and their dysregulation is associated with behavioral changes. We used BTBR + Itpr3tf/J mice, a strain that models behavioral disorders, and C57BL/6 mice for comparison. We studied the effects of genetic background, sex, environmental conditions, and layer of the cerebellar cortex on the expression of each receptor. Results The influence of genetic background and environmental enrichment had the same pattern on glutamate and endocannabinoid receptors in males. In contrast, in females, the effect of environmental enrichment and genetic background were different than the ones obtained for males and were also different between the glutamate and endocannabinoid receptors. Furthermore, an analysis of both receptors from tissue obtained from the same animals show that their expression is correlated in males, but not in females. Our results suggest that environmental enrichment has a receptor dependent and sexual dimorphic effect on the molecular expression of different receptors in the cerebellar cortex.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have established a robust correlation between exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) and various neurological disorders, with dysregulation of intracellular redox processes and cell death being key mechanisms involved. Ferroptosis, a cell death form characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and disruption of antioxidant defenses, may be involved in the neurotoxic effects of PM exposure. However, the relationship between PM-induced neurotoxicity and ferroptosis in nerve cells remains to be elucidated. In this study, we utilized a rat model (exposed to PM at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight per day for 4 weeks) and an HT22 cell model (exposed to PM at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 Ing/mL for 24 h) to investigate the potential induction of ferroptosis by PM exposure. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis was employed to identify hub genes that potentially contribute to the process of ferroptosis, which was subsequently validated through in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results revealed that PM exposure increased MDA content and Fe2+ levels, and decreased SOD activity and GSH/GSSG ratio in rat hippocampal and HT-22 cells. Through RNA sequencing analysis, bioinformatics analysis, and RT-qPCR experiments, we identified GSK3B as a possible hub gene involved in ferroptosis. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that PM exposure increased GSK3B levels and decreased Nrf2, and GPX4 levels in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, treatment with LY2090314, a specific inhibitor of GSK3B, was found to mitigate the PM-induced elevation of MDA and ROS and restore SOD activity and GSH/GSSG ratio. The LY2090314 treatment promoted the upregulation of Nrf2 and GPX4 and facilitated the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in HT-22 cells. Moreover, treatment with LY2090314 resulted in the upregulation of Nrf2 and GPX4, along with the facilitation of nuclear translocation of Nrf2. This study suggested that PM-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal cells may be via the GSK3B/Nrf2/GPX4 pathway.

AB  - Biodiesel produced from single feedstocks has many challenges due to variations in the oil properties. The flex-mix approach is a long-term solution for turning mixed feedstock into high-quality biodiesels. In this investigation, a pre-mixed used cooking oil and animal fat (pig fat) mixture (from 20% to 80%) was transesterified to produce flex-mix methyl ester (FMME). The FMME fuel characteristics were tested and compared to biodiesel standards. Generally, biodiesel emits higher oxides of nitrogen (NO (x) ) gas due to the presence of highly unsaturated compounds and oxygen. The present study aims to address this issue by adopting the flex-mix approach in combination with fuel injection strategies (400, 500 and 600 bar), exhaust gas recirculation (EGR 10%, 20% and 30%) and variable compression ratio (CR 17.5:1, 20:1 and 22:1). At a CR of 22 and an injection pressure (P (inj)) of 600 bar, the FMME fuel without EGR shows a minimum reduction in brake thermal efficiency of 0.15% when compared to diesel. Nitric oxide gas emissions decreased by nearly 50% for all P (inj) and EGR values, but they rose when the compression ratio was increased to 20 and 22. Smoke and hydrocarbon emissions also increased with the exhaust gas proportion. The engine performance with FMME fuel was found to be equivalent to that with fossil diesel fuel. According to the findings, the flex-mix approach could be a long-term alternative to producing renewable fuel for off-road diesel engine application.

AB  - Memory impairment is one of the cognitive symptoms in Huntington's disease (HD) which appears before motor dysfunction in patients. Various molecular mechanisms, including disruptions in neurotrophins levels, are involved in the occurrence of memory problems in HD. Alpha-pinene (APN), a member of the monoterpene family, exhibited beneficial effects in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. As a result, this study assessed the impact of APN on memory in the 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) induced model of HD in rats. Male Wistar rats received saline, 3-NP to model HD, or APN (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) plus 3-NP for 21 days to assess APN's effects. Working and spatial memory were examined by the Y-maze and Morris-water-maze (MWM) tests. The mRNA levels of neurotrophins and their receptors in the brain cortex and hippocampus of the rats were quantitatively assessed through Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. The results showed that APN, at all three doses, significantly prevented the disease phenotype induced by 3-NP administration. In addition, APN treatment elevated the gene expression levels of BDNF, TrkA, TrkB, and CREB, while significantly decreasing P75 NTR showing a dose-dependent effect in the brain cortex and hippocampus, compared to the 3-NP group. These findings suggest that APN alleviates 3-NP-induced memory deficits by enhancing neurotrophins and their receptor levels in an animal model of HD.

AB  - Experiments were carried out on recombinant B6.CBA-D13Mit76C (B6-M76C) and B6.CBA-D13Mit76B (B6-M76B) mouse lines created by transferring a 102.73-118.83 Mbp fragment of chromosome 13, containing the 5-HT1A receptor gene, from CBA or C57BL/6 strains to a C57BL/6 genetic background, correspondingly. We have recently shown different levels of 5-HT1A receptor functionality in these mouse lines. The administration of BDNF (300 ng/mouse, i.c.v.) increased the levels of exploratory activity and intermale aggression only in B6-M76B mice, without affecting depressive-like behavior in both lines. In B6-M76B mice the behavioral alterations were accompanied by a decrease in the 5-HT2A receptor functional activity and the augmentation of levels of serotonin and its main metabolite, 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), in the midbrain. Moreover, the levels of dopamine and its main metabolites, HVA (homovanillic acid) and DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid), were also elevated in the striatum of B6-M76B mice after BDNF treatment. In B6-M76C mice, central BDNF administration led only to a reduction in the functional activity of the 5-HT1A receptor and a rise in DOPAC levels in the midbrain. The obtained data suggest the importance of the 102.73-118.83 Mbp fragment of mouse chromosome 13, which contains the 5-HT1A receptor gene, for BDNF-induced alterations in behavior and the brain monoamine system.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SZ) is a heterogeneous mental disorder, affecting similar to 1% of the worldwide population. One of the main pathophysiological theories of SZ is the imbalance of excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, involving N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAr). This may lead to local glutamate storms coupled with excessive dendritic pruning and subsequent cellular stress, including nitrosative stress, during a critical period of neurodevelopment, such as adolescence. Nitrosative stress is mediated by nitric oxide (NO), which is released by NO synthases (NOS) and has emerged as a key signaling molecule implicated in SZ. Regarding glutamatergic models of SZ, the administration of NMDAr antagonists has been found to increase NOS levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral hippocampus (HPC). We hypothesized that suboptimal NOS function in adolescence could be a target for early treatments, including clozapine (CLZ) and the novel metabotropic glutamate receptor modulator JNJ-46356479 (JNJ). We analyzed the protein levels of NOS isoforms in adult PFC and HPC of a postnatal ketamine induced murine model of SZ receiving CLZ or JNJ during adolescence by western blot. Endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS increased under ketamine administration in PFC and decreased in CLZ or JNJ treatments. The same trends were found in the HPC in neuronal NOS. In contrast, inducible NOS was increased under JNJ treatment with respect to ketamine induction in the HPC, and the same trends were found in the PFC. Taken together, our findings suggest a misbalance of the NOS system following NMDAr antagonist administration, which was then modulated under early CLZ and JNJ treatments.

AB  - Solid-state fermentation represents a sustainable approach for the conversion of agro-industrial wastes into high-added-value feed ingredients. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the dietary addition of a solid-state-fermented mixture of olive mill stone waste (OMSW) and Lathyrus clymenum husks (LP) on the antioxidant blood parameters of weaned piglets. Two hundred 35-day-old weaned piglets were allotted into two groups and fed either a control (C) diet or a diet containing 50 g of OMSW-LP per kg (OMSW-LP) for 40 days. Blood samples were collected at 35 and 75 days of age to assess the free radical scavenging activity (FRSA), reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, catalase activity (CAT), protein carbonyls (CARBs), and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS). The OMSW-LP diet reduced the TBARS (p = 0.049) and CARB contents (p = 0.012) and increased the levels of FRSA (p = 0.005), GSH (p = 0.040), and CAT activity (p = 0.012) in the piglets' blood, likely due to the synergistic action of the antioxidants and bioactive compounds present in the OMSW-LP mixture. Overall, the dietary inclusion of solid-state-fermented OMSW-LP at 50 g/kg could potentially serve a bio-functional purpose since it enhanced the antioxidant blood parameters in this study, a crucial factor for the health and growth of piglets post-weaning.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, ataxia and neuropsychological problems. This disease is quite common in the general population with approximately 20 million carriers worldwide. The risk of developing FXTAS increases dramatically with age, with about 45% of male carriers over the age of 50 being affected. FXTAS is caused by a CGG-repeat expansion (CGG(exp)) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. CGG(exp) RNA is translated into the FMRpolyG protein by a mechanism called RAN translation. Although both gene and pathogenic trigger are known, no therapeutic interventions are available at this moment. Here, we present, for the first time, primary hippocampal neurons derived from the ubiquitous inducible mouse model which is used as a screening tool for targeted interventions. A promising candidate is the repeat binding, RAN translation blocking, small molecule 1a. Small molecule 1a shields the disease-causing CGG(exp) from being translated into the toxic FMRpolyG protein. Primary hippocampal neurons formed FMRpolyG-positive inclusions, and upon treatment with 1a, the numbers of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions are reduced. We also describe for the first time the formation of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions in the liver of this mouse model. Treatment with 1a reduced the insoluble FMRpolyG protein fraction in the liver but not the number of inclusions. Moreover, 1a treatment had a reducing effect on the number of Rad23b-positive inclusions and insoluble Rad23b protein levels. These data suggest that targeted small molecule therapy is effective in an FXTAS mouse model and has the potential to treat CGG(exp)-mediated diseases, including FXTAS.

AB  - The subsurface flow contribution to a basin hydrograph is often conceptualized as a single lumped reservoir parameterized by a power law function fit through the observed recession behavior of the basin. However, basins may be better represented as multiple independent subsurface hillslope reservoirs characterized with variable, transient recession behavior as a function of the time history of recharge. In this work, we unify the latter, more complex understanding of the subsurface with the large-scale power law recession behavior convenient in hydrologic modeling applications. This unification is achieved by deriving upscaling relationships capable of converting simple metrics of basin hillslope topography into a signature basin response characterizing the subsurface-flow-induced recession from a single recharge event. Event superposition may then be used to simulate the application of a time series of recharge and a simple scaling relationship may be used to handle basins with homogeneous conductivity. The signature response is informed by numerical simulations of the hillslope-storage Boussinesq equation for unconfined saturated flow through sloping hillslopes applied to 30 basins in the CAMELS database. The efficacy of the upscaled signature response in replicating numerical simulations in 50 CAMELS basins is demonstrated, as is the practical efficacy of the upscaling relationships for predicting transient recession in 17 of these basins. The upscaled signature response method thus provides a tool for hydrologic modelers to estimate transient recession parameters using the insights of subsurface flow modeling, although the predictions made by this method are unable to capture the full variability of observed recession behavior.

AB  - It is increasingly evident that plants interact with their outside world through the production of volatile organic compounds,(1-5) but whether the volatiles have evolved to serve in plant defense is still a topic of considerable debate.(3,6-8) Unharmed leaves constitutively release small amounts of volatiles, but when the leaves are damaged by herbivorous arthropods, they emit substantially more volatiles. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) attract parasitoids and predators that kill insect herbivores,(9-12) and this can benefit the plants.(13,14) As yet, however, there is no tangible evolutionary evidence that this tritrophic interplay contributes to the selection forces that have shaped the volatile emissions of plants.(2,3,5-8,15) With this in mind, we investigated the evolutionary changes in volatile emissions in invasive common ragwort and the respective defensive roles of its constitutive and inducible volatiles. This Eurasian plant has invaded other continents, where it evolved for many generations in the absence of specialized herbivores and their natural enemies. We found that, compared to native ragworts, invasive plants release higher levels of constitutive volatiles but considerably lower levels of herbivore-induced volatiles. As a consequence, invasive ragwort is more attractive to a specialist moth but avoided by an unadapted generalist moth. Importantly, conforming to the indirect defense hypothesis, a specialist parasitoid was much more attracted to caterpillar-damaged native ragwort, which was reflected in higher parasitism rates in a field trial. The evolution of foliar volatile emissions appears to be indeed driven by their direct and indirect roles in defenses against insects.

AB  - Parasitoids of herbivores exploit inducible plant volatiles to find plants with potential hosts from a distance, whereas at close range they typically use host-derived cues to pinpoint and identify suitable hosts. Here, we show, however, that the egg parasitoid Trichogramma japonicum assesses host egg quality far more efficiently by remotely using oviposition-induced plant volatiles (OIPVs). In olfactometer assays, female T. japonicum wasps showed a strong preference for the odor of rice plants carrying 2-day-old eggs of the rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis over the odor of plants with younger or older eggs, a preference that correlated with higher parasitism rates. In accordance with the preference-performance hypothesis, the offspring of T. japonicum showed superior performance in 2-day-old eggs, including shorter development times and higher eclosion rates. Volatile analysis revealed significantly increased emission of D-limonene and alpha-pinene from plants with 2-day-old eggs, and we found that synthetic versions of these two monoterpenes were highly attractive to the wasp. Knockout rice plants deficient in D-limonene and alpha-pinene synthesis lost their appeal to the wasps, but attraction could be restored by dispensing synthetic versions of the attractants alongside the knockouts. These findings reveal a novel and highly efficient host-assessment strategy in egg parasitoids, whereby plant-provided cues inform the wasps about host quality from afar. This discovery is illustrative of the clever strategies that have evolved out of plant-insect interactions and offers fresh ideas to optimally exploit plant traits for biocontrol approaches against C. medinalis, a major rice pest.

AB  - The spread of prion-like protein aggregates is a common driver of pathogenesis in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related Tauopathies. Tau pathologies exhibit a clear progressive spreading pattern that correlates with disease severity. Clinical observation combined with complementary experimental studies has shown that Tau preformed fibrils (PFF) are prion-like seeds that propagate pathology by entering cells and templating misfolding and aggregation of endogenous Tau. While several cell surface receptors of Tau are known, they are not specific to the fibrillar form of Tau. Moreover, the underlying cellular mechanisms of Tau PFF spreading remain poorly understood. Here, it is shown that the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag3) is a cell surface receptor that binds to PFF but not the monomer of Tau. Deletion of Lag3 or inhibition of Lag3 in primary cortical neurons significantly reduces the internalization of Tau PFF and subsequent Tau propagation and neuron-to-neuron transmission. Propagation of Tau pathology and behavioral deficits induced by injection of Tau PFF in the hippocampus and overlying cortex are attenuated in mice lacking Lag3 selectively in neurons. These results identify neuronal Lag3 as a receptor of pathologic Tau in the brain?and for AD and related Tauopathies, a therapeutic target.
   Tau pathology spreads progressively in a hierarchical pattern linked to cognitive decline. Human and experimental studies show Alzheimer's and related Tauopathies progress via misfolded Tau propagating between cells. Lag3 is identified as a receptor enabling Tau fibril cell-cell transmission. This significantly advances the understanding of Tau transmission mechanisms and presents Lag3-blocking therapy as a novel approach. image

AB  - Beetles that feed on the nutritionally depauperate and recalcitrant tissues provided by the leaves, stems, and roots of living plants comprise one-quarter of herbivorous insect species. Among the key adaptations for herbivory are plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) that break down the fastidious polymers in the cell wall and grant access to the nutritious cell content. While largely absent from the non-herbivorous ancestors of beetles, such PCWDEs were occasionally acquired via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or by the uptake of digestive symbionts. However, the macroevolutionary dynamics of PCWDEs and their impact on evolutionary transitions in herbivorous insects remained poorly understood. Through genomic and transcriptomic analyses of 74 leaf beetle species and 50 symbionts, we show that multiple independent events of microbe- to-beetle HGT and specialized symbioses drove convergent evolutionary innovations in approximately 21,000 and 13,500 leaf beetle species, respectively. Enzymatic assays indicate that these events significantly expanded the beetles' digestive repertoires and thereby contributed to their adaptation and diversification. Our results exemplify how recurring HGT and symbiont acquisition catalyzed digestive and nutritional adaptations to herbivory and thereby contributed to the evolutionary success of a megadiverse insect taxon.

AB  - The feeding of piercing-sucking insect herbivores often elicits changes in their host plants that benefit the insect. 1 In addition to thwarting a host's defense responses, these phloem-feeding insects may manipulate source-sink signaling so as to increase resources consumed. 2,3 To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying herbivore-induced resource reallocation remain less investigated. Brown planthopper (BPH), an important rice pest, feeds on the phloem and oviposits into leaf sheaths. BPH herbivory increases sugar accumulations 5-fold in the phloem sap of leaf sheaths and concurrently induces the expression of two clade III SWEET genes, SWEET13 and SWEET14 , in leaf tissues, but not in leaf sheaths of attacked rice plants. Mutations of both genes by genome editing attenuate resistance to BPH without alterations of known chemical and physical defense responses. Moreover, BPH-elicited sugar levels in the phloem sap were significantly reduced in sweet13/14 mutants, which is likely to attenuate BPH feeding behavior on sweet13/14 mutants. In one of the two field seasons tested, the sweet13/14 mutants showed comparable yield to wild types, and in the other season, the mutants demonstrated stronger BPH resistance. These preliminary results suggested that the mutations in these SWEET transporters could enhance BPH resistance without yield penalties. Given that sweet13 / 14 mutants also exhibit resistance to bacterial blight pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , these SWEET genes could serve as excellent molecular targets for the breeding of resistant rice cultivars.

AB  - While it is well-acknowledged that neurovascular dysfunction in hypertension is tightly associated with accelerated brain aging, we contend that the deleterious effects of hypertension may extend beyond affecting only the arteries. Methylglyoxal (MG) derived from glycolysis, is involved in the accumulation of advanced glycated end products (AGEs), which are the hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the present study aims to firstly investigate the role of MG metabolism in the hypertension-accelerated brain aging process. The results of our study indicate that the levels of MG increase with age in both the plasma and hippocampus of SHRs at 12, 16, and 30 weeks old. AGE methylglyoxal-hydro imidazoline-1 (MG-H1) is primarily localized in astrocytes, while its presence was not observed in neurons and microglia within the hypertensive hippocampus. Our observations also suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) enhances glucose uptake and glycolysis while reducing the expression of Glo1 in cultured astrocytes. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was found to counteract the increase in escape latency and inhibit the activation of the AGEs-RAGE axis in 30-week-old SHRs. NAC decreased Iba-1 immunofluorescence intensity, inhibited the levels of pro-inflammatory markers, and enhanced the abundance of anti-inflammatory markers in the hippocampus of SHRs. Moreover, NAC reduced the immunofluorescence signal of 4HNE and increased the content of GSH and SOD in SHRs. Finally, NAC was observed to inhibit apoptosis in the hippocampus of SHRs. Collectively, we firstly showed the enhanced accumulation of MG in the hypertensive brain, whereas the clearance of MG by NAC treatment mitigated the aging process and attenuated AGEs generation, neuro-inflammation, and oxidative damage.

AB  - Transient global amnesia, both persistent and transient, is a very common neuropsychiatric syndrome. Among animal models for amnesia and testing new drugs, the scopolamine test is the most widely used for transient global amnesia (TGA). This study examined the scopolamine-induced deficits in working memory, discriminative memory, anxiety, and motor activity in the presence of intranasal PEA-OXA, a dual antagonist of presynaptic & alpha;2 and H3 receptors. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with intraperitoneal scopolamine (1 mg/kg) with or without pre-treatment (15 min) or post-treatment (15 min) with intranasal PEA-OXA (10 mg/kg). It was seen that scopolamine induced deficits of discriminative and spatial memory and motor deficit. These changes were associated with a loss of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus: impaired LTP after lateral entorhinal cortex/perforant pathway tetanization. Furthermore, hippocampal Ach levels were increased while ChA-T expression was reduced following scopolamine administration. PEA-OXA either prevented or restored the scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits (discriminative and spatial memory). However, the same treatment did not affect the altered motor activity or anxiety-like behavior induced by scopolamine. Consistently, electrophysiological analysis showed LTP recovery in the DG of the hippocampus, while the Ach level and ChoA-T were normalized. This study confirms the neuroprotective and pro-cognitive activity of PEA-OXA (probably through an increase in the extracellular levels of biogenic amines) in improving transient memory disorders for which the available pharmacological tools are obsolete or inadequate and not directed on specific pathophysiological targets.

AB  - Chronic stress is the key factor contributing to the development of depressive symptoms. Chronic restraint stress (CRS) is well validated and is one of the most commonly used models to induce depressive-like behavior in rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate whether fluoxetine (FLU 5 mg/kg) and zinc (Zn 10mg/kg) given simultaneously induce a more pronounced antidepressant-like effect in the CRS model than both those compounds given alone. Behavioral assessment was performed using the tail suspension and splash tests (TST and ST, respectively). Furthermore, the effects of CRS, FLU and Zn given alone and combined treatment with FLU + Zn on the expression of proteins involved in the apoptotic, inflammatory, and epigenetic processes were evaluated in selected brain structures (prefrontal cortex, PFC; and hippocampus, Hp) using Western blot analysis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The results obtained indicated that three hours (per day) of immobilization for 4 weeks induced prominent depressive symptoms that manifested as increased immobility time in the TST, as well as decreased number and grooming time in the ST. Behavioral changes induced by CRS were reversed by both FLU (5 and 10 mg/kg) or Zn (10 mg/kg). Zinc supplementation (10 mg/kg) slightly increases the effectiveness of FLU (5 mg/kg) in the TST. However, it significantly increased the activity of FLU in the ST compared to the effect induced by FLU and Zn alone. Biochemical studies revealed that neither CRS nor FLU and Zn given alone or in combined treatment alter the expression of proteins involved in apoptotic or inflammatory processes. CRS induced major alterations in histone deacetylase (HDAC) levels by increasing the level of HADC1 and decreasing the level of HADC4 in the PFC and Hp, decreasing the level of HADC6 in the PFC but increasing it in Hp. Interestingly, FLU + Zn treatment reversed CRS-induced changes in HDAC levels in the Hp, indicating that HDAC modulation is linked to FLU + Zn treatment and this effect is structure-specific.

AB  - Birds strongly rely on spatial memory and navigation. Therefore, it is of utmost interest to reveal how space is represented in the avian brain. Here we used tetrodes to record neurons from the hippocampal formation of Japanese quails-a ground-dwelling species-while the quails roamed in an open-field arena. Whereas spatially modulated cells (place cells, grid cells, border cells) were generally not encountered, the firing rate of about 12% of the neurons was unimodally and significantly modulated by the head azimuth-i.e., these were head-direction cells (HD cells). Typically, HD cells were maximally active at one preferred direction and minimally at the opposite null direction, with preferred directions spanning all 360' across the population. The preferred direction was independent of the animal's position and speed and was stable during the recording session. The HD tuning was broader compared to that of HD cells in rodents, and most cells had non-zero baseline firing in all directions. However, similar to findings in rodents, the HD tuning usually rotated with the rotation of a salient visual cue in the arena. Thus, these findings support the existence of an allocentric HD representation in the quail hippocampal formation and provide the first demonstration of HD cells in birds.

TI  - Lycopene Ameliorates Hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension via Suppression of Oxidative Stress
T2  - OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY
LA  - English
AB  - Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary system disease characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling. Its occurrence and progression are closely related to oxidative stress. Lycopene, extracted from red vegetables and fruits, exhibits a particularly high antioxidant capacity that is beneficial for cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the role and mechanism of lycopene in HPH remain unknown. Here, we found that lycopene reversed the elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular remodeling induced by hypoxia in rats. In vitro, lycopene caused lower proliferation and migration of PASMCs, with higher apoptosis. Consistent with the antiproliferative result of lycopene on hypoxic PASMCs, the hippo signaling pathway associated with cell growth was activated. Furthermore, lycopene reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the lungs and serum of rats under hypoxia conditions. The expression of NOX4 in the lungs was also significantly decreased. Hypoxic PASMCs subjected to lycopene showed decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NOX4 expression. Importantly, lycopene repressed HIF-1 alpha expression both in the lungs and PASMCs in response to hypoxia in the absence of a significant change of HIF-1 alpha mRNA. Compared with 2ME2 (a HIF-1 alpha inhibitor) alone treatment, lycopene treatment did not significantly change PASMC proliferation, NOX4 expression, and ROS production after 2ME2 blocked HIF-1 alpha, suggesting the inhibitory effect of lycopene on HIF-1 alpha-NOX4-ROS axis and the targeted effect on HIF-1 alpha. After CHX blocked protein synthesis, lycopene promoted the protein degradation of HIF-1 alpha. MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, notably reversed the decrease in HIF-1 alpha protein level induced by lycopene in response to hypoxia. Therefore, lycopene suppressed hypoxia-induced oxidative stress through HIF-1 alpha-NOX4-ROS axis, thereby alleviating HPH. Our findings will provide a new research direction for clinical HPH therapies.

TI  - A Novel Strategy for Automatic Selection of Cross-Basin Data to Improve Local Machine Learning-Based Runoff Models

KW  - data selection
AB  - Previous studies have shown that regional deep learning (DL) models can improve runoff prediction by leveraging large hydrological datasets. However, training a DL regional model using all data without screening may degrade local performance. This study focuses on constructing enhanced local models through the utilization of cross-basin data. To this end, we propose an approach that employs a novel training strategy to optimize DL model training for specific basins. The approach measures the impact of any one basin's gradient on the loss of the basin of interest, providing insights into the relationships between different basins. The approach was validated using 531 basins from the CAMELS dataset. Results suggest that local performance degradation is a common occurrence in regional models, and imbalanced data are likely to result in a specific pattern dominating the entire regional model. In comparison to a regional model simply trained with all basins, the median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for our models is 0.031 higher. In particular, the increase in NSE can exceed 0.2 for some dry basins. Our findings indicate that this novel DL strategy can significantly improve model performance in specific basins using large hydrological datasets, while mitigating local performance loss.
   In the realm of deep learning, incorporating more data into the training process typically results in a more potent model. Conventionally, large datasets have been employed to train regional models with the intention of predicting rainfall-runoff processes across all basins. However, such regional models often encounter performance degradation when applied to local basins. This degradation can be attributed to the extraction of overly general features, leading to a loss of specificity. In this paper, our objective is to harness information from a large dataset to establish a more robust local model. We have introduced a method that autonomously learns the similarities in rainfall-runoff behavior among basins. Subsequently, we utilize this learned similarity to selectively choose data that proves advantageous for training the local model. Our results demonstrate that this strategy can significantly enhance runoff prediction, particularly in arid basins.
   Training a DL regional model using all data without screening may degrade local performance Proper selection of training data is crucial for enhancing DL model training for individual basins, especially arid basins Data from different basins might act as mutual noise during the training process

AB  - Doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used as an anticancer drug in humans' various solid and haematological tumours. Although many studies on the toxic effect of DOX are used in different organs, its impact on brain tissue has yet to be adequately studied. This study investigated the protective effect of selenium (Se) and the role of transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) channel activation against brain damage caused by DOX administration. Sixty rats were randomly divided into the sham, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), DOX, DOX + Se, DOX + N-(p-amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (ACA), and DOX + Se + ACA groups. The reactive oxygen species (ROS), poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1), and TRPM2 channel levels in brain tissues were measured by ELISA. In addition, a histopathological examination was performed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas, and the TRPM2 channel, NF-icB, and caspase-3 expression were determined immunohistochemically. The levels of ROS, PARP1 and TRPM2 channel in the DOX group were higher than in the sham and DMSO groups (P < 0.05). However, these parameters were decreased in the in DOX+Se and DOX+ACA groups by the treatments of Se and ACA (P < 0.05). Also, we determined that Se and ACA treatment decreased the NF-icB, caspase-3, and TRPM2 channel expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas in the DOX-induced rats. The data showed that Se and/or ACA administration together with DOX administration could be used as a protective agent against DOX-induced brain damage.

AB  - Background: Dementia poses a serious threat to the daily and social abilities of patients, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a metabolite of the gut microbiota involved in regulating the inflammatory response. However, the role of TMAO in dementia needs further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of TMAO on dementia, which may provide ideas for the treatment of dementia.Materials and methods: Dementia mice were induced by D-galactose + AlCl3, and the changes in learning memory capacity, histopathology, inflammatory factors, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR in mice treated with TMAO were analyzed to determine the mechanism of TMAO action on dementia. In addition, the effect of TMAO+PI3K inhibitor treatment on mice was also analyzed to further determine the mechanism of TMAO effect on dementia.Results: The results revealed that the dementia group had significantly higher TMAO levels and a significant hippocampal injury and inflammatory response. TMAO treatment promoted hippocampal injury and promoted the level of inflammatory cytokines. Further study of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway showed that the expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR was significantly increased in the dementia group, and it was more obvious after TMAO treatment. And hippocampal injury, inflammatory response, and increase of p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR were reversed by TMAO+PI3K inhibitor.Conclusions: This study determined that TMAO promotes dementia through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting that TMAO may be a potential target for dementia.

AB  - Gene therapy with AAV vectors carrying genes for neuropeptide Y and its receptor Y2 has been shown to inhibit seizures in multiple animal models of epilepsy. It is however unknown how the AAV serotype or the sequence order of these two transgenes in the expression cassette affects the actual parenchymal gene expression levels and the seizure-suppressant efficacy. To address these questions, we compared three viral vector serotypes (AAV1, AAV2 and AAV8) and two transgene sequence orders (NPY-IRES-Y2 and Y2-IRES-NPY) in a rat model of acutely induced seizures. Wistar male rats were injected bilaterally with viral vectors and 3 weeks later acute seizures were induced by a subcutaneous injection of kainate. The latency until 1(st) motor seizure, time spent in motor seizure and latency to status epilepticus were measured to evaluate the seizure-suppressing efficacy of these vectors compared to an empty cassette control vector. Based on the results, the effect of the AAV1-NPY-IRES-Y2 vector was further investigated by in vitro electrophysiology, and its ability to achieve transgene overexpression in resected human hippocampal tissue was evaluated. The AAV1-NPY-IRES-Y2 proved to be better to any other serotype or gene sequence considering both transgene expression and ability to suppress induced seizures in rats. The vector also demonstrated transgene-induced decrease of glutamate release from excitatory neuron terminals and significantly increased both NPY and Y2 expression in resected human hippocampal tissue from patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. These results validate the feasibility of NPY/Y2 receptor gene therapy as a therapeutic opportunity in focal epilepsies.

AB  - Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) has very long history of cultivation and abundant germplasm resources in China. Purple bud is a characteristic variety, which has attracted the attention of breeding researchers because it accumulated a large number of anthocyanins naturally. In many species, R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) were proved to be involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Research on anthocyanin metabolism has been relatively clear in some species, but that needs to be further elucidated in tea plants. In this research, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor CsMYB113 related to the anthocyanin accumulation regulation was identified from tea plants. Spatial and temporal expression analysis revealed differential expression of CsMYB113 among different tissues and organs, with highest expression occurring in the roots. Subcellular localization assays showed that CsMYB113 localized in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of CsMYB113 increased pigmentation and anthocyanin contents by the upregulation of the expression levels of genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway among different tissues of Arabidopsis. Moreover, transient overexpression of 35S::CsMYB113 in tea plant increased the anthocyanin contents in the leaves. Our results indicated that CsMYB113 plays important role in the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation in tea plants. It will also provide useful candidate gene for the modification of anthocyanin metabolism by genetic engineering in plants.

AB  - Results with the use of hCG after synchronization protocol are still inconsistent, which may vary according to breed, season, day of application and dose of the drug used. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the functionality of luteal tissue and ovarian perfusion after hCG treatment during early luteal phase. Estrus-synchronized ewes were randomly assigned to receive i.m. injection of 300 IU of hCG (G-hCG; n = 40) or 1 mL of saline (G-Control; n = 32) on Day 7.5 after progesterone withdrawal. Ultrasonographic evaluations of the ovaries and ovarian and iliac arteries were performed on Days 7.5, 10.5, 13.5, and 21.5. The accessory corpus luteum (aCL) formation rate was 52.5% for G-hCG. There was interaction (p > 0.05) for treatment (G-hCG and G-Control), days (7.5, 10.5, 13.5 and 21.5) and PD (Pregnant and Non-pregnant) for the variables of biometric characteristics of the corpus luteum B-Mode and Color Doppler on days 7.5, 10.5, 13.5 and 21.5. There was no difference (p > 0.05) for pregnancy rates and mean fetuses per ewe between the treatment groups. It is concluded that the application of hCG 7.5 days after the hormonal protocol in Morada Nova ewes in a breeding season is efficient in inducing aCL formation and increasing luteal tissue biometry. However, there was no effect on pregnancy rate.

AB  - Rivastigmine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, is frequently indicated in the management of demented conditions associated with Alzheimer disease. The major hurdle of delivering this drug through the oral route is its poor bioavailability, which prompted the development of novel delivery approaches for improved efficacy. Due to numerous beneficial properties associated with nanocarriers in the drug delivery system, rivastigmine nanoparticles were fabricated to be administer through the intranasal route. During the development of the nanoparticles, preliminary optimization of processing and formulation parameters was done by the design of an experimental approach. The drug-polymer ratio, stirrer speed, and crosslinking time were fixed as independent variables, to analyze the effect on the entrapment efficiency (% EE) and in vitro drug release of the drug. The formulation (D8) obtained from 2(3) full factorial designs was further coated using Eudragit EPO to extend the release pattern of the entrapped drug. Furthermore, the 1:1 ratio of core to polymer depicted spherical particle size of ~175 nm, % EE of 64.83%, 97.59% cumulative drug release, and higher flux (40.39 & PLUSMN; 3.52 mu g.h/cm(2)). Finally, the intranasal ciliotoxicity study on sheep nasal mucosa revealed that the exposure of developed nanoparticles was similar to the negative control group, while destruction of normal architecture was noticed in the positive control test group. Overall, from the in vitro results it could be summarized that the optimization of nanoparticles' formulation of rivastigmine for intranasal application would be retained at the application site for a prolonged duration to release the entrapped drug without producing any local toxicity at the mucosal region.

AB  - Initial seizures observed in young rats during the 60 min after administration of pilocarpine (Pilo) were delayed and attenuated by pretreatment with a non-convulsive dose of methionine sulfoximine (MSO). We hypothesized that the effect of MSO results from a) glutamine synthetase block-mediated inhibition of conversion of Glu/Gln precursors to neurotransmitter Glu, and/or from b) altered synaptic Glu release. Pilo was administered 60 min prior to sacrifice, MSO at 75 mg/kg, i.p., 2.5 h earlier. [1,2-C-13]acetate and [U-C-13]glucose were i.p.-injected either together with Pilo (short period) or 15 min before sacrifice (long period). Their conversion to Glu and Gln in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex was followed using [C-13] gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Release of in vitro loaded Glu surrogate, [H-3]d-Asp from ex vivo brain slices was monitored in continuously collected superfusates. [H-3]d-Asp uptake was tested in freshly isolated brain slices. At no time point nor brain region did MSO modify incorporation of [C-13] to Glu or Gln in Pilo-treated rats. MSO pretreatment decreased by ~37% high potassium-induced [H-3]d-Asp release, but did not affect [H-3]d-Asp uptake. The results indicate that MSO at a non-convulsive dose delays the initial Pilo-induced seizures by interfering with synaptic Glu-release but not with neurotransmitter Glu recycling.</p>

AB  - This study evaluated the use of the GnRH agonist hormone, deslorelin, to control the follicular population before initiating multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) treatment. Twenty-four cross-bred Santa In & ecirc;s ewes, aged between 2 and 4 years, were randomly assigned to either a control group (n = 11) or a treated group (n = 13). All ewes received an intravaginal device containing 60 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate on day 0, and a new device on day 7, which remained in place until day 14. Additionally, the ewes were administered 125 mu g of cloprostenol on day 7. The superovulatory treatment involved administering 200 mg of pFSH, divided into eight decreasing doses at 12-h intervals starting on day 12. On day 14, 300 IU of eCG was administered. In the deslorelin group, three doses of 100 mu g of deslorelin were administered starting on day 3 after the insertion of the vaginal device, with subsequent doses given at 72-h and 144-h intervals. Natural mating was performed 36 h after the removal of the progesterone implant using males with proven fertility. Embryo collection took place on the 6th day after mating, and the recovered structures were quantified and evaluated for quality and developmental stage. Transrectal ultrasonography was conducted on days 12, 16 and 21 to evaluate the ovaries, specifically to assess the ovarian follicular population and the presence of the corpus luteum. Ewes in the control group had higher embryo recovery rates (p < .01) compared to the treated group (5.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8), with differences observed primarily in the number of morulae. The number of corpus luteum observed during the laparotomy on day 21 was significantly higher (p < .01) in the control group (10.44 vs. 4.5 corpus luteum per ewe). Yet, the treated group had a significantly higher number of follicles (p < .05) on the first day of pFSH application (5.5 vs. 3.0 follicles per ewe). In conclusion, although the inclusion of deslorelin in the superovulation protocol resulted in increased synchronization of oestrus and follicle number, it did not lead to an increase in the number of corpus luteum or harvested embryos.

AB  - Background Tea is the most popular beverage worldwide second only to water. Its demand is tremendously rising due to increased awareness of its medicinal importance. The quality and uses of tea depend on the tea-types which are mainly three types including China, Assam and Cambod type having distinct compositions of secondary metabolites. Huge variation in secondary metabolites in different tea-types and cultivars limited the successful application of various approaches used for its trait improvement. The efficiency of a protocol for isolation of protoplast is specific to the types and cultivars of tea plants. The existing tea protoplast-isolation protocols [which were optimized for tea-types (China and Assam type) and Chinese cultivars grown in China] were found ineffective on types/cultivars grown in India due to type/cultivar variability. Therefore, optimization of protoplast-isolation protocol is essential for tea-types/cultivars grown in India, as it is the second largest producer of tea and the largest producer of black tea. Here, efforts were made to develop an efficient protoplast-isolation protocol from all major types of tea (China, Assam and Cambod types) grown in India and also from three types of tender leaves obtained from field-grown, hydroponically-grown and tissue culture-grown tea plants.Results Developed protoplast-isolation protocol was effective for different types of leaf tissue obtained from the tender leaves of field-grown, hydroponically-grown and tissue culture-grown tea plants. Moreover, optimized protocol effectively worked on all three types of tea including China, Assam and Cambod types cultivated in India. The digestion of leaves with 3% cellulase R-10, 0.6% macerozyme, 1% hemicellulase and 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone for 12 h at 28oC yielded approximately 3.8-4.6 x 107 protoplasts per gram fresh tissue and 80-95% viability in selected tea cultivars, and tissue culture plant material was found most appropriate for protoplast isolation.Conclusions In conclusion, we reported an efficient protocol for isolation of protoplasts from tender tea leaves of all major tea-types (China, Assam and Cambod) grown in India. Moreover, the protocol is also effective for tender-leaf tissue of field-grown, hydroponically-grown and tissue culture-grown tea plants. The findings are expected to contribute to the genetic improvement of tea traits widely.

AB  - Caffeine is an important functional substance and is abundant in tea plant, but little is known about how its biosynthesis is regulated by transcription factors. In this study, the NAC-like transcription factor-encoding gene CsNAC7, which is involved in caffeine synthesis, was isolated from a Yinghong 9 cDNA library using a yeast one-hybrid assay; this gene comprises 1371 bp nucleotides and is predicted to encode 456 amino acids. The expression of CsNAC7 at the transcriptional level in tea shoots shared a similar pattern with that of the caffeine synthase gene yhNMT1 in the spring and summer, and its expressed protein was localized in the nucleus. Assays of gene activity showed that CsNAC7 has self-activation activity in yeast, that the active region is at the N-terminus, and that the transient expression of CsNAC7 could significantly promote the expression of yhNMT1 in tobacco leaves. In addition, overexpression or silencing of CsNAC7 significantly increased or decreased the expression of yhNMT1 and the accumulation of caffeine in transgenic tea calli, respectively. Our data suggest that the isolated transcription factor CsNAC7 positively regulates the caffeine synthase gene yhNMT1 and promotes caffeine accumulation in tea plant.

AB  - Progestogens' anti-anxiety and anti-depressive effects and mechanisms are not well-understood. Progestogens are hypothesized to have anti-anxiety and anti-depressive effects on behavior, independent of actions at nuclear progestin receptors (NPRs) and dependent on allopregnanolone (5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one; 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP), a 5 alpha-reduced, neuroactive metabolite of progesterone (P-4). Adult c57 mice in behavioral estrus (proestrus; pro) showed more anti-anxiety-like and anti-depressant-like behavior and higher levels of estradiol (E-2), P-4, and allopregnanolone in the hippocampus/amygdala complex. Proestrus c57 > 5 alpha-reductase knockout (5 alpha RKO) mice made more central entries in an open field than diestrus c57 and 5 alpha RKO mice that were not different. Ovariectomized (OVX) c57 mice administered 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg P-4 SC showed dosage-dependent increases in central entries in an open field (more anti-anxiety-like behavior); 5 alpha RKO mice had maximal increases at 1-2 mg/kg P-4. OVX c57 and 5 alpha RKO mice showed maximum increases in central entries with SC 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP (4 mg/kg), and c57s showed a similar maximal response to P-4 (4 mg/kg), but 5 alpha RKOs response was half at that dosage. P-4 (4 mg/kg SC to OVX c57 or progestin receptor knockout (PRKO) mice decreased immobility (depression-like behavior) in the forced swim task. Effects of E-2 and veh were similar in both groups. Levels of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP in the hippocampus/amygdala were consistent with effects on central entries in the open field. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus/amygdala were greater among E-2-primed (0.09 mg/kg, SC) vs vehicle-administered mice. In sum, adult female mice can be responsive to P-4 for anti-anxiety/anti-depressant-like behavior; such effects may be independent of NPRs but require 5 alpha-reduction and E-2's priming actions at BDNF in the hippocampus/amygdala complex.

AB  - Maternal stress has been described as an important component in the offspring's cerebral development, altering the susceptibility to diseases in later life. Moreover, the postnatal period is essential for the development and integration of several peripheral and central systems related to the control of homeostasis. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of prenatal stress on the activation of cortical neurons, by performing experiments both under basal conditions and after KCl-induced depolarization. Female mice were divided in two groups: control and prenatal restraint stress. Cortical neurons from the offspring were obtained at gestational day 18. The effects of prenatal stress and KCl stimulations on cellular mortality, autophagy, gene expression, oxidative stress, and inflammation were evaluated. We found that neurons from PNS mice have decreased necrosis and autophagy after depolarization. Moreover, prenatal stress modulated the HPA axis, as observed by the increased GR and decreased 5HTr1 mRNA expression. The BDNF is an important factor for neuronal function and results demonstrated that KCl-induced depolarization increased the gene expression of BDNF I, BDNF IV, and TR kappa B. Furthermore, prenatal stress and KCl treatment induced significant alterations in oxidative and inflammatory markers. In conclusion, prenatal stress and stimulation with KCl may influence several markers related to neurodevelopment in cortical neurons from neonate mice, supporting the well-known long-term effects of maternal stress.

AB  - Linalool not only is one of characteristic flavour volatiles of tea, contributing to floral aroma, but also a kind of defensive compounds, playing essential roles in resistance against biotic/abiotic stresses. Although the linalool synthases have been identified, much is unknown about the regulation mechanism in tea plants. We identified two pairs of MYB paralogs as linalool biosynthesis activators, in which one pair (CsMYB148/CsMYB193) specifically expressed in flowers, and another (CsMYB68/CsMYB147) highly expressed in flowers, leaves, fruits and roots. These activators interacted with CsMYC2 to form MYC2-MYB complexes to regulate linalool synthase. While Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins served as the linalool biosynthesis repressors by interfering MYC2-MYB complex. Further, we found that the transcripts of CsMYB68/CsMYB147 were significantly upregulated by jasmonic acid (JA) to improve linalool products during tea processing and that linalool pathway may as one of the downstream pathways of JA signalling and DNA methylation processes to participate in cold resistance. Under cold stress, JA signalling was activated to elevate the abundance of MYC-MYB complexes; meanwhile, DNA demethylation was also activated, leading to declining methylation levels and increasing transcripts of CsMYB68/CsMYB147. Our study provides a new insight into synergistically improving tea quality and tea plant resistance.

AB  - High levels of free amino acids (AAs) in tea leaves are crucial for tea flavor and health function; however, the dynamic AA biosynthesis, transport, and turnover in tea plants remain elusive. Here we dissected whole tea plants for these dynamics by assessing AA profiles and transcriptomes of metabolic pathway genes in tea roots, stems, and leaves and revealing their distinctive features with regard to AA synthesis, transport, and degradation/recycling. Nitrogen assimilation dominated in the roots wherein glutamine (Gln), theanine, and arginine (Arg) were actively synthesized. Arg was transported into trunk roots and stems, together with Glu, Gln, and theanine as the major AAs in the xylem sap for long-distance root-to-leaf transport. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes involved in Arg synthesis were highly expressed in roots, but those for Arg transport and degradation were highly expressed in stems and young leaves, respectively. CsGSIa transcripts were found in root meristem cells, root, stem and leaf vascular tissues, and leaf mesophyll where it appeared to participate in AA synthesis, transport, and recycling. Overexpression of CsGSIa in tea transgenic hairy roots and knockdown of CsGSIa in transgenic hairy roots and tea leaves produced higher and lower Gln and theanine than wild-type roots and leaves, respectively. This study provides comprehensive and new insights into AA metabolism and transport in the whole tea plant.

AB  - Under high light conditions or UV radiation, tea plant leaves produce more flavonols, which contribute to the bitter taste of tea; however, neither the flavonol biosynthesis pathways nor the regulation of their production are well understood. Intriguingly, tea leaf flavonols are enhanced by UV-B but reduced by shading treatment. CsFLS, CsUGT78A14, CsMYB12, and CsbZIP1 were upregulated by UV-B radiation and downregulated by shading. CsMYB12 and CsbZIP1 bound to the promoters of CsFLS and CsUGT78A14, respectively, and activated their expression individually. CsbZIP1 positively regulated CsMYB12 and interacted with CsMYB12, which specifically activated flavonol biosynthesis. Meanwhile, CsPIF3 and two MYB repressor genes, CsMYB4 and CsMYB7, displayed expression patterns opposite to that of CsMYB12. CsMYB4 and CsMYB7 bound to CsFLS and CsUGT78A14 and repressed their CsMYB12-activated expression. While CsbZIP1 and CsMYB12 regulated neither CsMYB4 nor CsMYB7, CsMYB12 interacted with CsbZIP1, CsMYB4, and CsMYB7, but CsbZIP1 did not physically interact with CsMYB4 or CsMYB7. Finally, CsPIF3 bound to and activated CsMYB7 under shading to repress flavonol biosynthesis. These combined results suggest that UV activation and shading repression of flavonol biosynthesis in tea leaves are coordinated through a complex network involving CsbZIP1 and CsPIF3 as positive MYB activators and negative MYB repressors, respectively. The study thus provides insight into the regulatory mechanism underlying the production of bitter-tasting flavonols in tea plants.

AB  - Simple Summary: Depression is a significant public health problem, and its pathogenesis is associated with inflammation in the central nervous system. In this study, we investigated the effects of H2S donor NaHS treatment on depression-like behavior caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its potential mechanisms. It was found that H2S treatment prevented LPS-induced depression-like behavior. LPS resulted in NF-kappa B and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in the hippocampus and led to hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction, which could be reversed with H2S treatment. Our data indicate that H2S prevents LPS-induced depression-like behaviors via the inhibition of neuroinflammation and pyroptosis and improving mitochondrial function. H2S could be a promising therapeutic reagent for depression.
   Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been implicated to have antidepressive effects. We sought to investigate the prevention effects of H2S donor NaHS on depression-like behavior induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice and its potential mechanisms. Sucrose preference, force swimming, open field, and elevate zero maze were used to evaluate depression-like behavior. NF-kappa B and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and mitochondrial function in the hippocampus were determined. It was found that depression-like behavior induced by LPS was prevented by NaHS pretreatment. LPS caused NF-kappa B and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the hippocampus as evidenced by increased phosphorylated-p65 levels and increased NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and mature IL-1 beta levels in the hippocampus, which were also blocked by NaHS. LPS increased GSDMD-N levels and TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus, which was prevented by NaHS. Abnormal mitochondrial morphology in the hippocampus was found in LPS-treated mice. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production were reduced, and ROS production was increased in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice. NaHS pretreatment improved impaired mitochondrial morphology and increased membrane potential and ATP production and reduced ROS production in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice. Our data indicate that H2S prevents LPS-induced depression-like behaviors by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis and improving mitochondrial function in the hippocampus.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Corni Fructus is a traditional Chinese herb and widely applied for treatment of age-related disorders in China. Iridoid glycoside was considered as the active ingredient of Corni Fructus. Loganin is one of the major iridoid glycosides and quality control components of Corni Fructus. Emerging evidence emphasized the beneficial effect of loganin on neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the detailed mechanism underlying the neuroprotective action of loganin remains to be unraveled.Aim of the study: To explore the improvement of loganin on cognitive impairment in 3 x Tg-AD mice and reveal the potential mechanism.
   Materials and methods: Eight-month 3 x Tg-AD male mice were intraperitoneally injected with loganin (20 and 40 mg/kg) for consecutive 21 days. Behavioral tests were used to evaluated the cognition-enhancing effects of loganin, and Nissl staining and thioflavine S staining were performed to analyze neuronal survival and A beta pathology. Western blot analysis, transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence were utilized to explore the molecular mechanism of loganin in AD mice involved mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. A beta 2535-induced SH-SY5Y cells were applied to verify the potential mechanism in vitro.
   Results: Loganin significantly mitigated the learning and memory deficit and amyloid beta-protein (A beta) deposition, and recovered synaptic ultrastructure in 3 x Tg-AD mice. Perturbed mitochondrial dynamics characterized by excessive fission and insufficient fusion were restored after loganin treatment. Meanwhile, loganin reversed the increase of mitophagy markers (LC3II, p62, PINK1 and Parkin) and mitochondrial markers (TOM20 and COXIV) in hippocampus of AD mice, and enhanced the location of optineurin (OPTN, a well-known mitophagy receptor) to mitochondria. Accumulated PINK1, Parkin, p62 and LC3II were also revealed in A beta 25-35-induced SH-SY5Y cells, which were ameliorated by loganin. Increased OPTN in A beta 25-35-treated SH-SY5Y cells was further upregulated by loganin incubation, along with the reduction of mitochondrial ROSand elevation ofmitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Conversely, OPTN silence neutralized the effect of loganin on mitophagy and mitochondrial function, which is consistent with the finding that loganin presented strong affinity with OPTN measured by molecular docking in silico.Conclusions: Our observations confirmed that loganin enhanced cognitive function and alleviated AD pathology probably by promoting OPTN-mediated mitophagy,. Loganin might be a potential drug candidate for AD therapy via targeting mitophagy.

AB  - Background: Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a significant clinical emergency, and investigating novel therapeutic approaches and understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for improving patient outcomes. Naringenin (Nar), a flavanone present in tomatoes and citrus fruits, is frequently consumed in the human diet and recognized for having immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Despite Nar being able to alleviate intestinal IRI, the exact molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Purpose: To investigate Nar's protective properties on intestinal IRI and elucidate the mechanisms, a comprehensive approach that combines network pharmacology analysis with experimental verification in vitro and in vivo was adopted. Methods: The oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in IEC-6 cells and a murine model of intestinal IRI were used. Nar's effects on intestinal IRI were assessed through histological analysis using H&E &E staining and tight junction (TJ) protein expression. Ferroptosis-related parameters, including iron levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and mitochondrial morphology, were analyzed. Network pharmacology was utilized to predict the pathways through which Nar exerts its anti-ferroptosis effects. Further mechanistic insights were obtained through si-RNA transfection, YAP inhibitor (verteporfin, VP) treatment, ferroptosis inhibitor (Ferrostatin-1) and ferroptosis inducer (Erastin) application, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Western blotting. Results: Our results revealed that pretreatment with Nar significantly mitigated intestinal tissue damage and improved gut barrier function, as evidenced by increased TJ proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin). Nar reduced iron, MDA, and ROS, while it increased GSH and SOD levels. Additionally, Nar alleviated mitochondrial damage in mice. Nar treatment increased GPX4 and SLC7A11, while decreasing ACSL4 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that Nar may target the Hippo signaling pathway. Notably, YAP, a key transcriptional co-activator within the Hippo pathway, was downregulated in intestinal IRI mice and OGD/Rinduced IEC-6 cells. Nar pretreatment activated YAP, thereby augmenting anti-ferroptosis effects. The inhibition of YAP activation by VP or YAP knockdown increased p-STAT3 expression, thereby diminishing Nar's efficacy. Co-IP and immunofluorescence studies confirmed the interaction between YAP and STAT3. Conclusion: This study shows that Nar can inhibit ferroptosis in intestinal IRI via activating YAP, which in turn suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation, thereby unveiling a novel mechanism and supporting Nar's potential to be a promising therapeutic agent for intestinal IRI.

AB  - Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (PAs) are important types of flavonoids, plant secondary metabolites with a wide range of industrial and pharmaceutical applications. DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase) is a pivotal enzyme that plays an important role in the flavonoid pathway. Here, four CsDFR genes were isolated from Camellia sinensis, and their overexpression was analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Based on transcription and metabolic analyses, CsDFR expression was closely consistent with catechins and PAs accumulation. Moreover, enzyme activity analyses revealed that the two recombinant proteins CsDFRa and CsDFRc exhibited DFR activity, converting dihydroflavonols into leucoanthocyanins in vitro, but CsDFRb1 and CsDFRb3 did not. CsDFRa and CsDFRc overexpression in AtDFR mutants (tt3) revealed that CsDFRs are involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and PAs, as CsDFRa and CsDFRc restored not only the purple petiole phenotype but also the seed coat color. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the two amino acid residues S117 and T123 of CsDFRa play a prominent role in controlling DFR reductase activity. Enzymatic assays indicated that CsDFRa and CsDFRc exhibited a higher affinity for DHQ and DHK, respectively, whereas CsDFRb1(N120S) and CsDFRb1(C126T) exhibited a higher affinity for DHM. Our findings comprehensively characterize the DFRs from C. sinensis and shed light on their critical role in metabolic engineering.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is a typical crop that accumulates aluminum (Al). Although the physiological mechanisms by which this occurs are well understood, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, an integrative approach combining quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of controlled hybridized populations and comparative transcriptomic analysis using samples treated with different Al concentrations was applied to identify candidate genes associated with Al accumulation in tea plants. Consequently, 41 candidate genes were selected using genome functional annotation of the qAl09 locus in the region of 35 256 594-57 378 817 bp on chromosome 7. Finally, a key gene, CsWRKY17, was identified as encoding a nucleus-localized transcription factor involved in regulating Al accumulation in tea plants, given the finding of a high correlation between its expression level and Al content in leaves. Overexpression of CsWRKY17 in Arabidopsis increased pectin deesterification, sensitivity to Al stress, and Al accumulation in leaves. Expression of the pectin methylesterase gene CsPME6 was found to be highly consistent with CsWRKY17 expression under various Al concentrations. In addition, experiments using a yeast monoclonal, electrophoresis mobility shift assay and dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) system confirmed that CsWRKY17 activated CsPME6 promoter activity. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide silencing revealed a positive association between CsPME6 expression and Al accumulation in tea shoots. In conclusion, this study suggests that CsWRKY17 promoted the process of pectin deesterification by binding to the CsPME6 promoter, thereby enhancing Al enrichment in tea plants. Our findings lay the foundation for studying the precise mechanisms through which Al enriched in tea leaves.

AB  - The Brassicaceae Camelina sativa (gold of pleasure) is now an established niche crop and being used as a transgenic host for a range of novel seed traits. Most notable of these is the accumulation of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturates such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), fatty acids normally only found in marine organisms. As part of continued efforts to optimize the accumulation of these non-native fatty acids via seed-specific expression of algal genes, a new series of iterative constructs was built and introduced into Camelina. Seed fatty acid composition was determined, and the presence of EPA and DHA was confirmed. To provide an additional level of evaluation, full environmental release was carried out on selected events, providing a real-world gauntlet against which to assess the performance of these novel lines. Composition of the seed oil triacylglycerol was determined by mass spectrometry, allowing for conclusions as to the contribution of different activities to the final accumulation of EPA and DHA. Since these data were derived from field-grown material, they also represent a robust demonstration of the stability of the omega-3 LC-PUFA trait in Camelina. We propose that field trialling should be routinely incorporated in the plant synthetic biology 'design-build-test-learn' cycle.

AB  - Tea, coffee, and cocoa are the three most popular nonalcoholic beverages in the world and have extremely high economic and cultural value. The genomes of four tea plant varieties have recently been sequenced, but there is some debate regarding the characterization of a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event in tea plants. Whether the WGD in the tea plant is shared with other plants in order Ericales and how it contributed to tea plant evolution remained unanswered. Here we re-analyzed the tea plant genome and provided evidence that tea experienced only WGD event after the core-eudicot whole-genome triplication (WGT) event. This WGD was shared by the Polemonioids-Primuloids-Core Ericales (PPC) sections, encompassing at least 17 families in the order Ericales. In addition, our study identified eight pairs of duplicated genes in the catechins biosynthesis pathway, four pairs of duplicated genes in the theanine biosynthesis pathway, and one pair of genes in the caffeine biosynthesis pathway, which were expanded and retained following this WGD. Nearly all these gene pairs were expressed in tea plants, implying the contribution of the WGD. This study shows that in addition to the role of the recent tandem gene duplication in the accumulation of tea flavor-related genes, the WGD may have been another main factor driving the evolution of tea flavor.

AB  - Investigating transcriptomic changes during healthy development and aging provides insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the maturation of brain functions and drive age-related decline. Although it has been speculated that aging may represent a reversal of late-stage brain development, direct molecular comparisons between these two processes have remained limited. This study employs spatial transcriptomics to analyze the mouse brain at three key timepoints: postnatal day 21 (P21), 3 months (adult), and 28 months (aged), to identify region-specific differential gene expression dynamics. We identify widespread transcriptional changes across both brain development and aging, with all brain regions exhibiting distinct, region-specific gene expression dynamics that reflect divergent regulatory trajectories across the lifespan. During development, gene expression patterns were strongly enriched for neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and myelination, reflecting active circuit formation and white matter maturation. In contrast, aging was characterized by a decline in myelination-related gene expression and a pronounced increase in inflammatory and glial activation pathways, particularly within the hippocampus. While both development and aging involved changes in myelination-associated genes, the underlying mechanisms appear distinct: developmental upregulation supports circuit establishment and refinement, whereas aging-related downregulation may reflect secondary consequences of neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis. These findings underscore that, despite some overlap in affected pathways, neural maturation and age-related decline are driven by fundamentally different regulatory programs. These findings establish a novel spatial transcriptomic reference for brain development and aging, offering a valuable data resource for investigating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative mechanisms.

AB  - Obesity is characterized by a condition of low-grade chronic inflammation that facilitates development of numerous comorbidities and dysregulation of brain homeostasis. It is reported that obesity can lead to behavioral alterations such as cognitive decline and depression-like behaviors both in humans and rodents. Saponins from panax japonicus (SPJ) have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory action in mouse model of diet-induced obesity. We evaluated the neuroprotection of SPJ on high fat diet (HFD) induced impaired behaviors such as memory deficit and depressive-like behaviors, and explored the underlying mechanisms. 6-week male Balb/c mice were divided into normal control group (NC, 17% total calories from fat), HFD group (60% total calories from fat), and HFD treated with SPJ groups (orally gavaged with dosages of 15 mg/kg and 45 mg/kg), respectively. After treatment for 16 weeks, behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the cognition and depression-like behaviors of the mice. The underling mechanisms of SPJ on HFD-induced impaired behaviors were investigated through histopathological observation, Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Our results showed that HFD-fed mice caused behavioral disorders, neuronal degeneration as well as elevated neuroinflammation, which was partly involved in NLRP3 inflammasome that finally resulted in decreased protein levels of AMPA receptors and down-regulated phosphorylated levels of CaMKII and CREB in cortex and hippocampus. All the above changes in cortex and hippocampus induced by HFD were mitigated by SPJ treatment. SPJ treatment alleviated HFD-induced recognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors of mice, which could be partly due to the capacity of SPJ to mitigate neuroinflammation through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and upregulation of AMPA receptors signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Moschus is a traditional Chinese materia medica for treating central nervous system disorders. Oxidative stress is a key pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and serves as a critical bridge linking various pathological processes of AD. Previous studies have shown that Moschus can exert neuroprotective effects by inhibiting glutamate-induced neuronal cell damage. However, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the effects and potential mechanisms of the ethanol extract of Moschus (EEM) on glutamate-induced oxidative damage in HT22 cells. Materials and methods: The components of EEM were identified using GC-MS. An oxidative toxicity cell model was established by exposing HT22 cells to glutamate. Cell viability was assessed through CCK8 and LDH assays, and the modes of cell death were evaluated using FITC-Annexin V staining and TUNEL assays. Intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels were measured with DCFH-DA and MitoSOX Red probes. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured with the Fluo-4 AM fluorescent probe. Mitochondrial function was analyzed using the JC-1 fluorescent probe. Protein expression levels of Bid, Calpain-1, Bax, Bcl-2, AIF, P-ERK, ERK, P-JNK, JNK, P-P38, P38, Nrf2, HO-1, Keap1, and NQO-1 were analyzed through western blotting. The distribution of AIF and Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus was examined through immunofluorescence staining. Results: Using GC-MS, 18 major components were identified in EEM. EEM significantly inhibited apoptosis, reduced ROS generation, and alleviated Ca2+ overload. EEM restored mitochondrial dysfunction by regulating the expression of mitochondria-related apoptotic proteins, including the downregulation of Calpain-1 and Bax, upregulation of Bid and Bcl-2, and inhibition of AIF nuclear translocation. EEM inhibited MAPK phosphorylation while activating the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. Conclusions: Our study shows that EEM protects HT22 cells from glutamate-induced damage by regulating the MAPK and Nrf2 pathways, effectively reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis. In summary, this study first demonstrates at the cellular level that EEM exerts neuroprotective effects by modulating the MAPK and Nrf2 pathways. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of Moschus against AD and establish a foundation for its potential application in AD.

AB  - The timing of bud flush (TBF) in the spring is one of the most important agronomic traits of tea plants (Camellia sinensis). In this study, we designed an open-pollination breeding program using 'Emei Wenchun' (EW, a clonal tea cultivar with extra-early TBF) as a female parent. A half-sib population (n = 388) was selected for genotyping using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing. The results enabled the identification of paternity for 294 (75.8%) of the offspring, including 11 (2.8%) from EW selfing and 217 (55.9%) assigned to a common father, 'Chuanmu 217' (CM). The putative EW x CM full-sib population was used to construct a linkage map. The map has 4244 markers distributed in 15 linkage groups, with an average marker distance of 0.34 cM. A high degree of collinearity between the linkage map and physical map was observed. Sprouting index, a trait closely related to TBF, was recorded for the offspring population in 2020 and 2021. The trait had moderate variation, with coefficients of variation of 18.5 and 17.6% in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping that was performed using the linkage map identified two major QTLs and three minor QTLs related to the sprouting index. These QTLs are distributed on Chr3, Chr4, Chr5, Chr9, and Chr14 of the reference genome. A total of 1960 predicted genes were found within the confidence intervals of QTLs, and 22 key candidate genes that underlie these QTLs were preliminarily screened. These results are important for breeding and understanding the genetic base of the TBF trait of tea plants.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAs a cellular mode of therapy, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are used to treat stroke. However, their mechanisms in stroke treatment have not been established. Recent evidence suggests that regulation of dysregulated gut flora after stroke affects stroke outcomes.AIMTo investigate the effects of BMSCs on gut microbiota after ischemic stroke.METHODSA total of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups, including sham operation control group, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, and MCAO with BMSC treatment group. The modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), beam walking test, and Morris water maze test were used to evaluate neurological function recovery after BMSC transplantation. Nissl staining was performed to elucidate on the pathology of nerve cells in the hippocampus. Feces from each group of rats were collected and analyzed by 16s rDNA sequencing.RESULTSBMSC transplantation significantly reduced mNSS (P < 0.01). Rats performed better in the beam walking test in the BMSC group than in the MCAO group (P < 0.01). The Morris water maze test revealed that the BMSC treatment group exhibited a significant improvement in learning and memory. Nissl staining for neuronal damage assessment after stroke showed that in the BMSC group, cells were orderly arranged with significantly reduced necrosis. Moreover, BMSCs regulated microbial structure composition. In rats treated with BMSCs, the abundance of potential short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria and Lactobacillus was increased.CONCLUSIONBMSC transplantation is a potential therapeutic option for ischemic stroke, and it promotes neurological functions by regulating gut microbiota dysbiosis.

AB  - Aphantasia refers to reduced or absent visual imagery. While most of us can readily recall decade-old personal experiences (autobiographical memories, AM) with vivid mental images, there is a dearth of information about whether the loss of visual imagery in aphantasics affects their AM retrieval. The hippocampus is thought to be a crucial hub in a brain-wide network underlying AM. One important question is whether this network, especially the connectivity of the hippocampus, is altered in aphantasia. In the current study, we tested 14 congenital aphantasics and 16 demographically matched controls in an AM fMRI task to investigate how key brain regions (i.e. hippocampus and visual-perceptual cortices) interact with each other during AM re-experiencing. All participants were interviewed regarding their autobiographical memory to examine their episodic and semantic recall of specific events. Aphantasics reported more difficulties in recalling AM, were less confident about their memories, and described less internal and emotional details than controls. Neurally, aphantasics displayed decreased hippocampal and increased visual-perceptual cortex activation during AM retrieval compared to controls. In addition, controls showed strong negative functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortex during AM and resting-state functional connectivity between these two brain structures predicted better visualization skills. Our results indicate that visual mental imagery plays an important role in detail-rich vivid AM, and that this type of cognitive function is supported by the functional connection between the hippocampus and the visual-perceptual cortex.

AB  - 14-3-3 proteins, particularly the 14-3-30 isoform, are neuroprotective in several models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Evidence for increased 14-3-30 phosphorylation observed in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases points to a possible pathogenic role for 14-3-30 phosphorylation in neurodegenerative disease. We recently created a novel conditional knock-in mouse to express the 14-3-30 S232D phosphomimetic mutation. After crossing this conditional knock-in mouse with the Emx1-Cre mouse in order to induce expression of the S232D mutation in the cortex and hippocampus, we evaluated the effect of 14-3-30 phosphorylation on behavior and pathology. These mice demonstrated mild motor deficits and reduced social dominance behavior but showed normal cognition and anxiety levels compared to Cre control mice. S232D mice did not show any alpha-synuclein or phospho-tau pathology at baseline, and dendritic arborization was normal in primary hippocampal cultures from S232D mice. Overall, this mouse model is a novel tool that can be used to look at the effect of 14-3-30 phosphorylation at S232 in the context of neurodegenerative disease models.

AB  - Background As indigestible carbohydrates, milk oligosaccharides possess various benefits for newborns, mainly through intestinal microbiota, among which 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) is the most predominant milk oligosaccharide. However, knowledge about the fermentative characteristics of 2'-FL in the gut remains limited, especially in the small intestine. The aim of this study is to explore the differential fermentability of 2'-FL by the small and large intestinal microbiota of piglets using fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) and lactose as controls in an in vitro batch fermentation experiment. During fermentation, microbial composition was characterized along with gas production and short-chain fatty acid production.Results 2'-Fucosyllactose showed differential fermentability in jejunal and colonic fermentation. Compared with the colon, 2'-FL produced less gas in the jejunum than in the FOS and lactose groups (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, 2'-FL exhibited a different influence on the microbial composition and metabolism in the jejunum and colon compared with FOS and lactose. In the jejunum, compared with the FOS and lactose groups, the 2'-FL group showed a higher abundance of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Blautia, but a lower abundance of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus (P < 0.05), with a higher level of propionate and a lower level of lactate during fermentation (P < 0.05). In the colon, compared with the FOS and lactose groups, 2'-FL increased the abundance of Blautia, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae FCS020, but decreased the abundance of Prevotella_9, Succinivibrio, and Megasphaera (P < 0.05) with an increase in acetate production (P < 0.05).Conclusion Overall, the results suggested that the small intestinal microbiota had the potential to ferment milk oligosaccharides. Meanwhile, in comparison with FOS and lactose, 2 ' -FL selectively stimulated the growth of propionate-producing bacteria in the jejunum and acetate-producing bacteria in the colon. These results demonstrated the differences in fermentation properties of 2'-FL by small and large intestinal microbiota and provided new evidence for the application of 2'-FL in optimizing gut microbiota.

AB  - Theanine content is highly correlated with sensory quality and health benefits of tea infusion. The tender shoots of etiolated and albino tea plants contain higher theanine than the normal green tea plants and are valuable materials for high quality green tea processing. However, why these etiolated or albino tea plants can highly accumulate theanine is largely unknown. In this study, we observed an Arabidopsis etiolated mutant hy1-100 (mutation in Haem Oxygenase 1, HO1) that accumulated higher levels of glutamine (an analog of theanine). We therefore identified CsHO1 in tea plants and found CsHO1 is conserved in amino acid sequences and subcellular localization with its homologs in other plants. Importantly, CsHO1 expression in the new shoots was much lower in an etiolated tea plants 'Huangkui' and an albino tea plant 'Huangshan Baicha' than that in normal green tea plants. The expression levels of CsHO1 were negatively correlated with theanine contents in these green, etiolated and albino shoots. Moreover, CsHO1 expression levels in various organs and different time points were also negatively correlated with theanine accumulation. The hy1-100 was hypersensitive to high levels of theanine and accumulated more theanine under theanine feeding, and these phenotypes were rescued by the expression of CsHO1 in this mutant. Transient knockdown CsHO1 expression in the new shoots of tea plant using antisense oligonucleotides (asODN) increased theanine accumulation. Collectively, these results demonstrated CsHO1 negatively regulates theanine accumulation in tea plants, and that low expression CsHO1 likely contributes to the theanine accumulation in etiolated/albino tea plants.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is a short-season oilseed crop of the Brassicaceae family that consists of both summer and winter annual biotypes. Winter biotypes require non-freezing cold conditions for acquiring freezing tolerance (cold acclimation) and floral initiation (vernalization). Transcriptome profiles of a summer (CO46) biotype with poor freezing tolerance after acclimation and a winter (Joelle) biotype with excellent freezing tolerance after acclimation were compared prior to and after an 8-week cold treatment to identify key molecular pathways and genes responsive to cold acclimation and vernalization and potentially associated with freezing tolerance. Gene-set enrichment analyses identified AraCyc pathways involved in photosynthesis and lipid and hormone biosynthesis that were different between the two biotypes. Sub-network enrichment analyses identified hubs of molecular networks such as circadian clock, flowering, and hormone and stress responsive genes that were likely involved in vernalization but may also overlap with cold-induced freezing tolerance. A microRNA involved in floral initiation (MIR172A) was identified as a central hub for microRNA targets among upregulated genes for Joelle post-acclimation. Combined results are generally consistent with many previously identified molecular pathways and genes acting together to control vernalization, cold acclimation, and freezing tolerance. Our research provides new insights into the regulation of cold acclimation and molecular genetic mechanisms underlying cold tolerance and floral induction for the winter biotype Joelle.

AB  - Neuropeptides and neurotrophins are stored in and released from dense core vesicles (DCVs). While DCVs and synaptic vesicles (SVs) share fundamental SNARE/SM proteins for exocytosis, a detailed understanding of DCV exocytosis remains elusive. We recently identified the RAB3-RIM1 pathway to be essential for DCV, but not SV exocytosis, highlighting a significant distinction between the SV and DCV secretory pathways. Whether RIM1 is the only RAB3 effector that is essential for DCV exocytosis is currently unknown. In this study, we show that rabphilin-3A (RPH3A), a known downstream effector of RAB3A, is a negative regulator of DCV exocytosis. Using live-cell imaging at single-vesicle resolution with RPH3A deficient hippocampal mouse neurons, we show that DCV exocytosis increased threefold in the absence of RPH3A. RAB3A-binding deficient RPH3A lost its punctate distribution, but still restored DCV exocytosis to WT levels when re-expressed. SNAP25-binding deficient RPH3A did not rescue DCV exocytosis. In addition, we show that RPH3A did not travel with DCVs, but remained stationary at presynapses. RPH3A null neurons also had longer neurites, which was partly restored when ablating all regulated secretion with tetanus neurotoxin. Taken together, these results show that RPH3A negatively regulates DCV exocytosis, potentially also affecting neuron size. Furthermore, RAB3A interaction is required for the synaptic enrichment of RPH3A, but not for limiting DCV exocytosis. Instead, the interaction of RPH3A with SNAP25 is relevant for inhibiting DCV exocytosis.

AB  - BackgroundDendritic spines are the sites of excitatory synapses on pyramidal neurons, and their development is crucial for neural circuits and brain functions. The spine shape, size, or number alterations are associated with neurological disorders, including schizophrenia. DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 2 (DGCR2) is one of the deleted genes within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), which is a high risk for developing schizophrenia. DGCR2 expression was reduced in schizophrenics. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of DGCR2 in schizophrenia or 22q11DS is still unclear.ResultsHere, we report that DGCR2 expression was increased during the neurodevelopmental period and enriched in the postsynaptic densities (PSDs). DGCR2-deficient hippocampal neurons formed fewer spines. In agreement, glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity were decreased in the hippocampus of DGCR2-deficient mice. Further molecular studies showed that the extracellular domain (ECD) of DGCR2 is responsible for its transcellular interaction with cell adhesion molecule Neurexin1 (NRXN1) and spine development. Consequently, abnormal behaviors, like anxiety, were observed in DGCR2-deficient mice.ConclusionsThese observations indicate that DGCR2 is a novel cell adhesion molecule required for spine development and synaptic plasticity, and its deficiency induces abnormal behaviors in mice. This study provides a potential pathophysiological mechanism of DGCR2 in 22q11DS and related mental disorders.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Matcha green tea (Camellia sinensis) based-supplements have been widely used since they present a greater content of phenolic compounds than traditional green tea, which is popularly used in the treatment of diabetes. However, there are few studies on the effectiveness and safety of matcha supplements. Aim of the study: This work aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this supplement in endothelial cells (EA. hy926) in the hyperglycemic model and in vivo Artemia salina. Materials and methods: To assess the effect of Matcha herbal supplement (MHS), EA. hy926 endothelial cells were treated with 20 mu g/mL of MHS for 24 h, in a hyperglycemic medium with 35 mM glucose. After treatment, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 4 ? and 47xg for 5 min. The pellet was used to determine the reaction products to thiobarbituric acid and the levels of nitric oxide. Electron transport chain activity and ATP levels were also evaluated. Intracellular pH, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were evaluated by flow cytometry. MHS chemical characterization was performed by HPLC-UV and total phenolic content analysis. The evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of MHS was performed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenger assay. To determine the in vivo acute toxicity of MHS, an A. salina assay was conducted, using 0,2 mL of different concentrations of MHS (10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mu g/mL). The LD50 values were obtained by interpolation of 50% (y = 50) of the dead individuals in the trend curves. Results: Our data showed that MHS was able to avoid oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by hyperglycemia, demonstrating important antioxidant activity. However, it was observed that MHS reduced up to 90% the activity of the four-electron transport complexes, reducing the ATP production of the endothelial cells. In the toxicity assay performed in Artemia salina, MHS showed mild toxicity (LD50 = 0,4 mg/mL). The major com-pounds found in MHS were epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin, rutin, kaempferol, and quercetin. Conclusions: This data draws attention to the fact that supplements with high content of phenolic compounds, capable of avoiding oxidative and nitrosative stress can have a dual effect and, simultaneously to antioxidant activity, can induce toxicity in different cell types.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Taohong Siwu Decoction (TSD), a classic traditional Chinese medicine formula, is used for the treatment of vascular diseases, including vascular dementia (VD). However, the mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of study: This study aimed to investigate whether TSD has a positive effect on cognitive impairment in VD rats and to confirm that the mechanism of action is related to the Endoplasmic Reticulum stress (ERs) and cell apoptosis signaling pathway. Materials and methods: A total of 40 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: shamoperated group (Sham), the two-vessel occlusion group (2VO), the 2VO treated with 4.5 g/kg/d TSD group (2VO + TSD-L), the 2VO treated with 13.5 g/kg/d TSD group (2VO + TSD-H). The rats underwent either 2VO surgery or sham surgery. Postoperative TSD treatment was given for 4 consecutive weeks. Behavioral tests were initiated at the end of gastrulation. Open-field test (OFT) was used to detect the activity level. The New Object Recognition test (NOR) was used to test long-term memory. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to examine the foundation of spatial learning and memory. As a final step, the hippocampus was taken for molecular testing. The protein levels of GRP78 (Bip), p-PERK, PERK, IRE1 alpha, p-IRE1 alpha, ATF6, eIF2 alpha, p-eIF2 alpha, ATF4, XBP1, Bcl-2 and Bax were determined by Western blot. Immunofluorescence visualizes molecular expression. Results: In the OFT, residence time in the central area was significantly longer in both TSD treatment groups compared to the 2VO group. In the NOR, the recognition index was obviously elevated in both TSD treatment groups. The 2VO group had a significantly longer escape latency and fewer times in crossing the location of the platform compared with the Sham group in MWM. TSD treatment reversed this notion. Pathologically, staining observations confirmed that TSD inhibited hippocampal neuronal loss and alleviated the abnormal reduction of the Nissl body. In parallel, TUNEL staining illustrated that TSD decelerated neuronal apoptosis. Western Blot demonstrated that TSD reduces the expression of ERs and apoptotic proteins. Conclusion: In this study, the significant ameliorative effect on cognitive impairment of TSD has been determined by comparing the behavioral data of the 4 groups of rats. Furthermore, it was confirmed that this effect of TSD was achieved by suppressing the ERs-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Panax ginseng (P. ginseng) C. A. Meyer. has been used extensively globally as a medicine. It has a therapeutic effect on sleep and is an attractive alternative for patients with insomnia. The United States Patent of Invention has approved the use of P. ginseng alcohol extract (GAE) in nutraceuticals or food to improve sleep. It has shown promise as an effective therapeutic agent for improving sleep and cognition. However, its mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. Aim of the study: To investigate the therapeutic benefits of GAE on sleep and cognition and its underlying mechanism in aged sleep-deprived rats, with a focus on orexin-mediated autophagy function. Materials and methods: We conducted in vivo tests in an aged sleep-deprivation rat model produced using pchlorophenylalanine (PCPA) coupled with modified multi-platform method to examine the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of GAE. A pentobarbital sodium-induced sleep test and water maze were used to assess sleep and cognitive performance, respectively. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine orexin levels and aging and sleep markers in serum and hypothalamic tissues. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining were used to assess histopathological changes, and autophagy levels were assessed using transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence. Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were performed to detect the levels of orexin, orexin-receptor proteins, and autophagy-associated proteins to study the effects of GAE on hippocampal neurons, and the underlying mechanisms. Results: In aged sleep-deprived rats, GAE treatment prolonged sleep duration, improved cognitive function, prevented hippocampal neuronal damage, increased the number of Nissl bodies, improved aging and sleep markers, and enhanced the LC3A/B expression in autophagosomes and neurons. The amount of orexin in serum and hypothalamic tissue and OX1R, OX2R, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) proteins also reduced, which resulted in the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway and activation of the autophagy process. Conclusions: GAE may reduce hypothalamic orexin secretion and interact with orexin receptors to inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling network and activate autophagy. This may be a potential mechanism of action of GAE in regulating sleep-related cognitive function.

AB  - Catechins constitute abundant metabolites in tea and have potential health benefits and high economic value. Intensive study has shown that the biosynthesis of tea catechins is regulated by environmental factors and hormonal signals. However, little is known about the coordination of phosphate (Pi) signaling and the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway on biosynthesis of tea catechins. We found that Pi deficiency caused changes in the content of catechins and modulated the expression levels of genes involved in catechin biosynthesis. Herein, we identified two transcription factors of phosphate signaling in tea, named CsPHR1 and CsPHR2, respectively. Both regulated catechin biosynthesis by activating the transcription of CsANR1 and CsMYB5c. We further demonstrated CsSPX1, a Pi pathway repressor, suppressing the activation by CsPHR1/2 of CsANR1 and CsMYB5c. JA, one of the endogenous plant hormones, has been reported to be involved in the regulation of secondary metabolism. Our work demonstrated that the JA signaling repressor CsJAZ3 negatively regulated catechin biosynthesis via physical interaction with CsPHR1 and CsPHR2. Thus, the CsPHRs-CsJAZ3 module bridges the nutrition and hormone signals, contributing to targeted cultivation of high-quality tea cultivars with high fertilizer efficiency.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ginseng is a valuable herb in traditional Chinese medicine. Modern research has shown that it has various benefits, including tonifying vital energy, nourishing and strengthening the body, calming the mind, improving cognitive function, regulating fluids, and returning blood pressure, etc. Rg1 is a primary active component of ginseng. It protects hippocampal neurons, improves synaptic plasticity, enhances cognitive function, and boosts immunity. Furthermore, it exhibits anti-aging and anti-fatigue properties and holds great potential for preventing and managing neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Aim of the study: The objective of this study was to examine the role of Rg1 in treating chronic inflammatory NDDs and its molecular mechanisms. Materials and methods: In vivo, we investigated the protective effects of Rg1 against chronic neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in mice induced by 200 mu g/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 21 days using behavioral tests, pathological sections, Western blot, qPCR and immunostaining. In vitro experiments involved the stimulation of HT22 cells with 10 mu g/ml of LPS, verification of the therapeutic effect of Rg1, and elucidation of its potential mechanism of action using H2DCFDA staining, BODIPYTM 581/591 C11, JC-1 staining, Western blot, and immunostaining. Results: Firstly, it was found that Rg1 significantly improved chronic LPS-induced behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in mice. Further studies showed that Rg1 significantly attenuated LPS-induced neuronal damage by reducing levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta and ROS, and inhibiting AIM2 inflammasome. Furthermore, chronic LPS exposure induced the onset of neuronal ferroptosis by increasing the lipid peroxidation product MDA and regulating the ferroptosis-associated proteins Gpx4, xCT, FSP1, DMT1 and TfR, which were reversed by Rg1 treatment. Additionally, Rg1 was found to activate Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant enzymes, such as HO1 and NQO1, both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro studies also showed that the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 could inhibit the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-ferroptosis effects of Rg1. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that Rg1 administration ameliorated chronic LPS-induced cognitive deficits and neuronal ferroptosis in mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The underlying mechanisms may be related to the inhibition of AIM2 inflammasome and activation of Nrf2 signaling. These findings provide valuable insights into the treatment of chronic neuroinflammation and associated NDDs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the decline and loss of memory, language and behavioural disorders, decreased thinking ability, and cognitive dysfunction. Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the most active component of yellow pigment extracted from safflowers and possesses strong neuroprotective properties. However, the underlying neuroprotective mechanism of HSYA is not well understood. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of HSYA and related mechanisms in mice with cognitive dysfunction. Six-month-old male C57BL/6 and APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 20 per group): C57, C57 + HSYA, APP/PS1, and APP/PS1 + HSYA. Mice in the C57 + HSYA and APP/PS1 + HSYA groups were treated with HSYA (4 mg/kg for 2 weeks), and mice in the C57 and APP/PS1 groups were administered an equal volume of saline by intraperitoneal injection. Next, the behavioural changes, biochemical indicators, histology and Western blot manifestations of the mice were determined. The results showed that supplementation with HSYA significantly improved memory and attenuated oxidative stress, apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and proinflammatory cytokine expression. Our findings showed that HSYA might be a promising therapeutic candidate for improving AD-like pathology.

AB  - Introduction Schizophrenia is considered one of the most disabling and severe human diseases worldwide. The etiology of schizophrenia is thought to be multifactorial and evidence suggests that DNA methylation can play an important role in underlying pivotal neurobiological alterations of this disorder. Some studies have demonstrated the effects of dietary supplementation as an alternative approach to the prevention of schizophrenia, including folic acid. However, no study has ever investigated the role of such supplementation in altering the DNA methylation system in the context of schizophrenia.
   Objectives The present study aims to investigate the effects of maternal folic acid supplementation at different doses on nuclear methyltransferase activity of adult rat offspring subjected to an animal model schizophrenia induced by ketamine.
   Methods Adult female Wistar rats, (60 days old) received folic acid-deficient diet, control diet, or control diet plus folic acid supplementation (at 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg) during pregnancy and lactation. After reaching adulthood (60 days), the male offspring of these dams were subjected to the animal model of schizophrenia induced by 7 days of ketamine intraperitoneal injection (25 mg/kg). After the 7-day protocol, the activity of nuclear methyltransferase was evaluated in the brains of the offspring.
   Results Maternal folic acid supplementation at 50 mg/kg increased methyltransferase activity in the frontal cortex, while 10 mg/kg increased methyltransferase activity in the hippocampus. In the striatum of offspring treated with ketamine, maternal deficient diet, control diet, and folic acid supplementation at 5 mg/kg decreased methyltransferase activity compared to the control group. The folic acid supplementation at 10 and 50 mg/kg reversed this ketamine effect.
   Conclusions Maternal FA deficiency could be related to schizophrenia pathophysiology, while FA supplementation could present a protective effect since it demonstrated persistent effects in epigenetic parameters in adult offspring.

AB  - Strawberry fruit size is critical for its marketability. However, organ size control is a complex process regulated by various signalling pathways. In animals, the Hippo signalling pathway acts as a negative regulator of organ size, with Ste20 kinase being a key component. Mutation in Ste20 causes excessive cell proliferation and enlarged organs. In this study, FvM4K1, a Ste20-like kinase from woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), is identified. FvM4K1 partially restores defects in a yeast Ste20 mutant ste20 Delta and fully rescues growth in Arabidopsis mutant atsik1-4 lacking its Ste20 homologue, AtSIK1, underscoring its functional conservation. Downregulation of FvM4K1 by RNAi in woodland strawberry leads to smaller plants and fruits resulting from reduced cell size and number, while overexpression increases organ size, indicating a positive role in organ size control which contrasts with the negative role of Ste20 in other organisms. FvM4K1 autophosphorylates, with Lys269 and Thr396 being critical for its function. FvM4K1 interacts with FvMOB1A and FvMOB1B, components of the Hippo signalling pathway, and phosphorylates them at Thr35 and Thr36, respectively. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying fruit and organ size control in woodland strawberry and contribute to our understanding of the Hippo signalling pathway in higher plants, a pathway that remains largely unexplored. It also opens new avenues for exploring the regulatory function of the Hippo pathway in plant development and potentially informs biotechnological strategies for crop improvement.

AB  - Ketocarotenoids, including astaxanthin, are red lipophilic pigments derived from the oxygenation of beta-carotene ionone rings. These carotenoids have exceptional antioxidant capacity and high commercial value as natural pigments, especially for aquaculture feedstocks to confer red flesh colour to salmon and shrimp. Ketocarotenoid biosynthetic pathways occur only in selected bacterial, algal, fungal and plant species, which provide genetic resources for biotechnological ketocarotenoid production. Toward pathway optimization, we developed a transient platform for ketocarotenoid production using Agrobacterium infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves with plant (Adonis aestivalis) genes, carotenoid beta-ring 4-dehydrogenase 2 (CBFD2) and carotenoid 4-hydroxy-beta-ring 4-dehydrogenase (HBFD1), or bacterial (Brevundimonas) genes, beta-carotene ketolase (crtW) and beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtZ). In this test system, heterologous expression of the plant-derived astaxanthin pathway conferred higher astaxanthin production with fewer ketocarotenoid intermediates than the bacterial pathway. We evaluated the plant-derived pathway for ketocarotenoid production using the oilseed camelina (Camelina sativa) as a production platform. Genes for CBFD2 and HBFD1 and maize phytoene synthase were introduced under the control of seed-specific promoters. In contrast to prior research with bacterial pathways, our strategy resulted in nearly complete conversion of beta-carotene to ketocarotenoids, including primarily astaxanthin. Tentative identities of other ketocarotenoids were established by chemical evaluation. Seeds from multi-season US and UK field sites maximally accumulated similar to 135 mu g/g seed weight of ketocarotenoids, including astaxanthin (similar to 47 mu g/g seed weight). Although plants had no observable growth reduction, seed size and oil content were reduced in astaxanthin-producing lines. Oil extracted from ketocarotenoid-accumulating seeds showed significantly enhanced oxidative stability and was useful for food oleogel applications.

AB  - Seed development and yield depend on the transport and supply of sugar. However, an insufficient supply of nutrients from maternal tissues to embryos results in seed abortion and yield reduction in Camellia oleifera. In this study, we systematically examined the route and regulatory mechanisms of sugar import into developing C. oleifera seeds using a combination of histological observations, transcriptome profiling, and functional analysis. Labelling with the tracer carboxyfluorescein revealed a symplasmic route in the integument and an apoplasmic route for postphloem transport at the maternal-filial interface. Enzymatic activity and histological observation showed that at early stages [180-220 days after pollination (DAP)] of embryo differentiation, the high hexose/sucrose ratio was primarily mediated by acid invertases, and the micropylar endosperm/suspensor provides a channel for sugar import. Through Camellia genomic profiling, we identified three plasma membrane-localized proteins including CoSWEET1b, CoSWEET15, and CoSUT2 and one tonoplast-localized protein CoSWEET2a in seeds and verified their ability to transport various sugars via transformation in yeast mutants and calli. In situ hybridization and profiling of glycometabolism-related enzymes further demonstrated that CoSWEET15 functions as a micropylar endosperm-specific gene, together with the cell wall acid invertase CoCWIN9, to support early embryo development, while CoSWEET1b, CoSWEET2a, and CoSUT2 function at transfer cells and chalazal nucellus coupled with CoCWIN9 and CoCWIN11 responsible for sugar entry in bulk into the filial tissue. Collectively, our findings provide the first comprehensive evidence of the molecular regulation of sugar import into and within C. oleifera seeds and provide a new target for manipulating seed development.

AB  - Tea anthracnose is a prevalent disease in China that can lead to reduced tea production and lower quality, yet there is currently a lack of effective means for controlling this disease. In this study, we identified 46 phenolamides (including 27 isomers) in different tissues and organs of tea plants based on a developed workflow, and the secondary mass spectra of all these compounds have been documented. It was revealed that tea plants predominantly accumulate protonated aliphatic phenolamides, rather than aromatic phenolamides. The profile of phenolamides indicate that their buildup in tea plants is specific to certain tissues and acyl-acceptors, and this distribution is associated with the extent of phenolamide acyl-modification. Additionally, it was observed that N-Feruloylputrescine (Fer-Put, a type of phenolamides) was responsive to the stimulated accumulation of the tea anthracnose pathogen. The findings of anti-anthracnose experiments in vitro and on tea leaf demonstrated that Fer-Put was capable of significantly inhibiting the growth of anthracnose pathogen colony, effectively prevented tea leaf disease. Furthermore, it was observed that Fer-Put treatment can enhance the antioxidant enzyme activity of tea leaves. TEA002780.1 and TEA013165.1 gene may be responsible for the biosynthesis of Fer-Put in the disease resistance process in tea plants. Through these studies, the types and distribution of phenolamides in tea plants have been elucidated, and Fer-Put's ability to resist anthracnose has been established, providing new insights into the resistance of tea anthracnose.

AB  - This study examined the effect of camel milk on some marker of blood coagulation markers in aluminum chloride (ALCl(3))-treated rats. Rats (n = 6) were assigned as control, control + fresh camel milk (1 ml), ALCl(3) (0.5 mg/kg), and ALCl(3) + fresh camel milk (1 ml and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively). Treatments were conducted orally for 30 days and daily. Administration of camel milk to control and ALCl(3)-intoxicated rats significantly increased platelet count, bleeding time, and collagen epinephrine (CEPI)-induced platelet aggregation. It also lowered plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and hepatic levels of glutathione (GSH) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). While the treatment with camel milk has no effect on the liver structure, values of activated partial prothrombin time (aPPT), and levels of prothrombin time (PT) in control rats, it improved liver architectures and decreased serum levels alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST, respectively), and reduced values of both aPTT and PT in ALCl(3)-intoxicated rats. In conclusion, camel milk inhibits platelets activity and aggregation in both control and ALCl(3)-intoxicated rats. (C) 2022 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - Depression is characterized by indifferent and slow thinking, leading to highly unfavorable social and economic burden. Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is a traditional Chinese medicine and has many pharmacological properties, such as anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanism unraveling the effect of HSYA on depression is still unclear. Here, depression animal model was established. It was demonstrated that HSYA improved depressive behavior in rat model of depression, which increased horizontal movement, vertical movement, sucrose percent index and decreased immobility of depressed rats. Moreover, HSYA inhibited the activation of HPA signaling, inflammation and oxidative stress in brain of depressed rats. HSYA played an opposite effect on production of chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta). CUMS increased MDA expression but decreased SOD and GSH-Px expression, which were reversed by HSYA treatment. Furthermore, HSYA exerted a suppressive role in TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in brain of depressed rats. In conclusion, these findings indicted that HSYA can improve depressive behavior through inhibiting HPA signaling, repressing hippocampal inflammation and oxidative stress, which will provide a new therapeutic method for treating depression.

AB  - Tea plant is a fluoride (F)-hyperaccumulator, which poses a potential threat to human health via tea consumption. Reducing F accumulation in fresh tea leaves is crucial for enhancing the safety of tea production at its source. This study aims to isolate novel genes responsible for F accumulation or transport in tea plants. We identified an aluminum (Al)-activated malate transporter gene, CsALMT6, which was hypothesized to be a candidate for differential F accumulation in Camellia sinensis, by employing a combination of transcriptome-wide association study and genome-wide identification of the CsALMT gene family. CsALMT6 exhibited high expression levels in old leaves, and its expression was significantly upregulated in tea plants subjected to F-stress conditions. Furthermore, heterologous expression of CsALMT6 in yeast, Arabidopsis, and Populus conferred F tolerance. However, the expression of F-tolerant hub genes, CsFEX1 and CsFEX2, remained unaffected in CsALMT6-silenced tea plants. Additionally, under F toxicity conditions, the transcription of CsALMT6 was negatively associated with F accumulation in tea plants. In conclusion, CsALMT6 plays a vital role in reducing F accumulation in C. sinensis, thus conferring F tolerance to plant cells.

AB  - Purple tea, rich in anthocyanins, has a variety of health benefits and is attracting global interest. However, the regulation mechanism of anthocyanin in purple tea populations has not been extensively studied. In this experiment, RNA-seq, BSA-seq, and BSR-seq were performed using 30 individuals with extreme colors (dark-purple and green) in an F1 population of 'Zijuan' and 'Jinxuan'. The results show that 459 genes were differentially expressed in purple and green leaves, among which genes involved in the anthocyanin synthesis and transport pathway, such as CHS, F3H, ANS, MYB75, GST, MATE, and ABCC, were highly expressed in purple leaves. Moreover, there were multiple SNP/InDel variation sites on chromosomes 2 and 14 of the tea plant, as identified by BSA-seq. The integrated analysis identified two highly expressed genes (CsANS and CsMYB75) with SNP/InDel site variations in the purple tea plants. By silencing leaves, we proved that CsMYB75 could positively regulate anthocyanin accumulation and expression of related structural genes in tea plants. A 181-bp InDel in the CsMYB75 promoter was also found to be co-segregating with leaf color. The results of this study provide a theoretical reference for the molecular mechanism of anthocyanin accumulation in purple tea plants and contribute to the creation of new tea cultivars with high anthocyanin content.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is an oil and medicinal crop in the Brassicaceae family that possesses many good agronomic qualities, such as stress resistance, strong adaptation, and low water and fertilizer inputs. The objectives of the present study were to optimize somatic embryogenesis and evaluate the genetic fidelity of regenerated Camelina plants using RAPD markers and flow cytometry. The experiment was performed in a factorial form using a completely randomized design with two factors and three replications. The studied factors included two explants of hypocotyls and cotyledons and four different combinations of PGRs composed of NAA, BAP, 2,4-D, and Kin. The observation of many somatic embryonic developmental stages occurring simultaneously on an embryogenic callus, including the globular, heart-shaped, torpedo-shaped, and cotyledonary phases, suggested that camelina embryogenesis accurately reflects an unsynchronized process. The cotyledon explants cultured on MS + 0.3 mg L- 1 NAA + 0.7 mg L- 1 BAP and 1.0 mg L- 1 Kin showed the highest rates of somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration. Using RAPD markers, genetic fidelity in mother plants and regenerated plants was assessed for the first time in camelina. Sixty-four well-resolved bands were amplified using nine primers, ranging from four to eleven bands, with an average of 7.11 bands per primer. Molecular investigation revealed that there was no genetic variation in either the mother plants or the regenerated plants. The study of regenerated and mother plants using flow cytometry revealed monomorphic patterns, confirming the stability of the ploidy level across plant regeneration. These findings are helpful for breeding and genetic engineering of camelina.
   Camelina somatic embryogenesis is an unsynchronized process. This is the first study on the genetic fidelity of regenerated camelina plants using RAPD markers and flow cytometry.

AB  - Caffeine, a primary flavor component in tea, has been the subject of intense research. With the goal of shedding light on the complex regulatory processes governing caffeine biosynthesis in tea plants, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), transcriptomics, and small RNA analyses were employed on diverse tea cultivars such as 'Jianghua Kucha' [including 'Xianghong 3' (XH3H) and 'Kucha 3' (KC3H)], 'Fuding Dabaicha' (FDDB), 'Yaoshan Xiulv' (YSXL), and 'Bixiangzao' (BXZ). The results showed that the caffeine level in 'Jianghua Kucha' was significantly higher than that in other tea plant cultivars. In addition, weighted gene co-expression network analysis indicated that that the CsbHLH1 gene might play a pivotal role as a potential hub gene related to the regulation of caffeine biosynthesis. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the CsbHLH1 protein was localized in the nucleus of the cells. Moreover, CsbHLH1 suppresses the transcription of TCS1 by binding to the TCS1 promoter, as evidenced by a yeast one-hybrid assay, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and dual luciferase analysis. In addition, a microRNA, miR1446a, was identified that directly cleaves CsbHLH1, leading to an increase in caffeine levels. Therefore, our findings imply that CsbHLH1 binds to the TCS1 promoter (-971 to -1019 bp) to reduce its expression, thereby negatively regulating caffeine biosynthesis. On the other hand, miR1446a enhances the biosynthesis of caffeine by suppressing the expression of CsbHLH1. This work enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of caffeine biosynthesis in tea plants and offers potential directions for manipulating caffeine levels in future tea cultivation.

TI  - The transcription factor CsS40 negatively regulates TCS1 expression and caffeine biosynthesis in connection to leaf senescence in Camellia sinensis
T2  - HORTICULTURE RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Caffeine is considered as one of the most important bioactive components in the popular plant beverages tea, cacao, and coffee, but as a wide-spread plant secondary metabolite its biosynthetic regulation at transcription level remains largely unclear. Here, we report a novel transcription factor Camellia sinensis Senescnece 40 (CsS40) as a caffeine biosynthesis regulator, which was discovered during screening a yeast expression library constructed from tea leaf cDNAs for activation of tea caffeine synthase (TCS1) promoter. Besides multiple hits of the non-self-activation CsS40 clones that bound to and activated TCS1 promoter in yeast-one-hybrid assays, a split-luciferase complementation assay demonstrated that CsS40 acts as a transcription factor to activate the CsTCS1 gene and EMSA assay also demonstrated that CsS40 bound to the TCS1 gene promoter. Consistently, immunofluorescence data indicated that CsS40-GFP fusion was localized in the nuclei of tobacco epidermal cells. The expression pattern of CsS40 in 'Fuding Dabai' developing leaves was opposite to that of TCS1; and knockdown and overexpression of CsS40 in tea leaf calli significantly increased and decreased TCS1 expression levels, respectively. The expression levels of CsS40 were also negatively correlated to caffeine accumulation in developing leaves and transgenic calli of 'Fuding Dabai'. Furthermore, overexpression of CsS40 reduced the accumulation of xanthine and hypoxanthine in tobacco plants, meanwhile, increased their susceptibility to aging. CsS40 expression in tea leaves was also induced by senescence-promoting hormones and environmental factors. Taken together, we showed that a novel senescence-related factor CsS40 negatively regulates TCS1 and represses caffeine accumulation in tea cultivar 'Fuding Dabai'. The study provides new insights into caffeine biosynthesis regulation by a plant-specific senescence regulator in tea plants in connection to leaf senescence and hormone signaling.

AB  - Theanine metabolism is a necessary biological process during the planting and production of tea that determines tea quality. There is currently little knowledge about the transcriptional regulation of theanine metabolism in tea plants. In this study, we demonstrated that gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase CsGGT4, as a homologous protein of the theanine hydrolase CsGGT2, exhibited a higher theanine synthesis catalytic efficiency. Homology modeling and molecular docking showed that differential protein structures between CsGGT2 and CsGGT4 implied their different biological functions in tea plants. Theanine content correlated significantly with the expression of CsGGT2, CsGGT4 and the transcription factor CsMYB73 in tea shoots from different seasons. Additionally, CsMYB73 was confirmed to act as a nucleus-localized transcription factor (TF), directly interacts with the CsGGT2 and CsGGT4 promoters, serving as an activator of CsGGT2 and a suppressor of CsGGT4. Consequently, this leads to a negative association with theanine accumulation in tea shoots. Furthermore, the continuous increase in CsMYB73 produced a significantly increase in CsGGT2 expression and inhibited CsGGT4 expression. The present study reveals that the degradation of theanine has been observed to increase, concomitantly with the inhibition of theanine synthesis, resulting in a significant decline in the accumulation of theanine in tea shoots during the process of seasonal greening in 'Huangkui' leaves. This study contributes to the broader comprehension of the intricate transcriptional regulatory hierarchy that governs the metabolism of theanine in tea shoots, offering novel approaches for managing tea plantations and enhancing tea quality.

AB  - Simple Summary Cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) is implicated in neuronal death induced by various pathological conditions. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) confers neuroprotective effect, but underlying mechanisms have been poorly addressed. In this study, IPC protected pyramidal neurons (cells) in gerbil hippocampus after transient ischemia. Additionally, IPC controlled expressions of cyclin D1, cdk4, phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-Rb), and E2 promoter binding factor 1 (E2F1). In particular, the expression of p16INK4a was not different by IPC. These findings indicate that cyclin D1/cdk4-related signals may play important roles in events in neurons related to damage/death following ischemic insults. Especially, the preservation of p16INK4a by IPC may be crucial in attenuating neuronal death/damage or protecting neurons after brain ischemic insults. Inadequate activation of cell cycle proteins including cyclin D1 and cdk4 is involved in neuronal cell death induced by diverse pathological stresses, including transient global brain ischemia. The neuroprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning is well-established, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we examined changes in cyclin D1, cdk4, and related molecules in cells or neurons located in Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) of gerbil hippocampus after transient ischemia for 5 min (ischemia and reperfusion) and investigated the effects of IPC on these molecules after ischemia. Four groups were used in this study as follows: sham group, ischemia group, IPC plus (+) sham group, and IPC+ischemia group. IPC was developed by inducing 2-min ischemia at 24 h before 5-min ischemia (real ischemia). Most pyramidal cells located in CA1 of the ischemia group died five days after ischemia. CA1 pyramidal cells in the IPC+ischemia group were protected. In the ischemia group, the expressions of cyclin D1, cdk4, phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-Rb), and E2F1 (a transcription factor regulated by p-Rb) were significantly altered in the pyramidal cells with time after ischemia; in the IPC+ischemia group, they were controlled at the level shown in the sham group. In particular, the expression of p16(INK4a) (an endogenous cdk inhibitor) in the ischemia group was reversely altered in the pyramidal cells; in the IPC+TI group, the expression of p16(INK4a) was not different from that shown in the sham group. Our current results indicate that cyclin D1/cdk4-related signals may have important roles in events in neurons related to damage/death following ischemia and reperfusion. In particular, the preservation of p16(INK4a) by IPC may be crucial in attenuating neuronal death/damage or protecting neurons after brain ischemic insults.

AB  - Place cells develop spatially-tuned receptive fields during the early stages of novel environment exploration. The generative mechanism underlying these spatially-selective responses remains largely elusive, but has been associated with theta rhythmicity. An important factor implicating the transformation of silent cells to place cells is a spatially-uniform depolarization that is mediated by a persistent sodium current. This neuronal current is modulated by extracellular calcium concentration, which, in turn, is actively controlled by astrocytes. However, there is no established relationship between the neuronal depolarization and astrocytic activity. To consider this link, we designed a bioplausible computational model of a neuronal-astrocytic network, where astrocytes induced the transient emergence of place fields in silent cells, and accelerated the plasticity-induced consolidation of place cells. Interestingly, theta oscillations emerged naturally at the network level, resulting from the astrocytic modulation of subcellular neuronal properties. Our results suggest that astrocytes participate in spatial mapping and exploration, and further highlight the computational roles of these cells in the brain.

AB  - Sex differences in pain sensitivity have contributed to the fact that medications for curing chronic pain are unsatisfactory. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Brain-derived estrogen participates in modulation of sex differences in pain and related emotion. G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), identified as a novel estrogen receptor with a different distribution than traditional receptors, has been proved to play a vital role in regulating pain affected by estrogen. However, the contribution of its distribution to sexually dimorphic pain-related behaviors has not been fully explored. In the current study, immunofluorescence assays were applied to mark the neurons expressing GPR30 in male and female mice (in metestrus and proestrus phase) in pain-related brain regions. The neurons that express CaMKII alpha or VGAT were also labeled to observe overlap with GPR30. We found that females had more GPR30-positive (GPR30+) neurons in the primary somatosensory (S1) and insular cortex (IC) than males. In the lateral habenula (LHb) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), males had more GPR30+ neurons than females. Moreover, within the LHb, the expression of GPR30 varied with estrous cycle phase; females in metestrus had fewer GPR30+ neurons than those in proestrus. In addition, females had more GPR30+ neurons, which co-expressed CaMKII alpha in the medial preoptic nucleus (mPOA) than males, while males had more than females in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). These findings may partly explain the different modulatory effects of GPR30 in pain and related emotional phenotypes between sexes and provide a basis for comprehension of sexual dimorphism in pain related to estrogen and GPR30, and finally provide new targets for exploiting new treatments of sex-specific pain.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, has been recognized as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin receptor substrate2 (IRS2) is a major component of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway. Irs2 deletion leads to life-threatening T2DM, promoting premature death in male mice regardless of their genetic background. Here, we showed for the first time that young adult male mice lacking Irs2 on a C57BL/6J genetic background (Irs2(-/-)/6J) survived in different experimental environments and displayed hippocampus-associated behavioral alterations. Young adult male Irs2(-/-)/6J mice also exhibit aberrant alterations in energy and nutrient sensors, such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter3 (GLUT3), and reduced core body temperature accompanied by abnormal change in the temperature sensor in the brain. These results suggest that Irs2 deficiency induced impairments of brain energy metabolism and thermoregulation contribute to hippocampusassociated behavioral changes in young adult male mice.

AB  - Lignin nanoparticles emerged as a promising alternative for drug delivery systems owing to their biodegradability and bioactive properties. This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic extract of Ocimum basilicum-loaded lignin nanoparticles (OB-LNPs) and Lagenaria siceraria seed oil-loaded lignin nanoparticles (LS-LNPs) to find a solution for antimicrobial resistance. OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs were tested for their antimicrobial potential against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Microsporum canis. OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs were further tested for their anti-efflux activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella enterica strains and for treating Salmonella infection in a rat model. We also investigated the antifungal efficacy of OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs for treating T. rubrum infection in a guinea pig model. Both OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs showed strong antimicrobial potential against S. Typhimurium and T. rubrum infections. LS-LNPs showed antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica species with a MIC range of 0.5-4 mu g/mL and antifungal activity against T. rubrum with a MIC range of 0.125-1 mu g/mL. OB-LNPs showed antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica species with a MIC range of 0.5-2 mu g/mL and antifungal activity against T. rubrum with a MIC range of 0.25-2 mu g/mL. OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs downregulated the expression of ramA and acrB efflux pump genes (fold change values ranged from 0.2989 to 0.5434; 0.4601 to 0.4730 for ramA and 0.3842-0.6199; 0.5035-0.8351 for acrB). Oral administration of OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs in combination with ciprofloxacin had a significant effect on all blood parameters, as well as on liver and kidney function parameters. Oxidative stress mediators, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde were abolished by oral administration of OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs (0.5 mL/rat once daily for 5 days). Interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were also reduced in comparison with the positive control group and the ciprofloxacin-treated group. Histopathological examination of the liver and intestine of OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs-treated rats revealed an elevation in Salmonella clearance. Treatment of T. rubrum-infected guinea pigs with OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs topically in combination with itraconazole resulted in a reduction in lesion scores, microscopy, and culture results. In conclusion, OB-LNPs and LS-LNPs possess immunomodulatory and antioxidant potential and can be used as naturally derived nanoparticles for drug delivery and treatment of Salmonellosis and dermatophytosis infections.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is capable of causing porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) and is one of the major threats to the global pig industry. The nucleocapsid protein Cap encoded by the PCV2 ORF2 gene is an ideal antigen for the development of PCV2 subunit vaccines, and its N-terminal nuclear localization sequence (NLS) structural domain is essential for the formation of self-assembling VLPs. In the present study, we systematically expressed and characterized full-length PCV2 Cap proteins fused to dominant T and B cell antigenic epitopes and porcine-derived CD154 molecules using baculovirus and found that the Cap proteins fusing epitopes were still capable of forming virus-like particles (VLPs). Both piglet and mice experiments showed that the Cap proteins fusing epitopes or paired with the molecular adjuvant CD154 were able to induce higher levels of humoral and cellular responses, particularly the secretion of PCV2-specific IFN-gamma and IL-4. In addition, vaccination significantly reduced clinical signs and the viral load of PCV2 in the blood and tissues of challenged piglets. The results of the study provide new ideas for the development of a more efficient, safe and broad-spectrum next-generation PCV2 subunit vaccine.

AB  - Spontaneous burst firing is a hallmark attributed to the neuronal network activity. It is known to be accompanied by intracellular calcium [Ca2+](i) oscillations within the bursting neurons. Studying mechanisms underlying regulation of burst firing is highly relevant, since impairment in neuronal bursting accompanies different neurological disorders. In the present study, the contribution of NMDA and GABA(A) receptors to the shape formation of spontaneous burst-was studied in cultured hippocampal neurons. A combination of inhibitory analysis with simultaneous registration of neuronal bursting by whole-cell patch clamp and calcium imaging was used to assess spontaneous burst firing and [Ca2+](i) level.
   Using bicuculline and D-AP5 we showed that GABA(A) and NMDA receptors effectively modulate burst plateau phase and [Ca2+](i) transient spike which can further affect action potential (AP) amplitudes and firing frequency within a burst. Bicuculline significantly elevated the amplitude and reduced the duration of both burst plateau phase and [Ca2+](i) spike resulting in an increase of AP firing frequency and shortening of AP amplitudes within a burst. D-AP5 significantly decreases the amplitude of both plateau phase and [Ca2+](i) spike along with a burst duration that correlated with an increase in AP amplitudes and reduced firing frequency within a burst. The effect of bicuculline was occluded by co-addition of DAP5 revealing modulatory role of GABA(A) receptors to the NMDA receptor-mediated formation of the burst. Our results provide new evidence on importance of NMDA and GABA(A) receptors in shaping burst firing and Ca(2+)transient spikes in cultured hippocampal neurons. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have emerged as a promising tool for disease modeling and drug development. However, hiPSC-CMs remain functionally immature, which hinders their utility as a model of human cardiomyocytes.
   Objective: To improve the electrophysiological maturation of hiPSC-CMs.
   Methods and results: On day 16 of cardiac differentiation, hiPSC-CMs were treated with 100 nmol/L triiodothyronine (T3) and 1 mu mol/L Dexamethasone (Dex) or vehicle for 14 days. On day 30, vehicle- and T3 + Dex-treated hiPSC-CMs were dissociated and replated either as cell sheets or single cells. Optical mapping and patch-clamp technique were used to examine the electrophysiological properties of vehicle- and T3 + Dex-treated hiPSC-CMs. Compared to vehicle, T3 + Dex-treated hiPSC-CMs had a slower spontaneous beating rate, more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, faster maximal upstroke velocity, and shorter action potential duration. Changes in spontaneous activity and action potential were mediated by decreased hyperpolarization-activated current (I-f) and increased inward rectifier potassium currents (I-K1), sodium currents (I-Na), and the rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents (I-Kr and I-Ks, respectively). Furthermore, T3 + Dex-treated hiPSC-CM cell sheets (hiPSC-CCSs) exhibited a faster conduction velocity and shorter action potential duration than the vehicle. Inhibition of I-K1 by 100 mu M BaCl2 significantly slowed conduction velocity and prolonged action potential duration in T3 + Dex-treated hiPSC-CCSs but had no effect in the vehicle group, demonstrating the importance of I-K1 for conduction velocity and action potential duration.
   Conclusion: T3 + Dex treatment is an effective approach to rapidly enhance electrophysiological maturation of hiPSC-CMs.

AB  - For epidemic prevention and control, molecular diagnostic techniques such as field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors is developed for rapid screening of infectious agents, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus, and others. They obtain results within a few minutes but exhibit diminished sensitivity (<75%) in unprocessed biological samples due to insufficient recognition of low-abundance analytes. Here, an electro-enhanced strategy is developed for the precise detection of trace-level infectious agents by liquid-gate graphene field-effect transistors (LG-GFETs). The applied gate bias preconcentrates analytes electrostatically at the sensing interface, contributing to a 10-fold signal enhancement and a limit of detection down to 5 x 10(-16) g mL(-1) MPT64 protein in serum. Of 402 participants, sensitivity in tuberculosis, COVID-19 and human rhinovirus assays reached 97.3% (181 of 186), and specificity is 98.6% (213 of 216) with a response time of <60 s. This study solves a long-standing dilemma that response speed and result accuracy of molecular diagnostics undergo trade-offs in unprocessed biological samples, holding unique promise in high-quality and population-wide screening of infectious diseases.

AB  - Mental disorders have a poor clinical prognosis and account for approximately 8% of the global burden of disease. Some examples of mental disorders are anxiety and depression. Conventional antidepressants have limited efficacy in patients because their pharmacological effects wear off, and side effects increase with prolonged use. It is claimed that herbal medicine's antioxidant capacity helps regulate people's mood and provide a more substantial pharmacological effect. With this background, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of rutin on reserpine-induced anxiety and depression in rats. The animals were divided into groups of six rats each: normal control (water), a depression model, a rutin-treated rat model, and an amitriptyline-treated rat model. According to the results, 14 days of treatment with rutin, once daily, showed a modest antidepressant effect. This effect was mediated by increased serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels in cortical and hippocampal regions. The antioxidant and vasodilator properties of rutin may contribute to its antidepressant properties. According to this study, rutin has shown antidepressant effects by reducing antioxidant activity and acetylcholinesterase.

AB  - To enable the detection and modulation of modularized neural networks in vitro, this study proposes a microfluidic microelectrode array chip for the cultivation, compartmentalization, and control of neural cells. The chip was designed based on the specific structure of neurons and the requirements for detection and modulation. Finite-element analysis of the chip's flow field was conducted using the COMSOL Multiphysics software, and the simulation results show that the liquid within the chip can flow smoothly, ensuring stable flow fields that facilitate the uniform growth of neurons within the microfluidic channels. By employing MEMS technology in combination with nanomaterial modification techniques, the microfluidic microelectrode array chip was fabricated successfully. Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured on the chip, forming a well-defined neural network. Spontaneous electrical activity of the detected neurons was recorded, exhibiting a 23.7% increase in amplitude compared to neuronal discharges detected on an open-field microelectrode array. This study provides a platform for the precise detection and modulation of patterned neuronal growth in vitro, potentially serving as a novel tool in neuroscience research.

AB  - Glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is ubiquitously expressed in nearly all cell types of various organs, mediates the tissue-specific metabolic and immune responses to maintain homeostasis and ensure survival under stressful conditions or pathological challenges. The neonatal period is metabolically demanding, and piglets are subjected to multiple stressors in modern intensive farms, especially around weaning. The liver is more responsive to LPS challenge compared to muscle, which is indicated by significantly increased TLR4 and p-p65, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels in association with GR down-regulation at both mRNA and protein levels. GR binding to the putative nGRE on TNF-alpha and IL-6 gene promoters decreased in the liver, but not muscle, upon LPS stimulation. The transcriptional regulation of GR also showed striking differences between liver and muscle. GR exon 1 mRNA variants 1-4, 1-5, and 1-6 were down-regulated in both liver and muscle, but a significant up-regulation of GR exon 1-9/10 mRNA variants abolished the change of total GR mRNA in the muscle in response to LPS stimulation. The significant down-regulation of GR in the liver corresponded with significantly decreased binding of p-GR and diminished histone acetylation in GR gene promoters. These results indicate that tissue-specific GR transcriptional regulation is involved in the differential inflammation responses between liver and muscle.

AB  - FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) is a powerful tool that could be used in the future to diagnose islet cell recovery after therapy. The identification of appropriate FLIM parameters is required to determine islet quality and islet cell metabolism throughout the organ under various conditions of insulin deficiency. The aim of the work was to identify key FLIM parameters, changes of which are characteristic of pancreatic pathologies. The tau m, tau 1, tau 2, alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 1/alpha 2 of free and bound forms of NAD(P)H of the islet cells of animals (rats and pigs) and of humans with and without pathologies were measured and analyzed. The data were confirmed by IHC and histological studies. We identified three FLIM parameters in islet cells from animals with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) and from humans with chronic pancreatitis + type 2 diabetes (T2D), which differ in the same way: tau m and alpha 2 take lower values compared to the nonpathological islet cells, while alpha 1/alpha 2 takes higher values. In islet cells from patients with adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and chronic pancreatitis, these parameters had reverse tendency relative to the norm or did not differ. Thus, minimally invasive and non-contrast FLIM methods may, in the future, be used to diagnose pathological islet cells.

AB  - Marburg virus (MARV) causes a severe hemorrhagic fever disease in primates with mortality rates in humans of up to 90%. MARV has been identified as a category A bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and priority pathogen A by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), needing urgent research and development of countermeasures because of the high public health risk it poses. The recent cases of MARV in West Africa underscore the substantial outbreak potential of this virus. The poten-tial for cross-border spread, as had occurred during the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak, illustrates the critical need for MARV vaccines. To support regulatory approval of the chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3)-MARV vaccine that has completed phase 1 trials, we showed that the nonreplicating ChAd3 vector, which has a dem-onstrated safety profile in humans, protected against a uniformly lethal challenge with MARV/Ang. Protective immunity was achieved within 7 days of vaccination and was maintained through 1 year after vaccination. Antigen-specific antibodies were an immune correlate of protection in the acute challenge model, and their concentration was predictive of protection. These results demonstrate that a single-shot ChAd3-MARV vaccine generated a protective immune response that was both rapid and durable with an immune correlate of protection that will support advanced clinical development.

AB  - Currently, no specific treatment exists to promote recovery from cognitive impairment after a stroke. Dysfunction of the actin cytoskeleton correlates well with poststroke cognitive declines, and its reorganization requires proper regulation of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) proteins. Fasudil downregulates ROCK activation and protects neurons against cytoskeleton collapse in the acute phase after stroke. An enriched environment can reduce poststroke cognitive impairment. However, the efficacy of environmental enrichment combined with fasudil treatment remains poorly understood. A photothrombotic stroke model was established in 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. Twenty-four hours after modeling, these animals were intraperitoneally administered fasudil (10 mg/kg) once daily for 14 successive days and/or provided with environmental enrichment for 21 successive days. After exposure to environmental enrichment combined with fasudil treatment, the number of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region increased significantly, the expression and proportion of p-cofilin in the hippocampus decreased, and the distribution of F-actin in the hippocampal CA1 region increased significantly. Furthermore, the performance of mouse stroke models in the tail suspension test and step-through passive avoidance test improved significantly. These findings suggest that environmental enrichment combined with fasudil treatment can ameliorate memory dysfunction through inhibition of the hippocampal ROCK/cofilin pathway, alteration of the dynamic distribution of F-actin, and inhibition of neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region. The efficacy of environmental enrichment combined with fasudil treatment was superior to that of fasudil treatment alone. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fudan University of China (approval No. 2019-Huashan Hospital JS-139) on February 20, 2019.

AB  - Calcium (Ca2+) signaling is critical for neuronal functioning and requires the concerted interplay of numerous Ca2+-binding proteins, including neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1). Although an important role of NCS1 in neuronal processes and in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases has been established, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we systematically investigated the functions of NCS1 in the brain. Using Golgi-Cox staining, we observed a reduction in dendritic complexity and spine density in the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal hippocampus of Ncs1(-/-) mice, which may underlie concomitantly observed deficits in memory acquisition. Subsequent RNA sequencing of Ncs1(-/-) and Ncs1(+/+) mouse brain tissues revealed that NCS1 modulates gene expression related to neuronal morphology and development. Investigation of developmental databases further supported a molecular role of NCS1 during brain development by identifying temporal gene expression patterns. Collectively, this study provides insights into NCS1-dependent signaling and lays the foundation for a better understanding of NCS1-associated diseases.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular surgery is confronted by a lack of suitable materials for patch repair. Acellular animal tissues serve as an abundant source of promising biomaterials. The aim of our study was to explore the bio-integration of decellularized or recellularized pericardial matrices in vivo. Methods: Porcine (allograft) and ovine (heterograft, xenograft) pericardia were decellularized using 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate ((1) Allo-decel and (2) Xeno-decel). We used two cell types for pressure-stimulated recellularization in a bioreactor: autologous adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) isolated from subcutaneous fat of pigs ((3) Allo-ASC and (4) Xeno-ASC) and allogeneic Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJCs) ((5) Allo-WJC and (6) Xeno-WJC). These six experimental patches were implanted in porcine carotid arteries for one month. For comparison, we also implanted six types of control patches, namely, arterial or venous autografts, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE Propaten(R) Gore(R)), polyethylene terephthalate (PET Vascutek(R)), chemically stabilized bovine pericardium (XenoSure(R)), and detoxified porcine pericardium (BioIntegral(R) NoReact(R)). The grafts were evaluated through the use of flowmetry, angiography, and histological examination. Results: All grafts were well-integrated and patent with no signs of thrombosis, stenosis, or aneurysm. A histological analysis revealed that the arterial autograft resembled a native artery. All other control and experimental patches developed neo-adventitial inflammation (NAI) and neo-intimal hyperplasia (NIH), and the endothelial lining was present. NAI and NIH were most prominent on XenoSure(R) and Xeno-decel and least prominent on NoReact(R). In xenografts, the degree of NIH developed in the following order: Xeno-decel > Xeno-ASC > Xeno-WJC. NAI and patch resorption increased in Allo-ASC and Xeno-ASC and decreased in Allo-WJC and Xeno-WJC. Conclusions: In our setting, pre-implant seeding with ASC or WJC had a modest impact on vascular patch remodeling. However, ASC increased the neo-adventitial inflammatory reaction and patch resorption, suggesting accelerated remodeling. WJC mitigated this response, as well as neo-intimal hyperplasia on xenografts, suggesting immunomodulatory properties.

AB  - A brompheniramine taste-masked pediatric formulation was developed as part of the National Institutes of Health Pediatric Formulation Initiative to help address low patient compliance caused by the bitter taste of many adult formulations. To confirm that the taste-masked formulation can provide a similar pharmacological effect to the previous marketed adult formulations, a juvenile porcine model was used to screen the model pediatric formulation to compare the bioavailability between the marketed brompheniramine maleate and the taste-masked maleate/tannate formulation. Pigs were dosed orally with both formulations and blood samples were obtained from 0 to 48 h. Plasma samples were prepared and extracted using solid-phase extraction. The mass spectrometer was operated under selected ion monitoring mode. The selected ion monitoring channels were set to m/z 319.1 for brompheniramine and m/z 275.2 for the internal standard chlorpheniramine. Calibration curves were linear over the analytical range 0.2-20 ng/ml (r(2 )> 0.995) for brompheniramine in plasma. The intra- and inter-day accuracies were between 98.0 and 105% with 5.73% RSD precision. The bioanalytical method was successfully applied to a preclinical bioavailability study. The bioavailability profiles were not significantly different between the two formulations, which demonstrates that taste-masking with tannic acid is a promising approach for formulation modification for pediatric patients.

AB  - We evaluated photosystem II (PSII) functionality in potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L.) before and after a 15 min feeding by the leaf miner Tuta absoluta using chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging analysis combined with reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection. Fifteen minutes after feeding, we observed at the feeding zone and at the whole leaf a decrease in the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (phi(PSII)). While at the feeding zone the quantum yield of regulated non-photochemical energy loss in PSII (phi(NPQ)) did not change, at the whole leaf level there was a significant increase. As a result, at the feeding zone a significant increase in the quantum yield of non-regulated energy loss in PSII (phi(NO)) occurred, but there was no change at the whole leaf level compared to that before feeding, indicating no change in singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) formation. The decreased phi(PSII) after feeding was due to a decreased fraction of open reaction centers (q(p)), since the efficiency of open PSII reaction centers to utilize the light energy (Fv '/Fm ') did not differ before and after feeding. The decreased fraction of open reaction centers resulted in increased excess excitation energy (EXC) at the feeding zone and at the whole leaf level, while hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production was detected only at the feeding zone. Although the whole leaf PSII efficiency decreased compared to that before feeding, the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), and the efficiency of the water-splitting complex on the donor side of PSII (Fv/Fo), did not differ to that before feeding, thus they cannot be considered as sensitive parameters to monitor biotic stress effects. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging analysis proved to be a good indicator to monitor even short-term impacts of insect herbivory on photosynthetic function, and among the studied parameters, the reduction status of the plastoquinone pool (q(p)) was the most sensitive and suitable indicator to probe photosynthetic function under biotic stress.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of combining two injectable progesterone (iP4) formulas for estrous synchronization in ewes and to compare it with traditional intravaginal progesterone devices. Additionally, the study assessed whether the inclusion of GnRH enhances the reproductive outcomes of the iP4 treatment. Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, 20 Santa In & ecirc;s ewes were divided into two groups: one group received intravaginal progesterone devices, and the other received combined long-acting and short-acting iP4. In the second experiment, 30 Corriedale ewes were divided into two groups: one received the combined iP4 with GnRH, and the other without GnRH. Estrous, ovulation, follicular populations, and progesterone concentrations were monitored. The combined iP4 treatment induced an artificial luteal phase and produced reproductive responses similar to those obtained with intravaginal devices. In the first experiment, the iP4 treatment tended to result in more synchronized ovulation compared to the control (P=0.095). In the second experiment, adding GnRH enhanced the quality of the corpus luteum, as indicated by increased diameter and vascularization on Day 23 (P=0.047 and P=0.02, respectively). The combined administration of long-acting and short-acting iP4 effectively synchronized estrous in ewes and showed similar efficacy to traditional intravaginal devices. The inclusion of GnRH improved luteal quality, suggesting potential benefits for reproductive management in ewes. Further studies are needed to evaluate the fertility outcomes of these protocols under field conditions.

AB  - No precision medicine models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and associated mental comorbidities have been developed to date. This observational study aimed to develop a precision nomothetic, data-driven comorbid TLE model with endophenotype classes and pathway phenotypes that may have prognostic and therapeutical implications. We recruited forty healthy controls and 108 TLE patients for this research and assessed TLE and psychopathology (PP) features as well as oxidative stress (OSTOX, e.g., malondialdehyde or MDA, lipid hydroperoxides, and advanced oxidation protein products) and antioxidant (paraoxonase 1 or PON1 status, -SH groups, and total radical trapping potential or TRAP) biomarkers. A large part (57.2%) of the variance in a latent vector (LV) extracted from the above TLE and PP features was explained by these OSTOX and antioxidant biomarkers. The PON1 Q192R genetic variant showed indirect effects on this LV, which were completely mediated by PON1 activity and MDA. Factor analysis showed that a common core could be extracted from TLE, PP, OSTOX and antioxidant scores, indicating that these features are manifestations of a common underlying construct, i.e., a novel pathway phenotype of TLE. Based on the latter, we constructed a new phenotype class that is characterized by increased severity of TLE, PP and OSTOX features and lowered antioxidant defenses. A large part of the variance in episode frequency was explained by increased MDA, lowered antioxidant, and nitric oxide metabolite levels. In conclusion, (a) PP symptoms belong to the TLE phenome, and the signal increased severity; and (b) cumulative effects of aldehyde formation and lowered antioxidants determine epileptogenic kindling.

AB  - Objective. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is inevitable after kidney transplantation (KT), impairing outcomes. Relaxin-2 (RLX) is a promising insulin-related peptide hormone that protects against renal IRI in rodents, although large animal models are needed before RLX can be tested in a human setting. Methods. In this blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled experimental study kidneys from 19 donor pigs were retrieved after perfusion with Custodiol(R) & PLUSMN; RLX (5 or 20 nmol/L) and underwent static cold storage (SCS) for 24 and 48 h, respectively. Subsequently, KT was performed after unilateral right nephrectomy. Study outcomes included markers for kidney function, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and endothelial cell damage. PCR analysis for oxidative stress and apoptosis-related gene panels as well as immunohistochemistry were performed. Results. RLX upregulated SOD2 and NFKB expression to 135% (p = 0.042) and 125% (p = 0.019), respectively, while RIPK1 expression was downregulated to 82% (p = 0.016) of corresponding controls. Further RLX significantly downregulated RIPK1 and MLKL expression and decreased the number of Caspase 3- and MPO-positive cells in grafts after SCS. Conclusions. RLX supplemented Custodiol(R) significantly decreased IRI via both antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Clinical trials are warranted to implement synthetic human RLX as a novel additive to preservation solutions against IRI.

AB  - Hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has shown neuroprotective effects in acute brain injury, but its role in chronic radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) remains unclear. This study investigated the long-term efficacy of HRW in mitigating cognitive impairment and neuronal damage caused by chronic RIBI. Fifty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, irradiation (IR), IR with memantine, IR with HRW, and IR with combined treatment. All but the control group received 20 Gy whole-brain X-ray irradiation, followed by daily interventions for 60 days. Behavioral assessments, histopathological analyses, oxidative stress measurements, 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, transcriptomic sequencing, RT-qPCR, Western blot, and serum ELISA were performed. HRW significantly improved anxiety-like behavior, memory, and learning performance compared to the IR group. Histological results revealed that HRW reduced neuronal swelling, degeneration, and loss and enhanced dendritic spine density and neurogenesis. PET/CT imaging showed increased hippocampal glucose uptake in the IR group, which was alleviated by HRW treatment. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses indicated that HRW modulated key genes and proteins, including CD44, CD74, SPP1, and Wnt1, potentially through the MIF, Wnt, and SPP1 signaling pathways. Serum CD44 levels were also lower in treated rats, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for chronic RIBI. These findings demonstrate that HRW can alleviate chronic RIBI by preserving neuronal structure, reducing inflammation, and enhancing neuroplasticity, supporting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for radiation-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a public health crisis throughout the world and highlighted the need for rapid and sensitive testing as a countermeasure. A sensitive and specific biosensor platform is developed for the detection of antigen and RNA of SARS-CoV-2, and its variant (B1.1.529). The demonstrated biosensor platform combines unique protein catalyzed capture bioreceptors (PCCs) for antigen capture and a chimeric (RNA-DNA) probe for RNA detection using LwaCas13a collateral cleavage activity atop graphene field effect transistors (gFETs). The reported biosensor is able to differentiate unprocessed 10(4) pfu m(-1) samples of SARS-CoV-2 from Influenza and Rhinovirus. The limit of detection (LOD) calculated for SARS-CoV-2 antigen is 10(3) in buffer and 10(4) PFU mL(-1) in 10% saliva, while LOD of approximate to 65 am calculated for viral RNA isolate without amplification. To provide a high reliability of detection, the role of internal and external factors with respect to gate voltage is further analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Based on PCA analysis, the authors are able to classify the samples as pathogen positive or negative (Y > 0: Positive for pathogen, Y < 0: Negative for pathogen). The reported platform can be quickly adapted for multi-omics and multiplexed diagnosis of continuously evolving biothreats and global pandemics.

AB  - The brain's early response to low dose ionizing radiation, as may be encountered during diagnostic procedures and space exploration, is not yet fully characterized. In the brain parenchyma, the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) is constitutively expressed at low levels by endothelial cells, and can therefore be used to assess the integrity of the brain's vasculature. At the same time, the inducible expression of TSPO in activated microglia, the brain's intrinsic immune cells, is a regularly observed early indicator of subtle or incipient brain pathology. Here, we explored the use of TSPO as a biomarker of brain tissue injury following whole body irradiation. Post-radiation responses were measured in C57BL/6 wild type (Tspo(+/+)) and TSPO knockout (Tspo(-/-)) mice 48 h after single whole body gamma irradiations with low doses 0, 0.01, and 0.1 Gy and a high dose of 2 Gy. Additionally, post-radiation responses of primary microglial cell cultures were measured at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h at an irradiation dose range of 0 Gy-2 Gy. TSPO mRNA and protein expression in the brain showed a decreased trend after 0.01 Gy relative to sham-irradiated controls, but remained unchanged after higher doses. Immunohistochemistry confirmed subtle decreases in TSPO expression after 0.01 Gy in vascular endothelial cells of the hippocampal region and in ependymal cells, with no detectable changes following higher doses. Cytokine concentrations in plasma after whole body irradiation showed differential changes in IL-6 and IL-10 with some variations between Tspo(-/-) and Tspo(+/+) animals. The in vitro measurements of TSPO in primary microglial cell cultures showed a significant reduction 1 h after low dose irradiation (0.01 Gy). In summary, acute low and high doses of gamma irradiation up to 2 Gy reduced TSPO expression in the brain's vascular compartment without de novo induction of TSPO expression in parenchymal microglia, while TSPO expression in directly irradiated, isolated, and thus highly activated microglia, too, was reduced after low dose irradiation. The potential link between TSPO, its role in mitochondrial energy metabolism and the selective radiation sensitivity, notably of cells with constitutive TSPO expression such as vascular endothelial cells, merits further exploration.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: SiniSan (SNS), a traditional formula from the Treatise on Typhoid Fever, has been shown in modern clinical practice to effectively treat both ulcerative colitis (UC) and depression, although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Aim of the study: This study employed UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental validation to investigate SNS's mechanism in treating UC with comorbid depression. Materials and methods: UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS, in conjunction with network pharmacology and molecular docking, identified active constituents and potential targets of SNS. A UC model induced by a 3 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solution was used for experimental validation. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed through behavioral tests, ELISA, routine blood tests, histopathology, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and qRT-PCR. Results: SNS alleviated weight loss and inflammation in DSS-induced colitis in mice while exhibiting antidepressant effects in the open field test, forced swim test, and tail suspension test. Furthermore, SNS improved intestinal mucosal barrier function and restored hippocampal blood-brain barrier integrity. It inhibited microglial proliferation and neuroinflammation in the Hippocampus Cornu Ammonis 1 and dentate gyrus regions. Mechanistic analysis revealed that SNS mediates its effects on UC by modulating targets in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Conclusions: SNS ameliorates UC with comorbid depression by restoring the integrity of both the intestinal mucosal barrier and the blood-brain barrier, alleviating DSS-induced colitis and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in women; however, preclinical research on PTSD has predominantly been conducted in male animals. Using a predator scent stress (PSS) rodent model of PTSD, we sought to determine if stress-susceptible female rats show altered monoamine concentrations in brain regions associated with PTSD: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and dorsal (dHIPP) and ventral (vHIPP) hippocampus. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a single, 10-min PSS exposure and tested for persistent anhedonia, fear, and anxiety-like behavior over four weeks. Rats were phenotyped as stress-Susceptible based on sucrose consumption in the sucrose preference task and time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Brain tissue was collected, and norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Stress-susceptibility in female rats was associated with increased dopamine and serotonin turnover in the mPFC. Susceptibility was also associated with elevated dopamine turnover in the NAc and increased norepinephrine in the vHIPP. Our findings suggest that stress-susceptibility after a single stress exposure is associated with long-term effects on monoamine function in female rats. These data suggest interventions that decrease monoamine turnover, such as MAOIs, may be effective in the treatment of PTSD in women.

AB  - Fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) has now spread to more than 26 Chinese provinces. The government is working with farmers and researchers to find ways to prevent and control this pest. The use of biochar is one of the economic and environmentally friendly strategies to increase plant growth and improve pest resistance. We tested four v/v combinations of bamboo charcoal with coconut bran [BC1 (10:1), BC2(30:1), BC3(50:1)] against a control (CK) in maize. We found that plant height, stem thickness, fresh weight and chlorophyll content were significantly higher in BC2, in addition to the lowest FAW survival %. We then compared the metabolome and transcriptome profiles of BC2 and CK maize plants under FAW herbivory. Our results show that the levels of flavonoids, amino acids and derivatives, nucleotides and derivatives and most phenolic acids decreased, while terpenoids, organic acids, lipids and defense-related hormones increased in BC-grown maize leaves. Transcriptome sequencing revealed consistent expression profiles of genes enriched in these pathways. We also observed the increased expression of genes related to abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, auxin and MAPK signaling. Based on these observations, we discussed the possible pathways involved in maize against FAW herbivory. We conclude that bamboo charcoal induces anti-herbivory responses in maize leaves.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to implement a novel Scan to BIM method applied to cultural heritage field to build 3D GIS model able to connect different databases and, as consequence, allowing a multidisciplinary approach. The proposed method was applied to the case study of a rock church located in the famous ceramics district of Grottaglie (Italy). To obtain the 3D GIS model of the structure under investigation, it was necessary to perform, as a first step, an integrated survey with Terrestrial Laser Scanner technology and close range photogrammetry which allowed the construction of a dense point cloud and high-resolution orthophotos useful for the study of architectural and historical analysis of the elements present within the rock site. Subsequently, the single objects identified using the stratigraphic method, was modelled from point cloud by the development of an original procedure based on the use of some tools developed in Rhinoceros and MeshLAB software that allowed reconstructing the objects in a geometrically accurate way. Indeed, the difference between the point cloud and the BIM model was of few millimetres, demonstrating the high quality of the proposed method. Finally, the BIM model was imported into 3D GIS environment and for each element previously identified, it was possible to connect multi-information. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Objective. To investigate the effects of peripheral transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at sepsis convalescence on post-sepsis cognitive function and underlying mechanisms in mice. Methods. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice. Bone marrow-derived MSCs from mice were cultured and injected via tail vein on the 8(th) day after CLP. Cognitive function was detected in open field, novel object recognition task, and delayed matching-to-place water maze task during 10-26 days after CLP. Neuroinflammation, neurogenesis, and peripheral inflammation were detected on the 12(th) and 31(th) days after CLP. MSCs tracing was detected during 8-10 days after CLP. Results. Transplanted MSCs were located at peripheral organs (lung, spleen, liver) and had no obvious effects on survival and weight of sepsis mice. Transplanted MSCs mitigated cognitive impairments and hippocampal microglial activation, improved hippocampal neurogenesis of sepsis surviving mice, and had no obvious effect on the leukocyte amount, the neutrophil percentage, and the inflammatory factors of peripheral blood, and the hippocampal inflammatory factors. Conclusions. Our data indicated that MSCs transplantation via peripheral vein at later phase of sepsis can improve post-sepsis cognitive impairment and hippocampal neurogenesis of sepsis surviving mice.

AB  - In order to contribute to the development of semen processing procedures in camelids, the aims of the present study were to evaluate (i) the effect of 35% seminal plasma incubation on dromedary camel epididymal sperm motility and kinematic parameters, (ii) the effects of centrifugation, with cushion fluid and enzymatic reduction of viscosity (Papain + E64) during ejaculate processing, on the motility and kinematic parameters of dromedary camel ejaculates. The incubation with seminal plasma significantly reduced the percentage of progressively motile spermatozoa as well as the proportion of medium progressive spermatozoa whilst increasing the percentage of non-progressive spermatozoa. The centrifugation procedure improved the sperms' kinematic parameters, and the highest values were observed for samples centrifugated with cushion fluid. The samples treated with Papain + E64 showed a significant increase in both total and medium progressive spermatozoa, along with a reduction of non-progressive spermatozoa (p < 0.05). The results of this investigation show that a simple, cheap, and effective procedure, such as cushioned centrifugation, could improve the motility patterns of dromedary camel spermatozoa; in combination with enzymatic reduction of viscosity, this method leads to the best results in terms of recovery rates and sperms' kinematic parameters.

AB  - In addition to phytocannabinoids, cannabis contains terpenoids that are claimed to have a myriad of effects on the body. We tested a panel of five common cannabis terpenoids, myrcene, linalool, limonene, alpha-pinene and nerolidol, in two neuronal models, autaptic hippocampal neurons and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Autaptic neurons express a form of cannabinoid CB1 receptor-dependent retrograde plasticity while DRGs express a variety of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Most terpenoids had little or no effect on neuronal cannabinoid signaling. The exception was nerolidol, which inhibited endocannabinoid signaling. Notably, this is not via inhibition of CB1 receptors but by inhibiting some aspect of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) production/delivery; the mechanism does not involve reducing the activity of the 2-AG-synthesizing diacylglycerol lipases (DAGLs). Nerolidol was also the only terpenoid that activated a sustained calcium response in a small (7%) subpopulation of DRGs. In summary, we found that only one of five terpenoids tested had notable effects on cannabinoid signaling in two neuronal models. Our results suggest that a few terpenoids may indeed interact with some components of the cannabinoid signaling system and may therefore offer interesting insights upon further study.

AB  - Both the circadian clock and sex hormone signaling can strongly influence brain function, yet little is known about how these 2 powerful modulatory systems might interact during complex neural processes like memory consolidation. Individually, the molecular components and action of each of these systems have been fairly well-characterized, but there is a fundamental lack of information about how these systems cooperate. In the circadian system, clock genes function as timekeeping molecules that convey time-of-day information on a well-stereotyped cycle that is governed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Keeping time is particularly important to synchronize various physiological processes across the brain and body, including those that regulate memory consolidation. Similarly, sex hormones are powerful modulators of memory, with androgens, estrogens, and progestins, all influencing memory consolidation within memory-relevant brain regions like the hippocampus. Despite clear evidence that each system can influence memory individually, exactly how the circadian and hormonal systems might interact to impact memory consolidation remains unclear. Research investigating either sex hormone action or circadian gene function within memory-relevant brain regions has unveiled several notable places in which the two systems could interact to control memory. Here, we bring attention to known interactions between the circadian clock and sex hormone signaling. We then review sex hormone-mediated control of memory consolidation, highlighting potential nodes through which the circadian system might interact during memory formation. We suggest that the bidirectional relationship between these two systems is essential for proper control of memory formation based on an animal's hormonal and circadian state.

AB  - Amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) has been shown to cause synaptic dysfunction and can render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Na,K-ATPase plays an important role to maintain cell ionic equilibrium and it can be modulated by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP pathway. Disruption of NO synthase (NOS) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production could lead to changes in Na,K-ATPase isoforms' activities that may be detrimental to the cells. Our aim was to evaluate the signaling pathways of A beta in relation to NMDA-NOS-cyclic GMP versus oxidative stress on alpha(1)-/alpha(2,3)-Na,K-ATPase activities in rat hippocampal slices. A beta(1-40) induced a concentration-dependent increase of NOS activity and increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), and 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT)-modified protein levels in rat hippocampal slices. The increase in NOS activity and cyclic GMP levels induced by A beta(1-40) was completely blocked by MK-801 (inhibitor of NMDA receptor) and L-NAME (inhibitor of NOS) pre-treatment but changes in TBARS levels were only partially blocked by both compounds. The A beta treatment also decreased Na,K-ATPase activity which was reverted by N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) but not by MK-801 pre-treatment. The decrease in enzyme activity induced by A beta was isoform-specific since only alpha(1)-Na,K-ATPase was affected. These findings suggest that the activation of NMDA-NOS signaling cascade linked to alpha(2,3)-Na,K-ATPase activity may mediate an adaptive, neuroprotective response to A beta in rat hippocampus.

AB  - Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs) are volatile signals emitted by plants to deter herbivores and attract their natural enemies. To date, it is unknown how lychee plants, Litchi chinensis, respond to the induction of leaf galls (erinea) caused by the lychee erinose mite (LEM), Aceria litchii. Aiming to reveal the role of HIPVs in this plant-mite interaction, we investigated changes in the volatile profile of lychee plants infested by LEM and their role on LEM preferences. The volatile profile of uninfested (flower buds, fruit, leaves and new leaf shoots) and infested plant tissue were characterized under different levels of LEM infestation. Volatiles were collected using head-space-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. Fifty-eight volatiles, including terpenoids, alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, esters, and ketones classes were identified. Using dual-choice bioassays, we investigated the preference of LEM to uninfested plant tissues and to the six most abundant plant volatiles identified. Uninfested new leaf shoots were the most attractive plant tissues to LEM and LEM attraction or repellence to volatiles were mostly influenced by compound concentration. We discuss possible applications of our findings in agricultural settings.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic syndrome involving neuropathic pain. Increased oxidative stress in DM is assumed to increase free reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) and causes diabetic damage. The sciatic nerve (ScN) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) both contain high levels of the TRPV1 channel, which is triggered by capsaicin and ROSs and results in increased Ca2+ entry into the neurons. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is considered an important part of the antioxidant system. To better characterize the protective effects of ALA on the DM-induced neuronal through TRPV1 modulation, we investigated the role of ALA on DM-induced neuropathic pain, oxidative ScN, and DRG damage in diabetic rats. Forty adult Wistar albino female rats were divided into four groups as control, ALA (50 mg/kg for 14 days), streptozotocin (STZ and 45 mg/kg and single dose), and STZ + ALA. Rats were used for the pain tests. After obtaining the DRGs and ScN, they were used for plate reader, patch-clamp, and laser confocal microscope analyses. We observed the modulator role of ALA on the thresholds of mechanical withdrawal pain (von Frey test) and hot sensitivity pain (hot plate test) in the STZ + ALA group. The treatment of ALA decreased STZ-induced increase of TRPV1 current densities, intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations (Fura-2 and Fluo - 3/AM), ROS, caspase 3, caspase 9, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis values in the ScN and DRG neurons, although its treatment induced the increase of cell viability and body weight gain. The treatment of ALA acted a neuroprotective role on the TRPV1 channel stimulation-mediated Ca2+ influx, neuropathic pain, and neuronal damage in diabetic rats. The neuroprotective role of ALA treatment can be explained by its modulating the TRPV1 channel activity, intracellular Ca2+ increase-induced oxidative stress, and apoptosis.

AB  - This retrospective study aims to further investigate the effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) treatment on respiratory function in growing patients with contracted upper airways, by assessing nasal resistance using active anterior rhinomanometry (AAR). Methods: At T0 (pre-RME), 122 orthodontic patients aged 5 to 12 years, exhibiting oral breathing and/or snoring along with maxillary contraction, underwent AAR with a mask using the ATMOS Rhino 31 rhinomanometer. Additionally, the SRDB or PSQ-SRDB Questionnaire was utilized to validate the orthodontic history of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). If AAR results at T0 were clinically significant, they were repeated at T1, corresponding to a period of three months after screw fixation, to evaluate changes in nasal resistance values between pre- and post-treatment. Results: The study group comprised 42 oral respiratory patients with a mean age of 7.71 years, suspected of pediatric OSAS. Although the questionnaires did not yield statistically significant results, the therapy induced an overall reduction in airflow resistance values from both nostrils (-24.63% in the right nostril; -26.65% in the left nostril). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the beneficial effects of orthodontic treatment with RME on nasal function in terms of airflow resistance in cases of maxillary contraction.

AB  - Chronic cerebral ischaemia (CCI) is a common pathological disorder, which is associated with various diseases, such as cerebral arteriosclerosis and vascular dementia, resulting in neurological dysfunction. As a type of non-coding RNA, circular RNA is involved in regulating the occurrence and development of diseases, such as ischaemic brain injury. Here, we found that HT22 cells and hippocampus treated with CCI had low expression of circ_0000296, Runx3, Sirt1, but high expression of miR-194-5p. Overexpression of circ_0000296, Runx3, Sirt1, and silenced miR-194-5p significantly inhibited neuronal apoptosis induced by CCI. This study demonstrated that circ_0000296 specifically bound to miR-194-5p; miR-194-5p bound to the 3 ' UTR region of Runx3 mRNA; Runx3 directly bound to the promoter region of Sirt1, enhancing its transcriptional activity. Overexpression of circ_0000296 by miR-194-5p reduced the negative regulatory effect of miR-194-5p on Runx3, promoted the transcriptional effect of Runx3 on Sirt1, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis induced by CCI. mmu_circ_0000296 plays an important role in regulating neuronal apoptosis induced by CCI through miR-194-5p/Runx3/Sirt1 pathway.

AB  - Shading was thought as an effective approach to increase theanine in harvested tea shoots. Previous studies offered conflicting findings, perhaps since the integration of theanine metabolism and transport in different tissues was not considered. Theanine is synthesized primarily in the roots and is then transported, via the vascular system, to new vegetative tissues. Here, we found that theanine increased in the stem, was reduced in the leaf, and remained stable in the roots, under shading conditions. Notably, in tea roots, shading significantly increased ethylamine and activated the theanine biosynthesis pathway and theanine transporter genes. Furthermore, shading significantly increased the expression of theanine transporter genes, CsAAP2/4/5/8, in the stem, while decreasing the expression of CsAAP1/2/4/5/6 in the leaf, in accordance with shading effects on theanine levels in these tissues. These findings reveal that shading of tea plants promotes theanine biosynthesis and allocation in different tissues, processes which appear to involve the theanine biosynthesis pathway enzymes and AAP family of theanine transporters.

AB  - Herbaspirillum sp. ZXN111 and its mutants (Delta acc, Delta tyrb, and Delta acc-tyrb), which show PGP activity on Zijuan, were tested for tea plants' colonization characteristics and the strain-dependent response of tea metabolites. The results showed that strain ZXN111 could widely colonize in different tea cultivars of Zijuan, Yunkang-10, Longjin 43, and Shuchazao, but with significant colonization preference to Zijuan, which might be ascribed to anthocyanins' chemotaxis. After 9 weeks of co-cultivation, L-theanine and theobromine in Zijuan leaves that were inoculated with wild-type ZXN111 were decreased, while theobromine, caffeine, and L-theanine that were inoculated with mutant Delta acc were increased; especially L-theanine increased much significantly. Metabolomics analysis showed that tea metabolite profiling of inoculant groups was clearly separated from the control; therein, the flavanols were downregulated in ZXN111 and Delta acc groups, but the L-theanine of the Delta acc group was significantly upregulated compared to control and ZXN111 groups. These results indicated that strain ZXN111, especially of mutant Delta acc, improved Zijuan tea flavor.

AB  - Obesity has become a global epidemic and is associated with comorbidities, including diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases, among others. While appreciable insight has been gained into the mechanisms of obesity-associated comorbidities, effects of age, and duration of obesity on the female brain remain obscure. To address this gap, adolescent and mature adult female mice were subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) for 13 or 26 weeks, whereas age-matched controls were fed a standard diet. Subsequently, the expression of inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophic/neuroprotective factors, and markers of microgliosis and astrogliosis were analyzed in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex, along with inflammation in visceral adipose tissue. HFD led to a typical obese phenotype in all groups independent of age and duration of HFD. However, the intermediate duration of obesity induced a limited inflammatory response in adolescent females' hypothalamus while the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and visceral adipose tissue remained unaffected. In contrast, the prolonged duration of obesity resulted in inflammation in all three brain regions and visceral adipose tissue along with upregulation of microgliosis/astrogliosis and suppression of neurotrophic/neuroprotective factors in all brain regions, denoting the duration of obesity as a critical risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, when female mice were older (i.e., mature adult), even the intermediate duration of obesity induced similar adverse effects in all brain regions. Taken together, our findings suggest that (1) both age and duration of obesity have a significant impact on obesity-associated comorbidities and (2) early interventions to end obesity are critical to preserving brain health.
   High fat diet (HFD) induces typical obesity phenotype in female mice independent of their age and duration of HFD. Young females partially resist inflammatory processes induced by moderate duration (13 weeks) of HFD/obesity while females in advanced age develop full-scale inflammation, indicating age as a risk factor for obesity associated comorbidities. When HFD/obesity persists for a long duration (26 weeks), even young females develop full-scale inflammation underlining the importance of early corrective interventions to preserve cognitive function and overall health.image

AB  - Traffic enforcement cameras can lead to unwanted side-effects. For instance, red-light cameras at intersections can increase the chance at rear-end collisions, probably caused by slowing down abruptly. Additionally, on the highways, speed cameras could lead to kangaroo-jumps in driving speed. Warning drivers about cameras is a possible solution. Cameras that are uncommonly decorated (e.g. colored in pink or in yellow) may provide better conspicuity compared to those in standard colors like gray. However, besides warning drivers about their presence, more conspicuity of cameras could also distract drivers from the primary driving task. Therefore, the impact of such decoration on safety is unclear. This study evaluates different decorated designs of the camera housing and how such decoration may influence camera's conspicuity and induce distraction while driving.Three camera colored-designs were evaluated (gray, pink, and a mixture of yellow and black) using a driving simulator. Fifty-four participants drove nine different conditions, i.e. three camera-designs in three roadway-settings (basic highway segments, intersections operating during the amber-phase, and intersections with a bicycle-lane). Subjective and objective measures allowed to assess if: 1) decorated camera housings increased conspicuity, 2) signs of distraction could be found, and 3) driving was influenced. In addition to the detection success rate, other eye-tracking parameters were: time-to-first-fixation, fixation count, and average and total fixation duration. Driving measures, i.e. speed, acceleration or deceleration rate, lane-keeping behavior, and minimum time-to-collision, were included to assess if the tested camera-designs impacted driving behavior. Moreover, a post-drive questionnaire assessed the participants' opinions. Using camera colored-designs improved the camera's conspicuity. However, driving measures remained comparable across the three camera-designs. Although the subjective data indicated some distraction from the decorated cameras, clear indications for an effect on traffic safety were lacking. Meanwhile, a little over half of the respondents supported camera deco-ration. The current study does not allow firm conclusions, and additional research is recommended.

AB  - In this study, we were able to impart antimicrobial properties onto the surface of a commercial thin-film composite (TFC) membrane using sustainably derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) extracted from elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) leaves. Carboxylic acid-containing CNC were chemically bound to the amine-terminated polyamide active layer of TFC membranes using a cross-linking reaction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were conducted to confirm the presence of CNC on the membrane surface. TFC membranes functionalized with needle-like and antimicrobial CNC nanoparticles showed robust toxicity to bacteria, inactivating similar to 89% of attached Escherichia coli cells under contact. These findings establish that functionalization with CNC is a promising approach for mitigating biofouling on TFC membranes and substantiates the application of sustainable materials for the design of the next-generation membranes for water purification.

AB  - As an important economic plant, tea (Camellia sinensis) has a good economic value and significant health effects. Theanine is an important nitrogen reservoir, and its synthesis and degradation are considered important for nitrogen storage and remobilization in tea plants. Our previous research indicated that the endophyte CsE7 participates in the synthesis of theanine in tea plants. Here, the tracking test confirmed that CsE7 tended to be exposed to mild light and preferentially colonized mature tea leaves. CsE7 also participated in glutamine, theanine, and glutamic acid circulatory metabolism (Gln-Thea-Glu) and contributed to nitrogen remobilization, mediated by the gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (CsEGGT) with hydrolase preference. The reisolation and inoculation of endophytes further verified their role in accelerating the remobilization of nitrogen, especially in the reuse of theanine and glutamine. This is the first report about the photoregulated endophytic colonization and the positive effect of endophytes on tea plants mediated and characterized by promoting leaf nitrogen remobilization.

AB  - The effects of the phytoestrogen-enriched plant Pueraria mirifica (PM) extract on ovari-ectomy (OVX)-induced cognitive impairment and hippocampal oxidative stress in mice were investigated. Daily treatment with PM and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) significantly elevated cognitive behavior as evaluated by using the Y maze test, the novel object recognition test (NORT), and the Morris water maze test (MWM), attenuated atrophic changes in the uterus and decreased serum 17 beta-estradiol levels. The treatments significantly ameliorated ovariectomy-induced oxidative stress in the hippocampus and serum by a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA), an enhancement of superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity, including significantly down-regulated expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha proinflammatory cytokines, while up-regulating expression of PI3K. The present results suggest that PM extract suppresses oxidative brain damage and dysfunctions in the hippocampal antioxidant system, including the neuroinflammatory system in OVX animals, thereby preventing OVX-induced cognitive impairment. The present results indicate that PM exerts beneficial effects on cognitive deficits for which menopause/ovariectomy have been implicated as risk factors.

AB  - 1,2-Diacetylbenzene (DAB) is a metabolite of 1,2-diethylbenzene, which is commonly used in the manufacture of plastics and gasoline. We examined the neurotoxic effects of DAB in young and old rats, particularly its effects on hippocampus. Previously, we reported DAB impairs hippocampal neurogenesis but that the underlying mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we evaluate the toxicities exhibited by DAB in the hippocampi of 6-month-old (young) and 20-month-old (old) male SD rats by treating animals intraperitoneally with DAB at 3 mg/kg/day for 1 week. Hippocampal areas were dissected from brains and RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. RNA results showed animals exhibited age-dependent sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of DAB. We observed that inflammatory pathways were up-regulated in old rats but that metabolism- and detoxification-related pathways were up-regulated in young rats. This result in old rats, especially upregulation of the TREM1 signaling pathway (an inflammatory response involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD)) was confirmed by RT-PCR. Our study results provide a better understanding of age-dependent responses to DAB and new insight into the association between DAB and AD.

AB  - Background: Terahertz (THz) waves, lying between millimeter waves and infrared light, may interact with biomolecules due to their unique energy characteristics. However, whether THz waves are neurally regulated remains controversial, and the underlying mechanism is elusive. Methods: Mouse brain slices were exposed to 1.94 THz waves for 1 h. Synaptic plasticity was evaluated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), long-term potentiation (LTP), and neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1) and synaptophysin (SYN) expression. Immunofluorescence (IF) and electrophysiology were used to identify neurons sensitive to THz waves. The calcium activity of excitatory neurons, glutamate receptor currents, and glutamate neuron marker expression was also assessed using calcium imaging, a patch clamp, and Western blotting (WB). Optogenetics and chemogenetics were used to determine the role of excitatory neurons in synaptic plasticity impairment after THz wave exposure. NMDA receptor 2B (GluN2B) was overexpressed in the ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) by a lentivirus to clarify the role of GluN2B in THz wave-induced synaptic plasticity impairment. Results: Exposure to 1.94 THz waves increased postsynaptic density (PSD) thickness and reduced the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and Tuj1 and SYN expression. THz waves diminished vCA1 glutamatergic neuron activity and excitability, neural electrical activity, and glutamate transporter function. THz waves reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) current amplitudes and NMDAR subunit expression. Activating vCA1 glutamatergic neurons through optogenetics and chemogenetics mitigated THz wave-induced synaptic plasticity impairment. GluN2B subunit overexpression improved synaptic plasticity marker expression, synaptic ultrastructure, and the fEPSP slope. Conclusions: Exposure to 1.94 THz waves decreased synaptic plasticity, glutamatergic neuron excitability, and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the vCA1. Glutamatergic neuron activation and GluN2B overexpression alleviated THz wave-induced synaptic plasticity impairment; thus, neuromodulation could be a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of THz radiation.

AB  - Red blood cells of vertebrates have undergone evolutionary changes over time, leading to the diversification of morphological and mechanical properties of red blood cells (RBCs). Among the vertebrates, camelids have the most different RBC characteristics. As a result of adaptation to the desert environment, camelid RBCs can expand twice as much of their total volume in the case of rapid hydration yet are almost undeformable under mechanical stress. In this work, the mechanical and chemical differences in the RBC properties of the human and camelid species were examined using optical tweezers and Raman spectroscopy. We measured the deformability of camel and human RBCs at the single-cell level using optical tweezers. We found that the deformability index (DI) of the camel and the human RBCs were 0.024 0.019 and 0.215 & PLUSMN;0.061, respectively. To investigate the chemical properties of these cells, we measured the Raman spectra of the whole blood samples. The result of our study indicated that some of the Raman peaks observed on the camel's blood spectrum were absent in the human blood's spectrum, which further points to the difference in chemical contents of these two species' RBCs.

AB  - Macelignan, from Myristica fragrans (nutmeg), is a bioactive compound with various pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. The purpose of this work was to investigate the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects of macelignan in glutamate-treated HT22 mouse hippocampal neurons. Macelignan was extracted and identified in a methanol extract of M. fragrans seeds. The DPPH was used to assess the antioxidative activity of macelignan. Glutamate (5 mM) was used to induce neurotoxicity in the HT22 cells. Neuroprotective effects were measured using relevant biochemical and imaging assays, including cell viability, ROS production, nuclear staining, apoptotic cell death, and protein expression. Macelignan markedly and concentration-dependently enhanced DPPH radical scavenging activity. In the HT22 cell model, glutamate induced cell damage by decreasing cell viability, promoting ROS generation, and increasing apoptotic cell death according to cell morphological changes. However, macelignan treatment restored cell viability, inhibited ROS generation concentration-dependently, and reduced apoptosis. Moreover, glutamate significantly up-regulated the phosphorylation of MAPK-pathway-related proteins, which was reversed by macelignan treatment. In conclusion, macelignan shows notable neuroprotective effects on oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death in glutamate-induced cells, and this study provides useful information on its potential therapeutic implications in neurological disorders.

AB  - Oocyte cryopreservation has become an important component of assisted reproductive technology with increasing implication in female fertility preservation and animal reproduction. However, the possible adverse effects of oocyte cryopreservation on epigenetic status of the resulting embryos is still an open question. This study evaluated the effects of MII-oocyte vitrification on gene transcripts linked to epigenetic reprogramming in association with the developmental competence and epigenetic status of the resulting embryos at 2-cell and blastocyst stages in dromedary camel. The cleavage rate of vitrified oocytes following intracytoplasmic sperm injection was significantly increased compared with the control (98.2 +/- 2 vs. 72.7 +/- 4.1%, respectively), possibly due to the higher susceptibility of vitrified oocytes to spontaneous activation. Nonetheless, the competence of cleaved embryos derived from vitrified oocytes for development to the blastocyst and hatched blastocyst was significantly reduced compared with the control (7.7 +/- 1.2 and 11.1 +/- 11.1 compared with 28.1 +/- 2.6 and 52.4 +/- 9.9%, respectively). The relative transcript abundances of epigenetic reprogramming genes DNMT1, DNMT3B, HDAC1, and SUV39H1 were all significantly reduced in vitrified oocytes relative to the control. Evaluation of the epigenetic marks showed significant reductions in the levels of DNA methylation (6.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 9.9 +/- 0.5, respectively) and H3K9 acetylation (7.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 10.7 +/- 0.3, respectively) in 2-cell embryos in the vitrification group relative to the control. Development to the blastocyst stage partially adjusted the effects that oocyte vitrification had on the epigenetic status of embryos (DNA methylation: 4.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 0.6; H3K9 acetylation: 5.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 8 +/- 0.9, respectively). To conclude, oocyte vitrification may interfere with the critical stages of epigenetic reprogramming during preimplantation embryo development.

AB  - Simple Summary The well-being and welfare of animals on farms is a topic of interest to many people. On the island of Ireland, this issue has received increased attention because of political and governance changes, including Brexit and COVID-19. Policy-makers and industry are considering labelling schemes to inform the food consumer about welfare standards on farms. Focus groups and an online survey were carried out with members of the public on the island of Ireland to explore their awareness, perceptions, and attitudes toward farm animal welfare standards on farms in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Most consumers believed farm animal welfare standards were high, although different farming sectors were rated differently: beef and dairy farms were viewed more positively, and pig and poultry farms were viewed less positively. The living conditions of the animal, size and intensity of the farm, national standards and schemes, and visibility all influenced perceptions of welfare standards. The public also expressed a lack of knowledge and information on the topic. In developing new policies and labelling schemes, it is important to be apprised of the current awareness, attitudes, and perceptions that the public has regarding farm animal welfare standards, as identified in the current paper. There has been increased public interest and concerns in issues such as farm animal welfare (FAW) on the island of Ireland, stoked in part by political and governance changes, such as Brexit and COVID-19. Front-of-pack food labelling represents a primary information channel for many people. In advance of considering formalised food labelling schemes, specifically relating to FAW, it is important to ensure an up-to-date understanding of current consumer perceptions of FAW. With this aim, the current study utilised a mixed methodology. Nine focus group discussions (n = 41) and an online survey (n = 972) with food consumers in Ireland and Northern Ireland explored perceptions of FAW. Results suggest that overall perceptions of FAW are high, and consumers perceive FAW to have improved in the last decade. Quantitative (ANOVA) and qualitative results show variations in perception of FAW between sectors. Results from the focus group discussions identified factors underlying consumers' perception of FAW: the living conditions of the animal, size and intensity of the farm, national standards and schemes, and visibility. Information insufficiencies and knowledge gaps were identified. The findings are discussed in relation to policy implications for the role of public engagement, front-of-pack welfare labelling, and quality assurance schemes.

AB  - Background: The cortisol awakening response (CAR) is a pivotal component of the body's stress response, yet its dynamics under repeated acute stress and its interplay with immune biomarkers remain inadequately understood. Methods: This study examined 80 second-year military medical students undergoing a 5-day intensive surgical simulation designed to elicit stress responses. Salivary samples were collected daily upon waking and 30 min thereafter to measure cortisol and a panel of cytokines using bead-based multiplex ELISA. Results: Analysis revealed a significant blunting of the CAR on the third day of training (p = 0.00006), followed by a recovery on the fourth day (p = 0.0005). Concurrently, specific cytokines such as CXCL1 (r = 0.2, p = 0.0005), IL-6 (r = 0.13, p = 0.02), IL-10 (r = 0.14, p = 0.02), and VEGF-A (r = 0.17, p = 0.003) displayed patterns correlating with the CAR, with increased strength of associations observed when assessing cytokine levels against the CAR of the preceding day (CXCL1 r = 0.41, p = 0.0002. IL-6 r = 0.38, p = 0.0006. IL-10 r = 0.3, p = 0.008. VEGF-A r = 0.41, p = 0.0002). Conclusions: These results suggest a temporal relationship between stress-induced cortisol dynamics and immune regulation. The CAR pattern demonstrated in this study may represent induction of and recovery from psychological burnout. Moreover, the observed cytokine associations provide insight into the mechanisms by which stress can influence immune function. The results may have broader implications for managing stress in high-performance environments, such as military and medical professions, and for identifying individuals at risk of stress-related immune suppression.

AB  - Cigarette smoke withdrawal can cause anxiety-like behavior and modulate neurotransmitter-related proteins in the brain. We examined the effects of cigarette smoke with and without aspirin treatment on the concentrations of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, glutamine, and GABA in the amygdala and hippocampus. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four different groups: (1) control group exposed only to standard room air, (2) cigarette smoke exposed group treated with saline vehicle, (3) cigarette smoke exposed group treated with aspirin (30 mg/kg), and (4) control group treated only with aspirin (30 mg/kg). Cigarette smoke exposure was performed for 2 h/day, 5 days/week, for 31 days. Behavioral testing was carried out weekly, 24 h after cigarette smoke exposure, during acute withdrawal. At the end of week 4, rats were given either distilled water (1 mL) or aspirin 45 min before cigarette exposure for 11 days. Dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, glutamine, and GABA were extracted from both the amygdala and hippocampus and were separated and quantified using a developed and validated HPLC-MS/MS method. Cigarette smoke withdrawal induced anxiety behaviors, and aspirin treatment reduced this effect. Cigarette smoke exposure increased tissue content of dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, glutamine, and GABA, and aspirin treatment reversed this effect. Cigarette smoke caused an increase in tissue content of several neurotransmitters as well as anxiety-like behavior, and these effects were normalized by aspirin treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary Birds have excellent visual-spatial associative learning abilities and heavily rely on them for navigation, homing, and foraging. In birds, the hippocampus (Hp) and nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) play critical roles in this cognitive process. To enhance our understanding of how bird Hp and NCL cooperate to support visual-spatial associative learning, we examined the neural activities of the Hp and NCL of pigeons and explored their interaction dynamics during the learning process. We found that pigeons' behavioral changes during learning are accompanied by modifications in their interaction patterns in the Hp-NCL network. The enhanced theta-band synchronization between the Hp and NCL, as well as the dynamics of Hp-NCL interaction, provides insight into the potential mechanism of the Hp-NCL network during spatial associative learning.Abstract Learning the spatial location associated with visual cues in the environment is crucial for survival. This ability is supported by a distributed interactive network. However, it is not fully understood how the most important task-related brain areas in birds, the hippocampus (Hp) and the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), interact in visual-spatial associative learning. To investigate the mechanisms of such coordination, synchrony and causal analysis were applied to the local field potentials of the Hp and NCL of pigeons while performing a visual-spatial associative learning task. The results showed that, over the course of learning, theta-band (4-12 Hz) oscillations in the Hp and NCL became strongly synchronized before the pigeons entered the critical choice platform for turning, with the information flowing preferentially from the Hp to the NCL. The learning process was primarily associated with the increased Hp-NCL interaction of theta rhythm. Meanwhile, the enhanced theta-band Hp-NCL interaction predicted the correct choice, supporting the pigeons' use of visual cues to guide navigation. These findings provide insight into the dynamics of Hp-NCL interaction during visual-spatial associative learning, serving to reveal the mechanisms of Hp and NCL coordination during the encoding and retrieval of visual-spatial associative memory.

AB  - Tea leaves contain an extraordinarily high level of flavonoids that contribute to tea health benefits and flavor characteristics, but the regulatory mechanism of ambient ultraviolet B (UV-B) on tea flavonoid enrichment remains unclear. Here, we report that ambient UV-B modulates tea quality by inducing a metabolic flux in flavonoid biosynthesis. UV-B absence decreased bitter- and astringent-tasting flavonol glycosides (kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, myricetin-3-O-glucoside, and quercetin-7-O-glucoside) but increased non-galloylated catechins. Conversely, supplementary UV-B increased flavonols and decreased catechins in tea leaves. These responses were achieved via CsHYS, which mediates the UV-B-induced MYB12 activation and binds to the promoters of flavonoid biosynthetic genes (CsFLS, CsLARa, and CsDFRa), leading to flavonoid changes. Transcriptomic data indicated that UV-B-induced tea flavonoid regulation is responsive to multiple biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. These findings improve our understanding of light-regulated tea astringency and bitterness underlying shading effects and seasonal light changes and provide novel insights into tea cultivation management and processing.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of genetic selection in livestock has allowed farmers to enhance the sustainability of their operations by producing animals that require fewer inputs relative to animal outputs. In swine, geneticists have selected for sows that farrow larger litters, which has reduced the feed required per piglet produced. Yet challenges remain with piglet survival from birth to weaning. Utilizing genetic selection to increase the sow teat number may be a strategy to enhance piglet nutrient access and therefore piglet survival. More publicly available data are needed to confirm associations between sow teat traits and piglet weaning traits. Hence, the current study explores the genetic relationships among sow teat traits at farrowing with the number of piglets at weaning and identifies strategies to enhance piglet survival and sustainable pig production. The results suggest geneticists should incorporate the number of functional teats a sow has at farrowing into genetic selection programs to improve piglet survival and animal well-being. The objective was to evaluate the genetics of sow teat and mammary traits at farrowing and at weaning. Data were recorded on 3099 Landrace x Large White F1 sows. Underline traits included the total teat number (TT), the functional teat number (FT), the non-functional teat number (NFT), the damaged teat number (DT), and the number of functional mammary glands (FMG). Variance components were estimated using AIREMLF90. Means for TT, FT, and NFT at farrowing were 14.93, 13.90, and 1.03, respectively. Heritability estimates for TT, FT, and NFT ranged from 0.18 to 0.37, 0.16 to 0.28, and 0.14 to 0.18, respectively. Estimates of heritability for DT and FMG at weaning were 0.03 and 0.06, respectively. Estimated genetic correlations between FT with TT and NFT were 0.68 to 0.78 and -0.19 to -0.57, respectively. Genetic correlation estimates between TT, FT, and NFT with the number weaned were 0.25, 0.50, and -0.38, respectively. An increase of one TT and FT enhanced (p < 0.05) the number weaned by 0.14 to 0.16 and 0.18 to 0.27 piglets, respectively. The results suggest that genetically increasing the number of functional teats on a sow at farrowing would improve the number of piglets at weaning.

AB  - Inflammation is an integral component of cardiovascular disease and is thought to contribute to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. While ischemia-induced inflammation has been extensively studied in the heart, relatively less is known regarding cardiac inflammation during non-ischemic stress. Recent work has implicated a role for Yes-associated protein (YAP) in modulating inflammation in response to ischemic injury; however, whether YAP influences inflammation in the heart during non-ischemic stress is not described. We hypothesized that YAP mediates a pro-inflammatory response during pressure overload (PO)-induced non-ischemic injury, and that targeted YAP inhibition in the myeloid compartment is cardioprotective. In mice, PO elicited myeloid YAP activation, and myeloid-specific YAP knockout mice (YAPF/F;LysMCre) subjected to PO stress had better systolic function, and attenuated pathological remodeling compared to control mice. Inflammatory indicators were also significantly attenuated, while pro-resolving genes including Vegfa were enhanced, in the myocardium, and in isolated macrophages, of myeloid YAP KO mice after PO. Experiments using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from YAP KO and control mice demonstrated that YAP suppression shifted polarization toward a resolving phenotype. We also observed attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome priming and function in YAP deficient BMDMs, as well as in myeloid YAP KO hearts following PO, indicating disruption of inflammasome induction. Finally, we leveraged nanoparticle-mediated delivery of the YAP inhibitor verteporfin and observed attenuated PO-induced pathological remodeling compared to DMSO nanoparticle control treatment. These data implicate myeloid YAP as an important molecular nodal point that facilitates cardiac inflammation and fibrosis during PO stress and suggest that selective inhibition of YAP may prove a novel therapeutic target in non-ischemic heart disease.

AB  - Lactation is a crucial phase of brain development, and the events and nutrients during this period have long-term consequences for the occurrence of depression. This study investigated the effect and mechanism of lactoferrin (LF) deficiency during lactation on depression in adulthood. Lactation LF-deficient mice were established by nursing wild-type mice using LF systemic knockout mother mice. Additionally, 14-day-old mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress when they reached 6 weeks of age. The results show that lactation lactoferrin deficiency increases depression-like behavior in adult mice, and the mechanism is associated with heightened neuronal damage, abnormal microglial activation, and decreased BDNF in the hippocampus. In contrast, recombinant human lactoferrin promotes neuronal proliferation by upregulating ERK 1 and 2 phosphorylation and attenuates LPS-induced neuronal injury and microglial activation by inhibiting the activation of Toll-like receptor 4-nuclear factor-kappa B pathway in vitro. Our findings suggest that lactoferrin intake during lactation protects neurons by regulating microglial activation, thereby effectively reducing depressive symptoms in adults.

AB  - Simple Summary Human-animal interactions are an important focus of modern animal welfare research. A subset of this interest includes animal-visitor interactions that occur in zoos. One understudied aspect of animal-visitor interactions involves public feedings, where visitors can directly feed the zoo animals. We examined the effects of public feedings compared with nonpublic feed days on the general activity of three zoo-housed elephants. In addition, we examined the general activity of the elephants in the months prior to public feedings, as well as their general activity on public feed days before, during, and after a public feeding. Public feedings were effective at increasing social activity and decreasing stereotypies for two of the elephants when compared with nonpublic feed days. Additionally, all three elephants showed increased foraging and decreased inactivity following a public feeding. Our results suggest that public feedings can be an effective form of environmental enrichment for zoo-housed elephants. The past few decades have seen increased interest in studies examining the welfare of elephants and animal-visitor interactions. One understudied area for both pursuits is the impact of public feeding interactions. Our study examined the effects of public feedings on the general activity of three zoo-housed elephants. Prior to public feedings, we developed and assessed a 21-behavior ethogram split into six classes of behavior. Comparisons between the elephants demonstrated that only one of the elephants engaged in stereotypies with regularity (>30%), and that the stereotypies occurred in place of most foraging. During public feedings, we compared the general activity of each elephant independently and across both public feeding and nonpublic feeding days, as well as the general activity before, during, and after a public feeding. Public feedings increased social activity and decreased stereotypies when compared with nonpublic feeding days for two of the elephants. In addition, all three elephants showed increased foraging and decreased inactivity in the period after a public feeding session. These results demonstrate that public feedings can be a useful tool for enriching the welfare of zoo-housed elephants and are among the first sets of data to demonstrate positive welfare outcomes associated with public feedings.

AB  - The unique ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has endowed Chinese sea buckthorn leaves with rich bioactivities. In this study, we investigated the bioactivity and stress resistance mechanisms of flavonoids derived from Chinese sea buckthorn leaves (FCL) native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our analysis identified a total of 57 flavonoids, mainly flavonol glycosides, from FCL, of which 6 were novel flavonoids. Isorhamnetin glycosides, quercetin glycosides and kaempferol glycosides were the three most dominant classes of compounds in FCL. In particular, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside emerged as the most abundant compound. Our results showed that FCL possesses potent antioxidant properties, as evidenced by its ability to effectively scavenge DPPH free radicals and demonstrate ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) levels comparable to Trolox, a well-known antioxidant standard. Furthermore, FCL showed remarkable efficacy in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while enhancing the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), in Caenorhabditis elegans, a widely used model organism. Mechanistically, we elucidated that FCL exerts its stress resistance effects by modulating of transcription factors DAF-16 and HSF-1 within the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway (IIS). Activation of these transcription factors orchestrates the expression of downstream target genes including sod-3, ctl-1, hsp16.2, and hsp12.6, thus enhancing the organism's ability to cope with stressors. Overall, our study highlights the rich reservoir of flavonoids in Chinese sea buckthorn leaves as promising candidates for natural medicines, due to their robust antioxidant properties and ability to enhance stress resistance.

AB  - The invasion of the fall armyworm poses substantial threats to local agricultural safety, including the sugarcane industry. Exploring the insect-resistance mechanism is crucial for breeding resistant varieties. This study selected three representative materials from the Saccharum genus-Saccharum officinarum L. (Badila), S. spp. hybrid (GT58), and Saccharum spontaneum (SES208), to investigate feeding preferences and developmental fitness of Spodoptera frugiperda. Larvae exhibited a strong preference and highest fitness parameters in Badila leaves compared to SES208. Additionally, proteomic analyses of larval saliva from insects feeding on Badila and SES208 were carried out to test the types and abundance of proteins on different hosts. Furthermore, we identified fatty acid-binding protein 1-like activates plant defense responses, while aldehyde dehydrogenase negatively suppressed plant defense response. Our findings suggest that the plasticity of salivary proteins induced by different host plants, and also offer new insights into the molecular interactions between S. frugiperda and plants.

AB  - Antioxidative, antidiabetic, and hypolipidemic properties of probiotic-enriched fermented camel milk (FCM) combined with Salvia officinalis L. leaves hydroalcoholic extract (SOHE) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats were investigated. Phytochemicals analysis and antioxidant capacity indicated that S. officinalis contained high phenolics with super antioxidant activity. Subsequently, HPLC analysis demonstrated 13 phenolic acids and 14 flavonoids in considerable amounts with ferulic acid and resveratrol as predominant, respectively. The antidiabetic and hypolipidemic properties of FCM and SOHE were examined in a designed animal model consisting of seven treated groups for four weeks. There was a negative group (G1); the positive group (G2) received a single dose (50 mg kg(-1)) of streptozotocin (STZ) by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.); in G3, diabetic rats (DRs) orally received 5 mL FCM kg(-1) daily; in G4, DRs orally received 50 mg GAE SOHE kg(-1) daily; in G5, DRs orally received 5 mL FCM contains 25 mg GAE SOHE kg(-1) daily; in G6, DRs orally received 5 mL FCM contains 50 mg GAE SOHE kg(-1) daily; in G7, DRs orally received 50 mg metformin kg(-1) daily. Combining FCM with SOHE at 25 or 50 mg kg(-1) exhibited a synergistic effect in significantly lowering random blood glucose (RBG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and improved weight gain recovery %. The hypolipidemic effect of FCM + 50 mg GAE SOHE kg(-1) was significantly higher than using FCM or SOHE individually, and attenuation in triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (CHO), and high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL), and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) was remarked. Combining FCM with SOHE at 25 or 50 mg kg(-1) ameliorated liver and kidney functions better than individual uses of FCM, SOHE, or metformin. Interestingly, FCM with 50 mg SOHE kg(-1) presented significant improvement in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a substantial reduction in malonaldehyde (MDA) levels with 53.75%, 89.93%, 63.06%, and 58.69% when compared to the STZ group (G2), respectively. Histopathologically, administrating FCM + 25, 50 mg SOHE kg(-1) or 50 mg kg(-1) metformin showed a normal histological structure of both islets of Langerhans cells and acini. In conclusion, combining FCM with SOHE presented synergistic and therapeutical efficacy. It could be beneficial and profitable for controlling diabetes mellitus complications and protecting against oxidative stress.

AB  - Seed predation by insect herbivores reduces crop productionworldwide.Foraging on seeds at pre-dispersal generally means that females needto find the suitable host plant within a relatively short timeframein order to synchronize larval development with seed production. Themechanistic understanding of host finding by seed pests can be harnessedfor more sustainable pest management strategies. We here studied thechemical communication between the bean bug Riptortuspedestris, a major pest of legumes, and several cropspecies and cultivars in the Fabaceae. Via a comparative chemicalanalysis, we found that 1-octen-3-ol is the principal constituentof the floral scents of most species tested in the subfamily Faboideae,including soybean and faba bean. With field trapping and laboratorybioassays, including electroantennography, we further revealed thatthis compound can be perceived, and stimulate attraction responses,by R. pedestris nymphs and adults.The addition of 1-octen-3-ol to pheromone traps might therefore improvetrapping efficacy for controlling populations of this important granivorepest on legumes.

AB  - The use of medicinal plants, particularly in the treatment of sexually transmitted and related infections, is ancient. These plants may well be used as alternative and complementary medicine to a variety of antibiotics that may possess limitations mainly due to an emerging enormous antimicrobial resistance. Several computerized database literature sources such as ScienceDirect, Scopus, Scielo, PubMed, and Google Scholar were used to retrieve information on Fabaceae species used in the treatment and management of sexually transmitted and related infections in South Africa. The other information was sourced from various academic dissertations, theses, and botanical books. A total of 42 medicinal plant species belonging to the Fabaceae family, used in the treatment of sexually transmitted and related opportunistic infections associated with HIV-AIDS, have been documented. Trees were the most reported life form, yielding 47.62%, while Senna and Vachellia were the frequently cited genera yielding six and three species, respectively. Peltophorum africanum Sond. was the most preferred medicinal plant, yielding a frequency of citation of 14, while Vachellia karoo (Hayne) Banfi and Glasso as well as Elephantorrhiza burkei Benth. yielded 12 citations each. The most frequently used plant parts were roots, yielding 57.14%, while most of the plant species were administered orally after boiling (51.16%) until the infection subsided. Amazingly, many of the medicinal plant species are recommended for use to treat impotence (29.87%), while most common STI infections such as chlamydia (7.79%), gonorrhea (6.49%), syphilis (5.19%), genital warts (2.60%), and many other unidentified STIs that may include "Makgoma" and "Divhu" were less cited. Although there are widespread data on the in vitro evidence of the use of the Fabaceae species in the treatment of sexually transmitted and related infections, there is a need to explore the in vivo studies to further ascertain the use of species as a possible complementary and alternative medicine to the currently used antibiotics in both developing and underdeveloped countries. Furthermore, the toxicological profiles of many of these studies need to be further explored. The safety and efficacy of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products developed using these species also need to be explored.Dataset: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/plants11233241/s1Dataset License: Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a hazardous element that may jeopardize environmental safety and human health through biotransfer and trophic accumulation. Here, we tested Cd toxicity on cotton plants, cotton bollworms, and their responses. Results demonstrated that Cd accumulated in plant roots, aerial parts, insect larvae, pupae, and frass in a dose-dependent pattern. The similar to 9.35 mg kg(-1) of Cd in plant aerial parts, similar to 3.68 in larvae, similar to 6.43 in pupae, and high transfer coefficient (similar to 5.59) indicate significant mobility. The similar to 19.61 mg kg(-1) of Cd in larvae frass suggests an effective detoxification strategy, while BAF(cotton) (similar to 1.14) and BAF(worm) (similar to 0.54) indicated low bioaccumulation. Cadmium exposure resulted in compromised plant growth and yield as well as alterations in photosynthetic pigment contents, antioxidant enzyme activities, and certain life history traits of cotton bollworms. Furthermore, carboxylesterase activity and encapsulation rates of insect larvae decreased with increasing Cd concentrations, whereas acetylcholinesterase, phenol oxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and multifunctional oxidase exhibited hormesis responses.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) play an important role in insect resistance. As a common HIPV in tea plants (Camellia sinensis), beta-ocimene has shown anti-insect function in other plants. However, whether beta-ocimene in tea plants also provides insect resistance, and its mechanism of synthesis and emission are unknown. In this study, beta-ocimene was confirmed to interfere with tea geometrid growth via signaling. Light was identified as the key factor controlling regular emission of beta-ocimene induced by the wounding from tea geometrids. beta-Ocimene synthase (CsBOS1) was located in plastids and catalyzed beta-ocimene formation in overexpressed tobacco. CsBOS1 expression in tea leaves attacked by tea geometrids showed a day-low and night-high variation pattern, while CsABCG expression involved in volatile emission showed the opposite pattern. These two genes might regulate the regular beta-ocimene emission from tea plants induced by tea geometrid attack. This study advances the understanding on HIPV emission and signaling in tea plants.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have emerged as a promising target for the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. Studies have shown that both PPAR alpha & gamma individually modulate various pathophysiological events like neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, which are known to variedly affect neurogenesis. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of saroglitazar (SGZR), a dual PPAR agonist, on adult neurogenesis and spatial learning and memory, in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV STZ)-induced dementia in rats. We have found that SGZR at the dose of 4 mg/kg per oral showed significant improvement in learning and memory compared to ICV STZ-treated rats. A substantial increase in neurogenesis was observed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG), as indicated by an increase in the number of 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+ cells, BrdU+ nestin+ cells, and doublecortin (DCX)+cells. Treatment with SGZR also decreased the active form of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) and hence enhanced the nuclear translocation of the beta-catenin. Enhanced expression of Wnt transcription factors and target genes indicates that the up-regulation of Wnt signaling might be involved in the observed increase in neurogenesis. Hence, it can be concluded that the SGZR enhances memory functions and adult neurogenesis via the upregulation of Wnt beta-catenin signaling in ICV STZ-treated rats.

AB  - Certain bat species (family Rhinolophidae) dynamically deform their emission baffles (noseleaves) and reception baffles (pinnae) during echolocation. Prior research using numerical models, laboratory characterizations, and experiments with simple targets have suggested that this dynamics may manifest itself in time-variant echo signatures. Since the pronounced random nature of echoes from natural targets such as foliage has not been reflected in these experiments, we have collected a large number (>55 000) of foliage echoes outdoors with a sonar head that mimics the dynamic periphery in bats. The echo data was processed with a custom auditory processing model to create spike-based echo representations. Deep-learning classifiers were able to estimate the dynamic state of the periphery, i.e., static or dynamic, based on single echoes with accuracies of up to 80%. This suggests that the effects of the peripheral dynamics are present in the bat brains and could hence be used by the animals. The best classification performances were obtained for data obtained within a spatially confined area. Hence, if the bat brains suffer from the same generalization issues, they would have to have a way to adapt their neural echo processing to such local fluctuations to exploit the dynamic effects successfully.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an growing public health concern associated with high mortality rates. The occurrences of vascular calcification (VC) increase concordantly with the progression of CKD.With CKD, hyperphosphatemia promotes intermediate VC, a process that is further facilitated by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) initiating osteogenic transdifferentiation. The purpose of this study was to determine the involvement of CKAP4 in VC progression. Clinical investigations demonstrate that elevated blood CKAP4 and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) levels are related with CKD in individuals. As an in vitro model, mouse VSMCs were extracted and treated with high levels of phosphates (2.5 mmol/L Pi). We also created an in vivo mice model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrophrectomies and a high-protein diet (High Pi diet). The expression of CKAP4 and MMP2 in both in vitro and in vivo models was significantly higher in VSMCs and calcified aorta in both models. Additionally, in vitro tests indicated that CKAP4 modulates YAP phosphorylation. Simultaneous silencing of CKAP4 and calcium content assay revealed a significant reduction in the VSMCs and calcium content of the aorta. Alizarin red staining and calcium content assay reveled that silencing of CKAP4 reduced the VSMCs and aortic calcification, accompanied with reduced expression of YAP and MMP2. Overall, our study demonstrates for the first time that CKAP4 contributes to VC in CKD by modulating YAP phosphorylation and MMP2 expression.

AB  - Inhibition of RhoA-ROCK pathway is involved in the H2S-induced cerebral vasodilatation and H2S-mediated protection on endothelial cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation injury. However, the inhibitory mechanism of H2S on RhoA-ROCK pathway is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the target and mechanism of H2S in inhibition of RhoA/ROCK. GST-RhoA(wild) and GST-RhoA(S188A) proteins were constructed and expressed, and were used for phosphorylation assay in vitro. Recombinant RhoA(wild)-pEGFP-N1 and RhoA(S188A)-pEGFP-N1 plasmids were constructed and transfected into primary hippocampal nerve cells (HNCs) to evaluate the neuroprotective mechanism of endothelial H2S by using transwell co-culture system with endothelial cells from cystathionine-gamma-lyase knockout (CSE-/-) mice and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase knockout (3-MST-/-) rats, respectively. We found that NaHS, exogenous H2S donor, promoted RhoA phosphorylation at Ser188 in the presence of cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PKG1) in vitro. Besides, both exogenous and endothelial H2S facilitated the RhoA phosphorylation at Ser188 in HNCs, which induced the reduction of RhoA activity and membrane transposition, as well as ROCK2 activity and expression. To further investigate the role of endothelial H2S on RhoA phosphorylation, we detected H2S release from ECs of CSE+/+ and CSE-/- mice, and 3-MST+/+ and 3-MST-/- rats, respectively, and found that H2S produced by ECs in the culture medium is mainly catalyzed by CSE synthase. Moreover, we revealed that both endothelial H2S, mainly catalyzed by CSE, and exogenous H2S protected the HNCs against hypoxia-reoxygenation injury via phosphorylating RhoA at Ser188.

AB  - Elephant grass is indicated for silage production but requires additives to increase dry matter content because it reduces the production of effluents, potentially improves the fermentation pattern, and preserves the nutrients of the silage. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of including macauba cake in elephant grass ensilage on dry matter content, lactic acid bacteria population, lactic acid production, pH values, losses by gases and effluents, and dry matter recovery. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 3x6 factorial scheme, with three levels of inclusion of macauba cake (0, 10, and 20%) and six opening times (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 days after ensilage), with four repetitions. Macauba cake was an effective moisture-absorbing additive, increasing dry matter content, lactic acid bacteria population, and lactic acid content and reducing the pH. The losses by effluents and gases decreased, and dry matter recovery increased with the addition of this biodiesel co-product. The 20% level of inclusion of macauba cake in elephant grass ensilage allowed for better preserving the ensiled material.

T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by cognitive impairment. Recent investigations have highlighted the potential of nutritional interventions that target the gut-brain axis, such as probiotics and prebiotics, in forestalling the onset of AD. In this study, whole-genome sequencing was employed to identify xylan as the optimal carbon source for the tryptophan metabolism regulating probiotic Clostridium sporogenes (C. sporogenes). Subsequent in vivo studies demonstrated that administration of a synbiotic formulation comprising C. sporogenes (1 x 10(10) CFU per day) and xylan (1%, w/w) over a duration of 30 days markedly enhanced cognitive performance and spatial memory faculties in the 5xFAD transgenic AD mouse model. The synbiotic treatment significantly reduced amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. Importantly, synbiotic therapy substantially restored the synaptic ultrastructure in AD mice and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, the intervention escalated levels of the microbial metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and augmented the relative prevalence of IPA-synthesizing bacteria, Lachnospira and Clostridium, while reducing the dominant bacteria in AD, such as Aquabacterium, Corynebacterium, and Romboutsia. Notably, synbiotic treatment also prevented the disruption of gut barrier integrity. Correlation analysis indicated a strong positive association between gut microbiota-generated IPA levels and behavioral changes. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that synbiotic supplementation significantly improves cognitive and intellectual deficits in 5xFAD mice, which could be partly attributed to enhanced IPA production by gut microbiota. These findings provide a theoretical basis for considering synbiotic therapy as a novel microbiota-targeted approach for the treatment of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Non-invasive brain stimulation is promising for treating many neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. It could be optimized by understanding its intracranial responses in different brain regions. We implanted multi-site intracranial electrodes and systematically assessed the acute responses in these regions to transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at different frequencies. We observed robust neural oscillation changes in the hippocampus and amygdala in response to non-invasive tACS procedures, and these effects were frequency-specific and state-dependent. Notably, the hippocampus responded most strongly and stably to 10 Hz stimulation, with pronounced changes across a wide frequency range, suggesting the potential of 10 Hz oscillatory stimulation to modulate a broad range of neural activity related to cognitive functions. Future work with increased sample sizes is required to determine the clinical implications of these findings for therapeutic efficiency.

AB  - Early weaning of piglets was prone to increase reactive oxygen species, disrupt the redox balance, decrease antioxidant capacity, cause oxidative stress and intestinal oxidative damage, and lead to diarrhea in piglets. This research aimed to study dietary taurine (Tau) supplementation at a level relieving intestinal oxidative damage in early-weaned piglets. A total of 48 piglets were assigned to four groups of 12 individuals and fed a basal diet with 0.0% Tau (CON), 0.2% Tau (L-Tau), 0.3% Tau (M-Tau), or 0.4% Tau (H-Tau), respectively. The animal experiment lasted 30 days. The final weight, weight gain, average daily gain, and feed conversion rate increased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05; Quadratic p < 0.05), while the diarrhea index of piglets decreased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05). Serum malondialdehyde, nitric oxide (NO), D-lactose, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations decreased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05). The O-2 center dot- and center dot OH clearance rate in serum, liver, and jejunum mucosa increased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05). Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, and peroxidase (POD) activity and total antioxidant capacity increased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05). The serum glutathione (GSH) concentration and the ratio of GSH to GSSG increased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05). The POD and glutathione synthase activity in the liver and jejunum mucosa increased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05). The mRNA abundances of HO-1 and GPX1 in the H-Tau group were higher than that in the L-Tau, M-Tau, and CON groups (p < 0.05). The mRNA abundances of SOD1 and Nrf2 in the M-Tau and H-Tau groups were higher than in the L-Tau and CON groups (p < 0.05). The mRNA abundance of SOD2 in the L-Tau, M-Tau, and H-Tau groups was higher than in the CON group (p < 0.05). The VH and the ratio of VH to CD of jejunum and ileum increased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05). The mRNA abundances of occludens 1 and claudin 1 in the H-Tau group were higher than that in the CON, L-Tau, and M-Tau (p < 0.05). The mRNA abundance of occludin in the L-Tau, M-Tau, and H-Tau groups was higher than that in CON (p < 0.05). The abundance of Firmicutes increased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05), while Proteobacteria and Spirochaetota decreased with the increase in dietary Tau (Linear, p < 0.05). Collectively, dietary supplementation of 0.3% and 0.4% Tau in feed could significantly improve the growth performance and enhance the antioxidant capacity of piglets.

AB  - The Weather Prediction Task (WPT) can be solved by adults using several strategies dependent on different memory systems. One developmental study reported that 8-12-year-old children can solve WPT-like tasks but, because of inadequate analyses, the cognitive processes involved in solving the task have not been established. The present study aimed to determine at what age children can first solve the WPT and identify the strategies used by children of different ages. We tested 3-12-year-old typically developing children and 20-30-year-old adults on a modified WPT. We performed detailed analyses of performance for each pattern of cue-outcome associations to decipher the strategies used by participants. None of the 3-5.5-year-old children solved the task. About one third of 5.5-7.5-year-old children performed above chance, relying only on the two most predictive cues. In contrast, about 80% of 7.5-12-year-old children performed above chance, relying on a conditional hierarchical strategy. Similar to 20-30-year-old adults, 7.5-12-year-old children considered the highly predictive cues primarily and the less predictive cues secondarily. These findings indicate that the learning strategies used to solve the WPT evolve from middle to late childhood and reflect an increasing ability to use a conditional strategy concomitant with the development of the hippocampus-dependent memory system.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE), a continuous and self-sustaining epileptic seizure lasting more than 30 min, is a neurological emergency that can cause severe brain injuries and increase the risk for the development of epilepsy. Over the past few decades, accumulating evidence has suggested the importance of brain inflammation in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Honokiol (HNK), a pharmacological activator of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), is a bioactive compound extracted from the bark or leaves of Magnolia plants that possesses therapeutic benefits for preventing the development of inflammatory injury. However, the therapeutic effects of HNK against epileptic brain injury via regulating molecular mechanisms related to neuroinflammation remains elusive. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of HNK on pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PCSE) and the therapeutic benefits of HNK in regulating inflammatory processes in the hippocampus. Treatment with HNK before PCSE induction attenuated the initiation of behavioral seizures. Post-treatment with HNK after SE onset increased SIRT3 expression, which mitigated glial activation, including reactive astrocytes and activated microglia, in the hippocampus following PCSE. Moreover, HNK treatment reduced the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B/nucleotidebinding domain leucine-rich repeat with a pyrin-domain containing 3 inflammasome pathway, thereby inhibiting the production of interleukin-1 beta pro-inflammatory cytokine, subsequently alleviating PCSE-triggered apoptotic neuronal death in the hippocampus. These results indicate that HNK-induced SIRT3 upregulation has the potential to prevent the progression of epileptic neuropathology through its anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, the present study suggests that HNK is a natural therapeutic agent for epileptic brain injury.

AB  - Neuronal responses to similar stimuli change dynamically over time, raising the question of how internal representations can provide a stable substrate for neural coding. Recent work has suggested a large degree of drift in neural representations even in sensory cortices, which are believed to store stable representations of the external world. While the drift of these representations is mostly characterized in relation to external stimuli, the behavioural state of the animal (for instance, the level of arousal) is also known to strongly modulate the neural activity. We therefore asked how the variability of such modulatory mechanisms can contribute to representational changes. We analysed large-scale recording of neural activity from the Allen Brain Observatory, which was used before to document representational drift in the mouse visual cortex. We found that, within these datasets, behavioural variability significantly contributes to representational changes. This effect was broadcasted across various cortical areas in the mouse, including the primary visual cortex, higher order visual areas, and even regions not primarily linked to vision like hippocampus. Our computational modelling suggests that these results are consistent with independent modulation of neural activity by behaviour over slower timescales. Importantly, our analysis suggests that reliable but variable modulation of neural representations by behaviour can be misinterpreted as representational drift if neuronal representations are only characterized in the stimulus space and marginalized over behavioural parameters.

AB  - Cholinergic deficiency and neuroinflammation are the two main factors of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that water-soluble ginseng oligosaccharides (WGOS) derived from Panax ginseng roots can protect against scopolamine-induced impairments in learning and memory. However, the fundamental mechanisms remain unclear for the most part. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of WGOS on cholinergic function and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of mice. Mice were first pretreated with WGOS or saline, and then treated with scopolamine to establish an Alzheimer's disease model. The cognition memory of the mice was assessed through the behavioral test. The effect of WGOS on the cholinergic system was evaluated by measuring acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter concentration and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus. Using ELISA, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus were identified. This study found that WGOS treatment prevented the scopolamine-induced impairment of mice's recognition memory, as seen by their enhanced object recognition. In addition, WGOS prevented the scopolamine-induced decrease in ACh concentration and increase in AChE activity. Moreover, WGOS treatment inhibited scopolamine-induced upregulation of the inflammatory proteins IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. These findings suggest that the amelioration of scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice by WGOS was a consequence of the control of cholinergic function and inflammatory response in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that WGOS should be investigated as a dietary supplement or medication for the treatment of learning and memory disorders in humans.

AB  - Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe stroke subtype with limited therapeutic options. Programmed cell death (PCD) is crucial for immunological balance, and includes necroptosis, pyroptosis, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necrosis. However, the distinctions between these programmed cell death modalities after ICH remain to be further investigated. We used single-cell transcriptome (single-cell RNA sequencing) and spatial transcriptome (spatial RNA sequencing) techniques to investigate PCD-related gene expression trends in the rat brain following hemorrhagic stroke. Ferroptosis was the main PCD process after ICH, and primarily affected mature oligodendrocytes. Its onset occurred as early as 1 hour post-ICH, peaking at 24 hours post-ICH. Additionally, ferroptosis-related genes were distributed in the hippocampus and choroid plexus. We also elucidated a specific interaction between lipocalin-2 (LCN2)-positive microglia and oligodendrocytes that was mediated by the colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1)/CSF1 receptor pathway, leading to ferroptosis induction in oligodendrocytes and subsequent neurological deficits. In conclusion, our study highlights ferroptosis as the primary PCD mechanism, emerging as early as 1 hour post-ICH.

AB  - Experiencing early-life stress (ELS) plays a fundamental role in the development of mood disorders like depression in adulthood. Neuro-immune response in the brain is coupled with depressive-like behaviors following maternal separation (MS) stress. Indomethacin (IND) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. This study aimed to assess the antidepressant-like effect of IND in a mouse model of MS stress, focusing on its potential effect on neuro-inflammatory response in the hippocampus. To do this, male NMRI mice were treated with IND at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, saline (10 mL/kg) or fluoxetine (30 mg/kg). Drugs were injected intraperitoneally for 7 days. Behavioral tests including forced swimming test, splash test, and open field test were performed. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used for evaluation of gene expression of inflammatory mediators including of iNOS, TLR4, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in the hippocampus. Results showed that MS provoked depressive-like behavior in mice as observed by a decrease in the grooming activity time in the splash test and an increase in the immobility time in the forced swimming test. Depressive-like behaviors were coupled with neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. IND attenuated depressive-like behaviors as well as decreased the gene expression of neuroinflammation-related mediators in the hippocampus of MS mice. In conclusion, results showed that IND, at least in part, via alleviation of neuro-inflammatory response in the hippocampus, exerted antidepressant-like effects in a mouse model of MS stress.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Efficiently addressing human-large carnivore conflicts is a conservation issue of increasing relevance, especially in human-dominated landscapes where impact on rural economies generates negative attitudes towards large carnivores and their conservation. We quantified patterns of bear impact on farms and the costs of compensation from 2005 to 2015 in the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park (central Italy), an historical stronghold of the relict and highly imperiled Apennine brown bear population, where the park authority has been adopting conflict management approaches since the 1960s. Although the compensation program is rather costly (1490 +/- 589 euro/bear/year), the park policy has been increasingly integrated with prevention incentives, managing to effectively avert further increases in bear damages during the study period. Concurrently, local residents generally share a positive attitude towards bears, and the number of illegally killed bears decreased in the last decade. Despite this, our findings indicate there is still room for improvement in local conflict management, and that a more efficient use of conservation funds would benefit from increased monitoring, integrated prevention, conditional compensation, and participatory processes. Lessons learned from areas of historical coexistence between humans and large carnivores provide critical insights to design successful management strategies in areas of recent and future recolonisation by large carnivores.
   Human-carnivore conflicts are a major conservation issue. As bears are expanding their range in Europe's human-modified landscapes, it is increasingly important to understand, prevent, and address human-bear conflicts and evaluate mitigation strategies in areas of historical coexistence. Based on verified claims, we assessed costs, patterns, and drivers of bear damages in the relict Apennine brown bear population in the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park (PNALM), central Italy. During 2005-2015, 203 +/- 71 (SD) damage events were verified annually, equivalent to 75,987 +/- 30,038 euro/year paid for compensation. Most damages occurred in summer and fall, with livestock depredation, especially sheep and cattle calves, prevailing over other types of damages, with apiaries ranking second in costs of compensation. Transhumant livestock owners were less impacted than residential ones, and farms that adopted prevention measures loaned from the PNALM were less susceptible to bear damages. Livestock farms chronically damaged by bears represented 8 +/- 3% of those annually impacted, corresponding to 24 +/- 6% of compensation costs. Further improvements in the conflict mitigation policy adopted by the PNALM include integrated prevention, conditional compensation, and participatory processes. We discuss the implications of our study for Human-bear coexistence in broader contexts.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) induces significant neurobiological changes, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and behavioural impairments. This study was designed as a proof of concept to assess the potential for modulating the effects of SD through a short-term seven-day administration of Cornus mas (C. mas) in a rapid eye movement (REM) SD rodent paradigm. Adult male Wistar rats were randomised in four groups (n = 7): control, C. mas (CM), sleep deprivation (SD), and sleep deprivation with C. mas (SD + CM). Behaviourally, SD induced hyperactivity and hyperlocomotion. SD determined histological alterations in the prefrontal cortex and corpus callosum myelin coupled with ultrastructural mitochondrial and cellular abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and pineal gland. Despite evidence of systemic oxidative stress coupled with decreased serum GABA and BDNF following SD, no significant changes were observed in redox markers or inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta) within the prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. C. mas extract has shown an overall modest modulatory action, mainly evidenced on behavioural, histological, and ultrastructural parameters. Taken together, these findings highlight behavioural changes and region-specific molecular and structural abnormalities following prolonged REM SD in rats.

AB  - In this study, decolorized pectic polysaccharides (D-ACLP) with molecular weight (Mw) distribution of 3483- 2,023,656 Da were prepared from Amaranth caudatus leaves. Purified polysaccharides (P-ACLP) with the Mw of 152,955 Da were further isolated from D-ACLP through gel filtration. The structure of P-ACLP was analyzed by 1D and 2D NMR spectra. P-ACLP were identified as rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) containing dimeric arabinose side chains. The main chain of P-ACLP was composed of & RARR;4)-& alpha;-GalpA-(1 & RARR;, & RARR;2)-& beta;-Rhap-(1 & RARR;, & RARR;3)-& beta;-Galp-(1 & RARR; and & RARR;6)-& beta;-Galp-(1 & RARR;. There was a branched chain of & alpha;-Araf-(1 & RARR;2)-& alpha;-Araf-(1 & RARR; connected to the O-6 position of & RARR;3)-& beta;-Galp-(1 & RARR;. The GalpA residues were partially methyl esterified at O-6 and acetylated at O-3. The 28-day consecutive gavage of D-ALCP (400 mg/kg) significantly elevated the hippocampal glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels in rats. The concentrations of butyric acid and total short chain fatty acids in the cecum contents also increased significantly. Moreover, D-ACLP could significantly increase the gut microbiota diversity and dramatically up-regulated the abundance of Actinobacteriota (phylum) and unclassified Oscillospiraceae (genus) in intestinal bacteria. Taking together, D-ACLP might promote the hippocampal GLP-1 level through the beneficial regulation of butyric acid-producing bacteria in gut microbiota. This study contributed to making full use of Amaranth caudatus leaves for cognitive dysfunction intervention in food industry.

AB  - Extracellular adenosine plays prominent roles in the brain in both physiological and pathological conditions. Adenosine can be generated following the degradation of extracellular nucleotides by various types of ectonucleotidases. Several ectonucleotidases are present in the brain parenchyma: ecto-nucleotide triphosphate diphosphohydrolases 1 and 3 (NTPDase 1 and 3), ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (NPP 1), ecto-5'-nucleotidase (eN), and tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP, whose function in the brain has received little attention). Here we examined, in a living brain preparation, the role of these ectonucleotidases in generating extracellular adenosine. We recorded local field potentials evoked by electrical stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract in the mouse piriform cortex in vitro. Variations in adenosine level were evaluated by measuring changes in presynaptic inhibition generated by adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs) activation. A1R-mediated presynaptic inhibition was present endogenously and was enhanced by bath-applied AMP and ATP. We hypothesized that inhibiting ectonucleotidases would reduce extracellular adenosine concentration, which would result in a weakening of presynaptic inhibition. However, inhibiting TNAP had no effect in controlling endogenous adenosine action and no effect on presynaptic inhibition induced by bath-applied AMP. Furthermore, contrary to our expectation, inhibiting TNAP reinforced, rather than reduced, presynaptic inhibition induced by bath-applied ATP. Similarly, inhibition of NTPDase 1 and 3, NPP1, and eN induced stronger, rather than weaker, presynaptic inhibition, both in endogenous condition and with bath-applied ATP and AMP. Consequently, attempts to suppress the functions of extracellular adenosine by blocking its extracellular synthesis in living brain tissue could have functional impacts opposite to those anticipated.

AB  - Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a biodegradable polymer that has applications in several industries, such as textiles and paper manufacturing. Due to the water solubility, it is also a useful solvent in 3D dispensing to extrude printable solutions at a low temperature. However, its hydrophilicity is a drawback when considering the property of the end-use material if water contact is required. Using the water solubility of PVA as a benefit during 3D dispensing but avoiding the hydrophilicity in the printed material is tricky and unresolved. This study proposes a technique to achieve this phenomenon by taking advantage of the natural hydrophobicity of wool waste by using it as a filler in PVA. There is no previous knowledge on how wool could impact the water resistance characteristic of PVA. Three types of micro-sized wool powder (22.2-46.3 mm) were used and their impact on the wool/PVA (25/75) 3D composite properties was investigated. The wool powders reinforced in PVA were able to resist water drops from penetrating the surface for the full length of the experiment (10 min). Water solubility test also showed a greater resistance of the 3D composite samples due to the incorporation of wool powders. Though tensile strength and crystallinity of PVA were decreased by including the wool particles, powders prepared with finer wool showed minimum influence on this reduction. The rheology and thermal properties also suggested better compatibility in the wool/PVA system when finer wool was used. Overall results indicate that wool waste could be effectively utilised to naturally induce water-resistant performance in PVA composite. This finding could be beneficial not only in 3D dispensing, but also in many other areas, such as packaging, where the use of PVA is still limited due to its sensitivity to water.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the main problems in poultry production is to find more sustainable feed protein sources, other than the most widely used soya bean meal. An alternative protein source could be the underexploited oilseed crop camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz), which is mostly grown for biodiesel production, but is also characterized by disease and pest resistance, tolerance to cold weather, drought and low fertility soil. This review presents the nutritive value of camelina seeds, oil and cake (a by-product of biodiesel production), and their effect on the growth performance and fatty acid profile of muscles and liver in meat type poultry. The research results indicated that supplementation of poultry diets with camelina feedstuffs beneficially modified the fatty acid composition of meat and liver. The ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreased, whereas the content of alpha-linolenic and long-chain n-3 PUFA increased in poultry tissues. Camelina seed or seed processing derivatives, i.e., cake, are cheap alternative protein feed ingredients for meat type poultry. Camelina is an oilseed crop containing 36.8% oil in seeds, while in the cake the oil content accounts for 6.4-22.7%. If compared with other Brassicaceae family plants, camelina is distinguished by a unique fatty acid composition, because the content of alpha-linolenic fatty acid (C18:3n-3; ALA) varies from 25.9 to 36.7% of total fatty acids. The total tocopherol content in camelina oil and cake are, respectively, 751-900 and 687 mg/kg. Addition of camelina to poultry nutrition increases the amount of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in poultry meat and liver. The content of ALA in chicken muscles increases by 1.3-4.4, 2.4-2.9 and 2.3-7.2 times after supplementing chicken diets with, respectively, camelina cake (8-24%), seed (10%), and oil (2.5-6.9%) in comparison with the control group. Camelina cake (5-25%), seed (10%) and oil (2.5-4%) inclusion in chicken diets results in 1.5-3.9 times higher total n-3 PUFA content in muscles and liver. Meanwhile, supplementation of chicken diets with camelina oil (4-6.9%), seed (5-10%) and cake (5-25%) results in, respectively, a 1.8-8.4, 1.6-1.9 and 1.3-2.9 times lower n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in muscles, and 3.29 times lower n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in the liver. After inclusion of different amounts of camelina cake in chicken diets, a healthy for human nutrition n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio from 1.6 to 2.9 was found in chicken muscles.

AB  - Simple Summary
   One of the main concerns in aquaculture is the overreliance on wild-sourced fish oil as the main source of omega-3 fatty acids in diets for farmed fish. Microbes, such as Schizochytrium, naturally produce high levels of omega-3 fatty acids that could potentially replace fish oil in aquaculture feeds. In this study, we tested the oil from a new strain of Schizochytrium (T18) to replace fish oil in diets for farmed rainbow trout and looked at fish growth performance, muscle and liver fatty acid content, and the expression of transcripts involved in fat metabolism. Trout were raised for 8 weeks and fed diets with either: (1) fish oil control, (2) low inclusion of microbial oil, or (3) higher inclusion of microbial oil. Inclusion of Schizochytrium sp. (T18) oil at high or low levels in the diet resulted in a similar growth performance as seen in trout fed the control diet; however, muscle and liver fatty acid profiles were impacted by diet. Overall, our results showed that Schizochytrium (T18) is an effective source of omega-3 fatty acids in diets for rainbow trout.
   In this study, we evaluated whether oil extracted from the marine microbe, Schizochytrium sp. (strain T18), with high levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), could replace fish oil (FO) in diets for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Three experimental diets were tested: (1) a control diet with fish oil (FO diet), (2) a microbial oil (MO) diet with a blend of camelina oil (CO) referred to as MO/CO diet, and (3) a MO diet (at a higher inclusion level). Rainbow trout (18.8 +/- 2.9 g fish(-1) initial weight +/- SD) were fed for 8 weeks and evaluated for growth performance, fatty acid content and transcript expression of lipid-related genes in liver and muscle. There were no differences in growth performance measurements among treatments. In liver and muscle, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was highest in trout fed the FO diet compared to the MO/CO and MO diets. Liver DHA was highest in trout fed the MO/CO diet compared to the FO and MO diets. Muscle DHA was highest in trout fed the MO and MO/CO diets compared to the FO diet. In trout fed the MO/CO diet, compared to the MO diet, fadsd6b was higher in both liver and muscle. In trout fed the FO or MO/CO diets, compared to the MO diet, cox1a was higher in both liver and muscle, cpt1b1a was higher in liver and cpt1a1a, cpt1a1b and cpt1a2a were higher in muscle. Schizochytrium sp. (T18) oil was an effective source of DHA for rainbow trout.

AB  - Cervical cancer is one of the common types of cancer in women. Treatment regimens include use of chemotherapy but it leads to certain side effects thereby creating a need for safer therapeutic options. Ayurveda has a great potential to provide better treatment strategies. In this study, computational approaches have been employed to investigate the molecular mechanism of anti-cervical cancer Ayurvedic herbs. Initially, Ayurvedic plants possessing anti-cervical cancer activities were obtained from literature. Bioactive compounds present in such plants were evaluated for drug-likeliness, biological functions and associations with cancer-related pathways. This resulted in the most promising drug-like bioactive compounds which were found to target cancer pathways like microRNA and proteoglycans, Human papillomavirus infection. Anti-cervical cancer activity possessing herbs derived from the study include Camellia sinensis, Equisetum arvense, Rosmarinus officinalis. Major bioactive compounds extracted from the enlisted herbs that contribute in promoting anti-cervical cancer effects include allicin, apigenin, and mataresinol. Overall, our study has provided insights into the scientific mechanism behind anti-cervical cancer activities of the indigenous herbs of Ayurveda. In addition, this study has also highlighted key bioactive compounds which have a potential in targeting cancer related pathways and thus can further be utilized to devise better therapeutics to cure cervical cancer.

AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a significant zoonotic microorganism that causes a severe illness in both pigs and humans and is characterized by severe meningitis and septicemia. Suilysin (SLY), which is secreted by S. suis, plays a crucial role as a virulence factor in the disease. To date, the interaction between SLY and host cells is not fully understood. In this study, we identified the interacting proteins between SLY and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) using the TurboID-mediated proximity labeling method. 251 unique proteins were identified in TurboID-SLY treated group, of which six plasma membrane proteins including ARF6, GRK6, EPB41L5, DSC1, TJP2, and PNN were identified. We found that the proteins capable of interacting with SLY are ARF6 and PNN. Subsequent investigations revealed that ARF6 substantially increased the invasive ability of S. suis in HBMECs. Furthermore, ARF6 promoted SLY-induced the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in HBMECs. Moreover, ARF6 promoted the apoptosis in HBMECs through the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway induced by SLY. Finally, we confirmed that ARF6 could increase the virulence of SLY in C57BL/6 mice. These findings offer valuable insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of SLY.

AB  - Chronic wounds are a common and debilitating condition associated with aging populations that impact more than 6.5 million patients in the United States. We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of daily topical 1% valsartan in treating wounds in diabetic mouse and pig models. Despite these promising results, there remains a need to develop an extended-release formulation that would reduce patient burden by decreasing the frequency of daily applications. Here, we used nanotechnology to self-assemble valsartan amphiphiles into a filamentous structure (val-filaments) that would serve as a scaffold in wound beds and allow for steady, localised and tunable release of valsartan amphiphiles over 24 days. Two topical treatments of this peptide-based hydrogel on full-thickness wounds in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats resulted in faster rates of wound closure. By day 23, all val-filament treated wounds were completely closed, as compared to one wound closed in the placebo group. Mechanistically, we observed enrichment of proteins involved in cell adhesion and energetics pathways, downregulation of Tgf-beta signalling pathway mediators (pSmad2, pSmad3 and Smad4) and increased mitochondrial metabolic pathway intermediates. This study demonstrates the successful synthesis of a sustained-release valsartan filament hydrogel, its impact on mitochondrial energetics and efficacy in treating diabetic wounds.

AB  - Valproic acid (VPA) is a frequently prescribed treatment for many psychiatric disorders, particularly for epilepsy. However, it has been associated with possible side effects including hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. The present study investigated the protective effect of vinpocetine (Vinpo) against VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and hippocampal neurotoxicity in rats. Vinpo (5 and 10 mg/kg/day; p.o) was given for 14 days, with/without VPA (500 mg/kg/day; p.o) in adult male Wistar rats. VPA showed marked increase in hepatic and hippocampal MDA levels with increased liver function enzymes as well as a marked decline in serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Simultaneously, VPA administration resulted in a significant reduction in cAMP, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and PI3K/AKT protein levels in liver tissue and hippocampus. These results were confirmed by histological degenerative changes in both tissues. VPA also associated with increased hepatic and dentate gyrus nuclear factor kappa (NF-kappa B) immunoexpression with increased Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the dentate gyrus. Administration of Vinpo markedly attenuated VPA-induced toxicity in rats by its anti-oxidant effect on MDA and TAC levels. Vinpo resulted in a significant increase in the levels of cAMP/CREB and PI3K/AKT in liver and hippocampus tissues, together with significant decrease in NF-kappa B nuclear expression. Vinpo ameliorated astrogliosis as indicated by reduction in the expression of GFAP. Vinpo exerted a hepatoprotective and neuroprotective role against VPA-induced toxicity by cAMP and PI3K/AKT dependent activation of CREB and this hold a promise as a safe and effective adjuvant while treating psychiatric patients with VPA.

AB  - Objective The present experimental study aimed to evaluate the effect of consuming an obesogenic diet (OD) on serum and hippocampal inflammation and proteins related to energy metabolism, alongside, we evaluated how the same parameters responded to an OD withdrawal. Subjects Thirty male 60-days-old Wistar rats were used. Methods The control group (n = 10) was fed the control diet across the whole experiment. The remaining animals were fed a high-sugar/high-fat (HSHF) diet for 30 days (n = 20) and half of them were placed on the control diet for 48 h (n = 10) afterwards. Results OD intake decreased hippocampal AMPK phosphorylation, although, it did not increase serum inflammation and only increased hippocampal pNF kappa Bp65 levels without any increase in the cytokines assessed. Moreover, OD withdrawal led to higher inflammatory markers in the serum and hippocampus and higher hippocampal AMPK phosphorylation. The mediation models applied suggested that the effect of OD withdrawal on hippocampal inflammation was driven by serum inflammation, which activated the hippocampal IL10/AMPK anti-inflammatory pathway as a response. Conclusion Our analyses suggest that OD withdrawal increases serum inflammation with hippocampal consequent inflammatory alterations. Despite the general assumption that improving diet improves health, this may not be immediate.

AB  - Individuals affected by infantile spasms (IS), such as those carrying mutations in an IS-linked gene, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated gene 4-like (Nedd4-2), exhibit developmental delays and learning disabilities, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using conditional Nedd4-2 knockout mice, we uncover that Nedd4-2 functions to maintain the excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons and allows for late-phase long-term synaptic potentiation (L-LTP) at Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampus. We also find that Nedd4-2 is required for multiple forms of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Mechanistically, we show that loss of Nedd4-2 leads to a decrease in actin polymerization caused by reduced phosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing protein cofilin. A cell-permeable peptide promoting phosphorylation of endogenous cofilin in Nedd4-2 knockout neurons restores the number of hippocampal excitatory synapses and hippocampal L-LTP and partially restores hippocampus-dependent learning in mice. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism underlying IS-associated learning disabilities and may provide information for future therapeutic strategies for IS.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and acetylcholine depletion leading to neurobehavioral defects. AD was contributed also with downregulation of TGF-beta 1/SMAD2 and GSK3 beta/beta-catenin pathways. Simvastatin (SMV) improved memory function experimentally and clinically. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the mechanistic role of SMV against aluminium chloride (AlCl3) induced neurobehavioral impairments. AD was induced by AlCl3 (50 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Mice received Simvastatin (10 or 20 mg/kg) or Donepezil (3 mg/kg) for 6 weeks after that the histopathological, immunohistochemical and biochemical test were examined. Treatment with SMV improved the memory deterioration induced by AlCl3 with significant recovery of the histopathological changes. This was concomitant with the decrease of AChE and A beta((1-42)). SMV provides its neuroprotective effect through upregulating the protein expression of beta-catenin, TGF-beta 1 and downregulating the expression of GSK3 beta, TLR4 and p-SMAD2.

AB  - This study investigated the therapeutic effects of water extracts from Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger) and Cornus officinalis Siebold and Zucc. fruits (COF) water extracts on depression-like behavior and metabolic dysfunction in estrogen-deficient rats exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS). Network pharmacology analysis identified three bioactive compounds in ginger and four in COF, with 11 overlapping targets linked to both depression and metabolic pathways, primarily involving NR3C1, HTR2A, MAOA, and SLC6A4 genes associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation and neurotransmitter modulation. Ovariectomized rats received 200 mg/kg/day of ginger or COF extracts for 7 weeks, with a 4-week CMS protocol initiated at week 3. Both extracts significantly improved depression-like behaviors, memory performance, glucose tolerance, lipid profiles, and bone mineral density, normalized HPA axis markers (corticosterone and ACTH), and increased hippocampal serotonin and dopamine levels. Ginger demonstrated greater efficacy in improving memory and metabolic outcomes compared to COF. Molecular docking further validated these findings, revealing strong and stable interactions between key phytochemicals-such as hydroxygenkwanin and telocinobufagin-and target proteins MAOA, HTR2A, and NR3C1, supporting their mechanistic role in stress and mood regulation. These results support supplementing ginger and COF extracts as promising botanical interventions for estrogen-deficiency-related mood and metabolic disorders, with potential clinical application at a human-equivalent dose of 1.5 g/day.

AB  - Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been widely used in medicine such as imaging, drug delivery and therapeutics due to their multifunctional properties. Alterations in neuronal function may contribute to various neurological diseases. Transferrin plays a primary role in iron transportation and delivery and has recently been utilized for drug delivery to the brain. We have investigated effects of transferrin-conjugated GNPs (Tf-GNPs) on anxiety and locomotor behavior in vivo and also hippocampal neuronal activity ex vivo. Electrophysiological effects of Tf-GNP on hippocampal neurons were determined by patch clamp method. Fifteen male young adult C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups as control (200 mu L PBS), GNP (bare GNP; 2.2 mu g/g in PBS) and Tf-GNPs (2.2 mu g/g Tf-GNP). Animals intraperitoneally received the respective treatments for seven consecutive days and were subjected to elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field tests (OFT). Ex vivo, firing frequency of the neurons significantly increased by GNP treatment (p < 0.001). In vivo, animals in Tf-GNP group showed significantly longer distance in open arms but significantly lower number of entries to the open arms in EPM (p < 0.05). Mice received bare GNPs had significantly higher locomotor activity in OFT (p < 0.05), while Tf-GNP did not alter the locomotor activity significantly (p = 0.051). Animals in Tf-GNP group spent significantly longer time in the peripheral zone in OFT (p < 0.05). The present findings have shown that Tf-GNP induces anxiety-like behavior without altering spontaneous firing rate of hippocampal neurons. We suggest that neurobiological effects of Tf-GNP should be pre-determined before using in medical applications.

AB  - Lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) is an endogenous signaling molecule for the GPR55 receptor. Previous studies have shown that arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI-20:4) produced an increase in the inflammatory mediators NLPR3 (inflammasome-3 marker) and IL-1b in neurons from both rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and hippocampal cultures. Because LPI is comprised of a family of lipid structures that vary in fatty acyl composition, the current work examined neuroinflammatory responses to various LPI structures in DRG and hippocampal cultures as assessed by high-content fluorescent imaging. Major endogenous LPI fatty acyl structures consisting of 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, or 20:4 were compared for their effects on IL-1b, NLRP3, and GPR55 immunoreactive areas of neurites and cell bodies after a 6-h treatment. Among these four LPI structures, only LPI-20:4 treatment produced increases in immunoreactive areas for GPR55, NLRP3, and IL-1b in DRG and hippocampal neurites. In contrast, all other LPI structures tested produced a decrease in all of these inflammatory immunoreactive areas in both neurites and cell bodies. Additional studies with LPI-20:4 treatment indicated that IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-alpha were significantly increased in neurites of DRG and hippocampal cultures. However, oleoyl-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI-18:1) treatment produced decreases in these three cytokines. Using the viability dye Alamar blue, LPI-20:4 was shown to produce concentration-dependent decreases, whereas all other endogenous LPI structures produced increases with this assay. These studies indicate that fatty acyl structure is the major determinant of LPI for neuroinflammatory responses in DRG and hippocampal cultures, with LPI-20:4 showing pro-inflammatory effects and all other endogenous LPIs tested exhibiting anti-inflammatory responses.

AB  - Organophosphorus nerve agents represent a serious chemical threat due to their ease of production and scale of impact. The recent use of the nerve agent Novichok has re-emphasised the need for broad-spectrum medical countermeasures (MCMs) to these agents. However, current MCMs are limited. Plasma derived human butyrylcholinesterase (huBChE) is a promising novel bioscavenger MCM strategy, but is prohibitively expensive to isolate from human plasma at scale. Efforts to produce recombinant huBChE (rBChE) in various protein expression platforms have failed to achieve key critical attributes of huBChE such as circulatory half-life. These proteins often lack critical features such as tetrameric structure and requisite post-translational modifications. This review evaluates previous attempts to generate rBChE and assesses recent advances in mammalian cell expression and protein engineering strategies that could be deployed to achieve the required half-life and yield for a viable rBChE MCM. This includes the addition of a proline-rich attachment domain, fusion proteins, post translational modifications, expression system selection and optimised downstream processes. Whilst challenges remain, a combinatorial application of these strategies demonstrates potential as a technically feasible approach to achieving a bioactive and cost effective bioscavenger MCM.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-associated neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, and structural brain changes, primarily involving A beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Recent research highlights the significance of smaller A beta and Tau oligomeric aggregates (A beta O and TauO, respectively) in synaptic dysfunction and disease progression. Calcineurin (CaN), a key calcium/calmodulin-dependent player in regulating synaptic function in the central nervous system (CNS) is implicated in mediating detrimental effects of A beta O on synapses and memory function in AD. This study aims to investigate the specific impact of CaN on both exogenous and endogenous TauO through the acute and chronic inhibition of CaN. We previously demonstrated the protective effect against AD of the immunosuppressant CaN inhibitor, FK506, but its influence on TauO remains unclear. In this study, we explored the short-term effects of acute CaN inhibition on TauO phosphorylation and TauO-induced memory deficits and synaptic dysfunction. Mice received FK506 post-TauO intracerebroventricular injection and TauO levels and phosphorylation were assessed, examining their impact on CaN and GSK-3 beta. The study investigated FK506 preventive/reversal effects on TauO-induced clustering of CaN and GSK-3 beta. Memory and synaptic function in TauO-injected mice were evaluated with/without FK506. Chronic FK506 treatment in 3xTgAD mice explored its influence on CaN, A beta, and Tau levels. This study underscores the significant influence of CaN inhibition on TauO and associated AD pathology, suggesting therapeutic potential in targeting CaN for addressing various aspects of AD onset and progression. These findings provide valuable insights for potential interventions in AD, emphasizing the need for further exploration of CaN-targeted strategies.

AB  - Epilepsy, a prevalent chronic brain disorder, remains inadequately controlled by current antiepileptic drugs. Neuroinflammation is considered a crucial component in the process of epileptogenesis. Vitexin (VT), primarily derived from medicinal plants, is a flavonoid monomer with significant biological activity that has demonstrated benefits in various neurological disorders by suppressing neuroinflammation. However, the role and underlying mechanism of VT in epileptic seizures are incompletely understood. We herein investigate VT's antiseizure potential and the related mechanism utilizing a mouse model of status epilepticus induced by kainic acid (KA). Our findings indicate that VT pre-treatment exerts an antiseizure effect in a dose-dependent manner and attenuates KA-induced hippocampal neuronal damage in mice. Moreover, VT post-treatment (administration after the appearance of generalized seizures) can also alleviate KA-induced seizure and neuronal damage. Furthermore, VT suppresses the activity of hippocampal P2X7R and NLRP3 inflammasome in KA-treated mice. A438079, a specific P2X7R antagonist, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduces seizure severity and hippocampal neuronal damage. Conversely, the P2X7R activator BzATP negates the antiseizure and neuroprotective effects of VT. These findings demonstrate that VT can alleviate KA-induced seizure and neuronal damage by inhibiting P2X7R-NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in mice, potentially providing a novel strategy for prevention and treatment of acute seizures.

AB  - Bupleurum chinense DC. is a traditional Chinese medicine with a long medicinal history and is often used as the main ingredient in prescription drugs for epilepsy. The aerial parts of B. chinense DC. have similar efficacy and composition to B. chinense DC. Therefore, we speculated that the aerial parts of B. chinense DC. could be used in the treatment of epilepsy. Polysaccharides from the aerial parts of B. chinense DC. were selected to explore their therapeutic effects on epilepsy and their potential mechanism of action. The study is aimed at clarifying the antiepileptic effects of the polysaccharides from the aerial parts of B. chinense DC. and their potential underlying mechanisms. The chemical profile of the aerial parts of B. chinense DC. polysaccharides (ABP) was characterized by FT-IR spectrum and HPLC chromatogram. To determine the therapeutic effects of ABPs on epilepsy, we established a kainic acid- (KA-) induced rat model of epilepsy, and through H & E staining, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, biochemical analysis, ELISA, and Western blot analysis, we explored the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ABPs on epilepsy. The monosaccharide content of ABP included galacturonic acid (45.19%), galactose (36.63%), arabinose rhamnose (12.13%), and mannose (6.05%). Moreover, the average molecular weight of ABP was 1.38x10(3 )kDa. ABP could improve hippocampal injuries and neuronal function in the KA-induced epilepsy rat model. ABP significantly inhibited oxidative stress in the hippocampus of KA-induced rats. More importantly, ABP could regulate TREM2 activation in the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway to inhibit neuronal apoptosis, including increasing the expression of superoxide dismutase and lactate dehydrogenase and decreasing the expression of malondialdehyde. The current study defined the potential role of ABP in inhibiting the development of epilepsy, indicating that ABP could upregulate TREM2 to alleviate neuronal apoptosis, by activating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway and oxidative stress in epilepsy.

AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) promote the expression of immediate early genes required for learning and memory. Here, we showed that 132-adrenergic receptor (132AR) stimulation induced the nuclear export of phosphodiesterase 4D5 (PDE4D5), an enzyme that degrades the second messenger cAMP, to enable memory consolidation. We demonstrated that the endocytosis of 132AR phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs) mediat-ed arrestin3-dependent nuclear export of PDE4D5, which was critical for promoting nuclear cAMP signaling and gene expression in hippocampal neurons for memory consolidation. Inhibition of the arrestin3-PDE4D5 asso-ciation prevented 132AR-induced nuclear cAMP signaling without affecting receptor endocytosis. Direct PDE4 inhibition rescued 132AR-induced nuclear cAMP signaling and ameliorated memory deficits in mice expressing a form of the 132AR that could not be phosphorylated by GRKs. These data reveal how 132AR phosphorylated by endosomal GRK promotes the nuclear export of PDE4D5, leading to nuclear cAMP signaling, changes in gene expression, and memory consolidation. This study also highlights the translocation of PDEs as a mechanism to promote cAMP signaling in specific subcellular locations downstream of GPCR activation.

AB  - A behavioral strategy crucial to survival is directed navigation to a goal, such as a food or home location. One potential neural substrate for supporting goal-directed navigation is the parahippocampus, which contains neurons that represent an animal's position, orientation, and movement through the world, and that change their firing activity to encode behaviorally relevant variables such as reward. However, little prior work on the parahippocampus has considered how neurons encode variables during goal-directed navigation in environments that dynamically change. Here, we recorded single units from rat parahippocampal cortex while subjects performed a goal-directed task. The maze dynamically changed goal-locations via a visual cue on a trial-to-trial basis, requiring subjects to use cue-location associations to receive reward. We observed a mismatch-like signal, with elevated neural activity on incorrect trials, leading to rate-remapping. The strength of this remapping correlated with task performance. Recordings during open-field foraging allowed us to functionally define navigational coding for a subset of the neurons recorded in the maze. This approach revealed that head-direction coding units remapped more than other functional-defined units. Taken together, this work thus raises the possibility that during goal-directed navigation, parahippocampal neurons encode error information reflective of an animal's behavioral performance.

AB  - Light is an environmental signal that modulates plant defenses against attackers. Recent research has focused on the effects of light on defense hormone signaling; however, the connections between light signaling pathways and the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites involved in plant defense have been relatively unexplored. Here, we show that Arabidopsis BBX29, a protein that belongs to the B-Box transcription factor (TF) family, integrates photomorphogenic signaling with defense responses by promoting flavonoid, sinapate and glucosinolate accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves. AtBBX29 transcript levels were up regulated by light, through photoreceptor signaling pathways. Genetic evidence indicated that AtBBX29 up-regulates MYB12 gene expression, a TF known to induce genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis in a light-dependent manner, and MYB34 and MYB51, which encode TFs involved in the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis. Thus, bbx29 knockout mutants displayed low expression levels of key genes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, and the opposite was true in BBX29 overexpression lines. In agreement with the transcriptomic data, bbx29 mutant plants accumulated lower levels of kaempferol glucosides, sinapoyl malate, indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (I3M), 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate (4MSOB) and 3-methylthiopropyl glucosinolate (3MSP) in rosette leaves compared to the wild-type, and showed increased susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and to the herbivore Spodoptera frugiperda. In contrast, BBX29 overexpressing plants displayed increased resistance to both attackers. In addition, we found that AtBBX29 plays an important role in mediating the effects of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on plant defense against B. cinerea. Taken together, these results suggest that AtBBX29 orchestrates the accumulation of specific light-induced metabolites and regulates Arabidopsis resistance against pathogens and herbivores.

AB  - Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD) are two main types of dementias for which no specific treatment is available. Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion (CCH) is a pathogenesis underlying AD and VaD that promotes neuroinflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Honokiol (HNK) is a natural compound isolated from magnolia leaves that can easily cross blood brain barrier and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In the present study, the effects of HNK on astrocyte polarization and neurological damage in in vivo and in vitro models of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion were explored. We found that HNK was able to inhibit the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, A1 polarization, and reduce conditioned medium's neuronal toxicity of astrocyte under chronic hypoxia induced by cobalt chloride; STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor C188-9 was able to mimic the above effects of HNK, suggesting that HNK may inhibit chronic hypoxia-induced A1 polarization in astrocytes via STAT3. SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP reversed, while Sirt3 overexpression mimicked the inhibitory effects of HNK on oxidative stress, STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, A1 polarization and neuronal toxicity of astrocyte under chronic hypoxic conditions. For in vivo research, continuous intraperitoneal injection of HNK (1 mg/kg) for 21 days ameliorated the decrease in SIRT3 activity and oxidative stress, inhibited astrocytic STAT3 nuclear translocation and A1 polarization, and prevented neuron and synaptic loss in the hippocampal of CCH rats. Besides, HNK application improved the spatial memory impairment of CCH rats, as assessed with Morris Water Maze. In conclusion, these results suggest that the phytochemical HNK can inhibit astrocyte A1 polarization via regulating SIRT3-STAT3 axis, thus improving CCH-induced neurological damage. These results highlight HNK as novel treatment for dementia with underlying vascular mechanisms.

AB  - Astrocytes have key regulatory roles in central nervous system (CNS), integrating metabolic, inflammatory and synaptic responses. In this regard, type I interferon (IFN) receptor signaling in astrocytes can regulate synaptic plasticity. Simvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug that has shown anti-inflammatory properties, but its effects on astrocytes, a main source of cholesterol for neurons, remain to be elucidated. Herein, we investigated the effects of simvastatin in inflammatory and functional parameters of primary cortical and hypothalamic astrocyte cultures obtained from IFN alpha/beta receptor knockout (IFN alpha/beta R-/-) mice. Overall, simvastatin decreased extracellular levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), which were related to a downregulation in gene expression in hypothalamic, but not in cortical astrocytes. Moreover, there was an increase in anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) in both structures. Effects of simvastatin in inflammatory signaling also involved a downregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) gene expression as well as an upregulation of nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 (NF kappa B p65). The expression of cytoprotective genes sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and nuclear factor erythroid derived 2 like 2 (Nrf2) was also increased by simvastatin. In addition, simvastatin increased glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and glutathione (GSH) levels only in cortical astrocytes. Our findings provide evidence that astrocytes from different regions are important cellular targets of simvastatin in the CNS, even in the absence of IFN alpha/beta R, which was showed by the modulation of cytokine production and release, as well as the expression of cytoprotective genes and functional parameters.

AB  - The "schisandra-evodia" herb pair (S-E) is a herbal preparation to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and potential mechanism of S-E in AD rats, utilizing pharmacodynamic assessments and serum- and urine-based metabolomic analyses. Pharmacodynamic assessments included Morris water maze test, hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry experiments. The results of the study showed that the AD model was successful; the S-E significantly enhanced long-term memory and spatial learning in AD rats. Meanwhile, S-E notably ameliorated A beta 25-35-induced cognitive impairment, improved hippocampal neuron morphology, decreased A beta deposition in the hippocampus and mitigated inflammatory damage. We then analyzed serum and urine samples using UPLC-MS/MS to identify potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways. Metabolomic analysis revealed alterations in 40 serum metabolites and 38 urine metabolites following S-E treatment, predominantly affecting pathways related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. This study elucidates the biochemical mechanism underlying AD and the metabolic pathway influenced by S-E, laying the groundwork for future clinical applications.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a common environmental contaminant that belongs to a group of manmade fluorinated chemicals called per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Due to the pervasive nature of PFOA, the environmental health risks of PFOA contamination and exposure on reproductive health have increasing concern. In the present study, we exposed HGrC1 cells, an immortalized human granulosa cell line, to environmentally relevant (1-10 mu M) concentrations of PFOA. Results indicated that HGrC1 cells treated with PFOA had increased proliferation and migration relative to vehicle treated controls. No differences in cell apoptosis were observed with 1-10 mu M PFOA. Gene expression analysis revealed increases in mRNA transcripts for cell cycle regulators CCND1, CCNA2, and CCNB1. Upregulation of YAP1 protein and downstream target CTGF protein was also observed, suggesting that the Hippo pathway is involved in the proliferation and migratory effects of PFOA on HGrC1 cells. Further, the YAP1 inhibitor Verteporfin prevented the stimulatory effects of PFOA on HGrC1 cells. Together, these findings support a role for the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 in response to PFOA exposure in human granulosa cells.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) initiates a constellation of secondary injury cascades, leading to neuronal damage and dysfunction that is often beyond the scope of endogenous repair mechanisms. Cognitive deficits are among the most persistent morbidities resulting from TBI, necessitating a greater understanding of mechanisms of posttraumatic hippocampal damage and neuroplasticity and identification of therapies that improve recovery by enhancing repair pathways. Focusing here on hippocampal neuropathology associated with contusion-type TBIs, the impact of brain trauma on synaptic structure and function and the process of adult neurogenesis is discussed, reviewing initial patterns of damage as well as evidence for spontaneous recovery. A case is made that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a growth-promoting peptide synthesized in both the brain and the periphery, is well suited to augment neuroplasticity in the injured brain. Essential during brain development, multiple lines of evidence delineate roles in the adult brain for IGF-1 in the maintenance of synapses, regulation of neurotransmission, and modulation of forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation. Further, IGF-1 enhances adult hippocampal neurogenesis though effects on proliferation and neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells and on dendritic growth of newly born neurons. Post-injury administration of IGF-1 has been effective in rodent models of TBI in improving learning and memory, attenuating death of mature hippocampal neurons and promoting neurogenesis, providing critical proof-of-concept data. More studies are needed to explore the effects of IGF-1-based therapies on synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity following TBI and to optimize strategies in order to stimulate only appropriate, functional neuroplasticity.

AB  - Exposure to explosive shockwave often leads to blast-induced traumatic brain injury in military and civilian populations. Unprotected ears are most often damaged following exposure to blasts. Although there is an association between tympanic membrane perforation and TBI in blast exposure victims, little is known about how and to what extent blast energy is transmitted to the central nervous system via the external ear canal. The present study investigated whether exposure to blasts directed through the ear canal causes brain injury in Long-Evans rats. Animals were exposed to a single blast (0-30 pounds per square inch (psi)) through the ear canal, and brain injury was evaluated by histological and behavioral outcomes at multiple time-points. Blast exposure not only caused tympanic membrane perforation but also produced substantial neuropathological changes in the brain, including increased expression of c-Fos, induction of a profound chronic neuroinflammatory response, and apoptosis of neurons. The blast-induced injury was not limited only to the brainstem most proximal to the source of the blast, but also affected the forebrain including the hippocampus, amygdala and the habenula, which are all involved in cognitive functions. Indeed, the animals exhibited long-term neurological deficits, including signs of anxiety in open field tests 2 months following blast exposure, and impaired learning and memory in an 8-arm maze 12 months following blast exposure. These results suggest that the unprotected ear canal provides a locus for blast waves to cause TBI. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (Animal protocol# 0932E, approval date: September 30, 2016 and 0932F, approval date: September 27, 2019).

AB  - Luteolin is a flavone compound occurring in a variety of medicinal plants, which is reported to have neuroprotective properties. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of luteolin in alleviating sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity. GeneCards and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform were employed to screen luteolin, sevoflurane, and neurotoxicity-related genes. Subsequently, we isolated primary neurons from the hippocampus of 1-day-old C57BL/6J mice and tested for cytotoxicity after treatment of different concentrations of luteolin. Next, we measured the expression of apoptosis by flow cytometry and assessed inflammation-related factors, including heme oxygenase-1 expression detected by immunohistochemical staining and neuronal apoptosis. Finally, water maze, open field, and fear conditioning tests were conducted to observe the interaction between luteolin and sevoflurane in cognitive impairment of mice. Luteolin had the lowest cytotoxicity at concentrations of 30 or 60 mu g/mL; we selected 30 mu g/mL for drug administration experiments in vitro. Luteolin inhibited sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory responses through the autophagic pathway and thus ameliorated sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Mechanistically, luteolin up-regulated heme oxygenase-1 expression, which activated the autophagy pathway in vitro. This was confirmed by subsequent histological experiments in mice and behavioral results showing rescue cognitive impairment. Our findings uncovered an inhibitory role of luteolin in sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory response through activation of autophagy arising from up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1, thereby alleviating sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in mice.

AB  - Acute liver injury is an increasing global health problem. It is a widespread side effect of cisplatin treatment in the clinic and can lead to liver failure if not treated promptly. Previous studies have revealed that green tea can protect some organs from treatments. However, the potential of white tea to prevent the negative effects of acute liver injury has not been addressed so far. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reduction in cisplatin-induced liver injury in rats receiving white tea. Female Sprague Dawley rats with similar weight were selected in this study. Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups of eight animals each and ad libitum nutrition was provided. The control and cisplatin groups were given tap water only, while the white tea + cisplatin group received white tea at a 0.5% weight/volume concentration for four weeks. At the end of the fourth week, the white tea + cisplatin group and the cisplatin group received a single dose of cisplatin (7 mg/kg) via the intraperitoneal route. Five days after that procedure, the rats were anesthetized. Liver tissues and blood samples were collected, which were used for biochemical and histopathological analyses. According to biochemical results, liver tissue MDA and GSH, serum ALT, and AST levels significantly increased in the cisplatin group compared to the control group. Compared with the cisplatin group, although MDA, AST, ALT, and GSH levels were lower in the white tea + cisplatin group, only GSH levels were statistically different. The examination of histopathological and immunohistochemical findings revealed apoptotic cells, vascular congestion, and sinusoidal dilatation in the cisplatin group compared to the control group. This adverse event decreased in the white tea + cisplatin group compared to the cisplatin group. In conclusion, white tea exhibits an ameliorating effect on cisplatin-induced liver injury.

AB  - Neuroimaging biomarkers are needed to investigate the impact of smoking withdrawal on brain function. NFL-101 is a denicotinized aqueous extract of tobacco leaves currently investigated as an immune-based smoking cessation therapy in humans. However, the immune response to NFL-101 and its ability to induce significant changes in brain function remain to be demonstrated. Brain glucose metabolism was investigated using [F-18]fluoro-deoxy-glucose ([F-18]FDG) PET imaging in a mouse model of cigarette smoke exposure (CSE, 4-week whole-body inhalation, twice daily). Compared with control animals, the relative uptake of [F-18]FDG in CSE mice was decreased in the thalamus and brain stem (p < 0.001, n = 14 per group) and increased in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb (p < 0.001). NFL-101 induced a humoral immune response (specific IgGs) in mice and activated human natural-killer lymphocytes in vitro. In CSE mice, but not in control mice, single-dose NFL-101 significantly increased [F-18]FDG uptake in the thalamus (p < 0.01), thus restoring normal brain glucose metabolism after 2-day withdrawal in this nicotinic receptor-rich region. In tobacco research, [F-18]FDG PET imaging provides a quantitative method to evaluate changes in the brain function associated with the withdrawal phase. This method also showed the CNS effects of NFL-101, with translational perspectives for future clinical evaluation in smokers.

AB  - Mitophagy neutralizes mitochondrial damage, thereby preventing cellular dysfunction and apoptosis. Defects in mitophagy have been strongly implicated in age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. While mitophagy decreases throughout the lifespan of short-lived model organisms, it remains unknown whether such a decline occurs in the aging mammalian brain-a question of fundamental importance for understanding cell type- and region-specific susceptibility to neurodegeneration. Here, we define the longitudinal dynamics of basal mitophagy and macroautophagy across neuronal and non-neuronal cell types within the intact aging mouse brain in vivo. Quantitative profiling of reporter mouse cohorts from young to geriatric ages reveals cell- and tissue-specific alterations in mitophagy and macroautophagy between distinct subregions and cell populations, including dopaminergic neurons, cerebellar Purkinje cells, astrocytes, microglia and interneurons. We also find that healthy aging is hallmarked by the dynamic accumulation of differentially acidified lysosomes in several neural cell subsets. Our findings argue against any widespread age-related decline in mitophagic activity, instead demonstrating dynamic fluctuations in mitophagy across the aging trajectory, with strong implications for ongoing theragnostic development.
   Aging diminishes autophagy in short-lived model organisms. This study uncouples macroautophagy and mitophagy in the aging mouse brain at the single-cell level in vivo by profiling two optical reporter models. Differences across brain regions and circuits highlight a dynamic interplay between physiological autophagy and mitochondrial maintenance during healthy aging.An atlas of the spatiotemporal dynamics of autophagy in the aging mammalian brain.Aging is associated with increased mitophagy across many neuronal and non-neuronal subpopulations.Neuronal lysosomes exhibit subset-specific and age-dependent heterogeneity in acidification states.The CSF-producing choroid plexus, inhibitory interneurons and microglia exhibit high levels of mitophagy.
   In vivo imaging uncovers regional differences and spatiotemporal dynamics of basal mitophagy and macroautophagy in neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the aging mouse brain.

AB  - Experimental in vivo data have recently shown complementary neuroprotective actions of rhEPO and growth hormone (rhGH) in a neonatal murine model of hypoxic brain injury. Here, we hypothesized that rhGH and rhEPO mediate stabilization of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and regenerative vascular effects in hypoxic injury to the developing brain. Using an established model of neonatal hypoxia, neonatal mice (P7) were treated i.p. with rhGH (4000 mu g/kg) or rhEPO (5000 IU/kg) 0/12/24 h after hypoxic exposure. After a regeneration period of 48 h or 7 d, cerebral mRNA expression of Vegf-A, its receptors and co-receptors, and selected tight junction proteins were determined using qRT-PCR and ELISA. Vessel structures were assessed by Pecam-1 and occludin (Ocln) IHC. While Vegf-A expression increased significantly with rhGH treatment (p < 0.01), expression of the Vegfr and TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie-2) system remained unchanged. RhEPO increased Vegf-A (p < 0.05) and Angpt-2 (p < 0.05) expression. While hypoxia reduced the mean vessel area in the parietal cortex compared to controls (p < 0.05), rhGH and rhEPO prevented this reduction after 48 h of regeneration. Hypoxia significantly reduced the Ocln(+) fraction of cortical vascular endothelial cells. Ocln signal intensity increased in the cortex in response to rhGH (p < 0.05) and in the cortex and hippocampus in response to rhEPO (p < 0.05). Our data indicate that rhGH and rhEPO have protective effects on hypoxia-induced BBB disruption and regenerative vascular effects during the post-hypoxic period in the developing brain.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Polygala tenuifolia is used in a variety of Chinese medicine prescriptions for the classic dementia treatment, and polysaccharide is an important active component in the herb. Aim of the study: This study investigated the in vivo anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activity of the polysaccharide PTPS from Polygala tenuifolia using the senescence-accelerated mouse/prone8 (SAMP8) model and explored its molecular mechanism to lay the foundation for the development of polysaccharide-based anti-AD drugs. Materials and methods: The Morris water maze test (MWM)was used to detect changes in the spatial cognitive ability of mice, and Nissl staining was applied to observe the state of neurons in the classic hippocampus. The levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured by ELISA. Immunofluorescence was used to reflect beta-amyloid (A beta) levels in brain tissue. Apoptosis was evaluated by TdT-mediated dUTP NickEnd Labeling (TUNEL) method. The status of dendritic branches and spines was observed by Golgi staining. Meanwhile, the expression levels of recombinant human insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) proteins were determined by Western blotting. Results: PTPS improves spatial cognitive deficits in AD mice, reduces cellular damage in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, maintains the balance of the cholinergic system, and exerts an anti-AD effect in vivo. The molecular mechanism of its action may be related to the reduction of A beta deposition as well as the activation of ERK pathway-related proteins with enhanced synaptic plasticity. Conclusions: PTPS is able to exert anti-AD activity in vivo by mitigating A beta damage and targeting the ERK pathway.

AB  - Background: Neuroinflammation plays a major role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The regulation of microglia is an efficient therapeutic approach to controlling neuroinflammation.
   Purpose: In this study, we aimed to determine whether Artemisiae Iwayomogii Herba (AIH), which is herbal medicine traditionally used for inflammation-related disorders, controls neuroinflammatory responses by regulating the microglia-mediated signaling pathway.
   Methods: BV-2 microglial cells were treated with AIH and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), then various proinflammatory mediators were analyzed using griess reaction, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, or western blotting. C57BL/6 J mice were orally administered by AIH for 17 days and intraperitoneally injected with LPS for the last 14 days. The brains were collected and the microglial activation and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-, leucine-rich repeat-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) expression in the cortex and hippocampus were analyzed using immunohistochemistry or western blotting.
   Results: In BV-2 microglial cells, we found that AIH inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production induced by LPS. AIH also suppressed the expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators, including inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6. The study also revealed that the effects of AIH are related to the regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Additionally, we found that AIH prevented the formation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Consistent with the results of in vitro studies on the brains of LPS-injected mice, we observed that AIH suppressed microglial activation and NLRP3 expression.
   Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that AIH attenuates neuroinflammation by regulating the NF-kappa B and MAPK pathways, and it may be used for treating neurological diseases.

AB  - Introduction Two new dactylogyrid monogeneans, Anacanthorus cultro n. sp. and Notozothecium palometae n. sp., are described based on specimens collected from the gill filaments of Mylossoma albiscopum (Cope, 1872) (Characiformes: Serrasalmidae), a pelagic and herbivore teleost collected in the Tigre river, Loreto, Peru. Materials and methods Some monogeneans were stained with Gomori's trichrome and mounted in Canada Balsam to determine internal soft structures. Others were cleared in Hoyer's medium for the study of sclerotized structures. Drawings were made using a drawing tube and a microprojector. Results Anacanthorus cultro n. sp. is characterized by the presence of a rod-shaped male copulatory organ (MCO) lacking featherlike structures, and a knife-shaped accessory piece with a submedial knob. Notozothecium palometae n. sp. can be distinguished from all congeners by its MCO with a subbasal spur and an accessory piece with inverted hammer shaped. Conclusions This is the first data on the parasites of M. albiscopum, a popular fish in local markets. Anacanthorus cultro n. sp. is the twenty-fifth documented species of the genus in Peru, while N. palometae n. sp. represents the seventh species of the genus known to infect freshwater fish species in Peru.

AB  - Purpose Echinorhynchus gadi is one of the most widely distributed and commonly described acanthocephalans in marine fishes throughout the world. We provide a detailed morphometric and molecular description of a distinct Alaska population collected from the Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis Schmidt (Pleuronectidae) compared to those from other hosts and regions, illustrating new features never previously reported. Methods We described new specimens by microscopical studies, augmented by SEM, Energy Dispersive x-ray and molecular analyses, and histopathology. Results Specimens from Alaska were distinguished from those collected from the other geographical areas in proboscis size and its armature, especially number of hook rows and hooks per row, and length of hooks. The size of the receptacle, lemnisci, and reproductive structures in some other collections also varied from the Alaska material. X-ray scans of the gallium cut hooks depict prominent layering with high Sulfur content for tip cuts and increased calcium and phosphorus content in the base area of the hook. Sections of E. gadi specimens in the host tissue show prominent hook entanglement with subsequent connective tissue invasion also depicting the internal anatomy of certain worm structures not readily seen by other means. Molecular analyses clearly confirmed the identity of our E. gadi sequences. Conclusion Our Alaska population of the E. gadi complex appears to represent a novel population distinguishable by its distinct morphometrics, geography and host species. We further establish new information on the Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis in our Alaska material for future comparisons with the other siblings and explore genetic relationships among echinorhynchid genera and species.

AB  - PurposeAlternative and affordable tick control strategies are crucial to control and prevent tick bites and tick-borne diseases. MethodsIn this study, we evaluated the acaricidal efficacy of 35 aqueous plant extracts (17%) against the camel tick, Hyalomma dromedarii. ResultsThe phytochemical profile indicated the presence of various secondary substances. Plants were classified into three groups according to their mortality percentage 15 days post-treatment with 17%. This highly effective group (91%-95%) comprised Ocimum basilicum, Mespilus germanica, and Viola alpine followed by Carum carvi, Cucurbita pepo (peel), and Peganum harmala. A moderately effective group (80%-90%) included Acacia nilotica, Apium graveolens, Capsicum annuum, Ceratonia siliqua, Cucurbita pepo (seeds), Equisetum arvense, Eruca sativa, Ginkgo biloba, Plantago psyllium, Phyllanthus emblica, Punica granatum, and Ziziphus spinachristi. The 20 remaining plants were assigned to the less effective group (< 80%). Viscum album (58.3%), which was the least effective reference plant. The high potency of six plant extracts as acaricides may be attributed to the high content of active principles, e.g., phenols, flavonoids, and tannins. ConclusionAll of these highly effective plants are recommended for use as an acaricide, in case of facing acaricidal resistance or limited options for tick control.

AB  - Researchers borrow ideas from biological characteristics and behavior in design to make bionic robots that can meet unstructured and complex operating environments. The elephant trunk has been widely imitated by bionic robots because of its strong dexterity and stiffness adjustability. Due to the complex structure of the current elephant trunk robot, a series-parallel elephant trunk robot based on flexible rod actuation and a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-dof) parallel module is proposed in this paper. The bionic robot has a simple structure and redundant kinematics, which can realize the control of stiffness. This work focuses on the modeling of the flexible driving rod, the kinematics of a single parallel module, and the whole biomimetic robot. The kinematics are verified by simulation, which lays a foundation for future research on stiffness regulation.

AB  - A key aim of Alzheimer disease research is to develop efficient therapies to prevent and/or delay the irreversible progression of cognitive impairments. Early deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) are associated with the accumulation of amyloid beta in rodent models of the disease; however, less is known about how mGluR-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is affected. In this study, we have found that mGluR-LTD is enhanced in the APP(swe)/PS1dE9 mouse at 7 but returns to wild-type levels at 13 months of age. This transient over-activation of mGluR signalling is coupled with impaired LTP and shifts the dynamic range of synapses towards depression. These alterations in synaptic plasticity are associated with an inability to utilize cues in a spatial learning task. The transient dysregulation of plasticity can be prevented by genetic deletion of the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a substrate of p38 MAPK, demonstrating that manipulating the mGluR-p38 MAPK-MK2 cascade at 7 months can prevent the shift in synapse dynamic range. Our work reveals the MK2 cascade as a potential pharmacological target to correct the over-activation of mGluR signalling.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures with excessive and abnormal neuronal discharges. Epileptogenesis is usually involved in neuropathological processes such as ion channel dysfunction, neuronal injury, inflammatory response, synaptic plasticity, gliocyte proliferation and mossy fiber sprouting, currently the pathogenesis of epilepsy is not yet completely understood. A growing body of studies have shown that epigenetic regulation, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and restrictive element-1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencing factor (REST/NRSF) are also involved in epilepsy. Through epigenetic studies, we found that the synaptic dysfunction, nerve damage, cognitive dysfunction and brain development abnormalities are affected by epigenetic regulation of epilepsy-related genes in patients with epilepsy. However, the functional roles of epigenetics in pathogenesis and treatment of epilepsy are still to be explored. Therefore, profiling the array of genes that are epigenetically dysregulated in epileptogenesis is likely to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of epilepsy and may for the amelioration of these serious human conditions provide novel insight into therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers for epilepsy to improve serious human condition.

AB  - Present study focuses on ameliorative potential of Typha elephantina leave's aqueous (TE.AQ) extract against Paracetamol (PCM) induced toxicity in rabbits. We fed the male rabbits with 300 mg PCM in alone and in combination with TE.AQ at different doses i.e. (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight) or silymarin (100 mg/kg) daily for 21 days. PCM in alone significantly (P < 0.5) increased serum urea, uric acid, creatinine, total protein, albumin, globulin and blood urea nitrogen. Serum sodium, potassium and magnesium level were high. The glutathione, radical scavenging activity and Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were significantly reduced. Treatment with TE.AQ at dose rate 300 mg/kg body weight and Silymarin significantly ameliorated all the parameters when compared with PCM administered group. The 100 and 200 mg of TE.AQ showed no significant effects. The histopathological examination confirmed the therapeutic potential of TE.AQ. These results established the presence of natural antioxidants in Typha elephantina leaves. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - Neurons and astrocytes work in close metabolic collaboration, linking neurotransmission to brain energy and neurotransmitter metabolism. Dysregulated energy metabolism is a hallmark of the aging brain and may underlie the progressive age-dependent cognitive decline. However, astrocyte and neurotransmitter metabolism remains understudied in aging brain research. In particular, how aging affects metabolism of glutamate, being the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, is still poorly understood. Here we investigated critical aspects of cellular energy metabolism in the aging male mouse hippocampus using stable isotope tracing in vitro. Metabolism of [U-13C]glucose demonstrated an elevated glycolytic capacity of aged hippocampal slices, whereas oxidative [U-13C]glucose metabolism in the TCA cycle was significantly reduced with aging. In addition, metabolism of [1,2-13C]acetate, reflecting astrocyte energy metabolism, was likewise reduced in the hippocampal slices of old mice. In contrast, uptake and subsequent metabolism of [U-13C]glutamate was elevated, suggesting increased capacity for cellular glutamate handling with aging. Finally, metabolism of [15N]glutamate was maintained in the aged slices, demonstrating sustained glutamate nitrogen metabolism. Collectively, this study reveals fundamental alterations in cellular energy and neurotransmitter metabolism in the aging brain, which may contribute to age-related hippocampal deficits.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-protein (LP) diets supplemented with sodium butyrate (SB), medium-chain fatty acids (MCT), or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on the growth performance, immune function, and the microbiome of weaned piglets. A total of 120 healthy weaned piglets ((Landrace x Large White x Duroc); 7.93 +/- 0.7 kg initial body weight), were randomly divided into five groups. Each group consisted of six replications with four piglets per replication. Dietary treatments included control diet (CON); LP diet (LP); LP + 0.2% SB diet (LP + SB); LP + 0.2% MCT diet (LP + MCT); and LP + PUFA diet (LP + PUFA). The experimental period lasted for 4 weeks. Compared with the CON diet, LP, LP + SB, LP + MCT, and LP + PUFA diets decreased the final weight and average daily gain (ADG) of piglets (p < 0.05). There were lower (p < 0.05) concentrations of IL-8 and higher (p < 0.05) Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in the plasma of piglets fed with LP + SB, LP + MCT, and LP + PUFA diets than those fed with the LP diet. The piglets in the LP + SB and LP + PUFA groups had lower IKK-alpha (IKKa) mRNA expression in the colonic mucosa compared with those in the CON and LP groups (p < 0.05). The mRNA expression of TLR4 in the colonic mucosa of piglets in the LP + SB, LP + MCT, and LP + PUFA groups was decreased when compared with the CON and LP groups (p < 0.05). The LP + MCT diets increased the gene expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the colonic mucosa of piglets compared with CON, LP, and LP + SB diets (p < 0.05). The abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae in the colonic microbiome of piglets in the LP group was higher than that in the other four groups (p < 0.05). Collectively, this study showed that LP diets supplemented with SB, MCT, or n-3 PUFA reduced plasma inflammatory factor levels, increased plasma GSH-Px activity, and declined mRNA expression of TLR4 and IKKa in the colonic epithelium, whereas it reduced the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae in the colon of piglets.

AB  - The expression of aquaglyceroporin 3 (AQP-3) has been demonstrated in the spermatozoa of several mammalian species and its role has been associated with cryotolerance. Post-thaw sperm quality from individual dromedary males with different response to freezing-thawing process was evaluated through sperm head morphometry. In order to understand the cellular mechanisms affected by cryoinjury we have explored the presence and distribution of sperm AQP-3 using western blotting and immunocyto-chemistry. WB showed different intensity of the specific signal bands at 28 kDa. Immunofluorescence assessments allowed us to identify five different and clear AQP-3 distribution patterns of labelling in the sperm plasma membrane; acrosome, post-acrosome, mid-piece, and principal and final tail. Although expression of AQP-3 varied among male ejaculates, the individual sperm response to freeze-thawing was not associated with AQP-3 expression. Thus, AQP3 expressions do not seem like a reliable predictor of sperm response to freeze-thawing process in this species. This work is the first to describe the morphometric characteristics of the heads of dromedary spermatozoa. No correlation was found be-tween sperm head dimensions and sperm quality variables after freeze-thawing suggesting that dromedary camel sperm head morphometry is also not a reliable predictor of cryosurvival.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The functionality of food-derived nucleotides is revealed when nucleotide components are ingested in emergency situations, such as during stress loading, though it is difficult to elucidate the physiological function of dietary nucleotide supplementation. Using a stress load experimental system utilizing territoriality among male mice, we evaluated whether DNA sodium salt derived from salmon milt (DNA-Na) has stress-relieving effects. It was found that stress was reduced in mice fed a diet containing a 1% concentration of DNA-Na, but this was insignificant for yeast-derived RNA. Next, we attempted to elucidate the anti-stress effects of DNA-Na using another experimental system, in which mice were subjected to chronic crowding stress associated with aging: six mice in a cage were kept until they were 7 months of age, resulting in overcrowding. We compared these older mice with 2-month-old mice that were kept in groups for only one month. The results show that the expression of genes associated with hippocampal inflammation was increased in the older mice, whereas the expression of these genes was suppressed in the DNA-Na-fed group. This suggests that dietary DNA intake may suppress inflammation in the brain caused by stress, which increases with age.

AB  - Simple Summary Logging prohibition in Thailand national parks in 1989 ended work for most elephants and mahouts. Animal tourism developed, affording food and husbandry for elephants, and introducing tourism with young tigers. Media and research on wild animals in tourism have explored the animals' welfare, but not how tourism shifts human-animal relationships and affects the animal caregivers. Caregivers of elephants (n = 55) or tigers (n = 18) in both private and government tourism facilities in four cities were interviewed in Thai concerning how contexts and management styles impact the relationship between captive animals and caregivers. Mahouts working in private facilities used one-to-one management and were younger and more poorly compensated than those working at government-funded tourism facilities. Tiger caregivers in tourism had direct contact with young tigers, with group management; these caregivers also were younger than in government facilities, with fewer benefits. Most mahouts considered their elephants as family members; a slight majority of these mahouts questioned the ethics of this use of elephants. Tiger caregivers classified tigers as family or friend equally often; one-third of all declined answering whether they approved of use of tigers in tourism. While somewhat solving problems, animal tourism also creates some challenges. This study explored the perspectives of elephant mahouts (n = 55) and tiger caregivers (n = 18) working in 4 private or 2 government facilities in Thailand to learn their experiences and viewpoints pertaining to use of animals in tourism. Interviews were conducted in Thailand at facilities in four cities. Mahouts working in private tourism facilities used one-to-one management and were significantly younger and more poorly compensated than those working at government-funded zoos, where some had shifted to group management. Tiger caregivers in tourism had direct contact with young tigers, with group management; these caregivers also were significantly younger than in government zoos, and with fewer benefits. Mahouts and tiger caregivers differed in how they viewed their relationships with their animals. Most mahouts considered their elephants as family members; a slight majority of these questioned the ethics of use of elephants in tourism. Tiger caregivers classified tigers as family or friend equally often; one-third of tiger caregivers declined answering on their approval of using tigers in tourism. What to do with aging tigers is a problem; this may explain some tiger caregivers' reticence to answer questions about using young tigers in tourism. While solving some problems, animal tourism creates several challenges.

AB  - Background/aim: Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common health issues, is characterized by memory loss, severe behavioral disorders, and eventually death. Despite many studies, there are still no drugs that can treat AD or stop it from progressing. Previous in vitro tests showed that O-demethyl galantamine (ODG) might have therapeutic potential owing to its 10 times higher acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity than galantamine (GAL). Materials and methods: We aimed to assess the effect of ODG at the molecular level in a 12 -month -old 5xFAD Alzheimer's mouse model. To this end, following the administrations of ODG and GAL (used as a positive control), protein alterations were investigated in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum regions of the brain. Surprisingly, GAL altered proteins prominently in the cortex, while ODG exclusively exerted its effect on the cerebellum. Results: GNB1, GNB2, NDUFS6, PAK2, and RhoA proteins were identified as the top 5 hub proteins in the cerebellum of ODG-treated mice. Reregulation of these proteins through Ras signaling and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathways, which were found to be enriched, might contribute to reversing AD -induced molecular changes. Conclusion: We suggest that, since it targets specifically the cerebellum, ODG may be further evaluated for combination therapies for AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Realgar, the main component of which is As2S2 or As4S4 (>= 90%), is a traditional Chinese natural medicine that has been used to treat carbuncles, furuncles, snake and insect bites, abdominal pain caused by parasitic worms, and epilepsy in China for many years. Because realgar contains arsenic, chronic or excessive use of single-flavor realgar and realgar-containing Chinese patent medicine can lead to drug-induced arsenic poisoning, but the exact mechanism underlying its toxicity to the central nervous system is unclear.Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of realgar-induced neurotoxicity and to investigate the effects of realgar on autophagy and the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway.Materials and methods: We used rats treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or adeno-associated virus (AAV2/9-r-shRNA-Sqstm1, sh-p62) to investigate realgar-induced neurotoxicity and explore the specific relationship between autophagy and the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway (the Nrf2 pathway) in the cere-bral cortex. Molecular docking analysis was used to assess the interactions among the Nrf2, p62 and Keap1 proteins.Results: Our results showed that arsenic from realgar accumulated in the brain and blood to cause neuronal and synaptic damage, decrease exploratory behavior and spontaneous movement, and impair memory ability in rats. The mechanism may have involved realgar-mediated autophagy impairment and continuous activation of the Nrf2 pathway via the LC3-p62-Keap1-Nrf2 axis. However, because this activation of the Nrf2 pathway was not sufficient to counteract oxidative damage, apoptosis was aggravated in the cerebral cortex.Conclusions: This study revealed that autophagy, the Nrf2 pathway, and apoptosis are involved in realgar-induced central nervous system toxicity and identified p62 as the hub of the LC3-p62-Keap1-Nrf2 axis in the regulation of autophagy, the Nrf2 pathway, and apoptosis.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, like most other viruses that affect the respiratory tract can cause severe maternal illness and adverse pregnancy outcomes. They are not only highly transmissible (acquired through droplets), but Host reservoirs such as dromedary camels for MERS-CoV and masked palm civet for SARS-CoV-1 are critical links in the onset of outbreaks. Clinically they present with flu-like symptoms and therefore a high index of suspicion is required to ensure timely diagnosis and tailored management. Although there are not many reported series on these infections in pregnancy they seem to be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and maternal mortality. Diagnosis is made by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. There are currently no effective anti-viral agents for these viruses but following infections various agents have been administered to patients. The most important aspect of management should be early identification of deterioration and intensive support and prevention of transmission. Our understanding of the evidence of the impact of both infections on pregnancies suggests the potential for future repeat outbreaks, hence the importance of maintaining vigilance across healthcare systems.

AB  - A close relationship has been found between the central nervous system and vitamin D in which its deficiency leads to neurological and psychological disorders. The current study is focused on utilizing mushrooms as an important dietary source of vitamin D2 against AD. Male Wister rats (n=70) were divided into several groups, supplemented with vitamin D and mushroom and exposed to ALCI3 to induce AD. Expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) biomarker of AD and neuropathological alterations were conducted in brain hippocampus. Additionally, behavioral analysis using Y Maze Spontaneous Alternation Test was performed. The results showed that AD group of rats exhibited high expression levels of ApoE4 gene associated with neuronal cell loss. Additionally, an elevation in number of degenerated neurons in the hippocampal sub-regions coincided with low spontaneous alternation percentage (SA%) were observed in AD group. Conversely, pre-supplementation of rats exposed to ALCI3 with vitamin D and mushroom mitigated the severe neurotoxicity resulted from AlCl3 inducing AD rats. The beneficial effects of vitamin D and mushroom consumption on improving memory in AD mice could be due to the interaction between other bioactive compounds and vitamin D2 inhibiting the oxidative stress in brain hippocampus.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Tourists who visit elephant tourism venues (ETVs), and other wildlife attractions, can influence the activities offered at these venues by positive and negative word-of-mouth. When a person has a good experience and they tell their family and friends, or leave reviews online, this can influence people to participate in the activity. The same is also true when a person has a bad experience; although, in this instance, they can influence people not to participate in the activity, limiting the possible success of that venue. Generally, tourists seem to prefer to visit ETVs that allow elephants to behave naturally over those that make their elephants entertain tourists. Therefore, we visited twelve ETVs in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and compared the opinions of tourists who visited riding and non-riding venues towards the use of captive elephants for entertainment. We found that tourists who reported a preference for ETVs with higher welfare standards had personally seen elephants being treated poorly. Additionally, higher welfare standards may positively affect tourists' satisfaction with their experience. Therefore, tourists can influence the activities offered at ETVs by demanding better living conditions for elephants and only financially supporting ETVs with higher welfare standards.
   Consumer satisfaction and preference can be integral in influencing and solidifying change in user-driven industries such as tourism. High satisfaction rates are imperative to the continual success of a venue as satisfaction determines the likelihood of repeat business and positive recommendations to friends, family and online review forums. Tourist preference for ecocentric tourism venues, over anthropocentric ones, appears to be increasing in elephant tourism venues (ETVs) in Thailand. To explore this, we visited twelve ETVs in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and compared the preferences and satisfaction of tourists who visited riding and non-riding venues toward the use of captive elephants in an entertainment setting. We found that tourists visited riding and non-riding ETVs for similar reasons, primarily due to recommendations from friends and reviews, and because the venue had a good reputation. Tourist preference for higher welfare standards was observed at venues where participants directly observed poor treatment of the elephants. Tourist satisfaction may be impacted by higher elephant welfare standards; therefore, tourists have the ability to influence the elephant tourism industry by demanding better living conditions for elephants and only financially supporting ETVs with higher welfare standards.

AB  - The achievement of the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions set by the Paris Agreements and the Swiss federal law on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 law) requires massive use of renewable energies, which cannot be achieved without their adoption by the general public. The solar cadaster developed as part of the INTERREG G2 Solar project is intended to assess the solar potential of buildings at the scale of Greater Geneva-for both industrial buildings and for individual residential buildings-at a resolution of 1 m. The new version of the solar cadaster is intended to assess the solar potential of roofs, as well as that of vertical facades. The study presented here aims to validate this new version through a comparison with results obtained with two other simulation tools that are widely used and validated by the scientific community. The good accordance with the results obtained with ENVI-met and DIVA-for-Rhino demonstrates the capability of the radiative model developed for the solar cadaster of Greater Geneva to accurately predict the radiation levels of building facades in configurations with randomly distributed buildings (horizontally or vertically).

AB  - Cryptosporidium spp., Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Giardia duodenalis are zoonotic pathogens commonly found in the intestinal tract of mammalian hosts including livestock and humans. The prevalence of these eukaryote microorganisms in domestic animals and their interaction with intestinal microbiota are not yet fully recognized. We analyzed the intestinal microbiota composition with metagenomics and functional characterization with Cluster of Orthologous (COG) in Bactrian camels, which were raised on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Northwest China. Thus, fecal samples were collected from the animals to determine the parasite infection and the profile of microbiota. Analysis of intestinal microbiota at genus level revealed important features of interaction between parasites infection and bacterial community. Coprococcus and Prevotella were more abundant while Akkermansia had lower relative abundance with E. bieneusi infection. Bacteria of Akkermansia, Lactococcus, Oxalobacter, Sphaerochaeta, Paludibacter, Fibrobacter, Anaerovibrio, Pseudomonas, Mogibacterium, Pseudoramibacter_Eubacterium, YRC22, Flexispira, SMB53, AF12, and Roseburia genera were found under-presented and Oscillospira genus over-presented when G. duodenalis infection was present. Meanwhile, Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi co-infected animals showed lower relative abundance of Allobaculum, Rikenella, Shuttleworthia, Epulopiscium, Bilophila, Dorea, Fibrobacter, and TG5. Results demonstrate important interaction between the intestinal parasites and microbiota, and provide informative link for understanding the co-evolution of zoonotic pathogens and bacteria in domestic animals.

AB  - A chondral injury is a limiting disease that can affect the quality of life and be an economic burden due to the cost of immediate treatment and loss in work productivity. If left untreated, such an injury may progress to osteoarthritis, a degenerative and debilitating joint disease characterized by pain and functional impairment. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have immune-modulatory properties and the ability to differentiate into chondroblasts and osteoblasts, are a predictable source for the treatment of cartilage injuries. This article presents tools to evaluate cartilage restoration by tissue engineering and cell therapy treatment in a translational and preclinical large animal model. In this controlled experimental study with 14 miniature pigs, a scaffold-free tissue engineering construct (TEC) derived from dental pulp and synovial MSCs for cartilage therapy was tested. Total thickness cartilage defects were performed in both posterior knees. The defect was left empty in one of the knees, and the other received the TEC. The tissue repair was morphologically assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the three-dimensional double echo steady-state (3D-DESS) sequence, and compositional assessment was carried out based on the T2 mapping technique. The osteochondral specimens were fixed for histopathology, decalcified, subjected to standard histological processing, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections stained for immunohistochemical detection of collagen types were digested with pepsin and chondroitinase and incubated with antibodies against them. The mechanical evaluation involved analysis of Young's modulus of the cartilage samples based on the indentation and maximum compression test. In addition, a finite element model was used to simulate and characterize properties of the osteochondral block. At 6 months after surgery, there were no complications with the animals and the MRI, histological, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical evaluations proved to be effective and qualified to differentiate good quality chondral repair from inadequate repair tissue. The proposed methods were feasible and capable to properly evaluate the defect filled with TEC containing stromal cells after 6 months of follow-up in a large animal model for articular cartilage restoration. Impact StatementArticular chondral injuries are prevalent and represent an economic burden due to the cost of treatment. The engineering of cartilage tissue can promote the repair of chondral injuries and is dependent on selecting appropriate cells and biocompatible frameworks. In this article, methods for evaluation of a scaffold-free cell delivery system made from mesenchymal stromal cells were present in a translational study that allows further clinical safety and efficacy trials.

AB  - The protandric shrimp Hippolyte inermis is the only known marine invertebrate whose sex determination is strongly influenced by the composition of its food. In H. inermis, a sex reversal is triggered by the ingestion of diatoms of the genus Cocconeis associated with leaves of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica. These diatoms contain compounds that promote programmed cell death (PCD) in H. inermis and also in human cancer cells. Transcriptomic analyses suggested that ferroptosis is the primary trigger of the shrimp's sex reversal, leading to the rapid destruction of the androgen gland (AG) followed by a chain of apoptotic events transforming the testes into ovaries. Here, we propose a molecular approach to detect the effects of compounds stimulating the PCD. An RNA extraction method, suitable for young shrimp post-larvae (five days after metamorphosis; PL5 stage), was established. In addition, six genes involved in apoptosis, four involved in ferroptosis, and seven involved in the AG switch were mined from the transcriptome, and their expression levels were followed using real-time qPCR in PL5 fed on Cocconeis spp., compared to PL5 fed on a basic control feed. Our molecular approach, which detected early signals of sex reversal, represents a powerful instrument for investigating physiological progression and patterns of PCD in marine invertebrates. It exemplifies the physiological changes that may start a few days after the settlement of post-larvae and determine the life destiny of an individual.

AB  - Background: Sleep deprivation (SD) has become a global health concern with serious consequences containing memory deficits and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. The gut-brain axis serves as a crucial link between the brain and gut, and the utilization of chlorogenic acid (CGA) presents a compelling strategy for mitigating or potentially resolving various neuroinflammation-associated disorders. However, it is still unknown how CGA may interact with the gut, microbiota and the brain during SD.
   Purpose: This study aims to explore the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of microbiota-gut-brain axis by which CGA prevents SD-induced cognitive deficits.
   Study design and methods: CGA (30, 60 mg/kg.bw.) was gavaged to C57BL/6 mice, and then they were submitted to 48-h SD. The cognitive and spatial learning abilities were investigated through behavioral tests. Furthermore, we explored the action mechanism of this compound with haematological analysis, histopathological examination, Western blot, ELISA and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing from colonic contents.
   Results: The cognitive deficits induced by SD were significantly relieved by administration of CGA in a dosedependent manner. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of hippocampus and colon tissues indicated that pretreatment of CGA not only protected brain tissue from SD, but also maintained intestinal integrity. In the hippocampus, the increased pro-inflammatory neurometabolites were significantly prevented by CGA, and an immune profile capable of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory was improved via Nrf2/PPAR signaling pathways. The observed immunomodulatory effect was concomitant with augmentation of the intestinal barrier, as evidenced by the heightened expressions of tight junction proteins. 16S rRNA analysis of colonic contents revealed that levels of Clostridia_UCG-014 and lipopolysaccharide were significantly inhibited, and those of Lactobacillus and intestinal tight junction proteins were upregulated in the CGA group. Pathways of ko05322 (immune disease) and ko04610 (immune system) were significantly regulated by CGA. Based on PICRUSt2 algorithm, CGA probably influenced gut microbial functions via several metabolism pathways, such as arginine biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism and purine metabolism.
   Conclusion: The present study first proved the efficacy and mechanism of CGA in alleviating SD-induced cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation via creating a systemic protection, a bidirectional communication system connecting the gut with the brain. The intestinal barrier improvement and the reshaped "SD microbiota" profiles restored immunity functions, which were probably the main contributors to Nrf2/PPAR activation and the neuroprotective effect of CGA. Overall, this work provided novel insights of CGA, which might guide the more reasonable clinical use of CGA in the pathogenesis of sleep-related disorders.

AB  - Mutations and altered expression of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) profoundly influence tumor progression. Ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) is a well-characterized human DUB reportedly overexpressed in and associated with maintaining the mesenchymal stem cell status of osteosarcoma (OS); however, the potential mechanisms of USP1 in OS remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified that USP1 directly interacts with Transcriptional Co-Activator With PDZ-Binding Motif (TAZ) in OS cell lines, and with mechanistic analysis indicating that the anti-OS effects of USP1 inhibition could be partially attributed to TAZ instability, with its reduced nuclear accumulation responsible for a subsequent decrease in the expression of downstream genes associated with the Hippo signaling pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition USP1 by ML323 presented the similar effects on Hippo signaling pathway and suppressed OS growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results revealed a novel molecular mechanism underlying the function of USP1 in OS and a potential role of ML323 as a therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of OS.

AB  - BackgroundIntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical neurological condition with few treatment options, where secondary immune responses and specific cell death forms, like pyroptosis, worsen brain damage. Pyroptosis involves gasdermin-mediated membrane pores, increasing inflammation and neural harm, with the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway being central to this process. Peroxiredoxin II (Prx II), recognized for its mitochondrial protection and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging abilities, appears as a promising neuronal pyroptosis modulator. However, its exact role and action mechanisms need clearer definition. This research aims to explore Prx II impact on neuronal pyroptosis and elucidate its mechanisms, especially regarding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage modulation.Methods and resultsUtilizing MTT assays, Microscopy, Hoechst/PI staining, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence, we found Prx II effectively reduces LPS/ATP-induced pyroptosis and neuroinflammation in HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. Our results indicate Prx II's neuroprotective actions are mediated through PI3K/AKT activation and ER stress pathway inhibition, diminishing mitochondrial dysfunction and decreasing neuronal pyroptosis through the ROS/MAPK/NF-kappa B pathway. These findings highlight Prx II potential therapeutic value in improving intracerebral hemorrhage outcomes by lessening secondary brain injury via critical signaling pathway modulation involved in neuronal pyroptosis.ConclusionsOur study not only underlines Prx II importance in neuroprotection but also opens new therapeutic intervention avenues in intracerebral hemorrhage, stressing the complex interplay between redox regulation, ER stress, and mitochondrial dynamics in neuroinflammation and cell death management.

AB  - The dentate gyrus, a gateway for input to the hippocampal formation, arises from progenitors in the medial telencephalic neuroepithelium adjacent to the cortical hem. Dentate progenitors navigate a complex migratory path guided by two cell populations that arise from the hem, the fimbrial glia and Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells. As the hem expresses multiple Wnt genes, we examined whether beta-catenin, which mediates canonical Wnt signaling and also participates in cell adhesion, is necessary for the development of hem-derived lineages. We report that, in mice, the fimbrial glial scaffold is disorganized and CR cells are mispositioned upon hem-specific disruption of beta-catenin. Consequently, the dentate migratory stream is severely affected, and the dentate gyrus fails to form. Using selective Cre drivers, we further determined that beta-catenin function is required in the fimbrial glial scaffold, but not in the CR cells, for guiding the dentate migration. Our findings highlight a primary requirement for beta-catenin for the organization of the fimbrial scaffold and a secondary role for this factor in dentate gyrus morphogenesis.

AB  - During development, melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) become light sensitive much earlier than rods and cones. IpRGCs project to many subcortical areas, whereas physiological functions of these projections are yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that ipRGC-medi-ated light sensation promotes synaptogenesis of pyramidal neurons in various cortices and the hippocam-pus. This phenomenon depends on activation of ipRGCs and is mediated by the release of oxytocin from the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) into cerebral-spinal fluid. We further characterized a direct connection between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons in the SON and mutual projections between oxytocin neurons in the SON and PVN. Moreover, we showed that the lack of ipRGC-mediated, light -promoted early cortical synaptogenesis compromised learning ability in adult mice. Our results highlight the importance of light sensation early in life on the development of learning ability and therefore call attention to suitable light environment for infant care.

AB  - Cellular plasticity is crucial for adapting to ever-changing stimuli. As a result, cells consistently reshape their translatome, and, consequently, their proteome. The control of translational activity has been thoroughly examined at the stage of translation initiation. However, the regulation of ribosome speed in cells is widely unknown. In this study, we utilized a timed ribosome runoff approach, along with proteomics and transmission electron microscopy, to investigate global translation kinetics in cells. We found that ribosome speeds vary among various cell types, such as astrocytes, induced pluripotent human stem cells, human neural stem cells, and human and rat neurons. Of all cell types studied, mature cortical neurons exhibit the highest rate of translation. This finding is particularly remarkable because mature cortical neurons express the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) at lower levels than other cell types. Neurons solve this conundrum by inactivating a fraction of their ribosomes. As a result, the increase in eEF2 levels leads to a reduction of inactive ribosomes and an enhancement of active ones. Processes that alter the demand for active ribosomes, like neuronal excitation, cause increased inactivation of redundant ribosomes in an eEF2-dependent manner. Our data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism in which neurons dynamically inactivate ribosomes to facilitate translational remodeling. These findings have important implications for developmental brain disorders characterized by, among other things, aberrant translation.

AB  - The current research is an interdisciplinary endeavor to develop a necessary tool in preclinical protein studies of diseases or disorders through western blotting. In the era of digital transformation and open access principles, an interactive cloudbased database called East-West Blot (https://rancs-lab.shinyapps.io/WesternBlots) is designed and developed. The online interactive subject-specific database built on the R shiny platform facilitates a systematic literature search on the specific subject matter, here set to western blot studies of protein regulation in the preclinical model of TBI. The tool summarizes the existing publicly available knowledge through a data visualization technique and easy access to the critical data elements and links to the study itself. The application compiled a relational database of PubMed-indexed western blot studies labeled under HHS public access, reporting downstream protein regulations presented by fluid percussion injury model of traumatic brain injury. The promises of the developed tool include progressing toward implementing the principles of 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement) for humane experiments, cultivating the prerequisites of reproducible research in terms of reporting characteristics, paving the ways for a more collaborative experimental design in basic science, and rendering an up- to-date and summarized perspective of current publicly available knowledge.

AB  - Background: Acute lung injury commonly arises as a secondary complication following intestinal ischemia/ reperfusion (II/R) injury. Celastrol (CEL), recognized for its therapeutic effects on inflammation-related conditions such as acute lung injury. Its protective efficacy against II/R-induced acute lung injury remains insufficiently investigated. The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway regulates ferroptosis and plays a pivotal role in II/R injury. Purpose: To evaluate whether CEL can activate the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, suppress ferroptosis, and mitigate II/R-induced acute lung injury. Methods: Firstly, an II/R model in mice was established, Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were used to evaluate the effects of CEL on the Hippo signaling pathway and ferroptosis regulation. Network pharmacology predicted the relevance of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in CEL's improvement of acute lung injury. Molecular docking experiment indicated that CEL binds effectively to yes-associated protein (YAP), and overexpression of YAP significantly alleviated both lung injury and ferroptosis. Furthermore, the oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R) model of MLE-12 cells was developed to further confirm CEL's inhibition of ferroptosis via the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Results: CEL ameliorated II/R-induced acute lung injury and inhibited inflammation. In vivo and in vitro studies further revealed that CEL significantly reduced ferroptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the lung epithelial cells. Conclusion: CEL effectively mitigated ferroptosis and II/R-induced acute lung injury through elevating YAP protein level, reducing lipid peroxidation, and decreasing intracellular iron accumulation. This study highlights CEL's therapeutic potential for inhibiting ferroptosis, provides mechanistic insights to support CEL's broader therapeutic utility.

AB  - Handwriting is thought to impede vocabulary learning in sighted adults because the motor execution of writing interferes with efficient audiovisual processing during encoding. However, the motor memory of writing may facilitate adult word learning when visual sensory inputs are severely restricted. Using functional MRI, we show that late-blind participants, but not sighted participants, learned novel words by recruiting the left dorsal premotor cortex known as Exner's writing area and its functional coupling with the left hippocampus. During later recall, the phonological and semantic contents of these words are represented in the activation patterns of the left hippocampus as well as in those of left frontotemporal language areas. These findings suggest that motor codes of handwriting help blind participants maintain word-form representations during learning and retrieval. We propose that such reliance on the motor system reflects a broad architecture of the cerebral language network which encompasses the limb motor system as a hardwired component. Mizuochi-Endo et al. conduct a fMRI study, which reveals that in blind participants, unlike sighted participants, learning new words is associated with increased activity in Exner's area-a part of the brain known to play a crucial role in handwriting motor memory. This demonstrates the importance of writing motor memory in vocabulary learning in the blind.

AB  - Interest in the function of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) is extensively growing as evidenced by preclinical studies that continuously link ATM with new intracellular pathways. Here, we exploited Atm(+/-) and Atm(-/-) mice and demonstrate that cognitive defects are rescued by the delivery of the antidepressant Fluoxetine (Fluox). Fluox increases levels of the chloride intruder NKCC1 exclusively at hippocampal level suggesting an ATM context-specificity. A deeper investigation of synaptic composition unveils increased Gluk-1 and Gluk-5 subunit-containing kainate receptors (KARs) levels in the hippocampus, but not in the cortex, of Atm(+/-) and Atm(-/-) mice. Analysis of postsynaptic fractions and confocal studies indicates that KARs are presynaptic while in vitro and ex vivo electrophysiology that are fully active. These changes are (i) linked to KCC2 activity, as the KCC2 blockade in Atm(+/-) developing neurons results in reduced KARs levels and (ii) developmental regulated. Indeed, the pharmacological inhibition of ATM kinase in adults produces different changes as identified by RNA-seq investigation. Our data display how ATM affects both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission, extending its role to a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Stachydrine (STA), the principal bioactive alkaloid of Leonurus japonicus (Motherwort/"Yi Mu Cao"), may derive its ethnopharmacological relevance for epilepsy management from the botanical origin-Motherwort's documented traditional use in treating seizures and other neurological cardiovascular diseases. Aim of the study: To validate STA's ethnomedicinal claim an anticonvulsant by mechanistically interrogating its dual modulation of Notch1-driven neuroinflammation and NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, which are two key hallmarks of chronic epileptogenesis. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups to evaluate the neuroprotective and an anticonvulsant effects of STA in the PTZ-induced seizure model: Control group, PTZ group, and PTZ + STA group. Behavioral seizure scoring and cognitive tests were integrated with EEG recordings to assess neuronal synchronization. Molecular mechanisms were dissected via hippocampal immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Results: Our results showed that daily oral administration of STA for a duration of 25 days significantly reduced seizure scores. EEG recordings indicated that STA treatment resulted in a notable reduction in both total brainwave power and firing amplitude within the groups receiving STA. Furthermore, STA administration provided cognitive protection against kindling-associated deficits, as demonstrated by improved alteration behavior and recognition index in Y-maze and object recognition tests. STA administration reduced neuronal loss and glial cell activation. Additionally, significant downregulation of NMDA receptor subunits, CAMK2, caspase-3, Notch1, and Hes1 expression levels was observed following STA administration. Conclusion: These findings suggest that STA provides neuroprotection against PTZ-induced epilepsy by modulating the Notch and NMDA receptor pathways, thus addressing neuroinflammation and apoptosis resulting from excitotoxicity.

AB  - Background: Gut microbiota dysbiosis significantly contributes to progression of depression. Hypericum perforatum L. (HPL) is traditionally used in Europe for treating depression. However, its mechanism remains largely underexplored. Purpose: This study aims to investigate the pivotal gut microbiota species and microbial signaling metabolites associated with the antidepressant effects of HPL. Methods: Fecal microbiota transplantation was used to assess whether HPL mitigates depression through alterations in gut microbiota. Microbiota and metabolic profiling of control, chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced depression, and HPL-treated CRS mice were examined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis. The influence of gut microbiota on HPL's antidepressant effects was assessed by metabolite and bacterial intervention experiments. Results: HPL significantly alleviated depression symptoms in a manner dependent on gut microbiota and restored gut microbial composition by enriching Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK). Metabolomic analysis indicated that HPL regulated tryptophan metabolism, reducing kynurenine (KYN) levels derived from microbiota and increasing 5hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) levels. Notably, supplementation with KYN activated the NF kappa B-NLRP2-Caspase1IL1 beta pathway and increased proinflammatory IL1 beta in the hippocampus of mice with depression. Interestingly, mono-colonization with AKK notably increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and decreased KYN levels, ameliorating depression symptoms through modulation of the NF kappa B-NLRP2-Caspase1-IL1 beta pathway. Conclusions: The promising therapeutic role of HPL in treating depression is primarily attributed to its regulation of the NF kappa B-NLRP2-Caspase1-IL1 beta pathway, specifically by targeting AKK and tryptophan metabolites.

AB  - Our recent study revealed that continuous prenatal low-dose-rate irradiation did not induce cellular changes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in male B6C3F1 mice exposed to gamma rays during prenatal development. However, changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), locomotor ability, and mRNA and miRNA expressions in the hippocampus and blood were observed. To investigate potential sex differences in the effects of prenatal gamma irradiation, we conducted a parallel study on female B6C3F1 mice. The results showed significant reductions in the weight of the lungs and left kidney in prenatally irradiated female offspring, accompanied by significantly increased fat deposits in the mesentery, retroperitoneal, and left perigonadal areas. Despite these systemic changes, no cellular alterations were observed in the subgranular zone (immature neurons) or the hilus of the dentate gyrus (mature neurons and glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells). However, significant increases in hippocampal mRNA expression were detected for genes such as H2bc24, Fos, Cd74, Tent5a, Traip, and Sap25. Conversely, downregulation of mRNAs Inpp5j and Gdf3 was observed in whole blood. A Venn diagram highlighted the differential expression of two mRNAs, Ttn and Slc43a3, between the hippocampus and whole blood. Comparisons between prenatally irradiated male and female B6C3F1 mice revealed sex-specific differences. In whole blood, 4 mRNAs (Scd1, Cd59b, Vmn1r58, and Gm42427) and 1 miRNA (mmu-miR-8112) exhibited differential expression. In the hippocampus, 12 mRNAs and 2 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed between the sexes. qRT-PCR analysis validated the upregulation of H2bc24, Fos, Cd74, and Tent5a in the female hippocampus. These gene expression changes may be associated with the increased fat deposition observed following chronic low-dose-rate gamma irradiation exposure. This study underscores the importance of investigating sex-specific biological responses to prenatal gamma irradiation and highlights potential molecular pathways linked to observed physiological changes.

AB  - The alpha-arrestins form a large family of evolutionally conserved modulators that control diverse signaling pathways, including both G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated and non-GPCR-mediated pathways, across eukaryotes. However, unlike beta-arrestins, only a few alpha-arrestin targets and functions have been characterized. Here, using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we constructed interactomes for 6 human and 12 Drosophila alpha-arrestins. The resulting high-confidence interactomes comprised 307 and 467 prey proteins in human and Drosophila, respectively. A comparative analysis of these interactomes predicted not only conserved binding partners, such as motor proteins, proteases, ubiquitin ligases, RNA splicing factors, and GTPase-activating proteins, but also those specific to mammals, such as histone modifiers and the subunits of V-type ATPase. Given the manifestation of the interaction between the human alpha-arrestin, TXNIP, and the histone-modifying enzymes, including HDAC2, we undertook a global analysis of transcription signals and chromatin structures that were affected by TXNIP knockdown. We found that TXNIP activated targets by blocking HDAC2 recruitment to targets, a result that was validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Additionally, the interactome for an uncharacterized human alpha-arrestin ARRDC5 uncovered multiple components in the V-type ATPase, which plays a key role in bone resorption by osteoclasts. Our study presents conserved and species-specific protein-protein interaction maps for alpha-arrestins, which provide a valuable resource for interrogating their cellular functions for both basic and clinical research.

AB  - BackgroundsCerebral ischemia-reperfusion leads to brain tissue injury. Inflammation and apoptosis play pivotal roles in the pathology.Objectivea-Pinene is an organic compound of many aromatic plants and is known as a potent agent to possess antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we sought to identify the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis mechanism by which a-Pinene improves brain ischemia injury.ResultsMale Wistar rats underwent MCAO surgery for 1 h and different doses of alpha-pinene (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected immediately after reperfusion to test this hypothesis. IV, NDS, gene and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclogenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) p65, and caspase-3 were assessed 24 h after reperfusion. Results demonstrated that NF-?B p65, iNOS, and COX-2 gene and protein expression increased in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum after 24 h of reperfusion, and alpha-pinene significantly inhibited NF-kB p65, iNOS, and COX-2 expression. Also, alpha-pinene significantly reduced the ischemia/reperfusion-induced caspase-3 activation in CA1 area of hippocampus.ConclusionResults showed that alpha-pinene protects the cerebral against ischemic damage caused by MCAO, and this effect may be through the regulating iNOS -NF-kappa B- COX-2 and caspase-3 inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.

AB  - Neurons are subjected to various stresses, including high metabolic demand, physiological activity, and transcriptional regulation, to which their genomic DNA are vulnerable. Genome stability of neurons is essential for proper physiological brain function. Failure in accurate genomic DNA repair can result in abnormal neuronal functions or cell death. Genomic instability has been implicated in increased risks of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal genome stability remain poorly understood. Mutations in the Strawberry Notch Homolog 1 (SBNO1) have been suggested to contribute to these disorders. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying histological abnormalities observed in the cortex of Sbno1 knockout (KO) mice. Comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed that Sbno1 KO affects the expression of genes related to cell survival, consistent with the increased apoptosis observed in Sbno1 KO cortices. Among the genes downregulated in Sbno1 KO, we focused on Yeats4. Overexpression of Yeats4 rescued the accumulation of genomic DNA damage and cell death caused by Sbno1 deletion. These findings suggest that Sbno1 is critical in safeguarding the neuronal genome, at least in part, via regulating Yeats4 expression.

KW  - PATHWAY
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide. The Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as a significant suppressive pathway for hepatocellular carcinogenesis. The core components of the Hippo pathway constitute a kinase cascade, which inhibits the functional activation of YAP/TAZ. Interestingly, the overactivation of YAP/TAZ is commonly observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, although the inhibitory kinase cascade of the Hippo pathway is still functional. Recent studies have indicated that the ubiquitin-proteasome system also plays important roles in modulating Hippo signaling activity. Our DUB (deubiquitinase) siRNA screen showed that USP1 is a critical regulator of Hippo signaling activity. Analysis of TCGA data demonstrated that USP1 expression is elevated in HCC and associated with poor survival in HCC patients. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that USP1 depletion affects Hippo signaling activity in HCC cell lines. Mechanistic assays revealed that USP1 is required for Hippo/TAZ axis activity and HCC progression. USP1 interacted with the WW domain of TAZ, which subsequently enhanced TAZ stability by suppressing K11-linked polyubiquitination of TAZ. Our study identifies a novel mechanism linking USP1 and TAZ in regulating the Hippo pathway and one possible therapeutic target for HCC.

AB  - Oxidative stress is one of the earlier events causing neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer 's disease (AD). Gomisin N (GN), a lignin isolated from Schisandra chinensis , has anti-oxidative stress effects. There are currently no studies on the neuroprotective potential of GN in AD. In this study, two AD models were treated with GN for 8 weeks. The cognitive functions, amyloid deposition, and neuronal death were assessed. Additionally, the expressions of critical proteins in the GSK3 beta/Nrf2 signaling pathway were determined in vivo and in vitro . We showed that GN significantly upregulated the expressions of Nrf2, p-GSK3 beta Ser9 /GSK3 beta, NQO1 and HO -1 proteins in SHSY-5Y/ APPswe cells after H 2 O 2 injury, whereas the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reversed the increase in the expressions of Nrf2, p-GSK3 beta Ser9 /GSK3 beta, NQO1 and HO -1 proteins induced by GN administration. In a further study, GN could significantly improve the learning and memory dysfunctions of the rat and mouse AD models, reduce the area of A beta plaques in the hippocampus and cortex, and increase the number and function of neurons. Here, we first demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of GN on AD in vivo and in vitro . A possible mechanism by which GN prevents AD is proposed: GN significantly increased the expressions of Nrf2, p-GSK3 Ser9 /GSK3 beta and NQO1 proteins in the brain of AD animal models and promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation, then activated Nrf2 downstream genes to combat oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis. GN might be a promising therapeutic agent for AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer is a valuable medicinal herb and "alternative" remedy for the prevention and treatment of depression. Dysfunction of connexin43 (Cx43)-gap junction in astrocytes is predisposed to the precipitation of depression. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), the main bioactive constituent extracted from ginseng, is efficacious in the management of depression by upregulating the content of Cx43. Our previous results indicated that pretreatment with Rg1 significantly improved Cx43-gap junction in corticosterone (CORT)treated astrocytes. However, the antidepressant mechanism underlying how Rg1 upregulates Cx43-gap junction in astrocytes hasn't been proposed.
   Aim of the study: To dissect the mechanisms of Rg1 controlling Cx43 levels in primary astrocytes.
   Methods: We examined the changes of the level of Cx43 mRNA, the degradation of Cx43, as well as the ubiquitinproteasomal and autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathways of Cx43 followed by Rg1 prior to CORT in rat primary astrocytes isolated from prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, the recognized method of scrape loading/dye transfer was performed to detect Cx43-gap junctional function, an essencial indicator of the antidepressant effect.
   Results: Pretreatment with Rg1 could reverse CORT-induced downregulation of Cx43 biosynthesis, acceleration of Cx43 degradation, and upregulation of two Cx43 degradation pathways in primary astrocytes.
   Conclusion: The findings in the present study provide the first evidence highlighting that Rg1 increases Cx43 protein levels through the upregulation of Cx43 mRNA and downregulation of Cx43 degradation, which may be attributed to the effect of Rg1 on the ubiquitin-proteasomal and autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathways of Cx43.

AB  - Cartilage absorption and calcification are prone to occur after the implantation of diced cartilage wrapped with autologous materials, as well as prolong the operation time, aggravate surgical trauma and postoperative pain during the acquisition process. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has suitable toughness and excellent degradability, which has been widely used in the clinic. Urine-derived stem cells (USCs), as a new type of stem cells, have multi-directional differentiation potential. In this study, we attempt to create the tissue engineering membrane material, termed USCs-SIS (U-SIS), and wrap the diced cartilage with it, assuming that they can promote the survival and regeneration of cartilage. In this study, after co-culture with the SIS and U-SIS, the proliferation, migration and chondrogenesis ability of the auricular-derived chondrocyte cells (ACs) were significantly improved. Further, the expression levels of chondrocyte phenotype-related genes were up-regulated, whilst that of dedifferentiated genes was down-regulated. The signal pathway proteins (Wnt3a and Wnt5a) were also participated in regulation of chondrogenesis. In vivo, compared with perichondrium, the diced cartilage wrapped with the SIS and U-SIS attained higher survival rate, less calcification and absorption in both short and long terms. Particularly, USCs promoted chondrogenesis and modulated local immune responses via paracrine pathways. In conclusion, SIS have the potential to be a new choice of membrane material for diced cartilage graft. U-SIS can enhance survival and regeneration of diced cartilage as a bioactive membrane material.
   Schematic illustration of the study design. In vitro, the effects of SIS and U-SIS on the behaviour of chondrocyte: cell proliferation, migration, chondrogenic ability, regulation of protein secretion and changes in genes and signal pathway protein related to cartilage phenotype. In vivo, perichondrium, SIS and U-SIS wrapped diced cartilage were used for grafting and their effect on cartilage repair was evaluated in a rabbit ear cartilage defect model.image

AB  - Objectives The G72 mouse model of schizophrenia represents a well-known model that was generated to meet the main translational criteria of isomorphism, homology and predictability of schizophrenia to a maximum extent. In order to get a more detailed view of the complex etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia, whole genome transcriptome studies turn out to be indispensable. Here we carried out microarray data collection based on RNA extracted from the retrosplenial cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of G72 transgenic and wild-type control mice. Experimental animals were age-matched and importantly, both sexes were considered separately.Data description The isolated RNA from all three brain regions was purified, quantified und quality controlled before initiation of the hybridization procedure with SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression v2 8 x 60 K microarrays. Following immunofluorescent measurement und preprocessing of image data, raw transcriptome data from G72 mice and control animals were extracted and uploaded in a public database. Our data allow insight into significant alterations in gene transcript levels in G72 mice and enable the reader/user to perform further complex analyses to identify potential age-, sex- and brain-region-specific alterations in transcription profiles and related pathways. The latter could facilitate biomarker identification and drug research and development in schizophrenia research.

AB  - Plants encounter natural antagonist threats of varying intensity and respond by activating multiple defense traits. Due to the fitness costs associated with producing defense traits, plants are expected to activate less costly traits first, reserving more costly defenses for potentially more severe damage ("cheaper first hypothesis"), but evidence to date is scarce. Here, we tested this hypothesis by measuring six putative defense traits in the annual plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia. We found that all traits were effective against insect herbivores, but production of three of them more strongly reduced plant growth, suggesting higher growth costs. When plants were attacked by insect herbivores, less costly traits were induced first, even at the lowest levels of damage, while more costly traits were activated only after higher damage thresholds. This cost-dependent sequential pattern was consistently observed in plants when challenged by 12 different herbivore species from three insect orders. These findings demonstrate that plants can employ the "cheaper first" sequential induction defense strategy, potentially allowing them to reduce defense costs and maximize fitness. Our study provides new insights into how plants fine-tune their defense responses under variable antagonistic pressures.

AB  - Neuronal ferroptosis has been found to contribute to degenerative brain disorders and traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury, but whether radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI), a critical deleterious effect of cranial radiation therapy for primary and metastatic brain tumors, involves neuronal ferroptosis remains unclear. We have recently discovered that deletion of reprimo (RPRM), a tumor suppressor gene, ameliorates RIBI, in which its protective effect on neurons is one of the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we found that whole brain irradiation (WBI) induced ferroptosis in mouse brain, manifesting as alterations in mitochondrial morphology, iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation and a dramatic reduction in glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) level. Moreover, the hippocampal ferroptosis induced by ionizing irradiation (IR) mainly happened in neurons. Intriguingly, RPRM deletion protected the brain and primary neurons against IR-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, RPRM deletion prevented iron accumulation by reversing the significant increase in the expression of iron storage protein ferritin heavy chain (Fth), ferritin light chain (Ftl) and iron importer transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1), as well as enhancing the expression of iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn) after IR. RPRM deletion also inhibited lipid peroxidation by abolishing the reduction of GPX4 and stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1) induced by IR. Importantly, RPRM deletion restored or even increased the expression of nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2) in irradiated neurons. On top of that, compromised cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) signaling was found to be responsible for the down-regulation of Nrf2 and SCD1 after irradiation, specifically, RPRM bound to CREB and promoted its degradation after IR, leading to a reduction of CREB protein level, which in turn down-regulated Nrf2 and SCD1. Thus, RPRM deletion recovered Nrf2 and SCD1 through its impact on CREB. Taken together, neuronal ferroptosis is involved in RIBI, RPRM deletion prevents IR-induced neuronal ferroptosis through restoring CREB-Nrf2/SCD1 pathways.

AB  - Mitochondrial function plays a crucial role in cancer development, with mitochondrial energy metabolism-related genes (MEMRGs) contributing to carcinogenesis. This study investigates the role of MEMRGs in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) by analyzing RNA-seq data from TCGA and GEO databases to identify differentially expressed MEMRGs. Functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses revealed their significant involvement in metabolic pathways. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and consensus clustering, two distinct ICC subtypes were identified. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), immune cell infiltration, and immune escape potential were assessed, highlighting the importance of the Hippo/YAP pathway. Cox regression analyses pinpointed key prognostic genes, including ADH1A, ADH1B, and CYP4A11. A MEMRG-based nomogram was developed that accurately predicted 1- and 3-year survival outcomes. Experimental validation showed that ADH1B suppresses ICC malignancy through the Hippo/YAP pathway. These findings suggest that MEMRGs are vital in ICC progression and immune regulation, serving as promising prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, though further validation is required.

AB  - Our previous study revealed that prolonged human rhinovirus (HRV) infection rapidly induces antiviral interferons (IFNs) and chemokines during the acute stage of infection. It also showed that expression levels of RIG-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were sustained in tandem with the persistent expression of HRV RNA and HRV proteins at the late stage of the 14-day infection period. Some studies have explored the protective effects of initial acute HRV infection on secondary influenza A virus (IAV) infection. However, the susceptibility of human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) to re-infection by the same HRV serotype, and to secondary IAV infection following prolonged primary HRV infection, has not been studied in detail. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of HRV persistence on the susceptibility of hNECs against HRV re-infection and secondary IAV infection. We analyzed the viral replication and innate immune responses of hNECs infected with the same HRV serotype A16 and IAV H3N2 at 14 days after initial HRV-A16 infection. Prolonged primary HRV infection significantly diminished the IAV load of secondary H3N2 infection, but not the HRV load of HRV-A16 re-infection. The reduced IAV load of secondary H3N2 infection may be explained by increased baseline expression levels of RIG-I and ISGs, specifically MX1 and IFITM1, which are induced by prolonged primary HRV infection. As is congruent with this finding, in those cells that received early and multi-dose pre-treatment with Rupintrivir (HRV 3C protease inhibitor) prior to secondary IAV infection, the reduction in IAV load was abolished compared to the group without pre-treatment with Rupintrivir. In conclusion, the antiviral state induced from prolonged primary HRV infection mediated by RIG-I and ISGs (including MX1 and IFITM1) can confer a protective innate immune defense mechanism against secondary influenza infection.

AB  - Background: Autophagy-lysosome abnormalities are associated with the malignant progression of cancer. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is the master transcriptional regulator of the autophagy-lysosome machinery, and its abnormal activity is associated with autophagy-lysosome dysfunction. Polyphyllin II (PPII), an active steroidal saponin isolated from the rhizomes of Paris polyphylla, has been demonstrated to have antitumor activity.
   Purpose: Here, we explored the antitumor activity of PPII in breast cancer (BC) and further clarified its mechanism.
   Methods: Autophagosome was detected by transmission electron microscopy, an autophagy indicator system, and western blot. The effect of PPII on lysosomal activity was evaluated by flow cytometry, a lysosomal cathepsin activity assay, and acridine orange staining. The effect of PPII on the signaling pathway was evaluated by Western blot, gene expression measurement, gene alterations. The binding of PPII and MOB1 was examined through a drug affinity responsive target stability assay. The pharmacokinetic parameters of PPII were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Results: PPII exhibits therapeutic potential in BC by inducing the accumulation of autophagosome. PPII promotes the cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TFEB, which is responsible for the accumulation of autophagosome in BC. PPII activates Hippo signaling to promote cytoplasmic retention of YAP. PPII activates Hippo signaling by accelerating acetylation of MOB1 through a direct binding interaction.
   Conclusion: Taken together, these results confirm that acetylation of MOB1 mediates PPII-induced autophagosome accumulation in BC by promoting cytoplasmic retention of the YAP/TFEB coactivator complex. PPII is expected to be a drug candidate for the treatment of BC based on lysosomal biosynthesis.

AB  - The entorhinal cortex (EC) connects to the hippocampus sending different information from cortical areas that is first processed at the dentate gyrus (DG) including spatial, limbic and sensory information. Excitatory afferents from lateral (LPP) and medial (MPP) perforant pathways of the EC connecting to granule cells of the DG play a role in memory encoding and information processing and are deeply affected in humans suffering Alzheimer's disease and temporal lobe epilepsy, contributing to the dysfunctions found in these pathologies. The plasticity of these synapses is not well known yet, as are not known the forms of long-term depression (LTD) existing at those connections. We investigated whether spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) exists at these two different EC-DG synaptic connections in mice, and whether they have different action mechanisms. We have found two different forms of t-LTD, at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses and characterised their cellular and intracellular mechanistic requirements. We found that both forms of t-LTD are expressed presynaptically and that whereas t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses does not require NMDAR, t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDAR containing GluN2A subunits. The two forms of t-LTD require different group I mGluR, mGluR5 LPP-GC synapses and mGluR1 MPP-GC synapses. In addition, both forms of t-LTD require postsynaptic calcium, eCB synthesis, CB1R, astrocyte activity, and glutamate released by astrocytes. Thus, we discovered two novel forms of t-LTD that require astrocytes at EC-GC synapses.

AB  - To solve the problem of poor recognition accuracy caused by various colors, uneven distribution, and occlusion by branches and leaves of Camellia oleifera fruits under natural growth conditions, this study proposes an improved deep learning network, YOLOv5s-CEDB, for Camellia oleifera fruit detection based on YOLOv5s. Coordinate Attention Mechanism (CoordAtt), Deformable Convolution (DConv), and Explicit Visual Center (EVC) are introduced to enhance the network's local and global feature extraction performance. To improve the detection performance for small and dense targets, the feature fusion module of the network was replaced with the designed light-bidirectional feature pyramid (light-BiFPN) structure. GhostConv was used to reduce the parameters and inference speed of the structure. A dataset with different light conditions, colors, and density levels of Camellia oleifera fruits was established, and performance evaluation experiments were conducted. Experimental results showed that the mean Average Precision (mAP) and F1-score of the designed YOLOv5sCEDB network reached 91.4 % and 89.6 %, respectively, which were 2.6 % and 3.6 % higher than those of the original YOLOv5s model, respectively, and the influencing frame rate arrived at 37.6 FPS. Under different colors, distribution densities, occlusion scenarios, and light intensities, the detection accuracy of the YOLOv5sCEDB network model was significantly better than those of the YOLOv5s, YOLOv8s and Faster-RCNN networks. It was verified that the proposed YOLOv5s-CEDB network could significantly improve the accuracy and stability of Camellia oleifera fruit detection, satisfying the requirements of yield estimation and intelligent harvesting.

AB  - Dendritic spines are small, actin-rich protrusions that act as the receiving sites of most excitatory inputs in the central nervous system. The remodeling of the synapse architecture is mediated by actin cytoskeleton dynamics, a process precisely regulated by the small Rho GTPase family. Wnt ligands exert their presynaptic and postsynaptic effects during formation and consolidation of the synaptic structure. Specifically, Wnt5a has been identified as an indispensable synaptogenic factor for the regulation and organization of the postsynaptic side; however, the molecular mechanisms through which Wnt5a induces morphological changes resulting from actin cytoskeleton dynamics within dendritic spines remain unclear. In this work, we employ primary rat hippocampal cultures and HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cell models, molecular and pharmacological tools, and fluorescence microscopy (laser confocal and epifluorescence) to define the Wnt5a-induced molecular signaling involved in postsynaptic remodeling mediated via the regulation of the small Rho GTPase family. We report that Wnt5a differentially regulates the phosphorylation of Cofilin in neurons through both Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 and cell division cycle 42 depending on the subcellular compartment and the extracellular calcium levels. Additionally, we demonstrate that Wnt5a increases the density of dendritic spines and promotes their maturation via Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1. Accordingly, we find that Wnt5a requires the combined activation of small Rho GTPases to increase the levels of filamentous actin, thus promoting the stability of actin filaments. Altogether, these results provide evidence for a new mechanism by which Wnt5a may target actin dynamics, thereby regulating the subsequent morphological changes in dendritic spine architecture.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to explore the sex-specific effects and mechanisms of sevoflurane exposure on the neural development of pubertal rats on the basis of M1/M2 microglial cell polarisation and related signalling pathways. A total of 48 rat pups (24 males and 24 females) were assigned to the 0- or 2-h sevoflurane exposure group on the seventh day after birth. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was subsequently conducted on the 32nd to 38th days after birth. M1/M2 microglial cell polarisation, C3 and TLR4 expression, and synapse growth were analysed within specific brain zones by immunofluorescence after the MWM test. We found that the negative effects caused by sevoflurane exposure were weaker in female rats than in male rats and had less influence on spatial memory. Sevoflurane exposure has opposite effects on microglial M1 polarisation in the different sexes but can promote M2 polarisation, with more obvious effects seen in female rats. In addition, sevoflurane exposure had bidirectional effects on C3 expression in different zones, while it clearly downregulated C3 expression in female rats. Moreover, sevoflurane decreased TLR4 expression in the hippocampus, whereas female rats exhibited better resistance, especially in the dentate gyrus. Compared with male rats, female rats were more resistant to the synaptic reduction effect of sevoflurane exposure. In conclusion, we found that neonatal sevoflurane exposure could exhibit sex-specific effects via the regulation of C3- and TLR4-related microglial cell polarisation. In addition, subregional regulation in the hippocampus might also contribute to its sex-specific effects.

AB  - Aging-induced proteinopathies, including deterioration of amyloid beta (A beta) conformation, are associated with reductions in endogenous levels of carnosine and cognitive impairments. Carnosine is a well-known endogenous antioxidant, which counteracts aging-induced A beta plaque formation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exogenous carnosine treatments on aging-induced changes (a) in the steady-state level of endogenous carnosine and conformation of A beta secondary structure in the different brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons-medulla, and cerebellum) and (b) cognitive function. Young (4 months) and aged (18 and 24 months) male albino Wistar rats were treated with carnosine (2.0 mu g kg(-1) day(-1); i.t.) or equivalent volumes of vehicle (saline) for 21 consecutive days and were tested for cognition using 8-arm radial maze test. Brains were processed to assess the conformational integrity of A beta plaques using Raman spectroscopy and endogenous levels of carnosine were measured in the brain regions using HPLC. Results indicated that carnosine treatments improved the aging-induced deficits in cognitive function and reduced the beta-sheets in the secondary structure of A beta protein, as well as mitigating the reduction in the steady-state levels of carnosine and spine density in the brain regions examined. These results thus, suggest that carnosine can attenuate the aging-induced: (a) conformational changes in A beta secondary structure by reducing the abundance of beta-sheets and reductions in carnosine content in the brain regions and (b) cognitive impairment.

AB  - Prostate development and regeneration depend on prostate stem cell function, the delicate balance of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. However, mechanisms modulating prostate stem cell function remain poorly identified. Here, we explored the roles of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) in prostate stem cells, prostate development and regeneration. Using YAPfl/fl, CD133-CreER mice, we found that stem cell-specific YAP-deficient mice had compromised branching morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation, resulting in damaged prostate development. YAP inhibition also significantly affected the regeneration process of mice prostate, leading to impaired regenerated prostate. Furthermore, YAP ablation in prostate stem cells significantly reduced its self-renewal activity in vitro, and attenuated prostate regeneration of prostate grafts in vivo. Further analysis revealed a decrease in Notch and Hedgehog pathways expression in YAP inhibition cells, and treatment with exogenous Shh partially restored the self-renewal ability of prostate sphere cells. Taken together, our results revealed the roles of YAP in prostate stem cell function and prostate development and regeneration through regulation of the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways.

AB  - The germ cell lineage in mammals is induced by the stimulation of pluripotent epiblast cells by signaling molecules. Previous studies have suggested that the germ cell differentiation competence or responsiveness of epiblast cells to signaling molecules is established and maintained in epiblast cells of a specific differentiation state. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process has not been well defined. Here, using the differentiation model of mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), we have shown that two defined EpiSC lines have robust germ cell differentiation competence. However, another defined EpiSC line has no competence. By evaluating the molecular basis of EpiSCs with distinct germ cell differentiation competence, we identified YAP, an intracellular mediator of the Hippo signaling pathway, as crucial for the establishment of germ cell induction. Strikingly, deletion of YAP severely affected responsiveness to inductive stimuli, leading to a defect in WNT target activation and germ cell differentiation. In conclusion, we propose that the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway creates a potential for germ cell fate induction via mesodermal WNT signaling in pluripotent epiblast cells.

AB  - The SNARE proteins are central in membrane fusion and, at the synapse, neurotransmitter release. However, their involvement in the dual regulation of the synchronous release while maintaining a pool of readily releasable vesicles remains unclear. Using a chimeric approach, we performed a systematic analysis of the SNARE domain of STX1A by exchanging the whole SNARE domain or its N- or C-terminus subdomains with those of STX2. We expressed these chimeric constructs in STX1-null hippocampal mouse neurons. Exchanging the C-terminal half of STX1's SNARE domain with that of STX2 resulted in a reduced RRP accompanied by an increased release rate, while inserting the C-terminal half of STX1's SNARE domain into STX2 leads to an enhanced priming and decreased release rate. Additionally, we found that the mechanisms for clamping spontaneous, but not for Ca2+-evoked release, are particularly susceptible to changes in specific residues on the outer surface of the C-terminus of the SNARE domain of STX1A. Particularly, mutations of D231 and R232 affected the fusogenicity of the vesicles. We propose that the C-terminal half of the SNARE domain of STX1A plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the RRP as well as in the clamping of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion through the regulation of the energetic landscape for fusion, while it also plays a covert role in the speed and efficacy of Ca2+-evoked release.

AB  - The subthreshold voltage-gated transient K+ current (I-A) carried by pore-forming Kv4.2 subunits regulates the propagation of synaptic input, dendritic excitability, and synaptic plasticity in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites of the hippocampus. We report that the Ca2+ channel subunit Cav2.3 regulates I-A in this cell type. We initially identified Cav2.3 as a Kv4.2-interacting protein in a proteomic screen and we confirmed Cav2.3-Kv4.2 complex association using multiple techniques. Functionally, Cav2.3 Ca2+-entry increases Kv4.2-mediated whole-cell current due to an increase in Kv4.2 surface expression. Using pharmacology and Cav2.3 knockout mice, we show that Cav2.3 regulates the dendritic gradient of I-A. Furthermore, the loss of Cav2.3 function leads to the enhancement of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents and NMDA receptor-mediated spine Ca2+ influx. These results propose that Cav2.3 and Kv4.2 are integral constituents of an ion channel complex that affects synaptic function in the hippocampus.

AB  - The coexistence of plant-herbivore populations in an ecological system is a fundamental topic of research in mathematical ecology. Plant-herbivore interactions are often described by using discrete-time models in the case of non-overlapping generations: such generations have some specific time interval of life and their old generations are replaced by new generations after some regular interval of time. Keeping in mind the dynamical reliability of continuous-time models we presented two discrete-time plant-herbivore models. Mainly, by applying Euler's forward method a discrete-time plant-herbivore model is obtained from a continuous-time plant-herbivore model. In addition, a dynamically consistent discrete-time plant-herbivore model is obtained by applying a nonstandard difference scheme. Moreover, local stability is discussed and the existence of bifurcation about positive equilibrium is shown under some mathematical conditions. To control bifurcation and chaos, a modified hybrid technique is developed. Finally, to support our theocratical results and to show the dynamical reliability of the nonstandard difference scheme some numerical examples are provided.

AB  - Atranorin (ATR) is one of lichens' many known secondary metabolites. Most current studies have investigated the various effects of ATR in vitro and only sporadically in vivo. The latest data indicate that ATR may have anxiolytic/antidepressive effects. This study aimed to analyze the potential of ATR in a depression-like state in male Wistar rats. Pregnant females were stressed by restricting their mobility in the final week of pregnancy three times a day for 45 min each, for three following days. After birth, progeny aged 60 days was stressed repeatedly. The male progeny was divided into three groups as follows: CTR group as a healthy control (n = 10), DEP group as a progeny of restricted mothers (n = 10), and ATR group as a progeny of restricted mothers, treated daily for one month with ATR (n = 10; 10 mg/kg of body weight, p.o.). Our results show that ATR acts as an antioxidant and markedly changes animal behavior. Concomitantly, hippocampal neurogenesis increases in the hilus and subgranular zone, together with the number of NeuN mature neurons in the hilus and CA1 regions. Our results indicate a potential antidepressant/anxiolytic effect of ATR. However, further studies in this area are needed.

AB  - Protein S-palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational lipid modification that plays a critical role in neuronal development and plasticity, while dysregulated S-palmitoylation underlies a number of severe neurological disorders. Dynamic S-palmitoylation is regulated by a large family of ZDHHC palmitoylating enzymes, their accessory proteins, and a small number of known de-palmitoylating enzymes. Here, we curated and analyzed expression data for the proteins that regulate S-palmitoylation from publicly available RNAseq datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of their distribution in the mouse nervous system. We developed a web-tool that enables interactive visualization of the expression patterns for these proteins in the nervous system (), and explored this resource to find region and cell-type specific expression patterns that give insight into the function of palmitoylating and de-palmitoylating enzymes in the brain and neurological disorders. We found coordinated expression of ZDHHC enzymes with their accessory proteins, de-palmitoylating enzymes and other brain-expressed genes that included an enrichment of S-palmitoylation substrates. Finally, we utilized ZDHHC expression patterns to predict and validate palmitoylating enzyme-substrate interactions.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by amyloid beta (A beta) and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation in the brain. Recent studies indicated that memory retrieval, rather than memory formation, was impaired in the early stage of AD. Our previous study reported that pharmacological activation of hippocampal Epac2 promoted memory retrieval in C57BL/6J mice. A recent study suggested that pharmacological inhibition of Epac2 prevented synaptic potentiation mediated by GluA3-containing AMPARs. In this study, we aimed to investigate proteins associated with Epac2-mediated memory in hippocampal postmortem samples of AD patients and healthy controls compared with the experimental AD model J20 and wild-type mice. Epac2 and phospho-Akt were downregulated in AD patients and J20 mice, while Epac1 and phospho-ERK1/2 were not altered. GluA3 was reduced in J20 mice and tended to decrease in AD patients. PSD95 tended to decrease in AD patients and J20. Interestingly, AKAP5 was increased in AD patients but not in J20 mice, implicating its role in tau phosphorylation. Our study points to the downregulation of hippocampal expression of proteins associated with Epac2 in AD.

AB  - In pediatric and intensive care units, propofol is widely used for general anesthesia and sedation procedures as a short-acting anesthetic. Multiple studies have revealed that propofol causes hippocampal injury and cognitive dysfunction in developing animals. As is known, GM1, a type of ganglioside, plays a crucial role in promoting nervous system development. Consequently, this study explored whether GM1 mitigated neurological injury caused by propofol during developmental stages and investigated its underlying mechanisms. Seven-day-old SD rats or PC12 cells were used in this study for histopathological analyses, a Morris water maze test, a lactate dehydrogenase release assay, Western blotting, and an ELISA. Furthermore, LY294002 was employed to explore the potential neuroprotective effect of GM1 via the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade. The results indicated that GM1 exerted a protective effect against hippocampal morphological damage and pyroptosis as well as behavioral abnormalities following propofol exposure by increasing p-PI3K and p-AKT expression while decreasing p-p65 expression in developing rats. Nevertheless, the inhibitor LY294002, which targets the PI3K/AKT cascade, attenuated the beneficial effects of GM1. Our study provides evidence that GM1 confers neuroprotection and attenuates propofol-induced developmental neurotoxicity, potentially involving the PI3K/AKT/NF-kappa B signaling cascade.

AB  - Lesions to the corticospinal tract result in several neurological symptoms and several rehabilitation protocols have proven useful in attempts to direct underlying plastic phenomena. However, the effects that such protocols may exert on the dendritic spines of motoneurons to enhance accuracy during rehabilitation are unknown. Thirty three female Sprague-Dawley adult rats were injected stereotaxically at the primary motor cerebral cortex (Fr1) with saline (CTL), or kainic acid (INJ), or kainic acid and further rehabilitation on a treadmill 16 days after lesion (INJ+RB). Motor performance was evaluated with the the Basso, Beatie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale and in the Rotarod. Spine density was quantified in a primary dendrite of motoneurons in Lamina IX in the ventral horn of the thoracolumbar spinal cord as well as spine morphology. AMPA, BDNF, PSD-95 and synaptophysin expression was evaluated by Western blot. INJ+RB group showed higher scores in motor performance. Animals from the INJ+RB group showed more thin, mushroom, stubby and wide spines than the CTL group, while the content of AMPA, BDNF, PSD-95 and Synaptophysin was not different between the groups INJ+RB and CTL. AMPA and synaptophysin content was greater in INJ group than in CTL and INJ+RB groups. The increase in the proportion of each type of spine observed in INJ+RB group suggest spinogenesis and a greater capability to integrate the afferent information to motoneurons under relatively stable molecular conditions at the synaptic level.

AB  - Background: The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of atherosclerosis co-depression are poor, so it is urgent to explore new targets. Based on the "microbiota-gut-brain axis," this study aimed to investigate the changes of lipid metabolites in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus regions and the characteristics of the gut microbiota in ApoE(-/-) mice with atherosclerosis co-depression.Methods: ApoE(-/-) mice (hyperlipid feeding combined with binding, HFB group, n = 14, male) fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks with binding stimulation were used as an animal model for atherosclerosis co-depression. The depression degree of mice was evaluated by body weight, sucrose preference test, open field test, and tail suspension test. Oil-red O staining, HE staining, and biochemical parameters were used to evaluate the damage degree of atherosclerosis in mice. LC-MS/MS technique for non-targeted lipidomics analysis was used to analyze the differential lipid metabolites in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus regions of mice. 16S rDNA amplification sequencing was used to screen the differential gut microbial, and association analysis was performed with the differential lipid metabolites.Results: Compared with the normal control group (NC group), the HFB group showed depression-like behaviors and atherosclerosis-related pathological indicators. The differential lipid metabolites in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus regions were mainly LPC, LPE, LPS, PC, PE, PS, PI, and GD1a, and were mainly enriched in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway and the retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathway. At the same time, there were significant differences in the structure of the gut microbial community between the two groups. The abundance of Deferribacteres and Proteobacteria in the HFB group increased, while the abundance of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria decreased at the phylum level; the abundance of Desulfovibrio, Clostridium_IV, Helicobacter and Pseudoflavonifractor increased, while the abundance of Akkermansia decreased at the genus level.Conclusion: Atherosclerosis co-depression of ApoE(-/-) mice of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus lipid metabolism pathways of disorder and the changes of to the gut microbiota, which leads to abnormal white matter and synaptic dysfunction, increased gut inflammation, and decreased gut permeability, leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines, there is a strong correlation between both, it further confirmed the existence of the "microbiota-gut-brain axis."

TI  - The Combination of β-Asarone and Icariin Inhibits Amyloid-β and Reverses Cognitive Deficits by Promoting Mitophagy in Models of Alzheimer's Disease

KW  - AUTOPHAGY

AB  - beta-Asarone is the main constituent of Acorus tatarinowii Schott and exhibits important effects in diseases such as neurodegenerative and neurovascular diseases. Icariin (ICA) is a major active ingredient of Epimedium that has attracted increasing attention because of its unique pharmacological effects in degenerative disease. In this paper, we primarily explored the effects of the combination of beta-asarone and ICA in clearing noxious proteins and reversing cognitive deficits. The accumulation of damaged mitochondria and mitophagy are hallmarks of aging and age-related neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we provide evidence that autophagy/mitophagy is impaired in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and in A beta 1-42-induced PC12 cell models. Enhanced mitophagic activity has been reported to promote A beta and tau clearance in in vitro and in vivo models. Meanwhile, there is growing evidence that treatment of AD should be preceded by intervention before the formation of pathological products. The efficacy of the combination therapy was better than that of the individual therapies applied separately. Then, we found that the combination therapy also inhibited cell and mitochondrial damage by inducing autophagy/mitophagy. These findings suggest that impaired removal of defective mitochondria is a pivotal event in AD pathogenesis, and that combination treatment with mitophagy inducers represents a potential strategy for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a devastating condition. Although progress has been made in the past seven decades, patients with MDD continue to receive an inadequate treatment, primarily due to the late onset of first-line antidepressant drugs and to their acute withdrawal symptoms. Resilience is the ability to rebound from adversity in a healthy manner and many people have psychological resilience. Revealing the mechanisms and identifying methods promoting resilience will hopefully lead to more effective prevention strategies and treatments for depression. In this study, we found that intermittent hypobaric hypoxia training (IHHT), a method for training pilots and mountaineers, enhanced psychological resilience in adult mice. IHHT produced a sustained antidepressant-like effect in mouse models of depression by inducing long-term (up to 3 months after this treatment) overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of adult mice. Moreover, DRN-infusion of cobalt chloride, which mimics hypoxia increasing HIF-1 alpha expression, triggered a rapid and long-lasting antidepressant-like effect. Down-regulation of HIF-1 alpha in the DRN serotonergic (DRN5-HT) neurons attenuated the effects of IHHT. HIF-1 alpha translationally regulated the expression of P2X2, and conditionally knocking out P2rx2 (encodes P2X2 receptors) in DRN5-HT neurons, in turn, attenuated the sustained antidepressant-like effect of IHHT, but not its acute effect. In line with these results, a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine enhanced HIF-1 alpha-P2X2 signaling, which is essential for its rapid and long-lasting antidepressant-like effect. Notably, we found that P2X2 protein levels were significantly lower in the DRN of patients with MDD than that of control subjects. Together, these findings elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying IHHT promoting psychological resilience and highlight enhancing HIF-1 alpha-P2X2 signaling in DRN5-HT neurons as a potential avenue for screening novel therapeutic treatments for MDD.

AB  - Cannabinoids, used for centuries for recreational and medical purposes, have potential therapeutic value in stroke treatment. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound and partial agonist of TRPV2 channels, is efficacious in many neurological disorders. We investigated the effects of CBD or Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in rat organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of ischemia. Neuronal TRPV2 expression decreased after OGD, but it increased in activated, phagocytic microglia. CBD increased TRPV2 expression, decreased microglia phagocytosis, and increased rod microglia after OGD. THC had effects contrary to those of CBD. Our results show that cannabinoids have different effects in ischemia. CBD showed neuroprotective effects, mediated, at least in part, by TRPV2 channels, since the TRPV2 antagonist tranilast blocked them, while THC worsened the neurodegeneration caused by ischemia. In conclusion, our results suggest that different cannabinoid molecules play different roles in the mechanisms of post-ischemic neuronal death. These different effects of cannabinoid observed in our experiments caution against the indiscriminate use of cannabis or cannabinoid preparations for recreational or therapeutic use. It was observed that the positive effects of CBD may be counteracted by the negative effects caused by high levels of THC.

AB  - Objectives Necroptosis is widespread in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we examined necroptosis in the hippocampus and cortex after hydrocephalus and found that a necroptosis pathway inhibitor alleviates necroptosis and provides neuroprotective effects. Materials and methods Hydrocephalus was induced in C57BL/6 mice by kaolin. Haematoxylin and eosin (HE), Nissl, PI and Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining were used for general observations. Phosphorylated receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (p-RIP3) and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like (p-MLKL) were measured by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe ependymal cilia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the Morris water maze (MWM) test were used to assess neurobehavioral changes. Immunofluorescence was used to detect microglial and astrocyte activation. Inflammatory cytokines were measured by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Results Obvious pathological changes appeared in the hippocampus and cortex after hydrocephalus, and expression of the necroptosis markers p-RIP3, p-MLKL and inflammatory cytokines increased. Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and GSK872 reduced necrotic cell death, attenuated p-RIP3 and p-MLKL levels, slightly improved neurobehaviours and inhibited microglial and astrocyte activation and inflammation. Conclusions RIP1/RIP3/MLKL mediates necroptosis in the cortex and hippocampus in a hydrocephalus mouse model, and Nec-1 and GSK872 have some neuroprotective effects.

AB  - Depression is highly prevalent in patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases. Dysregulated neuroinflammation and concomitant-activated microglia play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of depression. As one of the biologically functional phytochemicals in soybeans, soy isoflavones (SI) have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, estrogen-like and neuroprotective activities. However, there is no research on how SI administration affects the depressive-like behavior induced by neuroinflammation. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the antidepressant-like action of SI in acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice and to explore its underlying mechanisms. An open field test, a sucrose preference experiment, a tail suspension test and a forced swimming task were conducted to assess the influence of SI on the depressive-like behavior induced by LPS injection. Then, the levels of the pro-inflammation cytokines, tryptophan (Trp) metabolism in the cortex and hippocampus, and the synaptic plasticity-related signal pathway in the hippocampus, which are involved in the pathophysiology of depression, were examined. The results showed that SI administration remarkably alleviated LPS-induced depressive-like behavior as indicated by the increased sucrose preference index and the decreased immobility time both in the tail suspension test and the forced swimming task. SI significantly suppressed neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of LPS mice, as indicated by a decrease in the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and suppression of the signal pathway of TLR4/NF-kappa B. Additionally, SI administration regulated tryptophan (Trp) metabolism by increasing 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels, inhibiting the release of kynurenine (KYN) in the cortex and hippocampus, and elevating the expressions of synaptic plasticity-related protein markers such as postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SYN). The current study demonstrated that soy isoflavones could reverse LPS-induced depressive-like behavior by suppressing neuroinflammation, normalizing the Trp metabolism, up-regulating the expressions of synaptic plasticity-related proteins, and inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway activation in the hippocampus of mice, exerting their antidepressant-like action.

AB  - The beneficial effects of diet and exercise on brain function are traditionally attributed to the enhancement of autophagy, which plays a key role in neuroprotection via the degradation of potentially harmful intracellular structures. The molecular machinery of autophagy has also been suggested to influence synaptic signaling via interaction with trafficking and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and proteins. Still, the role of autophagy in the regulation of synaptic plasticity remains elusive, especially in the mammalian brain. We explored the impact of autophagy on synaptic transmission and homeostatic and acute synaptic plasticity using transgenic mice with induced deletion of the Beclin1 protein. We observed down-regulation of glutamatergic and up-regulation of GABAergic synaptic currents and impairment of long-term plasticity in the neocortex and hippocampus of Beclin1-deficient mice. Beclin1 deficiency also significantly reduced the effects of environmental enrichment, caloric restriction and its pharmacological mimetics (metformin and resveratrol) on synaptic transmission and plasticity. Taken together, our data strongly support the importance of autophagy in the regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the neocortex and hippocampus. Our results also strongly suggest that the positive modulatory actions of metformin and resveratrol in acute and homeostatic synaptic plasticity, and therefore their beneficial effects on brain function, occur via the modulation of autophagy.

AB  - Impact statementFecal or bowel incontinence as a result of a torn anal sphincter complex remains undetected for many years. The resulting defect does not respond well to surgical repair. Regenerating the anal sphincter complex with functional muscle has been a long-term goal. Stem cells home to a site of a chronic injury and cause regeneration when a cell signaling mechanism is available. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 is one such cytokine that has been well researched by us and others to have this effect. It is easy to use clinically and has been used in other applications in humans and considered safe.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate if a high dose of the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) plasmid improves outcome in a minipig model of chronic anal sphincter injury.Methods: Twenty-two female minipigs underwent excision of the posterior hemicircumference of the anal sphincter complex and were allowed to recover for 6 weeks. They were randomly allocated (n = 6) to receive either 5% dextrose (sham) or 2, 4, or 8 mg of SDF-1 plasmid at the defect site. Two control pigs received no surgery/treatment. Outcome measures included anal manometry at preinjury/pretreatment and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after treatment, recording the mean of eight pressure channels and the posterior channel alone, histopathology using Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemistry using PGP9.5 for staining of neural structures, and CY3 staining for blood vessels. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard error. Manometry analysis used two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Holm-Sidak test. Quantification of muscle/fibrosis was analyzed with a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks.Results: Posterior anal pressures were significantly decreased in sham treated animals compared with controls (p = 0.04). In contrast, mean anal pressures at the four time points were not significantly different between groups (p > 0.05). The defect area of the sham treated group showed irregular muscle bundles, while all three SDF-1 treatment groups show organized muscle bundles, with the most organization in the higher dose groups. Quantification of Masson-stained slides showed no statistically significant differences between groups, but did show increased muscle volume in the area of defect in the treatment groups compared with sham. PGP9.5 and CY3 staining showed increased fluorescence in the higher dose groups compared with sham treatment.Conclusion: A single higher dose of the plasmid encoding SDF-1 may increase muscle volume in the area of a chronic defect.

AB  - DNA topoisomerases (TOPs) are dysregulated in various types of cancer. However, how TOP II-alpha (TOP2A) contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains elusive. Cohort analysis revealed that the increased expression of TOP2A was associated with poor clinical outcomes and TOP2A was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. In vitro, TOP2A expression level is related to cell invasion and migration, which may be due to the alteration of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by the TOP2A. Moreover, we used verteporfin (a Hippo inhibitor) to test how the Hippo pathway promotes the effect of TOP2A on the HCC phenotype and found that TOP2A induces tumor progression through the Hippo pathway. Finally, miR-22-5p inhibited tumor progression by sponging TOP2A.

AB  - NMDA receptor (NMDAR) plays a vital role in brain development and normal physiological functions. Surface trafficking of NMDAR contributes to the modulation of synaptic functions and information processing. However, it remains unclear whether NMDAR trafficking is independent of long-term potentiation (LTP) and whether it regulates behavior. Here, we report that LTP of AMPAR and NMDAR can occur concurrently and that NMDAR trafficking can regulate AMPAR trafficking and AMPAR-mediated LTP. By contrast, AMPAR trafficking does not impact NMDAR-mediated LTP. Using SAP97-interfering peptide and SAP97 knockin (KI) rat, we show that the effect is mediated by GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDARs. At the behavior level, impaired NMDAR trafficking results in deficits in consolidation, but not acquisition, of fear memory. Collectively, our results suggest the essential role of NMDAR trafficking in LTP and memory consolidation.

AB  - The current efforts in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of brain cancer are focused on the development of novel photosensitizers with improved photodynamic properties, targeted specific localization, and sensitivity to the irradiation dose, ensuring the effectiveness of PDT with fewer side effects for normal nerve tissue. Here, we characterize the effects of four photosensitizers of the tetracyanotetra(aryl)porphyrazine group (pz I-IV) on the functional activity of neuron-glial networks in primary hippocampal cultures in their application in normal conditions and under PDT. The data revealed that the application of pz I-IV leads to a significant decrease in the main parameters of the functional calcium activity of neuron-glial networks and pronounced changes in the network characteristics. The observed negative effects of pz I-IV were aggravated under PDT. Considering the significant restructuring of the functional architectonics of neuron-glial networks that can lead to severe impairments in synaptic transmission and loss of brain functions, and the feasibility of direct application of PDT based on pz I-IV in the therapy of brain tumors is highly controversial. Nevertheless, the unique properties of pz I-IV retain a great prospect of their use in the therapy of tumors of another origin and cellular metabolism.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorders are frequently observed in postoperative patients and previous reports have shown that pre-existing mild cognitive impairment with accumulated neuropathology may be a risk factor. Sevoflurane is a general anesthetic agent which is commonly used in clinical practice. However, the effects of sevoflurane in postoperative subjects are still controversial, as both neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects were reported. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sevoflurane in 3 x Tg mice, a specific animal model with pre-existing Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. 3 x Tg mice and wild-type mice were exposed to 2 h of sevoflurane respectively. Cognitive function, glutamate transporter expression, MAPK kinase pathways, and neuronal apoptosis were accessed on day 7 post-exposure. Our findings indicate that sevoflurane-induced cognitive deterioration in 3 x Tg mice, which was accompanied with the modulation of glutamate transporter, MAPK signaling, and neuronal apoptosis in the cortical and hippocampal regions. Meanwhile, no significant impact was observed in wild-type mice. Our results demonstrated that prolonged inhaled sevoflurane results in the exacerbation of neuronal and cognitive dysfunction which depends on the neuropathology background.

AB  - This study examined the development conditions and functional properties of a novel compound tea Lithocarpus polystachyus (wall.) Rehd (L. polystachyus, LPR) black tea (LPRBT). The compound tea was developed by fermentation using fresh leaves (Camellia sinensis cv. Qianmei 601) as the main raw material with LPR powder as an additive. Based on the single factor and orthogonal tests with sensory scores as indicators, a withered leaves-LPR powder mass ratio of 9:1 with a 6 h fermentation time was determined to be the production condition of LPRBT with a sensory score of 89.09. In addition, phlorizin content, anti-oxidation function, hypoglycemic function, and tumor suppressor effect of LPRBT were measured. The results demonstrated that LPRBT phlorizin content was significantly higher than apple. It also showed that the equivalent 2,2 '-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radical clearance rate with Vitamin C (Vc) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical clearance rate was 81% of Vc. Both hydroxyl and superoxide anion radical clearance increased with the increase in LPRBT amount. LPRBT also showed a good inhibitory effect on alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, indicating certain hypoglycemic activity. Moreover, it inhibited the growth of HeLa and A549 cancer cells showing tumor suppressor activity. This study provides a reference for the development and application of LPR food products.

AB  - Background: Cognitive disorders are symptoms of degenerative neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study evaluated the effects of a mixture of Gastrodiae elata (GE) and Glycyrrhizae uralensis (GU) (GGW) on scopolamine-treated cognitive function disorders in vivo. Methods: To induce memory impairment and cognitive disorder, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally administered scopolamine. In the experimental period, the Y-maze, passive avoidance, and water maze tests were carried out to measure the ameliorative effect of GGW on cognitive function disorder. The expression of amyloid-beta (A beta), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampal tissues were measured. In addition, to assess the effect of GGW on brain tissue, tissues were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Results: GGW treatment improved latencies in the Y-maze, water maze, and passive avoidance tests compared with scopolamine treatment alone. GGW administration downregulated A beta and AChE expression. In addition, BDNF expression was upregulated by GGW administration. Conclusion: These results suggest that GGW ameliorates impaired cognitive function in a scopolamine-induced mouse model. In addition, GGW could control the pathway of scopolamine-induced cognitive disorders by regulating A beta, AChE, and BDNF. These results suggest that GGW could be used as a treatment agent for cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Abnormal mitochondrial dynamics can lead to seizures, and improved mitochondrial dynamics can alleviate seizures. Vacuolar protein sorting 13D (VPS13D) is closely associated with regulating mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy. However, further investigation is required to determine whether VPS13D affects seizures by influencing mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy. We aimed to investigate the influence of VPS13D on behavior in a rat model of acute epileptic seizures. Hence, we established an acute epileptic seizure rat model and employed the CRISPR/CAS9 technology to construct a lentivirus to silence the Vps13d gene. Furthermore, we used the HT22 mouse hippocampal neuron cell line to establish a stable strain with suppressed expression of Vps13d in vitro. Then, we performed quantitative proteomic and bioinformatics analyses to confirm the mechanism by which VPS13D influences mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy, both in vitro and in vivo using the experimental acute epileptic seizure model. We found that knockdown of Vps13d resulted in reduced seizure latency and increased seizure frequency in the experimental rats. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in mitochondrial dynamin-related protein 1 expression following Vps13d knockdown. Moreover, we observed a significant reduction in LC3II protein expression levels and the LC3II/LC3I ratio (indicators for autophagy) accompanied by a significant increase in P62 expression (an autophagy adaptor protein). The proteomic analysis confirmed the up-regulation of P62 protein expression. Therefore, we propose that VPS13D plays a role in modulating seizures by influencing mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy.

AB  - Transcription factors (TFs) are important mediators of aberrant transcriptional programs in cancer cells. In this study, we focus on TF activity (TFa) as a biomarker for cell -line -selective anti -proliferative effects, in that high TFa predicts sensitivity to loss of function of a given gene (i.e., genetic dependencies [GDs]). Our linear -regression -based framework identifies 3,047 pan -cancer and 3,952 cancer -type -specific candidate TFa-GD associations from cell line data, which are then cross-examined for impact on survival in patient cohorts. One of the most prominent biomarkers is TEAD1 activity, whose associations with its predicted GDs are validated through experimental evidence as proof of concept. Overall, these TFa-GD associations represent an attractive resource for identifying innovative, biomarker-driven hypotheses for drug discovery programs in oncology.

AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the effects of lactoferrin (Lf) on acute (days 3 and 15) and early-delayed (day 30) changes in the dentate gyrus of mouse hippocampus caused by whole-body gamma-irradiation. Male C57BL/6 mice received Lf (4 mg per mouse, i.p. injection) immediately after whole-body gamma-irradiation at a dose of 7.5 Gy from a 60Co source. The effect of Lf on mouse behavior was evaluated using "Open field" and "Elevated plus-maze" tests. The proportion of cells with DNA replication was determined by 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine incorporation (thymidine analog) and detected by a click reaction with azide Alexa Fluor 568. Lf treatment increased animal survival during the experiment (30 days), compensated for radiation-induced body weight loss, and prevented suppression of motor and exploratory activities. A pronounced anti-radiation effect of Lf on mouse brain cells has been demonstrated. A single injection of the protein allowed preserving 2-fold more proliferating cells and immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of irradiated animals during the acute period of post-radiation injury development.

AB  - Safflower Seeds (Carthamus tinctorius L. seed (CTS)) have utilized in coloring and flavoring in food industries. The present study aims to evaluate the saver impacts of various CTS levels against neurotoxicity in rats induced by lead (Pb). Thirty-five male rats were classified into five classes each contains 7 rats. Class (I) is the control class and was fed on the basal diet. Class (II) Pb class was administrated oral gavage of lead acetate (30 mg/kg/BW) for eight weeks. Classes (III, IV, and V) were supplemented with different levels of CTS powder formulated with the basal diet (5, 7.5, and 10%, respectively) and combined with Pb intoxication. After eight weeks, serum and brains were collected from rats to measure dopamine, serotonin, antioxidant parameters, and proinflammatory cytokines. Compared to the Pb-intoxicated rats, CTS supplementation ameliorated the Pb-linked elevation in body weight gain, brain weight, and dyslipidemia. Also, it increases the neurotransmitters levels (serotonin and dopamine content) in rats and enhance the antioxidant status of the brain (superoxide dismutase and glutathione functions) while reducing peroxidation of lipid. Moreover, CTS reduced Pro -inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrotic (TNF-alpha) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity). These outcomes were established by restoring the brain architecture in histological examination. The results of our investigation showed that phenolic-rich CTS supplementation was beneficial in lowering Pb-induced brain inflammation, neuronal damage, and oxidative stress. Therefore, CTS might have a neuromodulatory role against Pb toxicity.

AB  - BackgroundShenqi Compound (SQC) has been used in clinic for several decades in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications. But this is merely a heritage of experience. The primary aim of this study is to scientifically validate the therapeutic effects of SQC on diabetic vascular calcification (DVC) in an animal model and, simultaneously, uncover its potential underlying mechanisms.MethodSpontaneous diabetic rat- Goto Kakizaki (GK) rats were selected for rat modeling. We meticulously designed three distinct groups: a control group, a model group, and an SQC treatment group to rigorously evaluate the influence of SQC. Utilizing a comprehensive approach that encompassed methods such as pathological staining, western blot analysis, qRT-PCR, and RNA sequencing, we thoroughly investigated the therapeutic advantages and the underlying mechanistic pathways associated with SQC in the treatment of DVC.ResultThe findings from this investigation have unveiled the extraordinary efficacy of SQC treatment in significantly mitigating DVC. The underlying mechanisms driving this effect encompass multifaceted facets, including the restoration of aberrant glucose and lipid metabolism, the prevention of phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into osteogenic-like states, the subsequent inhibition of cell apoptosis, the modulation of inflammation responses, the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the activation of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Collectively, these mechanisms lead to the dissolution of deposited calcium salts, ultimately achieving the desired inhibition of DVC.ConclusionOur study has provided compelling and robust evidence of the remarkable efficacy of SQC treatment in significantly reducing DVC. This reduction is attributed to a multifaceted interplay of mechanisms, each playing a crucial role in the observed therapeutic effects. Notably, our findings illuminate prospective directions for further research and potential clinical applications in the field of cardiovascular health.

KW  - BRAIN
KW  - EXPRESSION
AB  - Background: The regulation of noncoding ribonucleic acid (ncRNA) has been shown to be involved in cellular and molecular responses to hypoxic preconditioning (HPC), a situation created by the induction of sublethal hypoxia in the brain. The ncRNAs metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) are abundantly expressed in the brain, where they regulate the expression of various genes in nerve cells. However, the exact roles of MALAT1 and NEAT1 in HPC are not fully understood. Methods: A mouse model of acute repeated hypoxia was used as a model of HPC, and MALAT1 and NEAT1 levels in the hippocampus were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mRNA and protein levels of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2 B (NR2B) in the mouse hippocampus were measured using real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. HT22 cells knocked-down for MALAT1 and NEAT1 were used for in vitro testing. Expression of NR2B, which is involved in nerve cell injury under ischemic and hypoxic conditions, was also evaluated. The levels of spectrin and cleaved caspase-3 in MALAT1 and NEAT1 knockdown HT22 cells under oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) were determined by western blotting. Results: HPC increased the expression of MALAT1 and NEAT1 and decreased the expression of NR2B mRNA in the mouse hippocampus (p < 0.05). Knockdown of MALAT1 and NEAT1 increased both NR2B mRNA and protein levels nearly twofold and caused damage under OGD/R conditions in HT22 cells (p < 0.05). Conclusion: MALAT1 and NEAT1 exert neuroprotective effects by influencing the expression of NR2B.

AB  - Objective: Bladder cancer is the 9th leading cause of human urologic malignancy and the 13th cause of death worldwide. Increased collagen cross-linking, NIDOGEN1 expression and consequently stiffness of extracellular matrix (ECM) may be responsible for the mechanotransduction and regulation of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) signaling pathways, resulting in progression of tumorigenesis. The present study aimed to assess whether type 1 collagen expression is associated with TAZ nuclear localization.
   Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to evaluate the activation of the TAZ pathway in patients with bladder cancer (n=40) and healthy individuals (n=20). The ELISA method was also conducted to measure the serum concentrations of TGF-beta 1. Masson's trichrome staining was carried out to histologically evaluate the density of type 1 collagen.
   Results: Our findings that the expression levels of COL1A1, COL1A2, NIDOGEN1, TAZ, and TGF-01 genes were overexpressed in patients with bladder cancer, and their expression levels were positively associated with the grade of bladder cancer. The immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the nuclear localization of TAZ was markedly correlated with high-grade bladder cancer. We also found that TAZ nuclear localization was substantially higher in cancerous tissues as compared with normal bladder tissues. Masson's trichrome staining showed that the tissue density of type I collagen was considerably increased in patients with bladder cancer as compared with healthy subjects.
   Conclusion: According to our findings, it seems the alterations in the expression of type I collagen and NIDOGEN1, as well as TAZ nuclear localization influence the progression of bladder cancer. The significance of TGF-01 and TAZ expression in tumorigenesis and progression to high-grade bladder cancer was also highlighted. However, a possible relationship between TGF-beta 1 expression and the Hippo pathway needs further investigations.

AB  - Background: General anesthesia (GA) in pediatric patients represents a clinical routine. Factors such as increased birth age and maternal chronic conditions cause more infants to experience hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, an additional risk for anesthesia. Aim: This study evaluates the effect of one sevoflurane-induced GA episode on the immature brain previously exposed to perinatal asphyxia (PA). Methods: Postnatal day 6 (PND6) Wistar rats were exposed to a 90-min episode of normoxia/PA and at PND15 to a 120-min episode of normoxia/GA. Four groups were analyzed: Control (C), PA, GA, and PA-GA. Post-exposures, fifteen pups/group were sacrificed and the hippocampi were isolated to assess S-100B and IL-1B protein levels, using ELISA. At maturity, the behavior was assessed by: forced swimming test (FST), and novel object recognition test. Results: Hippocampal S-100B level was increased in PA, GA, and PA-GA groups, while IL-1B was increased in PA, but decreased in PA-GA. The immobility time was increased in PA and PA-GA, in FST. Conclusions: Both PA and GA contribute to glial activation, however with no cumulative effect. Moreover, PA reduces the rats' mobility, irrespective of GA exposure, while memory evaluated by the novel object recognition test was not influenced.

AB  - Copper pollution in aquatic environments poses a significant health challenge due to its non-biodegradable nature. This study introduces a novel and environmentally friendly approach to preparing Camellia oleifera shell extract reduced graphene oxide (COS-rGO) for the effective removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions. By using a 0.5 g/L dosage of COS-rGO at a pH of 5.1 and a temperature of 20 degrees C, an 85.8 % removal efficiency (18.7 mg/g) of Cu(II) was achieved at an initial concentration of 10 mg/L. Various characterization techniques, including Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), were employed to examine the synthesized COS-rGO. Additionally, thermodynamic and kinetic studies were conducted to investigate the mechanism of Cu(II) adsorption on COS-rGO. The results demonstrate that the adsorption of Cu(II) on COS-rGO follows pseudosecond-order kinetics, representing a spontaneous exothermic reaction. Our findings further support that the removal of Cu(II) by COS-rGO is driven by chemical adsorption in accordance with the rate-controlled process based on the Langmuir adsorption model. Overall, this study presents the green synthesis of COS-rGO as a promising technique for producing a cost-effective adsorbent from waste materials, which can be utilized for the mitigation of heavy metals in water.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is a cellular model for learning and memory. However, the expression mechanisms underlying presynaptic forms of plasticity are not well understood. Here, we investigate functional and structural correlates of presynaptic potentiation at large hippocampal mossy fiber boutons induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. We performed 2-photon imaging of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGlu(u) that revealed an increase in the surface area used for glutamate release at potentiated terminals. Time-gated stimulated emission depletion microscopy revealed no change in the coupling distance between P/Q-type calcium channels and release sites mapped by Munc13-1 cluster position. Finally, by high-pressure freezing and transmission electron microscopy analysis, we found a fast remodeling of synaptic ultrastructure at potentiated boutons: Synaptic vesicles dispersed in the terminal and accumulated at the active zones, while active zone density and synaptic complexity increased. We suggest that these rapid and early structural rearrangements might enable long-term increase in synaptic strength.

AB  - Background: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder that significantly diminishes the quality of life for affected individuals. The pathophysiology of IBS remains poorly understood, and available therapeutic options for IBS are limited. The crucial roles of brain-gut interaction, which is mediated by the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system in IBS, have attracted increasing attention. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of paeoniflorin (PF) on anxiety and visceral hypersensitivity in maternal separation-induced IBS-like rats. Methods: The IBS-like rat model was established through the implementation of Maternal Separation (MS) and subsequently subjected to various doses of PF administered via oral gavage for 14 days. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using the Open Field Test (OFT) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test. The assessment of visceral sensitivity involved the utilization of the Abdominal Withdrawal Reflex (AWR) score and electromyographic (EMG) responses of the external oblique muscle in response to colorectal distention. The levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT), and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) were examined by ELISA. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence were employed to detect the expressions of CRH receptors 1 (CRHR1) and 2 (CRHR2). Glucocorticoid receptors (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), and phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) were examined by Western blot. Results and Discussion: The results showed that MS induced anxiety-like behavior and visceral hypersensitivity, while PF treatment attenuated these changes. Furthermore, the HPA axis hyperactivity in MS rats was attenuated by PF treatment, indicated by reduced serum ACTH, CORT, and CRH levels and recovered hippocampal CRHR1 and GR expressions. In addition, PF inhibited BDNF/TrkB signaling by downregulating the protein levels of BDNF, TrkB, and phospho-PLC gamma 1 in the colon. Conclusion: These findings suggest that PF alleviated anxiety and visceral hypersensitivity in MS-induced IBS-like rats, which may be the modulation of HPA axis activity and BDNF/TrkB/PLC gamma 1 signaling pathway.

AB  - BackgroundThe tumor suppressor protein, p53, which is mutated in half of human tumors, plays a critical role in cellular responses to DNA damage and maintenance of genome stability. Therefore, increasing our understanding of the p53 pathway is essential for improving cancer treatment and diagnosis.MethodsThis study, which aimed to identify genes and pathways that mediate resistance to p53 upregulation, used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screening done with Nutlin-3a, which inhibits p53-MDM2 interaction, resulting in p53 accumulation and apoptotic cell death. We used bioinformatics analysis for the identification of genes and pathways that are involved in the p53 pathway and cell survival assays to validate specific genes. In addition, we used RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed p53 target genes in gene knockout (KO) cell lines.ResultsOur screen revealed three significantly enriched pathways: The heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, diphthamide biosynthesis and Hippo pathway. Notably, TRIP12 was significantly enriched in our screen. We found that TRIP12 is required for the p53-dependent transcription of several pro-apoptotic genes.ConclusionOur study has identified two novel pathways that play a role in p53-mediated growth restriction. Moreover, we have highlighted the interaction between the Hippo and the p53 pathways. Interestingly, we have shown that TRIP12 plays an important function in the p53 pathway by selectively affecting its role as a transcription factor.

AB  - Dysfunction of the Hippo pathway is common in esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC). Chaetocin, a small molecular compound isolated from the marine fungus, exhibits potent anticancer effects. However, the anticancer effects of chaetocin on ESCC and its potential relationship to Hippo pathway remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that chaetocin dramatically inhibited the proliferation in ESCC cells by causing cycle arrest in the M phase and activating the caspase-dependent apoptosis signaling pathway in vitro, and we also found that chaetocin induced the accumulation cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The RNA-seq analysis indicated that the Hippo pathway is one of the most enriched pathways after chaetocin treatment. We further revealed that chaetocin triggered the activation of Hippo pathway in ESCC cells, which is characterized by elevated phosphorylation levels of almost all core proteins in Hippo pathway, such as MST1 (Thr183), MST2 (Thr180), MOB1 (Thr35), LAST1 (Thr1079 and Ser909) and YAP (Ser127), ultimately leading to decreased nuclear translocation of YAP. Moreover, the MST1/2 inhibitor XMU-MP-1 not only partially rescued the inhibitory effect chaetocin-induced proliferation, but also rescued the chaetocin-induced apoptosis in ESCC cells. Furthermore, in vivo results confirmed the antitumor effect of chaetocin and its relationship with Hippo pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates that chaetocin exhibits anticancer effects in ESCC via activation of Hippo pathway. These results provide an important basis for further research of chaetocin as a potential candidate for ESCC treatment.

AB  - The post-partum gross examination of the fetal membranes is an efficient tool for detecting the abnormalities that might influence the survival, health, and future development of a newborn. The routine on-field gross evaluation of the placenta performed by veterinarians could represent a valuable tool for the management of dromedary camel (Camelus dromedaries) newborns. A description of the dromedary camel placenta was therefore performed in this study. Female dromedary camel parturitions were attended and placentas were collected, cleaned of sand, and observed. The chorionic surface appeared velvety and non-uniform in color, varying from pink to pale or bright red and often with dark red areas; the latter were located mainly around the uterine body portion or in the area outside the insertion of the umbilical cord. The pregnant horn portion was always bigger in size than that of the non-pregnant portion; the uterine body portion showed variability in shape and size. The allantoic surface showed variable appearance, from pearly white, to pink or red-bluish, depending on the background color of the chorionic surface, and was characterized by the presence of several blood vessels. The dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) fetal membranes, commonly referred to as "the placenta", are epitheliochorial, diffuse, and microcotyledonary, similarly to the mare's placenta. The evaluation of the placenta is an essential component of the neonatal evaluation in the equine species. However, post-partum or post-abortion placental assessment in dromedary camels is unfortunately too frequently neglected and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the dromedary camel species lacks a comprehensive description of the normal placenta's gross morphology. In order to facilitate its on-field evaluation, the current study describes the macroscopic features of the placenta of the dromedary camel after full-term pregnancy and spontaneous parturition.

AB  - In this last article of the trilogy, the unified biothermokinetic theory of ATP synthesis developed in the previous two papers is applied to a major problem in comparative physiology, biochemistry, and ecology-that of metabolic scaling as a function of body mass across species. A clear distinction is made between intraspecific and interspecific relationships in energy metabolism, clearing up confusion that had existed from the very beginning since Kleiber first proposed his mouse-to-elephant rule almost a century ago. It is shown that the overall mass exponent of basal/standard metabolic rate in the allometric relationship P = P0Mb'+b is composed of two parts, one emerging from the relative intraspecific constancy of the slope (b), and the other (b') arising from the interspecific variation of the mass coefficient, a(M) with body size. Quantitative analysis is shown to reveal the hidden underlying relationship followed by the interspecific mass coefficient, a(M) = P0M0.10, and a universal value of P0 = 3.23 watts, W is derived from empirical data on mammals from mouse to cattle. The above relationship is shown to be understood only within an evolutionary biological context, and provides a physiological explanation for Cope's rule. The analysis also helps in fundamentally understanding how variability and a diversity of scaling exponents arises in allometric relations in biology and ecology. Next, a molecular-level understanding of the scaling of metabolism across mammalian species is shown to be obtained by consideration of the thermodynamic efficiency of ATP synthesis eta, taking mitochondrial proton leak as a major determinant of basal metabolic rate in biosystems. An iterative solution is obtained by solving the mathematical equations of the biothermokinetic ATP theory, and the key thermodynamic parameters, e.g. the degree of coupling q, the operative P/O ratio, and the metabolic efficiency of ATP synthesis eta are quantitatively evaluated for mammals from rat to cattle. Increases in eta (by similar to 15%) over a 2000 - fold body size range from rat to cattle, primarily arising from an similar to 3 - fold decrease in the mitochondrial H+ leak rate are quantified by the unified ATP theory. Biochemical and mechanistic consequences for the interpretation of basal metabolism, and the various molecular implications arising are discussed in detail. The results are extended to maximum metabolic rate, and interpreted mathematically as a limiting case of the general ATP theory. The limitations of the analysis are pointed out. In sum, a comprehensive quantitative analysis based on the unified biothermokinetic theory of ATP synthesis is shown to solve a central problem in biology, physiology, and ecology on the scaling of energy metabolism with body size.

AB  - Proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), predominantly known for antigen presentation in the immune system, have recently been shown to be necessary for developmental neural refinement and adult synaptic plasticity. However, their roles in nonneuronal cell populations in the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify classical MHC I molecule H2-K-b as a negative regulator of proliferation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Using genetic knockout mouse models and in vivo viral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression, we delineate a role for H2-K-b in negatively regulating NSPC proliferation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis of H2-K-b knockout NSPCs, in combination with in vitro RNAi, overexpression, and pharmacological approaches, further revealed that H2-K-b inhibits cell proliferation by dampening signaling pathways downstream of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1). These findings identify H2-K-b as a critical regulator of cell proliferation through the modulation of growth factor signaling.

AB  - Swimming exercise is reported to have protective effects on kidney function. Previous studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important for normal development, physiology, and pathophysiology of the kidney. Previous publications reported that swimming could modify miRNA expression profiles in the heart and brain. We studied the differential expression of miRNA in the kidneys of rats following sustained swimming exercise twice a day for 6 consecutive weeks. Small RNA libraries were made from the kidneys of sedentary control (SC) and sustained swimming exercised (SE) animals to identify the expression of miRNAs using high-throughput (deep) sequencing technology. We identified 521 and 516 known miRNAs and revealed 328 and 312 novel miRNA candidates with a total of 849 and 828 miRNAs in the kidneys of rats from the SC and SE libraries, respectively. Seventeen miRNAs were differentially expressed, of which 10 miRNAs were increased and 7 miRNAs were decreased in response to swimming exercise. The results showed that sustained swimming exercise could modulate renal miRNAs in rats. These differentially modified miRNA-s were investigated employing Gene Ontology (GO) terminologies and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The results implied that these swimming-responsive miRNAs may interact with many types of target genes to regulate renal functions. Analysis of KEGG pathways found that the significantly enriched target genes of the modified miRNAs were involved in the thyroid signaling (ko04919) and Hippo signaling pathways (ko04390). Our study data suggest that sustained swimming exercise could induce deferential expression of renal miRNAs, which might modulate an adaptive response of the kidney.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease with a long duration and complicated pathogenesis. Thymidine (Thy) and 2'-deoxyuridine (2'-De) are pyrimidines nucleotides that are associated with nervous system diseases. However, it remains unclear whether Thy and 2'-De exert neumprotective effects in AD. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the interventional effects and mechanisms of Thy and 2'-De on the A(beta 25-35)-induced brain injury. Donepezil (Do, 10 mg/kg/d), Thy (20 mg/kg/d), and 2'-De (20 mg/kg/d) were administered for 4 weeks after the injection of A(beta 25-35) peptides (200 mu M, i.c.v.) to mice. UPLC-MS/MS method was performed to quantify Thy and 2'-De in the hippocampus of mice brain. The cognition ability, neuronal and mitochondria damage, and levels of A beta(1-42)/A beta(1-40), P-Tau, Na+ K+-ATPase, apoptosis, oxidative stress, immune cells, and Iba 1(+) were measured in A(beta 25-35)-induced mice. The oxygen consumption (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured using a seahorse analyzer in A(beta 25-35)-induced N9 cells. Moreover, 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glycolysis inhibitor, was added to explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of Thy and 2'-De on A(beta 25-35)-induced N9 cells. The expression of Iba 1(+) and levels of CD11b(+) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured after treatment with Thy (5 mu M) and 2'-De (10 mu M) against 2-DG (5 mM) in A(beta 25-35)-induced N9 cells. The results suggested that Do, Thy, and 2'-De improved the cognition ability, attenuated the damage to hippocampus and mitochondria, downregulated the levels of A beta(1-42)/A beta(1-40), p-Tau, Na+ K+-ATPase, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and Iba 1(+), and regulated the immune response induced by A(beta 25-35) against the brain injury. Furthermore, Do, Thy, and 2'-De increased ATP production and inhibited glycolysis in A(beta 25-35)-induced N9 cells. Moreover, 2-DG enhanced the effects of drugs, reduced microglial activation, and attenuated oxidative stress to interfere with A(beta 25-35)-induced N9 cells. In conclusion, Thy and 2'-De reduced microglial activation and improved oxidative stress damage by modulating glycolytic metabolism on the A(beta 25-35)-induced brain injury.

AB  - Modulation of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) excitability regulates anxiety. In the DG, glutamatergic mossy cells (MCs) receive the excitatory drive from principal granule cells (GCs) and mediate the feedback excitation and inhibition of GCs. However, the circuit mechanism by which MCs regulate anxiety-related information routing through hippocampal circuits remains unclear. Moreover, the correlation between MC activity and anxiety states is unclear. In this study, we first demonstrate, by means of calcium fiber photometry, that MC activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) of mice increases while they explore anxiogenic environments. Next, juxtacellular recordings reveal that optogenetic activation of MCs preferentially recruits GABAergic neurons, thereby suppressing GCs and ventral CA1 neurons. Finally, chemogenetic excitation of MCs in the vHPC reduces avoidance behaviors in both healthy and anxious mice. These results not only indicate an anxiolytic role of MCs but also suggest that MCs may be a potential therapeutic target for anxiety disorders.

AB  - An amyloid-beta (A beta) fibril is a vital pathogenic factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A beta fibril disintegrators possess great potential to be developed into novel anti-AD agents. Here, a ligand fishing method was employed to rapidly discover A beta(42) fibril disintegrators from Ganoderma lucidum using A beta(42) fibril-immobilized magnetic beads, which led to the isolation of six A beta 42 fibril disintegrators including ganodermanontriol, ganoderic acid DM, ganoderiol F, ganoderol B, ganodermenonol, and ergosterol. Neuroprotective evaluation in vitro exhibited that these A beta(42) fibril disintegrators could significantly mitigate A beta(42)-induced neurotoxicity. Among these six disintegrators, ergosterol and ganoderic acid DM with stronger protecting activity were further selected to evaluate their neuroprotective effect on AD in vivo. Results showed that ergosterol and ganoderic acid DM could significantly alleviate A beta(42)-induced cognitive dysfunction and hippocampus neuron loss in vivo. Moreover, ergosterol and ganoderic acid DM could significantly inhibit A beta(42)-induced neuron apoptosis and Nrf2-mediated neuron oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Locus coeruleus (LC) dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of depression; however, the neural circuits and specific molecular mechanisms responsible for this dysfunction remain unclear. Here, it is shown that activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in the LC alleviates depression-like behaviors in susceptible mice. The dorsolateral septum (dLS) is the most physiologically relevant output from the LC under stress. Stimulation of the LCTH-dLSSST innervation with optogenetic and chemogenetic tools bidirectionally can regulate depression-like behaviors in both male and female mice. Mechanistically, it is found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not norepinephrine, is required for the circuit to produce antidepressant-like effects. Genetic overexpression of BDNF in the circuit or supplementation with BDNF protein in the dLS is sufficient to produce antidepressant-like effects. Furthermore, viral knockdown of BDNF in this circuit abolishes the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine, but not fluoxetine. Collectively, these findings underscore the notable antidepressant-like role of the LCTH-dLSSST pathway in depression via BDNF-TrkB signaling.
   Optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of LCTH neurons after chronic social defeat stress increases the expression of BDNF, which in turn acts on SST neurons in the dLS and promotes resilience to stress. These findings highlight the notable antidepressant-like role of the LCTH-dLSSST pathway in depression which can serve as prominent targets for neurostimulation.image

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating neural mechanisms of decision-making, spatial cognition, and navigation. In many head-fixed VRs for rodents, animals locomote on spherical treadmills that provide rotation information in two axes to calculate two-dimensional (2D) movement. On the other hand, zebrafish in a submerged head-fixed VR can move their tail to enable movement in 2D VR environment. This motivated us to create a VR system for adult zebrafish to enable 2D movement consisting of forward translation and rotations calculated from tail movement. Besides presenting the VR system, we show that zebrafish can learn a virtual Morris water maze-like (VMWM) task in which finding an invisible safe zone was necessary for the zebrafish to avoid an aversive periodic mild electric shock. Results show high potential for our VR system to be combined with optical imaging for future studies to investigate spatial learning and navigation.

AB  - The process of memory consolidation involves the synthesis of new proteins, and interfering with protein synthesis through anisomycin can impair memory. Memory deficits due to aging and sleep disorders may also result from a reduction in protein synthesis. Rescuing memory deficits caused by protein synthesis deficiency is therefore an important issue that needs to be addressed. Our study focused on the effects of cordycepin on fear memory deficits induced by anisomycin using contextual fear conditioning. We observed that cordycepin was able to attenuate these deficits and restore BDNF levels in the hippo -campus. The behavioral effects of cordycepin were dependent on the BDNF/TrkB pathway, as demon-strated by the use of ANA-12. Cordycepin had no significant impact on locomotor activity, anxiety or fear memory. Our findings provide the first evidence that cordycepin can prevent anisomycin-induced memory deficits by regulating BDNF expression in the hippocampus.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cognitive impairment has been associated with an age-related decline in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). The molecular basis of declining neurogenesis in the aging hippocampus remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that pleiotrophin (PTN) expression is decreased with aging in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Mice lacking PTN exhibit impaired AHN accompanied by poor learning and memory. Mechanistically, we find that PTN engages with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTPRZ1) to promote NSPC proliferation and differentiation by activating AKT signaling. PTN overexpression or pharmacological activation of AKT signaling in aging mice restores AHN and alleviates relevant memory deficits. Importantly, we also find that PTN overexpression improves impaired neurogenesis in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. We further confirm that PTN is required for enriched environment-induced increases in AHN. These results corroborate the significance of AHN in aging and reveal a possible therapeutic intervention by targeting PTN.

AB  - Chronic stress is a risk factor for the development of psychiatric illnesses through impairment of the ability to appropriately regulate physiological and behavioral responses, but the molecular events that lead to damage of hippocampal neurons remain unclear. The medicinal herb Spilanthes acmella Murr. has been used as a traditional medicine for various diseases and its extracts exhibit antioxidant activity. The present study explored the molecular signals of mitochondrial dynamics and investigated the beneficial effects of S. acmella Murr. An ethyl acetate extract of this plant was used to assess mitochondrial dynamics in response to chronic restraint stress (CRS) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The results demonstrated that the S. acmella Murr. extract reduced the expression of mitochondrial fission protein but induced HSP60, MnSOD and ATPsynthase in the hippocampus of the CRS rats. In addition, S. acmella Murr. extract reversed depressive symptoms in the forced swim test. Our findings suggested that S. acmella Murr. extract provides a potential treatment of chronic stress, and that the mechanism is associated with the alleviation of neuronal injury and maintenance of mitochondrial function.

AB  - Introduction: Passive immunotherapy using polyclonal antibodies plays an important role in preventing and treating antigenic and pathogenic diseases. Polyclonal antibodies are used for therapeutic, diagnostic and investigational purposes, with adjuvants employed to enhance the immune response against proteins that are poorly antigenic or self-antigens. This study aimed to optimize current immunization methods by evaluating the novel adjuvant CoVaccine HT (TM) against the established Freund's at producing ovine polyclonal antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokine human recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).
   Methods: Castrated male Aberfield cross sheep were immunized with TNF-alpha in CoVaccine HT (TM) or Freund's adjuvant. The binding titer of antibodies for TNF-alpha and neutralization titer were determined in vitro, as well as the strength of antibody binding by a simple small scale affinity chromatography elution experiment. Animal welfare was monitored through inspection of immunization site reactions at regular time points and graded according to reaction size. The second part of the study looked at re-immunization using Freund's adjuvant alone every 4- or 8-weeks.
   Results: Freund's generated significantly higher antibody binding titers than CoVaccine HT (TM) but were less effective at neutralizing TNF-alpha which is a better indicator of functional potency. CoVaccine HT (TM) also caused fewer immunization site reactions, while no statistical difference was observed in the binding strength of antibodies. Re-immunization every 4- and 8-weeks showed no statistical difference.
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence that CoVaccine HT (TM) is superior to Freund's adjuvant for the production of antibodies to TNF-alpha, and supports the use of this alternative adjuvant for clinical and experimental use. The outcomes gained through this study are applicable to passive and active immunotherapy for the generation of polyclonal antibodies in human and veterinary medicine.

AB  - We make decisions based on currently perceivable information or an internal model of the environment. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and its interaction with the hippocampus have been implicated in the latter, model-based decision-making; however, the underlying computational properties remain incompletely understood. We have examined mPFC spiking and hippocampal oscillatory activity while rats flexibly select new actions using a known associative structure of environmental cues and outcomes. During action selection, the mPFC reinstates representations of the associative structure. These awake reactivation events are accompanied by synchronous firings among neurons coding the associative structure and those coding actions. Moreover, their functional coupling is strengthened upon the reactivation events leading to adaptive actions. In contrast, only cue-coding neurons improve functional coupling during hippocampal sharp wave ripples. Thus, the lack of direct experience disconnects the mPFC from the hippocampus to independently form self-organized neuronal ensemble dynamics linking prior knowledge with novel actions.

AB  - PM2.5 is a known threat to human health. For example, PM2.5 can impair brain health by damaging neurons. In this work, a model PM2.5 particle library was employed to investigate the role of PM2.5 compositions in regulating neurotoxicity using the mouse hippocampal neuron cell line HT22 and the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y as in vitro models. Our results demonstrated that while Pb2+, Cr(vi) and As(iii) at environmentally relevant concentrations all contributed to neurotoxicity when loaded onto model PM2.5 particles, the loading of Al3+ played an antagonistic role. We further revealed that this antagonistic effect was mediated via suppression of NADPH oxidase-induced cellular reactive oxygen species when cells were exposed to model PM2.5 particles loaded with Al3+ at an environmentally relevant concentration.

AB  - The dentate gyrus plays a key role in the discrimination of memories by segregating and storing similar episodes. Whether hilar mossy cells, which constitute a major excitatory principal cell type in the mammalian hippocampus, contribute to this decorrelation function has remained largely unclear. Using two -photon calcium imaging of head -fixed mice performing a spatial virtual reality task, we show that mossy cell populations robustly discriminate between familiar and novel environments. The degree of discrimination depends on the extent of visual cue differences between contexts. A context decoder revealed that successful environmental classification is explained mainly by activity difference scores of mossy cells. By decoding mouse position, we reveal that in addition to place cells, the coordinated activity among active mossy cells markedly contributes to the encoding of space. Thus, by decorrelating context information according to the degree of environmental differences, mossy cell populations support pattern separation processes within the dentate gyrus.

AB  - Background: Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based neuronal differentiation is valuable for studying neuropsychiatric disorders and pharmacological mechanisms at the cellular level. We aimed to examine the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics on human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Methods: Proliferation and neurite outgrowth were measured by live cell imaging, and gene expression levels related to neuronal identity were analyzed by RT-QPCR and immunocytochemistry during differentiation into hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells following treatment of low- and high-dose antipsychotics (haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone). Results: Antipsychotics did not modify the growth properties of NPCs after 3 days of treatment. However, the characteristics of neurite outgrowth changed significantly in response to haloperidol and olanzapine. After three weeks of differentiation, mRNA expression levels of the selected neuronal markers increased (except for MAP2), while antipsychotics caused only subtle changes. Additionally, we found no changes in MAP2 or GFAP protein expression levels as a result of antipsychotic treatment. Conclusions: Altogether, antipsychotic medications promoted neurogenesis in vitro by influencing neurite outgrowth rather than changing cell survival or gene expression. This study provides insights into the effects of antipsychotics on neuronal differentiation and highlights the importance of considering neurite outgrowth as a potential target of action.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, which is considered as the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Recently, it is suggested that impaired cerebrovascular function may precede the onset of AD. Claudin-5, which is the most enriched tight junction protein, has been reported to prevent the passage of damaging material at the blood-brain barrier. However, whether claudin-5 impacts AD has no direct evidence. We found a decrease level of claudin-5 in the hippocampus of AD and elder mice. And intravenous injection of claudin-5 improved learning and memory ability in these mice, while knockout of the protein led to impaired learning and memory and long-term potentiation in adult control mice. Furthermore, the effects of claudin-5 are mediated by suppressing inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission. Our results suggest benefit effects of claudin-5 on learning and memory, which may provide a new treatment strategy for AD.

AB  - TEAD transcription factors regulate gene expression through interactions with DNA and other proteins. They are crucial for the development of eukaryotic organisms and to control the expression of genes involved mostly in cell proliferation and differentiation; however, their deregulation can lead to tumorigenesis. To study the interactions of TEAD1 with M-CAT motifs and their inverted versions, the K-D of each complex was determined, and H/D exchange, quantitative chemical cross-linking, molecular docking, and smFRET were utilized for structural characterization. ChIP-qPCR was employed to correlate the results with a cell line model. The results obtained showed that although the inverted motif has 103higher K-D, the same residues were affected by the presence of M-CAT in both orientations. Molecular docking and smFRET revealed that TEAD1 binds the inverted motif rotated 180 degrees. In addition, the inverted motif was proven to be occupied by TEAD1 in Jurkat cells, suggesting that the low-affinity binding sites present in the human genome may possess biological relevance.

AB  - Background: Many studies have shown that occupational aluminum (Al) exposure could affect the cognitive functions of workers and cause mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Glutamate receptors (GluRs) play an important role in learning and memory functions.
   Methods: 352 workers in a large Al production enterprise were investigated in this research. MMSE, CDT, DST, VFT, FOM were used to evaluate the cognitive functions of workers. Plasma Al levels as exposure indices were measured by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Method (GFAAS). The expression of GluRs was measured by ELISA. Cognitive function comprehensive scores were obtained through factor analysis. Then a rat model of chronic AlCl3 exposure was established. The detection method of Al levels and protein expression were the same as mentioned-above.
   Results: Compared with the Q1 group, the DST, VFT, and comprehensive cognitive function scores of the Q4 group were lower(P < 0.05). For every 1 mu g/L increase in plasma Al concentration, the risk of cognitive impairment increases 1.051 times (95 %CI:1.031,1.072). Both NMDAR1 and NMDAR2A protein expression level of Q1 group were higher than those of Q2, Q3, Q4 group (all P < 0.05). The mediating effect ratio of NMDAR1 between plasma Al levels and cognitive function comprehensive scores was a1*b1/c=11.30 %, and the mediating effect ratio of NMDAR2A was vertical bar a2*b2/c vertical bar=21.77 %. Compared with control group, the escape latency of rats in the high Al dose group was longer day by day (P < 0.05). With the increase of Al dose, the relative expression of NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, GluR1 and mGluR5 in cerebral cortex and lymphocytes of rats were decreased (P < 0.05). The result of correlation analysis on NMDAR1 protein expression between brain cortex and lymphocyte showed that the correlation coefficient is r = 0.646(P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Taking together the results from both Al exposed workers and animal, there is a certain correlation between NMDAR1 protein contents of brain cortex and peripheral lymphocytes. We propose that lymphocyte NMDAR1 could be considered as a peripheral potential marker of cognitive impairment for further observation.

AB  - The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-a stress response pathway for maintaining protein homeostasis-is critical in seizures-induced neuronal injury. The activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) regulates mtUPR; however, whether ATF5-regulated mtUPR has a role in neuronal injury in epilepsy remains uncertain. Here, we investigated the effects of ATF5-regulated mtUPR on neuronal injury in hippocampal neurons with seizures evoked by Mg2+-free medium. HSP60 and ClpP, key proteins of mtUPR, were upregulated, indicating mtUPR activation. ATF5 overexpression by lentiviral vector infection potentiated mtUPR, whereas ATF5 downregulation by lentiviral vector infection attenuated this response. Moreover, ATF5 overexpression elevated mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suggesting that ATF5 overexpression protected mitochondrial homeostasis, while ATF5 downregulation had the opposite effect. ATF5 overexpression also reversed Bcl2 downregulation and Bax upregulation and attenuated seizures-induced neuronal apoptosis, while ATF5 downregulation aggravated the injury. Our study demonstrates that ATF5 attenuates seizures-induced neuronal injury, possibly by regulating mtUPR pathways, to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - Flexible neural probes, consisting of a linear array of graphene microtransistors, can be used to record from DC brain signals to high-frequency neuronal activity in awake rodents, thus showing potential for in vivo electrophysiology, and in particular epilepsy research.
   Mapping the entire frequency bandwidth of brain electrophysiological signals is of paramount importance for understanding physiological and pathological states. The ability to record simultaneously DC-shifts, infraslow oscillations (<0.1 Hz), typical local field potentials (0.1-80 Hz) and higher frequencies (80-600 Hz) using the same recording site would particularly benefit preclinical epilepsy research and could provide clinical biomarkers for improved seizure onset zone delineation. However, commonly used metal microelectrode technology suffers from instabilities that hamper the high fidelity of DC-coupled recordings, which are needed to access signals of very low frequency. In this study we used flexible graphene depth neural probes (gDNPs), consisting of a linear array of graphene microtransistors, to concurrently record DC-shifts and high-frequency neuronal activity in awake rodents. We show here that gDNPs can reliably record and map with high spatial resolution seizures, pre-ictal DC-shifts and seizure-associated spreading depolarizations together with higher frequencies through the cortical laminae to the hippocampus in a mouse model of chemically induced seizures. Moreover, we demonstrate the functionality of chronically implanted devices over 10 weeks by recording with high fidelity spontaneous spike-wave discharges and associated infraslow oscillations in a rat model of absence epilepsy. Altogether, our work highlights the suitability of this technology for in vivo electrophysiology research, and in particular epilepsy research, by allowing stable and chronic DC-coupled recordings.

AB  - BackgroundGreater knowledge of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapies is driving the research into their secretome, identified as the main element responsible for their therapeutic effects. The aim of this study is to characterize the individual variability of the secretome of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (adMSCs) with regard to potential therapeutical applications in neurology.MethodsadMSCs were isolated from the intact adipose tissue of ten subjects undergoing abdominal plastic surgery or reduction mammoplasty. Two commercial lines were also included. We analyzed the expansion rate, production, and secretion of growth factors of interest for neurological applications (VEGF-A, BDNF, PDGF-AA and AA/BB, HGF, NGF, FGF-21, GDNF, IGF-I, IGF-II, EGF and FGF-2). To correlate these characteristics with the biological effects on the cellular targets, we used individual media conditioned with adMSCs from the various donors on primary cultures of neurons/astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) exposed to noxious stimuli (oxygen-glucose deprivation, OGD) to evaluate their protective and promyelinating properties, using MSC medium as a control group.ResultsThe MSC secretome showed significant individual variability within the considered population with regard to PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, VEGF-A and BDNF. None of the MSC-derived supernatants affected neuron viability in normoxia, while substantial protection by high BDNF-containing conditioned MSC medium was observed in neuronal cultures exposed to OGD conditions. In OPC cultures, the MSC-derived supernatants protected cells from OGD-induced cell death, also increasing the differentiation in mature oligodendrocytes. Neuroprotection showed a positive correlation with VEGF-A, BDNF and PDGF-AA concentrations in the culture supernatants, and an inverse correlation with HGF, while OPC differentiation following OGD was positively correlated to PDGF-AA concentration.ConclusionsDespite the limited number of adMSC donors, this study showed significant individual variability in the biological properties of interest for neurological applications for adMSC secretome, an under-researched aspect which may represent an important step in the translation of MSC-derived acellular products to clinical practice. We also showed the potential protection capability of MSC conditioned medium on neuronal and oligodendroglial lineages exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation. These effects are directly correlated to the concentration of specific growth factors, and indicate that the remyelination should be included as a primary target in MSC-based therapies.

AB  - Impaired neuronal and synaptic function are hallmarks of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding other neuropathological traits and cognitive decline. We previously showed that SFRP1, a glial-derived protein elevated in AD brains from preclinical stages, contributes to disease progression, implicating glial factors in early pathogenesis. Here, we generate and analyze transgenic mice overexpressing astrocytic SFRP1. SFRP1 accumulation causes early dendritic and synaptic defects in adult mice, followed by impaired synaptic long-term potentiation and cognitive decline, evident only when the animals age, thereby mimicking AD's structural-functional temporal distinction. This phenotype correlates with proteomic changes, including increased structural synaptic proteins like neurexin, which localizes in close proximity with SFRP1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. We conclude that excessive SFRP1 hinders synaptic protein turnover, reducing synaptic plasticity-a mechanism that may underlie the synaptopathy observed in the brains of prodromal AD patients.

AB  - Understanding how coordinated neural networks support brain functions remains a central goal in neuroscience. The hippocampus, with its layered architecture and structured inputs to diverse cell populations, is a tractable model for dissecting operating microcircuits through the analysis of electrophysiological signatures. We investigated hippocampal network patterns in behaving mice by developing a low-dimensional embedding of local field potentials recorded along the CA1-to-dentate gyrus axis. This embedding revealed layer-specific gamma profiles reflecting spatially organized rhythms and their associated principal cell-inter-neuron firing motifs. Moreover, firing behaviors along the CA1 radial axis distinguished between deep and superficial principal cells, as well as between interneurons from the pyramidal, radiatum, and lacunosum-moleculare layers. These findings provide a comprehensive map of spatiotemporal activity patterns underlying hippocampal network functions.

AB  - Background Normalization of RNA-seq data aims at identifying biological expression differentiation between samples by removing the effects of unwanted confounding factors. Explicitly or implicitly, the justification of normalization requires a set of housekeeping genes. However, the existence of housekeeping genes common for a very large collection of samples, especially under a wide range of conditions, is questionable. Results We propose to carry out pairwise normalization with respect to multiple references, selected from representative samples. Then the pairwise intermediates are integrated based on a linear model that adjusts the reference effects. Motivated by the notion of housekeeping genes and their statistical counterparts, we adopt the robust least trimmed squares regression in pairwise normalization. The proposed method (MUREN) is compared with other existing tools on some standard data sets. The goodness of normalization emphasizes on preserving possible asymmetric differentiation, whose biological significance is exemplified by a single cell data of cell cycle. MUREN is implemented as an R package. The code under license GPL-3 is available on the github platform: github.com/hippo-yf/MUREN and on the conda platform: anaconda.org/hippo-yf/r-muren. Conclusions MUREN performs the RNA-seq normalization using a two-step statistical regression induced from a general principle. We propose that the densities of pairwise differentiations are used to evaluate the goodness of normalization. MUREN adjusts the mode of differentiation toward zero while preserving the skewness due to biological asymmetric differentiation. Moreover, by robustly integrating pre-normalized counts with respect to multiple references, MUREN is immune to individual outlier samples.

AB  - The hippocampal dentate gyrus, responds to diverse pathological stimuli through neurogenesis. This phenomenon, observed following brain injury or neurodegeneration, is postulated to contribute to neuronal repair and functional recovery, thereby presenting an avenue for endogenous neuronal restoration. This study investigated the extent of regenerative response in hippocampal neurogenesis by leveraging the well-established kainic acid-induced status epilepticus model in vivo. In our study, we observed the activation and proliferation of neuronal progenitors or neural stem cell (NSC) and their subsequent migration to the injury sites following the seizure. At the injury sites, new neurons (Tuj1+BrdU+ and NeuN+BrdU+) have been generated indicating regenerative and reparative roles of the progenitor cells. We further detected whether this transient neurogenic burst, which might be a response towards an attempt to repair the brain, is associated with persistent long-term exhaustion of the dentate progenitor cells and impairment of adult neurogenesis marked by downregulation of Ki67, HoPX, and Sox2 with BrdU+ cell in the later part of life. Our studies suggest that the adult brain has the constitutive endogenous regenerative potential for brain repair to restore the damaged neurons, meanwhile, in the long term, it accelerates the depletion of the finite NSC pool in the hippocampal neurogenic niche by changing its proliferative and neurogenic capacity. A thorough understanding of the impact of modulating adult neurogenesis will eventually be required to design novel therapeutics to stimulate or assist brain repair while simultaneously preventing the adverse effects of early robust neurogenesis on the proliferative potential of endogenous neuronal progenitors.

AB  - Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation of Mecp2 gene and primarily affects females. Glial cell dysfunction has been implicated in in Rett syndrome (RTT) both in patients and in mouse models of this disorder and can affect synaptogenesis, glial metabolism and inflammation. Here we assessed whether treatment of adult (5-6 months old) symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice with N-acetyl cysteine conjugated to dendrimer (D-NAC), which is known to target glia and modulate inflammation and oxidative injury, results in improved behavioral phenotype, sleep and glial inflammatory profile. We show that unbiased global metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus and striatum in adult Mecp2-heterozygous mice demonstrates significant differences in lipid metabolism associated with neuroinflammation, providing the rationale for targeting glial inflammation in this model. Our results demonstrate that treatment with D-NAC (10 mg/kg NAC) once weekly is more efficacious than equivalently dosed free NAC in improving the gross neurobehavioral phenotype in symptomatic Mecp2-heterozygous female mice. We also show that D-NAC therapy is significantly better than saline in ameliorating several aspects of the abnormal phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, REM sleep and epileptiform activity burden. Systemic D-NAC significantly improves microglial proinflammatory cytokine production and is associated with improvements in several aspects of the phenotype including paw clench, mobility, fear memory, and REM sleep, and epileptiform activity burden in comparison to saline-treated Mecp2-hetereozygous mice. Systemic glial-targeted delivery of D-NAC after symptom onset in an older clinically relevant Rett syndrome model shows promise in improving neurobehavioral impairments along with sleep pattern and epileptiform activity burden. These findings argue for the translational value of this approach for treatment of patients with Rett Syndrome.image

AB  - BackgroundA neurodevelopmental disease, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurs in males three times more commonly than girls. Higher prenatal testosterone exposure may result in autistic-like behaviour in boys, according to earlier research. It is unclear how fetal testosterone affects the development of autism. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal testosterone exposure in an animal model may result in autistic behaviours by modifying serotonin, dopamine, IGF-1 and oxytocin levels. Materials and MethodsGroup 1 (control, n = 6) and Group 2 (testosterone undecanoate, n = 6) of female rats were randomly assigned. For 2-3 days during the oestrus cycle, female rats were housed with a reproductive male (three females/one male). On the 10th day of gestation, rats in Group 1 received 1 ml/kg% 0.9 NaCl saline, whereas rats in Group 2 received 250 mg/kg testosterone undecanoate. Until weaning on postnatal day 21 (P21), the mothers were permitted to care for their pups. On P21, 40 littermates-10 male and female for control and 10 male and female from mothers that exposed to testosterone-were arbitrarily split up and housed. On P50, these mature rats were tested for their behaviour. The rats were then sacrificed. The brain tissue was subjected to histological examinations as well as biochemical tests for homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), oxytocin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). ResultsThe groups differed significantly in the behavioural examinations (three-chamber social test, passive avoidance learning analysis, open field test), with the testosterone-exposed groups exhibiting autistic symptoms to a higher extent. When compared with the control groups, testosterone exposure caused significant histological changes in the hippocampus CA1 and CA3 areas, including gliosis and cell death of neurons. In the testosterone-exposed groups, HVA, 5-HIAA and IGF-1 tissue expressions in the brain elevated, whereas oxytocin levels reduced. These findings point to a potential connection between neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD and exposure to testosterone during gestation. ConclusionOverall, we revealed that prenatal testosterone exposure led to autistic traits by elevating serotonin, dopamine and IGF-1 levels while lowering oxytocin levels.

AB  - Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects 5.5-28% of the population and is primarily an inflammatory disease, with microbiota potentially playing a key role. Understanding microbial pathogens and resistance patterns is crucial for effective management. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of Gram-negative rods in CRS in adults as a part of a prospective microbiological study. Methods: Over one year, paranasal sinus mucosa samples from CRS patients and nasal concha samples from controls were analyzed. Cultivable bacterial flora was assessed using culture-based methods. Biofilm formation was evaluated via a microtiter-plate assay, and antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the disk diffusion method. Results: Tissue samples from 74 CRS patients and 47 controls yielded 198 bacterial strains. Gram-positive cocci dominated, while Gram-negative rods accounted for 17.6%, with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Citrobacter spp. being most common. All Gram-negative rods formed biofilms in vitro. They were susceptible to cefotaxime, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem but showed varying sensitivity to ampicillin (20-67%), tigecycline (40-57%), and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (73-83%). Conclusions: The result of this study underlines that treatment of CRS should be based on the result of drug susceptibility testing of the isolated microorganism.

AB  - Insufficient invasion of trophoblast cells into the uterine decidua is associated with preeclampsia (PE). G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is a membrane estrogen receptor involved in non-genomic estrogen signaling. GPER is expressed in human trophoblast cells and downregulated GPER levels are noted in PE. However, to date, the role of GPER in trophoblast cells remains largely unknown. Here, we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to HTR-8/SVneo human trophoblast cells in response to G1, an agonist of GPER, and identified angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as a target gene of GPER. Treatment of trophoblast cells with G1 or 17 beta-estradiol (E2) activated Yes-associated protein (YAP), the major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, via GPER but in a mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1)-independent manner. Using pharmacological inhibitors as well as loss- and gain-of-function approaches, our results revealed that YAP activation was required for GPER-stimulated ANGPTL4 expression. Transwell invasion assays demonstrated that activation of GPER-induced ANGPTL4 promoted cell invasion. In addition, the expression levels of GPER, YAP, and ANGPTL4 were downregulated in the placenta of patients with PE. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which GPER exerts its stimulatory effect on human trophoblast cell invasion by upregulating YAP-mediated ANGPTL4 expression.
   Cheng, Fan, Li et al. identified ANGPTL4 as a G1-induced target gene of GPER/YAP in HRT8 cells using RNA-seq and highlighted its importance in regulating trophoblast cell invasion. The authors also reported GPER downregulation in the placenta and lower estradiol levels in patients who developed preeclampsia.

AB  - Depression is a widespread neuropsychiatric illness whose etiology is yet mysterious. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron-binding glycoprotein, is reported to promote neuroprotection through its role in the modulation of oxidative stress and inflammation. The objective of the present research was to evaluate the efficacy of LF against chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced depressive behavior in rats. Depression was evidenced by a reduced grooming time in the splash test and an increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). This effect was also accompanied by reduced GSH and serotonin levels and elevated lipid peroxidation and corticosterone levels in the hippocampus. Additionally, an exaggerated hippocampal inflammatory response was also shown by a rise in NF-kappa B (p65) and TNF-alpha levels and a reduced IL-10 level. Moreover, CRS substantially reduced the BDNF content as well as the protein levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR while boosting the GSK3 beta content. Interestingly, LF therapy significantly improved CRS-induced behavioral and biochemical aberrations, an effect which was suppressed upon pretreatment with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor). This suggests that the antidepressant potential of LF may be mediated through the modulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, LF succeeded in restoring 5-HT and corticosterone levels, diminishing oxidative stress and ameliorating the inflammatory cascades. Therefore, and for the first time, LF might serve as a promising antidepressant drug through targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
   The effects of CRS on inducing depression and the beneficial effect of LF in halting depression through mitigating ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines, restoring corticosterone, 5-HT and BDNF levels, and modulating the hippocampal PI3K/Akt/mTOR/GSK-3 beta pathway were studied.

AB  - Several plant compounds have been found to possess neuroactive properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the anticonvulsant effect of eupafolin, a major active component extracted from Salvia plebeia, a herb used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties. To this end, we assessed the anticonvulsant effects of eupafolin in rats intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with kainic acid (KA) to elucidate this mechanism. Treatment with eupafolin (i.p.) for 30 min before KA administration significantly reduced behavioral and electrographic seizures induced by KA, similar to carbamazepine (i.p.), a widely used antiepileptic drug. Eupafolin treatment also significantly decreased KA seizure-induced neuronal cell death and glutamate elevation in the hippocampus. In addition, eupafolin notably reversed KA seizure-induced alterations in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit GluR2, glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67, GABAergic enzyme), and Wnt signaling-related proteins, including porcupine, Wnt1, phosphorylated-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, beta-catenin, and Bcl-2 in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the increased level of Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk-1, a Wnt signaling antagonist) and the decreased level of Disheveled1 (Dvl-1, a Wnt signaling activator) in the hippocampus of KA-treated rats were reversed by eupafolin. This study provides evidence of the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties of eupafolin and of the involvement of regulation of glutamate overexcitation and Wnt signaling in the mechanisms of these properties. These findings support the benefits of eupafolin in treating epilepsy.

AB  - Neuronal ensembles are coactive groups of cortical neurons, found in spontaneous and evoked activity, that can mediate perception and behavior. To understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of ensembles, we co-activated layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mouse visual cortex, in animals of both sexes, replicating in vitro an optogenetic protocol to generate ensembles in vivo. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp pair recordings we found that, after optogenetic or electrical stimulation, coactivated neurons increased their correlated activity, a hallmark of ensemble formation. Coactivated neurons showed small biphasic changes in presynaptic plasticity, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation after a recovery period. Optogenetic and electrical stimulation also induced significant increases in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs, even after single-cell stimulation. In addition, we observed unexpected strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, with increases in membrane resistance and reductions in spike threshold. A pharmacological agent that blocks changes in membrane resistance reverted this effect. These significant increases in excitability can explain the observed biphasic synaptic plasticity. We conclude that cell-intrinsic changes in excitability are involved in the formation of neuronal ensembles. We propose an 'iceberg' model, by which increased neuronal excitability makes subthreshold connections suprathreshold, enhancing the effect of already existing synapses, and generating a new neuronal ensemble.

AB  - Tamoxifen (TAM), a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), is commonly used to treat and prevent breast cancer. Memory impairment has been noticed in patients who experience hormone therapy in the case of TAM and other SERMs. Animal studies that mimic the TAM longer exposure effects are needed to better elucidate the adverse effects of continuous treatment in humans. This study evaluated the effects of TAM subchronic administration on the memory performance and hippocampal neural plasticity of intact female Wistar rats. Animals were treated intragastrically with TAM (0.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) for 59 days. The rats were subjected to the Object Location Test (OLT) and Object Recognition Test (ORT) to evaluate memory performance. After eutha-nasia, the hippocampus samples were excised and the protein levels of the BDNF/ERK/Akt/CREB pathway were evaluated. The rat's locomotor activity and hippocampal TrkB levels were similar among the experimental groups. TAM at both doses reduced the memory performance of female rats in the OLT and short-term memory of ORT, and impaired hippocampal levels of mBDNF, proBDNF, and pCREB/CREB. TAM only at the dose of 2.5 mg/ kg reduced the memory performance of rats in the long-term memory of ORT and hippocampal pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt ratios. TAM subchronic administration induced amnesic effects and modulated the hippocampal BDNF/ERK/Akt/CREB pathway in intact young adult female Wistar rats.

AB  - Homocysteine (Hcy) is produced through methionine transmethylation. Elevated Hcy levels are termed Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and represent a risk factor for neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to explore the impact of mild HHcy and the neuroprotective effects of ibuprofen and rivastigmine via immunohistochemical analysis of glial markers (Iba-1 and GFAP). Additionally, we assessed levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5/ RANTES), CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1), and the NGF/p75NTR/tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB) pathway in the hippocampus of adult rats. Mild chronic HHcy was induced chemically in Wistar rats by subcutaneous administration of Hcy (4 mg/kg body weight) twice daily for 30 days. Rivastigmine (0.5 mg/kg) and ibuprofen (40 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally once daily. Results revealed elevated levels of CCL5/RANTES and reduced levels of VEGF, EGF, and TrkB in the hippocampus of HHcy-exposed rats. Rivastigmine mitigated the neurotoxic effects of HHcy by increasing TrkB and VEGF levels. Conversely, ibuprofen attenuated CCL5/ RANTES levels against the neurotoxicity of HHcy, significantly reducing this chemokine's levels. HHcy-induced neurochemical impairment in the hippocampus may jeopardize neurogenesis, synapse formation, axonal transport, and inflammatory balance, leading to neurodegeneration. Treatments with rivastigmine and ibuprofen alleviated some of these detrimental effects. Reversing HHcy-induced damage through these compounds could serve as a potential neuroprotective strategy against brain damage.

AB  - Adaptive behavior in complex environments critically relies on the ability to appropriately link specific choices or actions to their outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms that support the ability to credit only those past choices believed to have caused the observed outcomes remain unclear. Here, we leverage multivariate pattern analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and an adaptive learning task to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms of such specific credit assignment. We find that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and hippocampus (HC) code for the causal choice identity when credit needs to be assigned for choices that are separated from outcomes by a long delay, even when this delayed transition is punctuated by interim decisions. Further, we show when interim decisions must be made, learning is additionally supported by lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC). Our results indicate that lFPC holds previous causal choices in a 'pending' state until a relevant outcome is observed, and the fidelity of these representations predicts the fidelity of subsequent causal choice representations in lOFC and HC during credit assignment. Together, these results highlight the importance of the timely reinstatement of specific causes in lOFC and HC in learning choice-outcome relationships when delays and choices intervene, a critical component of real-world learning and decision making.

AB  - Different psychiatric disorders share genetic relationships and pleiotropic loci to certain extent. We integrated and analyzed datasets related to major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BIP), and schizophrenia (SCZ) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium using multitrait analysis of genome-wide association analysis (MTAG). MTAG significantly increased the effective sample size from 99,773 to 119,754 for MDD, from 909,061 to 1,450,972 for BIP, and from 856,677 to 940,613 for SCZ. We discovered 7, 32, and 43 novel lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1, 6, and 3 novel causal SNPs for MDD, BIP, and SCZ, respectively, after fine-mapping. We identified rs8039305 in the FURIN gene as a novel pleiotropic locus across the three disorders. We performed marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) and Hi-C-coupled MAGMA (H-MAGMA) based gene-set analysis and identified 101 genes associated with the three disorders, which were enriched in the regulation of postsynaptic membranes, postsynaptic membrane dopaminergic synapses, and Notch signaling pathway. Next, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis using different tools and detected a causal effect of BIP on SCZ. Overall, we demonstrated the usage of combined genome-wide association studies summary statistics for exploring potential novel mechanisms of the three psychiatric disorders, providing an alternative approach to integrate publicly available summary data.

AB  - Inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammatory pathways exerts a critical effect on neuronal death; therefore, it is a possible new therapeutic approach for traumatic brain injury (TBI). Resatorvid (TAK-242) is a novel small-molecule compound widely used to inhibit TLR4-mediated pathways, but the protective mechanism of TAK-242 in TBI remains unclear. Herein, we analyzed the neuroprotective effects of TAK-242 in rats after TBI. The rat model of brain injury was established using a modified Free-fall device, and the rats were injected with TAK-242 (0.5 mg/kg) through the caudal vein before TBI. The rats were allocated into four groups: a sham group, a TBI group, a TBI + vehicle group, and a TBI + TAK-242 group. The brain tissue was extracted for histology and determination of the expression of autophagy-related proteins and inflammatory mediators. TAK-242 pretreatment significantly reduced the damage to hippocampal neurons. Neuronal autophagy increased after brain injury, whereas TAK-242 significantly reduced autophagy marker protein LC3-II in the hippocampus. In addition, TAK-242 pretreatment significantly downregulated NF-kappa B p65, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in the hippocampus. In conclusion, TAK-242 significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal damage by inhibiting autophagy and neuroinflammatory activity, possibly via the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - The vertebrate respiratory protein cytoglobin (Cygb) is thought to exert multiple cellular functions. Here we studied the phenotypic effects of a Cygb knockout (KO) in mouse on the transcriptome level. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed for the first time on sites of major endogenous Cygb expression, i.e. quiescent and activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and two brain regions, hippocampus and hypothalamus. The data recapitulated the up-regulation of Cygb during HSC activation and its expression in the brain. Differential gene expression analyses suggested a role of Cygb in the response to inflammation in HSCs and its involvement in retinoid metabolism, retinoid X receptor (RXR) activation-induced xenobiotics metabolism, and RXR activation-induced lipid metabolism and signaling in activated cells. Unexpectedly, only minor effects of the Cygb KO were detected in the transcriptional profiles in hippocampus and hypothalamus, precluding any enrichment analyses. Furthermore, the transcriptome data pointed at a previously undescribed potential of the Cygb- knockout allele to produce cis-acting effects, necessitating future verification studies.

AB  - BackgroundThe hippocampus is associated with mood disorders, and the activation of quiescent neurogenesis has been linked to anxiolytic effects. Near-infrared (NIR) light has shown potential to improve learning and memory in human and animal models. Despite the vast amount of information regarding the effect of visible light, there is a significant gap in our understanding regarding the response of neural stem cells (NSCs) to NIR stimulation, particularly in anxiety-like behavior. The present study aimed to develop a new optical manipulation approach to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis and understand the mechanisms underlying its anxiolytic effects.MethodsWe used 940 nm NIR (40 Hz) light exposure to stimulate hippocampal stem cells in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced proliferation and astrocyte differentiation of NIR-treated NSCs were assessed using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation and immunofluorescence assays. Additionally, we evaluated calcium activity of NIR light-treated astrocytes using GCaMP6f recording through fluorescence fiber photometry. The effects of NIR illumination of the hippocampus on anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated using elevated plus maze and open-field test.ResultsNIR light effectively promoted NSC proliferation and astrocyte differentiation via the OPN4 photoreceptor. Furthermore, NIR stimulation significantly enhanced neurogenesis and calcium-dependent astrocytic activity. Moreover, activating hippocampal astrocytes with 40-Hz NIR light substantially improved anxiety-like behaviors in mice.ConclusionsWe found that flickering NIR (940 nm/40Hz) light illumination improved neurogenesis in the hippocampus with anxiolytic effects. This innovative approach holds promise as a novel preventive treatment for depression.

AB  - Dendrobium officinale, a traditional edible and medicinal plant, possesses significant medicinal and nutritional value. Specifically, the neuroprotective effect of Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (DOP) has been increasingly recognized. However, the precise mechanism through which DOP exerts its neuroprotective effects remains incompletely elucidated. Accordingly, the present study integrated pharmacodynamics, serum metabolomics, lipidomics and hippocampal proteomics analyses to investigate the therapeutic effects of DOP and elucidate its underlying mechanisms in AD mice. Results showed that DOP significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment and hippocampal pathological damage in AD mice. Metabolomic and proteomic analyses revealed that DOP effectively reversed 43 differential metabolites (polar metabolites and lipids) and 137 different proteins. Joint analysis combined with Western blot validation suggested that the GnRH signaling pathway may function as a predominant neuroprotective mechanism associated with DOP. Collectively, this study provides novel evidence for DOP as a potential drug candidate for treating AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Yi-guan-jian decoction (YGJ) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription commonly used for treating syndromes associated with Yin deficiency in the liver and kidney, as well as Qiobstructed in liver. Aim of the study: YGJ has shown potential alleviating cognitive dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the precise mechanisms are not yet fully understood. This study aims to reveal the mechanism by which YGJ alleviates cognitive dysfunction in T2DM. Materials and methods: Various doses of YGJ were administered to T2DM rats with cognitive dysfunction for 8 weeks. The positive control group received a combination of metformin and memantine. Cognitive function was assessed in T2DM rats using the Morris water maze test during treatment. Changes in gut microbiota and bile acids in the intestine were evaluated, and their interactions analyzed. Additionally, this study also evaluated the expressions of inflammatory markers (IL-1 beta,TNF-alpha, IL-16, IL-18 and CRP protein), Tau protein, neurotransmitter (5-HT and GABA), and bile acid receptor (FXR, PXR, VDR, and TGR5). Results: YGJ significantly alleviated insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia, reduce the levels of inflammatory factors in serum and hippocampus, and decreased mortality in T2DM rats. The Morris water maze test indicated that YGJ reduced the escape latency and increased platform crossing frequency, thereby improving cognitive function in T2DM rats. Furthermore, YGJ regulated the abundance of microorganisms associated with bile acid metabolism, including Romboutsia, Bacteroides, Turicibacter, Blautia, and Ruminococcus, thus regulating bile acid metabolism in T2DM rats. Additionally, YGJ also regulated bile acid metabolism by regulating intestinal FXR, PXR, VDR and TRG5 receptors. Conclusion: YGJ can alleviate glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, cognitive function, as well as remodel intestinal flora and BA composition in CDT2DM rats, which is a potential complementary and alternative therapy for the prevention and treatment of CDT2DM. These effects may be associated that YGJ regulates the structure of intestinal flora and BA metabolism, and inhibits intestinal BA receptors FXR, PXR, TGR5, and VDR.

AB  - The formation of memories is a complex, multi-scale phenomenon, especially when it involves integration of information from various brain systems. We have investigated the differences between a novel and consolidated association of spatial cues and amphetamine administration, using an in situ hybridisation method to track the short-term dynamics during the recall testing. We have found that remote recall group involves smaller, but more consolidated groups of neurons, which is consistent with their specialisation. By employing machine learning analysis, we have shown this pattern is especially pronounced in the VTA; furthermore, we also uncovered significant activity patterns in retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices, as well as in the DG and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. The behavioural propensity towards the associated localisation appears to be driven by the nucleus accumbens, however, further modulated by a trio of the amygdala, VTA and hippocampus, as the trained association is confronted with test experience. Moreover, chemogenetic analysis revealed central amygdala as critical for linking appetitive emotional states with spatial contexts. These results show that memory mechanisms must be modelled considering individual differences in motivation, as well as covering dynamics of the process.

AB  - Organoids are 3D cultures that to some extent reproduce the structure, composition and function of the mammalian tissues from which they derive, thereby creating in vitro systems with more in vivo-like characteristics than 2D monocultures. Here, the ability of human organoids derived from normal gastric, pancreas, liver, colon and kidney tissues to metabolise the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was investigated. While organoids from the different tissues showed varied cytotoxic responses to BaP, with gastric and colon organoids being the most susceptible, the xenobiotic-metabolising enzyme (XME) genes, CYP1A1 and NQO1, were highly upregulated in all organoid types, with kidney organoids having the highest levels. Furthermore, the presence of two key metabolites, BaP-t-7,8-dihydrodiol and BaP-tetrol-l-1, was detected in all organoid types, confirming their ability to metabolise BaP. BaP bioactivation was confirmed both by the activation of the DNA damage response pathway (induction of p-p53, pCHK2, p21 and gamma-H2AX) and by DNA adduct formation. Overall, pancreatic and undifferentiated liver organoids formed the highest levels of DNA adducts. Colon organoids had the lowest responses in DNA adduct and metabolite formation, as well as XME expression. Additionally, high-throughput RT-qPCR explored differences in gene expression between organoid types after BaP treatment. The results demonstrate the potential usefulness of organoids for studying environmental carcinogenesis and genetic toxicology.

AB  - Bain damage caused by Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is associated with increased inflammatory response and oxidative stress. Rutin, a natural product extracted from tobacco leaves and tomatoes, has excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in vivo, but its ameliorative effect on T. gondii infection-induced brain tissue damage remain unknown. In this study, mice were acutely infected with RH virulent strains of T. gondii, then treated with 0-50 mg/kg of Rutin. Results showed that Rutin significantly reduced the number of abnormal morphological neurons in the hippocampal region of brain tissue, decreased the concentration of Iba-1, the biomarker of microglia which indicates increased tissue damage and inflammation in the brain; decreased the level of inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta) in serum and increased the content of antioxidant enzymes (GSH and SOD) in brain tissue; and decreased the enrichment of oxidation products MDA. Results showed significant downregulation of key proteins in the two inflammation-related pathways, TLRs/NF-kappa B, P2X7R/NLRP3. While the proteins in the antioxidant-related pathways were noticeably upregulated in the T. gondii-infected brain tissue with Rutin treatment. These findings suggest that Rutin ameliorates T. gondii-induced brain tissue damage, may involving in inhibiting the TLRs/NF-kappa B and P2X7R/NLRP3 inflammatory signaling pathways, and activating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway. The findings could provide some theoretical support for Rutin's potential therapeutic use in treating T. gondii-related brain damage in the future.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and progressive cognitive dysfunction, and our clinical investigation revealed that the plasma concentration of melatonin (Mlt) decreased and was closely related to cognition in T2DM patients. However, although many studies have suggested that Mlt has a certain protective effect on glucose and lipid metabolism disorders and neuropsychiatric injury, the underlying mechanism of Mlt against T2DM-related metabolic and cognitive impairments remains unclear. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of Mlt on metabolic disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropsychiatric injuries in T2DM mice and to explore the possible underlying molecular mechanism involved. Methods: A T2DM mouse model was established by a combination of a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ, 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and Mlt (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg) was intragastrically administered for six consecutive weeks. The serum levels of glycolipid metabolism indicators were measured, behavioral performance was tested, and the protein expression of key molecules involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, circadian rhythms, and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus was detected. Moreover, the fluorescence intensities of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1), amyloid beta-protein (A beta) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) in the hippocampus were also observed. Results: Treatment with Mlt not only improved T2DM-related metabolic disorders, as indicated by increased serum concentrations of fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), insulin (INS), total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG), improved glucose tolerance and liver and pancreas function but also alleviated AD-like neuropsychiatric injuries in a HFD/STZ-induced mouse model, as indicated by decreased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), increased preference indices of novel objects or novel arms in the novel object recognition test (NOR) and Y-maze test (Y-maze), and improved platform positioning capability in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Moreover, treatment with Mlt also improved the hyperactivation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus of mice, accompanied by reduced expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), A beta, and p-Tau and increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Synapsin I, Synaptotagmin I, melatonin receptor 1B (MT1B), brain muscle arnt-like protein 1 (Bmal1), circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock), period 2 (Per2), and cryptochrome 2 (Cry2). Conclusion: Mlt alleviated T2DM-related metabolic disorders and AD-like neuropsychiatric injuries in a HFD/STZ- induced mouse model, possibly through a mechanism involving the regulation of glial activation and associated neuroinflammation and the balancing of synaptic plasticity and circadian rhythms in the hippocampus.

AB  - While purified protein derivative (PPD) is commonly used as skin diagnostic reagent for tuberculosis (TB) infection, it cannot distinguish effectively Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex and nontuberculous mycobacteria infection. The new skin reagent ESAT6-CFP10 (EC) has favorable sensitivity and specificity, which can overcome limitations associated with PPD. At present, EC skin test reactions are mainly characterized by erythema, while PPD mainly causes induration. We conducted a comparative study on the potential differences between EC-induced erythema and PPD-induced induration using a guinea pig model. The size of EC-dependent erythema was similar to that of PPD-induced induration, and an inflammatory response characterized by the infiltration of monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as tissue damage, appeared at the injection site. The lymphocytes included CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells, which released IFN-gamma as the main cytokine. Both EC erythema and PPD induration could lead to increased levels of acute-phase proteins, and the differential pathways were similar, thus indicating that the main induced immune pathways were similar. The above results indicated that erythema produced by EC could generate the main delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response characteristic of PPD induration, thereby suggesting that erythema might also have a certain diagnostic significance and provide a possible theoretical basis for its use as a diagnostic indicator for detecting MTB infection.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Syringa oblata Lindl (ZDX) is a plant in the Oleaceae family that is the primary ingredient in the classic Tibetan medicine AKARU sinensis. The plant's stem is used as a medicine, and Tibetan doctors often use it as a sedative, a use with a history of nearly 100 years. Tibetan medicine mainly uses lilac to treat headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, irritability and other symptoms. Depression is a chronic mental disorder characterized by low mood, cognitive impairments, and physical discomfort, and it has become a significant public health issue. Given the limitations of existing treatments, interest in alternative therapies, including herbal medicines, is increasing. Aim: To elucidate the mechanism of ZDX extract in the treatment of depression. Materials and methods: A depression-like mouse model was established via the subcutaneous injection of corticosterone (CORT) into the groin, and a model of PC12 cell injury was established via CORT treatment. The antidepressant effect of the ZDX extract was subsequently evaluated via weight measurements, the sucrose preference test (SPT), the forced swimming test (FST), the open field test(OFT), the tail suspension test (TST), HE staining, Nissl staining and ELISA. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to determine whether ZDX extract can regulate the cAMP/PKA-CREB-BDNF pathway to prevent depression and neuronal apoptosis. Results: ZDX extract significantly improved depression-like behaviours; inhibited decreases in the protein levels of cAMP, PKA, CREB and BDNF; and increased proliferative activity in the hippocampus and cortex. In addition, in vitro, ZDX extract attenuated CORT-induced injury and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons and inhibited CORTinduced decreases in the mRNA expression levels of cAMP, PKA, CREB and BDNF. Conclusions: These findings suggest that ZDX extract has potential as a novel antidepressant therapeutic agent, offering a complementary approach to current treatments by targeting multiple pathways involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical applications of ZDX extract in the treatment of depression.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained significant attention in cell therapies due to their multipotency and immunomodulatory capacities. The transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ, central to the mechanotransduction system in MSCs, dominantly direct MSCs lineage commitment. However, their role in immunomodulation remains elusive. Accordingly, this present study aimed to investigate the role of mechanotransducer YAP/TAZ and their binding target transcriptional factor, TEAD, in the immunomodulatory capacities of human bone marrow-derived MSCs. Reducing YAP/TAZ activity by altering the matrix stiffness, disrupting the F-actin integrity with chemical inhibitors, or using siRNAs increased the expression of immunomodulatory genes, such as TSG-6 and IDO, upon TNF-alpha stimulation. Similarly, transfection of TEAD siRNA also increased the immunomodulatory capacities in MSCs. RNA-seq analysis and inhibition assays demonstrated that the immunomodulatory capacities caused by YAP/TAZ-TEAD axis disruption were due to the NF-kappa B signaling pathway activation. Then, we also evaluated the in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy of MSCs in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice colitis model. The administration of human MSCs transfected with TEAD siRNA, which exhibited enhanced immunomodulatory properties in vitro, significantly ameliorated inflammatory bowel disease symptoms, such as body weight loss and acute colon inflammation, in the DSS-induced mice colitis model. Our findings underscore the mechanosignaling YAP/TAZ-TEAD axis as a regulator of MSCs immunomodulation. Targeting these signaling pathways could herald promising MSCs-based therapies for immune disorders.

AB  - BackgroundCyclophosphamide is a widely utilized chemotherapeutic agent for pediatric cancers, known to elicit adverse effects, including perturbation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways, thereby diminishing ovarian reserve and fertility potential in females. Consequently, this investigation delves into the mitigative effects of metformin on cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian impairment in prepubertal mice.MethodsTwenty-four 14-day-old NMRI female mice were distributed into four groups: Control (Cont), Cyclophosphamide (Cyc), Metformin (Met), and Metformin plus Cyclophosphamide (Met-Cyc). The Met-Cyc group was given daily doses of 150 mg/kg metformin for 11 consecutive days and in parallel 3 intermittent doses of 65 mg/kg cyclophosphamide once every three days. The Met and Cyc groups were given identical doses of Met or Cyc alone. The control group received normal saline treatment. On the 12th day, mice were sacrificed for analysis. Stereological methods were employed to measure the overall volume of the ovaries, including the medulla, cortex, and follicles, along with measuring anti-M & uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) levels using an ELISA kit. Furthermore, qRT-PCR was utilized to quantify the expression levels of genes, including P53, Bax, Bcl-2, Rad-51, Pten, Mtor, and Yap-1.ResultsThe findings demonstrate that metformin ameliorates cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian toxicity by increasing AMH levels and attenuating the excessive activation of primordial follicles, the ratio of growing to quiescent follicles, and follicular atresia. This protective effect is mediated by the downregulation of apoptosis-related genes, upregulation of the gene involved in a reparative pathway, and modulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway evidenced by increased expression of Pten, Mtor and Hippo pathway by Yap-1 expression.ConclusionsOur results advocate for the potential of metformin as a viable therapeutic option for preserving ovarian function in cyclophosphamide-treated adolescent girls, given its favorable side effect profile and ability to improve cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian damage.

AB  - Previously, we isolated potentially probiotic Ligilactobacillus salivarius strains from the intestines of wakame-fed pigs. The strains were characterized based on their ability to modulate the innate immune responses triggered by the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 or TLR4 signaling pathways in intestinal mucosa. In this work, we aimed to evaluate whether nasally administered L. salivarius strains are capable of modulating the innate immune response in the respiratory tract and conferring long-term protection against the respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Infant mice (3-weeks-old) were nasally primed with L. salivarius strains and then stimulated with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Five or thirty days after the last poly(I:C) administration mice were infected with pneumococci. Among the strains evaluated, L. salivarius FFIG58 had a remarkable ability to enhance the protection against the secondary pneumococcal infection by modulating the respiratory immune response. L. salivarius FFIG58 improved the ability of alveolar macrophages to produce interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-27, chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 2 (CXCL2), and CXCL10 in response to pneumococcal challenge. Furthermore, results showed that the nasal priming of infant mice with the FFIG58 strain protected the animals against secondary infection until 30 days after stimulation with poly(I:C), raising the possibility of using nasally administered immunobiotics to stimulate trained immunity in the respiratory tract.

AB  - Excessive free radicals in human and animal bodies can cause oxidative stress (OS) which damages cells and tissues. Plant materials with high antioxidant potential would resolve the OS problem. Thus, this study proposed to investigate the total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid contents (TFC), antioxidant capaci-ties and cytotoxicity in 17 edible plant materials from herbs, fruits, vegetables and plant by-products available in Southeast Asia for future use in the food or feed industry. Among 17 plant materials, Syzygium aromaticum (clove), Camellia sinensi (green tea pomace) from the beverage industry and Persicaria odorata (Vietnamese coriander) showed a prominent amount of TPC and TFC. These three plants and their combination (1:1:1 ratio, v:v:v) also possessed a remarkable antioxidant function in terms of DPPH, ABTS and FRAP, as well as showing a strong ROS inhibition through HepG2 cells. The cytotoxicity test of the crude extract of clove, green tea pomace and Vietnamese coriander, or their combination can be used between 0.032 and 0.255, 0.011 to 0.088, 0.022 to 0.178 and 0.021 to 0.346 mg/mL, respectively, without impeding cell viability. A combined mixture of clove, green tea pomace and Vietnamese corian-der revealed the synergistic properties of antioxidants and cell safety. This indicates that there is a poten-tial use of various antioxidant bioactive compounds in plant materials tested for use as phytogenic antioxidant additives. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which learning, communication, and social interaction are impaired. Research has sought to minimize the neural impairments associated with autism spectrum disorder and improve the quality of life. Recent studies suggest that boron may benefit nerve cells, with effects varying depending on the dosage. This study explored the impact of boron, administered as boric acid, on behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in a rat model of autism induced by propionic acid (PPA). Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, autism model, and boron-treated groups. Behavioral tests were conducted pre- and post-PPA induction, with brain tissue analyzed post-euthanasia. Proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6)) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were assessed in the hippocampus. Histopathological evaluations were conducted on the hippocampus and cerebellum. Autism model rats displayed impaired learning, elevated BDNF and cytokine levels, microglial and astrocytic activation, and decreased Purkinje cell count. The boron-treated groups showed improvements, particularly with the 4 mg/kg dose. This dose enhanced learning and social interaction, reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels, prevented microglial and astrocytic activation, and increased Purkinje cell count. Boron treatment exhibited neuroprotective potential, ameliorating autism spectrum disorder deficits by modulating cytokines, BDNF, microglia, and astrocytes, with low doses yielding pronounced effects.

AB  - Oxidative stress has become a major concern in the field of spermatology, and one of the possible solutions to this acute problem would be the use of antioxidant protection; however, more studies are required in this field, as highly contradictory results regarding the addition of antioxidants have been obtained. Vitamin E is a powerful biological antioxidant, but its low stability and high hydrophobicity limit its application in spermatology, making the use of organic solvents necessary, which renders spermatozoa practically motionless. Keeping this in mind, we propose the use of hydrogels (HVEs) and nanoemulsions (NVEs), alone or in combination, as carriers for the controlled release of vitamin E, thus, improving its solubility and stability and preventing oxidative stress in sperm cells. Cryopreserved sperm from six stags was thawed and extended to 30 x 10(6) sperm/mL in Bovine Gamete Medium (BGM). Once aliquoted, the samples were incubated as follows: control, free vitamin E (1 mM), NVEs (9 mM), HVEs (1 mM), and the combination of HVEs and NVEs (H + N), with or without induced oxidative stress (100 mu M Fe2+/ascorbate). The different treatments were analyzed after 0, 2, 5, and 24 h of incubation at 37 & DEG;C. Motility (CASA(R)), viability (YO-PRO-1/IP), mitochondrial membrane potential (Mitotracker Deep Red 633), lipid peroxidation (C-11 BODIPY 581/591), intracellular reactive oxygen species production (CM-H(2)DCFDA), and DNA status (SCSA(R)) were assessed. Our results show that the deleterious effects of exogenous oxidative stress were prevented by the vitamin E-loaded carriers proposed, while the kinematic sperm parameters (p < 0.05) and sperm viability were always preserved. Moreover, the vitamin E formulations maintained and preserved mitochondrial activity, prevented sperm lipid peroxidation, and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (p < 0.05) under oxidative stress conditions. Vitamin E formulations were significantly different as regards the free vitamin E samples (p < 0.001), whose sperm kinematic parameters drastically decreased. This is the first time that vitamin E has been formulated as hydrogels. This new formulation could be highly relevant for sperm physiology preservation, signifying an excellent approach against sperm oxidative damage.

AB  - Chronic and continuous alcohol consumption increases the risk of cognitive decline and may lead to alcohol-related dementia. We investigated the potential of Heracleum moellendorffii Hance root extract (HME) for treating alcohol-related cognitive impairment. Behavioral tests evaluated the effects of HME on cognitive function and depression. Changes in hippocampus and liver tissues were evaluated by Western blotting and H&E staining. The group treated with HME 200 mg/kg showed a significant increase in spontaneous alternation in Y-maze and a decrease in immobility in a forced swimming test (FST) compared to the vehicle-treated group. These results suggest that HME can restore memory deficits and reverse depressive symptoms caused by chronic alcohol consumption. The HME-treated group also upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus. Additionally, it reduced lipid vacuolation in the liver and increased the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1). The administration of HME improves cognitive impairment and reverses depressive symptoms due to alcohol consumption, restoring neural plasticity in the hippocampus and alcohol metabolism in the liver. These findings suggest that HME is a promising treatment for alcohol-related brain disorders. Molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of HME and its active ingredients should be investigated further.

AB  - The existing body of literature, in conjunction with our recent studies, shows that melatonin dysfunction can accelerate the aging process, with this effect depending on the specific age of the subject. The present study aims to ascertain the impact of pinealectomy on sphingolipid (SL) turnover in young adult (3-month-old), middle-aged (14-month-old), and old (18-month-old) rats. Ceramide (Cer) levels, neutral (NSMase) and acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), acid ceramidase (ASAH1), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels in hippocampus and/or plasma, were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The accumulation of Cer and its metabolite second messenger S1P in the hippocampus and plasma was associated with increased levels and activity of hippocampal NSMase in the hippocampus and plasma. However, no such association was observed for hippocampal ASMase, whose levels and activity were reduced in middle-aged and old rats compared to young adult rats. Pinealectomy-induced melatonin deficiency in young adult rats showed an increase in hippocampal Cer content compared to the sham group. However, in contrast to young adult rats, pinealectomy had an inverse effect on age-related changes in hippocampal Cer, NSMase, and ASMase in middle-aged rats. Furthermore, pinealectomy exacerbated the age-related increase in S1P in the hippocampus of 18-month-old rats. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that melatonin deficiency may influence the aging process by modulating SL turnover in an age-specific manner.

AB  - Linguatula serrata (Frolich, 1789) is a widespread parasite known as the tongue worm belonging to the family Linguatulidae. The adult form of the parasite is usually located in the upper respiratory tract of domestic and wild carnivores while the larval forms are located in the visceral organs of intermediate hosts (various herbivorous mammals). Twenty-four European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) were examined in this study, of which two were positive with L. serrata nymphs. The collected nymphs were examined morphologically using electron-microscopic analysis and molecularly by amplification of 18S rRNA and COX1 genes. Lung tissue samples were also collected and histopathological examination was performed. Histopathological examination revealed the following lesions: generalized inflammatory oedema, granulomas with necrosis, calcification and fibrosis in the bronchial tree. The results of molecular sequencing for L. serrata specimens collected from the European brown hares are deposited in GenBank. This study presents the first report on Linguatula serrata nymphs collected from L. europaeus in Romania, using molecular and morphological characterization simultaneously.

AB  - Many studies suggest that animals exhibit lateralized behaviors during stressful situations. However, which brain structure in each hemisphere underlies such lateralized function is unclear. This study, investigated the effects of bilateral and unilateral inhibition of the ventral hippocampus (VH) on chronic restraint stress (CRS) induced memory impairment. Unilateral and bilateral VH cannulation was carried out. After a week of recovery, lidocaine hydrochloride was injected into the rat VH ten minutes before CRS induction for seven consecutive days. Behavioral (Y-maze and Morris water maze; MWM)), and histological (glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFAP, ionized calcium-binding adapter protein-1; Iba-1, as well as Golgi-Cox staining in the VH) studies were performed. The result showed no significant difference between the effect of right-only and left-only of VH inhibition induced by lidocaine on spatial learning and memory and working memory. In addition, lidocaine treated groups were significantly lower in spatial learning and memory and working memory than control groups during non-stress conditions. Furthermore, the dendritic arborization in the right-only, left-only and bilateral VH microinjected lidocaine significantly decreased after the CRS condition compared with the control group. However, lidocaine microinjection resulted in up-regulation levels of GFAP and Iba1 in the right-only, left-only and bilateral of VH and they were higher significantly than that of their control groups after CRS and during non stress condition. Meanwhile, there is no significant difference between the effect of right-only and left-only of VH inhibition on neuronal arborization and glial cells during non-stress and after the CRS condition. In conclusion, bilateral VH inhibition can give rise to increase CRS-induced memory impairment. These findings were accompanied by elevating GFAP and Iba1 while reducing the dendritic arborization.

AB  - Thymoquinone is a pharmacologically active component of Nigella sativa Linn. seeds. Despite the diverse neuropharmacological attributes of TQ, limited reports related to adult neurogenesis and memory research are available. In this study, we investigated the effects of TQ on the proliferation and neural differentiation of cultured neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs). We also investigated the effect of TQ chronic administration on neurogenesis and memory in adult rats. Under proliferation conditions, TQ (0.05-0.3 mu M) significantly increased NSCs/NPCs viability, neurosphere diameter, and cell count. TQ treatment under differentiation conditions increased the proportion of cells positive for Tuj1 (a neuronal marker). Furthermore, chronic oral administration of TQ (25 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks) to adult rats increased the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-immunopositive cells double-stained with a mature neuronal marker, neuronal nuclei (NeuN), and a proliferation marker, doublecortin (Dcx), in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. TQ-administered rats showed a profound beneficial effect on avoidance-related learning ability, associated with an increase in the hippocampal mRNA and protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as measured by both real-time PCR and ELISA. Western blot analysis revealed that TQ stimulates the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), the upstream signaling molecule in the BDNF pathway. Furthermore, chronic administration of TQ decreased lipid peroxide and reactive oxygen species levels in the hippocampus. Taken together, our results suggest that TQ plays a role in memory improvement in adult rats and that the CREB/BDNF signaling pathways are involved in mediating the actions of TQ in hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Isorhamnetin (IRh), which has a wide range of pharmacological effects, is one of the most significant active components in the fruits of Hippophae rhamnoides L. and the leaves of Ginkgo biloba L. It protects the heart and brain, in addition to possessing anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, organ protection, and anti-obesity properties. We sought to assess IRh's anti-psoriatic activity, explore its immunomodulatory properties in reducing the severity of psoriatic symptoms, and evaluate its potential immunotherapeutic effects. We used IRh to treat imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis in BALB/C mice and examined the underlying mechanisms. The outcomes demonstrated that IRh reduced epidermal hyperplasia, lowered PASI scores, and improved histopathological psoriasiform lesions in IMQ-induced mice. IRh attenuated the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), and also reversed the reduction caused by IMQ of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in skin tissues. Additionally, IRh effectively inhibited IMQ's ability to increase proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-17A, and transcription factor NF-kappa B. Furthermore, IRh significantly reduced the percentage of Th1 and Th17 in the spleens of mice treated with IMQ and suppressed the maturation of splenic dendritic cells. Overall, our research suggests that IRh protects against oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, with potential for the development of new and potent medication for the treatment of psoriasis.

AB  - Despite the severe respiratory problems reducing the quality of life for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, their causes are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory responses in a transgenic mouse model of AD (A beta PP V717I) overexpressing A beta PP and mimicking early-onset AD. The cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine were used to investigate the effects of drugs, used to treat AD cognitive dysfunction, on breathing in hypoxia and hypercapnia. We found a significant increase in the respiratory response to hypercapnia and no difference in the hypoxic response in APP+ mice, compared with the control group (APP-). Memantine had no effect on respiration in either group, including responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Rivastigmine depressed resting ventilation and response to hypercapnia irrespective of the mice genotype. Reduction in hypoxia-augmented ventilation by rivastigmine was observed only in APP+ mice, which exhibited lower acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus. Treatment with rivastigmine reduced the enzyme activity in both groups equally in the hippocampus and brainstem. The increased ventilatory response to hypercapnia in transgenic mice may indicate alterations in chemoreceptive respiratory nuclei, resulting in increased CO2 sensitivity. Rivastigmine is a potent reductant of normoxic and hypercapnic respiration in APP+ and APP- mice.

AB  - In addition to its role as a neuronal energy substrate and signaling molecule involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, recent evidence shows that lactate produces antidepressant effects in animal models. However, the mechanisms underpinning lactate's antidepressant actions remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that lactate reverses the effects of corticosterone on depressive-like behavior, as well as on the inhibition of both the survival and proliferation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus. Furthermore, the inhibition of adult hippocampal neurogenesis prevents the antidepressant-like effects of lactate. Pyruvate, the oxidized form of lactate, did not mimic the effects of lactate on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and depression-like behavior. Finally, our data suggest that conversion of lactate to pyruvate with the concomitant production of NADH is necessary for the neurogenic and antidepressant effects of lactate.

AB  - Anxiety and depression have been suggested to increase the risk for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). A link between all these mental illnesses, inflammation and oxidative stress is also well established. Recent behavior studies by our group clearly demonstrate a powerful anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of a novel growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonist of MIAMI class, MIA-690, probably related to modulatory effects on the inflammatory and oxidative status. In the present work we investigated the potential beneficial effects of MIA-602, another recently developed GHRH antagonist, in mood disorders, as anxiety and depression, and the possible brain pathways involved in its protective activity, in adult mice. MIA-602 exhibited antinflammatory and antioxidant effects in ex vivo and in vivo experimental models, inducing anxiolytic and antidepressant-like behavior in mice subcutaneously treated for 4 weeks. The beneficial effect of MIA-602 on inflammatory and oxidative status and synaptogenesis resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects could be related by increases of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathways in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These results strongly suggest that GHRH analogs should be tried clinically for the treatment of mood disorders including PTSD.

AB  - Patients with malignant glioma often suffered from depression, which leads to an increased risk of detrimental outcomes. Imipramine, an FDA-approved tricyclic antidepressant, has been commonly used to relieve depressive symptoms in the clinic. Recently, imipramine has been reported to participate in the suppression of tumour progression in several human cancers, including prostate cancer, colon cancer and lymphomas. However, the effect of imipramine on malignant glioma is largely unclear. Here, we show that imipramine significantly retarded proliferation of immortalized and primary glioma cells. Mechanistically, imipramine suppressed tumour proliferation by inhibiting yes-associated protein (YAP), a recognized oncogene in glioma, independent of Hippo pathway. In addition to inhibiting YAP transcription, imipramine also promoted the subcellular translocation of YAP from nucleus into cytoplasm. Consistently, imipramine administration significantly reduced orthotopic tumour progression and prolonged survival of tumour-bearing mice. Moreover, exogenous overexpression of YAP partially restored the inhibitory effect of imipramine on glioma progression. Most importantly, compared with imipramine or temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy, combination therapy with imipramine and TMZ exhibited enhanced inhibitory effect on glioma growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the synergism of both agents. In conclusion, we found that tricyclic antidepressant imipramine impedes glioma progression by inhibiting YAP. In addition, combination therapy with imipramine and TMZ may potentially serve as promising anti-glioma regimens, thus predicting a broad prospect of clinical application.

AB  - Exercise can afford several benefits to combat mood disorders in both rodents and humans. Engagement in various physical activities upregulates levels of neurotrophic factors in several brain regions and improves mental health. However, the type of exercise that regulates mood and the underlying mechanisms in the brain remain elusive. Herein, we performed two distinct types of exercise and RNA sequencing analyses to investigate the effect of exercise on mood-related behaviors and explain the distinct patterns of gene expression. Specifically, resistance exercise exhibited reduced immobility time in the forced swim test when compared with both no exercise and treadmill exercise (in the aerobic training [AT] group). Interestingly, anxiety-like behaviors in the open field and nest-building tests were ameliorated in the AT group when compared with those in the control group; however, this was not observed in the RT group. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these different behavioral changes caused by distinct exercise types, we examined the shift in the gene expression pattern in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a critical role in regulating mood. We discovered that 38 and 40 genes were altered in the AT and RT groups, respectively, compared with the control group. Both exercises regulated 16 common genes. Compared with the control group, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was enriched in the AT group and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and neurotrophin signaling pathways were enriched in the RT group, as determined by bioinformatics pathway analysis. PCR results revealed that Cebpb expression was increased in AT group, and Dcx expression was upregulated in both groups. Our findings indicate that different exercise types may exert substantially distinct effects on mood-like behaviors. Accordingly, appropriate types of exercise can be undertaken based on the mood disorder to be regulated. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ischemic stroke represents a major cause of mortality worldwide. An elevated level of homocysteine (Hcy) is recognized as a powerful risk factor of ischemic stroke. We previously reported that Hcy induces cytotoxicity and proliferation inhibition in neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from the neonatal rat hippocampus in vitro. However, the toxic potential of Hcy on NSCs and its underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear in ischemic brain. Since DNA methylation is critical for establishing the diverse cell fates in the central nervous system, we hypothesized that negative effect of Hcy (an intermediate in the one-carbon metabolism) on neurogenesis might be link to DNA methylation in ischemic stroke. In our study, the rats in Hcy intervention group were intraperitoneally injected with 2% Hcy solution (5 mL/kg/d) for 7 consecutive days before MCAO surgery until they were sacrificed. Our study indicated that Hcy inhibited NSCs self-renewal capacity, which was exhibited by lowering the number of DCX+/BrdU+ and NeuN+/BrdU+ in ischemic brain hippocampus. A reduction in the activity of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), total methylation level and the number of 5mC+/NeuN+ and DCX+/5mC+ cells was observed in Hcy-treated ischemic brains. Additionally, Hcy also induced an increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and a decrease in the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to SAH. These results suggest that the alterations in DNA methylation may be an important mechanism by which Hcy inhibits neurogenesis after stroke. Hcy-induced DNA hypomethylation may be mainly caused by a reduction in the DNMT activity which is regulated by the concentrations of SAM and SAH. Maintaining normal DNA methylation by lowering Hcy level may possess therapeutic potential for promoting neurological recovery and reconstruction after stroke.

AB  - Glutamate-induced neural toxicity in autophagic neuron death is partially mediated by increased oxidative stress. Therefore, reducing oxidative stress in the brain is critical for treating or preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Selaginella tamariscina is a traditional medicinal plant for treating gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, leucorrhea, inflammation, chronic hepatitis, gout, and hyperuricemia. We investigate the inhibitory effects of Selaginella tamariscina ethanol extract (STE) on neurotoxicity and autophagic cell death in glutamate-exposed HT22 mouse hippocampal cells. STE significantly increased cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased the expression of reactive oxygen species, lactate dehydrogenase release, and cell apoptosis in glutamate-exposed HT22 cells. In addition, while glutamate induced the excessive activation of mitophagy, STE attenuated glutamate-induced light chain (LC) 3 II and Beclin-1 expression and increased p62 expression. Furthermore, STE strongly enhanced the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation activation. STE strongly inhibited glutamate-induced autophagy by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In contrast, the addition of LY294002, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor, remarkably suppressed cell viability and p-Akt and p62 expression, while markedly increasing the expression of LC3 II and Beclin-1. Our findings indicate that autophagy inhibition by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR phosphorylation levels could be responsible for the neuroprotective effects of STE on glutamate neuronal damage.

AB  - Depression has become an important disease threatening human health. In recent years, the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating the disease has become increasingly prominent, so it is meaningful to find new antidepressant TCM. Mahonia fortune (Lindl.) Fedde is a primary drug in traditional formulas for the treatment of depression, and alkaloids are the main components of it. However, the detailed mechanism of Mahonia alkaloids (MA) on depression remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MA on gap junction function in depression via the miR-205/Cx43 axis. The antidepressant effects of MA were observed by a rat model of reserpine-induced depression and a model of corticosterone (CORT)-induced astrocytes. The concentrations of neurotransmitters were measured by ELISA, the expression of Connexin 43 (Cx43) protein was measured by Immunohistochemistry and western-blot, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) proteins were measured by western-blot, the pathological changes of prefrontal cortex were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the binding of miR-205 and Cx43. The regulation effect of Cx43 on CREB was verified by interference experiment. Gap junction dysfunction was detected by fluorescent yellow staining. The results confirmed that MA remarkably decreased miR-205 expression and increased Cx43, BDNF, CREB expression in depression rat and CORT-induced astrocytes. In addition, after overexpression of miR-205 in vitro, the decreased expression of Cx43, BDNF and CREB could be reversed by MA. Moreover, after interfering with Cx43, the decreased expression of CREB and BDNF could be reversed by MA. Thus, MA may ameliorate depressive behavior through CREB/BDNF pathway regulated by miR-205/Cx43 axis.

AB  - Background Dioecy, a common reproductive strategy in angiosperms, has evolved independently in various plant lineages, and this has resulted in the evolution of diverse sex chromosome systems and sex determination mechanisms. Hippophae is a genus of dioecious plants with an XY sex determination system, but the molecular underpinnings of this process have not yet been clarified. Most previously published sea buckthorn genome data have been derived from females, yet genomic data on males are critically important for clarifying our understanding of sex determination in this genus. Comparative genomic analyses of male and female sea buckthorn plants can shed light on the origins and evolution of sex. These studies can also enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual differentiation and provide novel insights and data for future research on sexual reproduction in plants.Results We conducted an in-depth analysis of the genomes of 2 sea buckthorn species, including a male Hippophae gyantsensis, a female Hippophae salicifolia, and 2 haplotypes of male H. salicifolia. The genome size of H. gyantsensis was 704.35 Mb, and that of the female H. salicifolia was 788.28 Mb. The sizes of the 2 haplotype genomes were 1,139.99 Mb and 1,097.34 Mb. The sex-determining region (SDR) of H. salicifolia was 29.71 Mb and contained 249 genes. A comparative analysis of the haplotypes of Chr02 of H. salicifolia revealed that the Y chromosome was shorter than the X chromosome. Chromosomal evolution analysis indicated that Hippophae has experienced significant chromosomal rearrangements following 2 whole-genome duplication events, and the fusion of 2 chromosomes has potentially led to the early formation of sex chromosomes in sea buckthorn. Multiple structural variations between Y and X sex-linked regions might have facilitated the rapid evolution of sex chromosomes in H. salicifolia. Comparison of the transcriptome data of male and female flower buds from H. gyantsensis and H. salicifolia revealed 11 genes specifically expressed in males. Three of these were identified as candidate genes involved in the sex determination of sea buckthorn. These findings will aid future studies of the sex determination mechanisms in sea buckthorn.Conclusion A comparative genomic analysis was performed to identify the SDR in H. salicifolia. The origins and evolutionary trajectories of sex chromosomes within Hippophae were also determined. Three potential candidate genes associated with sea buckthorn sex determination were identified. Overall, our findings will aid future studies aimed at clarifying the mechanisms of sex determination.

AB  - Many studies evaluated the functional role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and its key role in cognitive functions and mood regulation. The effects of promoting AHN on the recovery of stress-induced symptoms have been well studied, but its involvement in stress resilience remains elusive. We used a mouse model enabling us to foster AHN before the exposure to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to evaluate the potential protective effects of AHN on stress, assessing the depressive-like phenotype and executive functions. For this purpose, an inducible transgenic mouse model was used to delete the pro-apoptotic gene Bax from neural progenitors four weeks before UCMS, whereby increasing the survival of adult-generated neurons. Our results showed that UCMS elicited a depressive-like phenotype, highlighted by a deteriorated coat state, a higher immobility duration in the tail suspension test (TST), and a delayed reversal learning in a water maze procedure. Promoting AHN before UCMS was sufficient to prevent the development of stressed-induced behavioral changes in the TST and the water maze, reflecting an effect of AHN on stress resilience. Taken together, our data suggest that increasing AHN promotes stress resilience on some depressive-like symptoms but also in cognitive symptoms, which are often observed in MD.

AB  - Anxiety disorders, as common neurological diseases in clinical practice, often coexist with depression. Epidemiological surveys indicate that approximately 85% of patients with depression exhibit significant anxiety symptoms. This comorbid state not only exacerbates clinical symptoms but also leads to treatment resistance and prolonged disease duration. This study innovatively developed a compound aromatic plant essential oil (EO) formulation with remarkable anxiolytic and antidepressant effects and systematically elucidated its mechanism of action. The study found that the essential oil formulation, administered via inhalation, could significantly improve behavioral abnormalities in animals subjected to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model, specifically manifesting as (1) the reversal of stress-induced weight gain retardation; (2) a significant increase in sucrose preference; (3) an increase in the total distance of spontaneous activity; and (4) the prolongation of exploration time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Neuropathological examinations confirmed that the formulation could effectively protect the structural integrity of hippocampal neurons and alleviate CUMS-induced neural damage. In terms of mechanism of action, the study revealed that the formulation regulates the neurotransmitter system through multiple targets: (1) the upregulation of serotonin (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels; (2) the downregulation of glutamate (GLU) concentration; and (3) key targets identified via network pharmacological analysis, such as ESR1, STAT3, and PPARG. These findings provide molecular-level evidence for understanding the neuromodulatory effects of aromatic essential oils. Pharmaceutical formulation studies showed that the oil-in-water (O/W) type compound essential oil microemulsion, prepared using microemulsification technology, has a uniform particle size and excellent stability, maintaining stable physicochemical properties at room temperature for an extended period, thus laying a foundation for its clinical application. This study not only validates the practical value of traditional medicine but also provides new ideas for the development of novel anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs, achieving an organic integration of traditional experience and modern technology.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of diet supplementation with stevia residue extract (SRE) on growth performance, intestinal health, and antioxidant capacity of weaned piglets. A total of 144 weaned piglets (body weight 6.8 +/- 0.5 kg) were randomly selected and allocated into four treatment groups with six replicates of six pigs/pen. The treatments consisted of a basal diet without SRE or basal diet supplemented with 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg SRE. The results showed that the addition of 200 mg/kg SRE to the diet significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the diarrhea rate of piglets compared with the control group. The supplementation of 400 mg/kg SRE in the diet significantly reduced the piglets' serum MDA content and significantly increased (p < 0.05) the T-AOC, T-SOD, and GSH-PX activity in the serum. The dietary supplementation with 400 mg/kg SRE significantly increased (p < 0.05) the CAT and GSH-PX activity in the liver. Moreover, the supplementation of 400 mg/kg SRE in the diet significantly increased (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae (genus) and Roseburia (genus) beneficial bacteria compared to the control group. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that Prevotella (genus) abundance was positively correlated with liver GSH-PX activity and acetic acid content of colon contents. In conclusion, the supplementation of 400 mg/kg SRE to the diet can improve piglet health by regulating antioxidant reduction homeostasis, which may also be associated with an increase in the relative numbers of potentially beneficial bacteria.

AB  - Silybin (Si) is the main element of silymarin isolated from the seeds of Silybum marianum L. Gaernt., which has superior antioxidant properties. However, the protective role of Si in maintaining liver health under oxidative stress remains ambiguous. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of the beneficial effect of dietary Si against hepatic oxidative injury induced by paraquat (PQ) in weaned piglets. A total of 24 piglets were randomly allocated to four treatments with six replicates per treatment and 1 piglet per replicate: the control group; Si group; PQ group; and Si + PQ group. Piglets in the control group and PQ group were given a basal diet, while piglets in the Si and Si + PQ groups were given a Si-supplemented diet. On the 18th day, the pigs in the PQ treatment group received an intraperitoneal injection of PQ, and the others were intraperitoneally injected with the same volume of saline. All piglets were sacrificed on day 21 for plasma and liver sample collection. The results showed that dietary Si supplementation mitigated PQ-induced liver damage, as proven by the reduction in liver pathological changes and plasma activity of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase. Si also improved superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and total antioxidant capacity, as well as decreased malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide concentration in the liver, which were closely related to the activation of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling pathway. Meanwhile, Si reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 production and their transcript levels as well as abrogated the overactivation of nuclear factor-kappa B induced by PQ. Importantly, Si improved mitochondrial function by maintaining mitochondrial energetics and mitochondrial dynamics, which was indicated by the elevated activity of mitochondrial complexes I and V and adenosine triphosphate content, decreased expression of dynamin 1 protein, and increased expression of mitofusin 2 protein. Moreover, Si inhibited excessive hepatic apoptosis by regulating the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated-X-protein signaling pathway. Taken together, these results indicated that Si potentially mitigated PQ-induced hepatic oxidative insults by improving antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial function and inhibiting inflammation and cell apoptosis in weaned piglets.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is linked to various developmental brain disorders. Infants who are asymptomatic at birth might have postnatal neurocognitive complications. However, animal models recapitulating these neurocognitive phenotypes are lacking, and the circuit mechanism underlying behavioral abnormalities is unknown. Here, we show that ZIKV infection during mouse pregnancy induces maternal immune activation (MIA) and leads to autistic-like behaviors including repetitive self-grooming and impaired social memory in offspring. In the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ZIKV-affected offspring mice exhibit excitation and inhibition imbalance and increased cortical activity. This could be explained by dysregulation of inhibitory neurons and synapses, and elevated neural activity input from mPFC-projecting ventral hippocampus (vHIP) neurons. We find structure alterations in the synaptic connections and pattern of vHIP innervation of mPFC neurons, leading to hyperconnectivity of the vHIP-mPFC pathway. Decreasing the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons with a chemogenetic strategy rescues social memory deficits in ZIKV offspring mice. Our studies reveal a hyperconnectivity of vHIP to mPFC projection driving social memory deficits in mice exposed to maternal inflammation by ZIKV.

AB  - ObjectivePreserving intestinal barrier integrity and modulating post-stroke gut inflammatory milieu have garnered increasing attention as novel therapeutic strategies for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Parthenolide (PTL) demonstrates potent anti-inflammatory properties through multiple pharmacological pathways. While accumulating preclinical evidence supports PTL's neuroprotective efficacy in CIRI and other neurological conditions, its therapeutic effects on gut-brain axis signaling pathways remain poorly characterized. This investigation was specifically undertaken to comprehensively assess PTL's therapeutic potential in mitigating CIRI-induced cognitive deficits, and mechanistically decipher its regulatory effects on gut-derived inflammatory mediators and barrier-protective mechanisms.MethodsA rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion (MCAO/R) was used, with PTL administered at various doses. Cognitive function was evaluated using neurological deficit scores, the novel object recognition test, and the Morris water maze. Hippocampal pathology was assessed by Nissl staining, while the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay was used to detect neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus. Histopathological changes in the colon were examined with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Proinflammatory cytokines expression were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tight junction proteins and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) pathway proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blot. In vitro studies were conducted using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6.ResultsPTL significantly alleviated cognitive deficits caused by CIRI in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, it exhibited marked protective effects against neuronal damage and neuroinflammation induced by brain I/R. Furthermore, PTL mitigated intestinal inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and systemic inflammation in MCAO/R rats. PTL effectively blocked the NF-kappa B axis. NF-kappa B overexpression counteracted the protective impact of PTL on intestinal epithelial cells injured by LPS.ConclusionPTL maintains intestinal homeostasis and ameliorates cognitive dysfunction following CIRI by inhibiting the NF-kappa B axis.

AB  - Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that exhibit enormous diversity in their expression patterns, sequence homology, pharmacology, biophysical properties and signaling pathways in the brain. In general, mGluRs modulate different traits of neuronal physiology, including excitability and plasticity processes. Particularly, group I mGluRs located at the pre- or postsynaptic compartments are involved in spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at hippocampal and neocortical synapses. Their roles of participating in the underlying mechanisms for detection of activity coincidence in STDP induction are debated, and diverse findings support models involving mGluRs in STDP forms in which NMDARs do not operate as classical postsynaptic coincidence detectors. Here, we briefly review the involvement of group I mGluRs in STDP and their possible role as coincidence detectors.

AB  - D-galactose (D-gal) administration was proven to induce cognitive impairment and aging in rodents' models. Geraniol (GNL) belongs to the acyclic isoprenoid monoterpenes. GNL reduces inflammation by changing important signaling pathways and cytokines, and thus it is plausible to be used as a medicine for treating disorders linked to inflammation. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effects of GNL on D-gal-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation-mediated memory loss in mice. The study was conducted using six groups of mice (6 mice per group). The first group received normal saline, then D-gal (150 mg/wt) dissolved in normal saline solution (0.9%, w/v) was given orally for 9 weeks to the second group. In the III group, from the second week until the 10th week, mice were treated orally (without anesthesia) with D-gal (150 mg/kg body wt) and GNL weekly twice (40 mg/kg body wt) four hours later. Mice in Group IV were treated with GNL from the second week up until the end of the experiment. For comparison of young versus elderly mice, 4-month-old (Group V) and 16-month-old (Group VI) control mice were used. We evaluated the changes in antioxidant levels, PI3K/Akt levels, and Nrf2 levels. We also examined how D-gal and GNL treated pathological aging changes. Administration of GNL induced a significant increase in spatial learning and memory with spontaneously altered behavior. Enhancing anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and activating PI3K/Akt were the mechanisms that mediated this effect. Further, GNL treatment upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1 to reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis. This was confirmed using( 99m)Tc-HMPAO brain flow gamma bioassays. Thus, our data suggested GNL as a promising agent for treating neuroinflammation-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Purpose: The study aimed to investigate whether astrocyte pyroptosis, and the subsequent neuroinflammatory response that exerts amyloid 8 (A8) neurotoxic effects, has an effect on endothelial cells, along with the underlying mechanisms.Methods: In vivo, 5 mu L of disease venom was injected into the lateral ventricle of APP/PS1 mice for treatment. Pyroptosis was induced by treating astrocytes with A842 in vitro. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence caspase-1 and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) mRNA expression. Cell viability was determined using a CCK-8 detection kit. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect cell pyroptosis. The degree of pathological damage to the brain and aortic tissue was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry.Results: A842 induced astrocyte pyroptosis dependent on the GSDMD/Gasdermin E (GSDME)/Caspase 11/ NLRP3 pathway, releasing large amounts of inflammatory factors, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-18, and IL-18. Astrocyte pyroptosis caused endothelial cell dysfunction and release of large amounts of vasoconstrictors (ET and vWF). Knockdown of GSDMD reduced astrocyte pyroptosis in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal tissue, decreased the release of inflammatory factors IL-1 8 and IL-18, reduced A8 deposition and tau protein, increased the release of peripheral vasodilator substances (eNOS), and decreased the release of vasoconstrictor substances (ET, vWF), thereby reducing brain tissue damage and vascular injury in APP/PS1 mice.Conclusion: A842 induced astrocyte pyroptosis, while GSDMD knockout inhibited astrocyte pyroptosis, reduced the release of inflammatory factors, and alleviated brain tissue damage and vascular damage in APP/PS1 mice. Therefore, GSDMD is a novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Background: Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is the most common (45%-74%) mucormycosis in India. With contemporary medical care, ROCM has a mortality rate of 40%-50% and 70% of survivors are left with residual defects. Recently, several cases of mucormycosis in people with COVID-19 have been increasingly reported worldwide, from India, due to immune dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. To reduce the high mortality rate and residual defect in most survivors under the guidelines of the Ministry of AYUSH, the Government of India recommended homoeopathy as an add-on therapy to maximizethe effectiveness of standard treatment in conventional therapy. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the role of existing homoeopathic treatment as an adjuvant therapy in patients with COVID-19-related ROCM and enhancing the survival of the patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection and to access the initial treatment response and duration required for significant or complete recovery in patients receiving adjuvant treatment. Methods: Thissuperiority, randomizedcontrolledclinical trial would includetwo parallel comparatorgroupsA and B. Group A would be the experimental group and would receive homoeopathic treatment along with the standard line of treatment as per investigational medicinal product (IMP) and group B would be the control arm and would receive standard line of treatment as per IMP along with identical placebo. Allocation would be 1:1 through randomization. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 36 participants per arm would be screened. Participants would be assessed clinically twice a day and magnetic resonance imagery or endoscopy cum-biopsy would be assessed on days 1, 14, and 28. Laboratory investigations may vary as per demand of disease conditions. Results: In India, the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during the second wave, resulted in a surge of mucormycosis cases among patients with COVID-19. At the time this protocol was being developed, there was a significant spike in mucormycosis cases in India, particularly in Mumbai (June 2021). However, by the time the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy obtained the necessary approvals and ethical clearance for the study, the incidence of mucormycosis had drastically declined (September 2021). As a result, the study was not initiated and registered. The authors feel it is their ethical responsibility to share the reviewed protocol with the medical community as a reference for future work. Conclusions:This study aims to evaluate the role of existing homoeopathic medicines as an adjuvant therapy in managing COVID-19-related ROCM, potentially contributing to the use of homoeopathy as an evidence-based medical approach. The protocol can also serve as a valuable resourcefor clinicians and researchers addressing mucormycosis cases unrelated to COVID-19, particularly in immunocompromised patients. It would help ensure preparedness, whether or not sufficient evidence is available, in the event of a future health emergency. International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/57905

AB  - Clinically, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most prevalent type of partial epilepsy and often accompanied by various comorbidities. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of chronic treatment with the antiepileptic drug (AED) lacosamide (LCM) on spontaneous motor seizures (SMS), behavioral comorbidities, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal damage in a model of TLE. Vehicle/LCM treatment (30 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered 3 h after the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and continued for up to 12 weeks in Wistar rats. Our study showed that LCM attenuated the number of SMS and corrected comorbid to epilepsy impaired motor activity, anxiety, memory, and alleviated depressive-like responses measured in the elevated plus maze, object recognition test, radial arm maze test, and sucrose preference test, respectively. This AED suppressed oxidative stress through increased superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels, and alleviated catalase activity and lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. Lacosamide treatment after SE mitigated the increased levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus and exerted strong neuroprotection both in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and partially in the piriform cortex. Our results suggest that the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activity of LCM is an important prerequisite for its anticonvulsant and beneficial effects on SE-induced behavioral comorbidities.

AB  - Chronic stress is a critical factor in the aetiology of anxiety disorders; however, in the clinic, enduring and preventive measures are not available, and therapeutic drugs are associated with inevitable side effects. Our study established an anxiety rat model using chronic restraint stress (CRS) and assessed these animals using the open-field test, elevated plus-maze test, and light-dark box test. Jie-Yu-He-Huan capsule (JYHH), a Chinese medicine formula, was used as a preventative drug. The HPA axis-mediated release of corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticosterone from the hypothalamus was tested. In the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, as well as monoamine oxidase A, glucocorticoid receptor, and 5-HT1A receptor expression levels, were measured. Furthermore, we examined protein and mRNA expression of cAMP-PKA-CREB-BDNF pathway components. The results showed that JYHH had a significant preventative effect on the anxiety-like behaviour induced by CRS and prevented abnormal changes in the HPA axis and 5-HT system. Furthermore, CRS inhibited the cAMP-PKA-CREB-BDNF pathway, which returned to normal levels following JYHH treatment. This might be the underlying molecular mechanism of the antianxiety effect of JYHH, which could provide a new clinical target for preventative anxiolytic drugs for chronic stress.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered a promising tool for treating cerebral ischemic injury. However, their poor survival after transplantation limits their therapeutic effect and applications. Salidroside has been reported to exert potent cytoprotective and neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to investigate whether salidroside could improve MSC survival under hypoxic-ischemic conditions and, subsequently, alleviate cerebral ischemic injury in a rat model. MSCs were pretreated by salidroside under hypoxic-ischemic conditions. The cell proliferation, migratory capacity, and apoptosis were evaluated by means of Cell Counting Kit-8, transwell assay, and flow cytometry. MSCs pretreated with salidroside were transplanted into the rats subsequent to middle cerebral artery occlusion. The grip strength, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and hematoxylin-eosin staining were used to analyze the therapeutic efficiency and pathological changes. The mature neuron marker NeuN and astrocyte marker GFAP in the focal area were detected by immunofluorescence. These results indicated that salidroside promoted the proliferation, migration and reduced apoptosis of MSCs under hypoxic-ischemic conditions. In vivo experiments revealed that transplantation of salidroside-pretreated MSCs strengthened the therapeutic efficiency by enhancing neurogenesis and inhibiting neuroinflammation in the hippocampal CA1 area after ischemia. Our results suggest that pretreatment with salidroside could be an effective strategy to enhance the cell survival rate and the therapeutic effect of MSCs in treating cerebral ischemic injury.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious neurodegenerative disorder representing a serious continuously escalating medico-social problem. The AD-associated progressive dementia is followed by gradual formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Though, converging evidence indicates apparent metabolic dysfunctions as key AD characteristic. In particular, late-onset AD possesses a clear metabolic signature. Considerable brain insulin signaling impairment and a decline in glucose metabolism are common AD attributes. Thus, positron emission tomography (PET) with glucose tracers is a reliable non-invasive tool for early AD diagnosis and treatment efficacy monitoring. Various approaches and agents have been trialed to modulate insulin signaling. Accumulating data point to arginase inhibition as a promising direction to treat AD via diverse molecular mechanisms involving, inter alia, the insulin pathway. Here, we use a transgenic AD mouse model, demonstrating age-dependent brain insulin signaling abnormalities, reduced brain insulin receptor levels, and substantial energy metabolism alterations, to evaluate the effects of arginase inhibition with Norvaline on glucose metabolism. We utilize fluorodeoxyglucose whole-body micro-PET to reveal a significant treatment-associated increase in glucose uptake by the brain tissue in-vivo. Additionally, we apply advanced molecular biology and bioinformatics methods to explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of Norvaline on glucose metabolism. We demonstrate that treatment-associated improvement in glucose utilization is followed by significantly elevated levels of insulin receptor and glucose transporter-3 expression in the mice hippocampi. Additionally, Norvaline diminishes the rate of Tau protein phosphorylation. Our results suggest that Norvaline interferes with AD pathogenesis. These findings open new avenues for clinical evaluation and innovative drug development.

AB  - Extracts from plants/herbals are great resources of drugs and nutrients. Baicalein, a component present in Scutellaria baicalensis, was previously found to alleviate the abnormal depolarization brought about by A beta oligomers. We extended this promising outcome by screening baicalein derivatives, and a natural compound named homoplantaginin was pinpointed. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of homoplantaginin on animal behavior and explore its neuronal functioning/mechanism. In behavior tests, impairments of novel object recognition and of spatial learning/memory were reversed by homoplantaginin in a J20 Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Utilizing primary glutamatergic neurons, homoplantaginin was found to prevent the A beta oligomer-induced increase in ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, homoplantaginin inhibits both AMPA-insult and NMDA-insult depolarization; this was assessed using DiBAC4(3), a membrane potential sensitive dye. Finally, homoplantaginin blocks both A beta oligomer-induced and NMDA-induced calcium influx, which was assessed by intracellular calcium measurement using Fura2/AM. Interestingly, homoplantaginin immediately blunts the steady state calcium influx caused by NMDA. Taken together, homoplantaginin is capable of inhibiting A beta oligomer-induced pathophysiology, in particular at the receptor level. This pure compound has great potential to be developed as a clinical therapeutic drug.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a type of coronavirus that infects pigs, resulting in high mortality rates in piglets and posing a significant threat to the swine industry. However, the biological mechanisms underlying PEDV-induced intestinal damage and the role of oxidative stress in this context remain poorly understood. In the present study, quantitative proteomics was employed to identify key genes associated with PEDV infection. We established an in vivo PEDV infection model using piglets and conducted in vitro studies employing Z-nucleic acid (NA)-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) knockdown and knockout (KO) models in Vero E6 cells. Several techniques were used, including transmission electron microscopy, H&E staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy, TUNEL staining, and AO/EB staining, to assess morphological changes in the intestinal tissue of piglets and to evaluate alterations in oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential, and PANoptosis-related marker molecules in cells. Our findings indicated that PEDV infection results in increased expression of ZBP1 and PANoptosis-related markers. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PEDV-N colocalizes with Z-RNA and ZBP1, and that oxidative stress inhibitors effectively mitigate PEDV-induced PANoptosis. Collectively, our results suggest that ZBP1 triggers cellular oxidative damage by recognizing Z-NA structures during PEDV invasion, thereby inducing apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, which ultimately leads to intestinal PANoptosis. These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding PEDV-induced intestinal injury in piglets and offer valuable insights for comparative medicine research.

KW  - ELEMENT
AB  - Detailed modelling of masonry arch bridges and viaducts presents unique computational challenges. Not only do such structures exhibit complex nonlinear behaviour, but they are also difficult to describe within a consistent computational framework for high-fidelity simulations, due to the range of interactive components with varying geometric characteristics. This paper presents a novel parametric model design tool for the generation of detailed 3D FE meshes of realistic masonry arch bridges and viaducts. This tool has been developed according to a modular description as an add-on component within the Rhino - Grasshopper environment. It allows for modular complex bridge assemblages with independent definition of the key viaduct parts, including arch barrels, spandrel walls, piers as well as multi-layered fill. Moreover, new parts can be seamlessly introduced into the framework due to its modular nature. Notably, as all components are geometrically addressable, it is possible to further enhance the model generation tool by adding non-standard routines to create more complex geometry than that allowed by the current parametric definition. Importantly, the developed strategy enables variable fidelity model generation, where different segments of an analysed viaduct can be represented by meso- and/or macro-scale masonry descriptions at different levels of detail. This approach further enables the consideration of initial damage in the brick/blockwork, which is a very common feature of many existing masonry bridges and viaducts.

AB  - Depression and obesity are comorbid conditions linked through shared neuroinflammatory and immune mechanisms. This study examined the effects of chronic cannabidiol (CBD) treatment on behavior and neuroinflammatory gene expression in female rats exposed to a combined model of high-fat diet (HFD) and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Rats were subjected to an acute HFD for 2 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of UCMS. CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered during the final 2 weeks of UCMS. Specifically, mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappa B1 (NF-kappa B1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-6 were measured in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and CA1. CBD's effects varied depending on the type of stressor. It promoted coping behavior, increased locomotion, reduced freezing, and restored UCMS-induced depressive-like behavior in a splash test. In the vmPFC, CBD normalized the HFD- and UCMS-induced increase in il1 beta, and downregulated nfkb1 and tnfa expression. In the CA1, it normalized stress-induced downregulation in nfkb1 expression. These findings suggest that the efficacy of CBD in modulating both behavior and neuroinflammation is contingent upon the nature of the stress exposure, highlighting its potential as a targeted treatment for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders in females.

During one month of setting and hardening, synthetic C(3)A was subjected to corrosion in corn silage, pig slurry and chicken manure. The hardening process of the C(3)A phase in water was used as a reference sample. The phase composition and microstructure of the hydrating tricalcium aluminate slurries were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis (DTA/TG/DTG/EGA), scanning microscopy (SEM, EDS) and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). In the samples studied, it was observed that the qualitative and quantitative phase composition of the synthetic tricalcium aluminate preparations changed depending on the corrosion exposure conditions. The main crystalline phases formed by the hydration of the examined samples in water as well as in corrosive media were the catoite (Ca3Al2(OH)(12)) and hydrocalumite (Ca2Al(OH)(7)center dot 3H(2)O) phases. Detailed analysis showed the occurrence of secondary crystallisation in hydrating samples and the phases were mainly calcium carbonates (CaCO3) with different crystallite sizes. In the phase composition of the C(3)A pastes, varying amounts of aluminium hydroxides (Al(OH)(3)) were also present. The crystalline phases formed as a result of secondary crystallisation represented biological corrosion products, probably resulting from the reaction of hydrates with secondary products resulting from the metabolic processes of anaerobic bacterial respiration (from living matter) associated with the presence of bacteria in the reaction medium. The results obtained contribute towards the development of fast-acting and bio-corrosion-resistant special cements for use in bioenergetics.

AB  - Zinc (Zn) and nitrogen (N) are the two crucial nutrients for tea plant growth and development and contribute to the quality formation of tea fresh leaves. In this study, a zinc/iron-regulated transporter-like protein 4 gene (i.e., CsZIP4) was functionally characterized. Expression profiling showed that CsZIP4 could be induced by Zn stresses and a N deficiency. Heterologous expression of CsZIP4 in yeast revealed that CsZIP4 possessed the capacity for Zn transport but not ammonium. Moreover, CsZIP4 overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana promoted Zn and N uptake and transport and contributed to alleviate Zn stresses by collaborating with N supply, which might be interrelated to the expression of N or Zn metabolism-related genes, such as AtNRT1.1 and AtZIP4. Additionally, CsZIP4 was localized in the plasma membrane and chloroplast, which was helpful in maintaining cellular homeostasis under a Zn excess. Furthermore, silencing of CsZIP4 in tea plants by virus-induced gene silencing increased the chlorophyll content but decreased the Zn content. Finally, the yeast one-hybrid assay demonstrated that CsbZIP2 bound to the CsZIP4 promoter. These results will shed light on the functions of CsZIP4 in the N and Zn interaction in tea plants.

AB  - The effect of extracts from four types of tea made from Camelia sinensis (green, white, black, and oolong) on in vitro amylolysis of gelatinized starch and the underlying mechanisms were studied. Of the four extracts, black tea extract (BTE) gave the strongest inhibition of starch digestion and on alpha-amylase activity. Fluorescence quenching and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) showed compounds in BTE bound to alpha-amylase more strongly than those in the green, white, and oolong tea extracts. Individual testing of five phenolic compounds abundant in tea extracts showed that theaflavins had a greater inhibitory effect than catechins on alpha-amylase. SPR showed that theaflavins had much lower equilibrium dissociation constants and therefore bound more tightly to aamylase than catechins. We conclude that BTE had a stronger inhibitory effect on in vitro enzymatic starch digestion than the other tea extracts, mainly due to the higher content of theaflavins causing stronger inhibition of alpha-amylase.

AB  - The lateral habenula (LHb) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which form interconnected circuits, have important roles in the crucial control of sensory and cognitive motifs. Signaling in the LHb-VTA pathway can be exacerbated during pain conditions by a hyperactivity of LHb glutamatergic neurons to inhibit local VTA DAergic cells. However, it is still unclear whether and how this circuit is endogenously engaged in pain-related cognitive dysfunctions. To answer this question, we modulated this pathway by expressing halorhodopsin in LHb neurons of adult male rats, and then selectively inhibited the axonal projections from these neurons to the VTA during a working memory (WM) task. Behavioral performance was assessed after the onset of an inflammatory pain model. We evaluated the impact of the inflammatory pain in the VTA synapses by performing immunohistochemical characterization of specific markers for GABAergic (GAD65/67) and dopaminergic neurons (dopamine transporter (DAT), dopamine D2 receptor (D2r) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)). Our results revealed that inhibition of LHb terminals in the VTA during the WM delay-period elicits a partial recovery of the performance of pain animals (in higher complexity challenges); this performance was not accompanied by a reduction of nociceptive responses. Finally, we found evidence that the pain-affected animals exhibit VTA structural changes, namely with an upregulation of GAD65/67, and a downregulation of DAT and D2r. These results demonstrate a role of LHb neurons and highlight their responsibility in the stability of the local VTA network, which regulates signaling in frontal areas necessary to support WM processes.

AB  - This study provides new insights into how sex and chronic stress influence circRNA expression in the rat ventral hippocampus, a region critical for emotional processing. We identified 206 sex-biased circRNAs and 194 stress-responsive circRNAs, highlighting distinct expression profiles. Parental genes of male circRNAs were primarily enriched in synaptic transmission pathways, while those of female circRNAs were associated with axon guidance, emphasizing sex-specific molecular differences. Chronic stress also triggered miRNA changes unique to each sex, revealing divergent regulatory mechanisms. The identified circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes, modulated under stress, appear to regulate the translation of numerous potential mRNA targets. In males, stress positively regulated neuroprotective pathways, suggesting a compensatory response to mitigate stress-induced damage. In contrast, females exhibited a broader translational network that favored mRNA expression without distinct pathway-specific actions. However, the smaller repressed network in females-characterized by a higher circRNA-to-miRNA and mRNA ratio-may indicate a more selective and targeted regulatory mechanism, with many interactions linked to anti-inflammatory processes. Coexpression analysis revealed two male-specific modules with altered activity under stress. These were associated with processes such as reticulum stress and actin dynamics, the latter linked to dendritic spine loss and depressive-like behaviors, extensively documented in chronically stressed male rats. Conversely, females displayed an activated stress-responsive module, promoting axon guidance and long-term potentiation, which may contribute to improved cognitive outcomes. Among the identified circRNAs, rno-Gabrg3_0001 emerged as stress-sensitive in males. This circRNA exhibited predicted miRNA binding sites and interactions with proteins involved in vesicle trafficking, forming part of a highly active module enriched in genes related to ion transport and membrane protein localization. Overall, these findings uncover sex-dependent regulatory mechanisms driving transcriptomic changes under chronic stress, deepening our understanding of ventral hippocampal molecular functions. Investigating these regulatory networks, which differentially affect the male and female ventral hippocampus, could inform the development of sex-specific therapeutic strategies for stress-related disorders.

AB  - Deregulation of protein synthesis and ER stress/unfolded protein response (ER stress/UPR) have been reported in astrocytes. However, the relationships between protein synthesis deregulation and ER stress/UPR, as well as their role in the altered homeostatic support of Alzheimer's disease (AD) astrocytes remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2 alpha and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker (EML) resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2 alpha without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2 alpha and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent. Next, we investigated the ability of 3xTg-AD astrocytes to support metabolism and function of other cells of the central nervous system. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from 3Tg-iAstro cells significantly reduced protein synthesis rate in primary hippocampal neurons. When added as a part of pericyte/endothelial cell (EC)/astrocyte 3D co-culture, 3Tg-iAstro, but not WT-iAstro, severely impaired formation and ramification of tubules, the effect, replicated by EML overexpression in WT-iAstro cells. Finally, a chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) rescued protein synthesis, p-eIF2 alpha levels in 3Tg-iAstro cells and tubulogenesis in pericyte/EC/3Tg-iAstro co-culture. Collectively, our results suggest that a PERK-independent, p-eIF2 alpha-associated impairment of protein synthesis compromises astrocytic homeostatic functions, and this may be caused by the altered ER-mitochondria interaction.

AB  - As a primary determinant of nasal physiological functions, the nasal morphology and its effects on the airflow dynamics have been extensively studied in literature. However, gross flow features reported in literature are mostly obtained from subjects at similar ages, while studies focusing on nasal subjects with distinct age differences are significantly less. To advance current understandings of nasal airflow dynamics in the context of age diversity, this study employed three anatomically accurate nasal cavity models with distinct age features (5-, 24- and 77-year-old models) and numerically compared the physiological nasal airflow fields within these nasal cavity models. To demonstrate the validity of the present numerical models, in vivo rhinomanometry measurement was conducted on the 24-year-old female nasal model, and key anatomical features and pressure-flow curves of all three models were compared with models with similar age features in literature work. Apart from results comparison based on conventional velocity flow fields and wall shear stress distributions, a method for quantifying flow partitions in confined airway spaces was developed to reveal the proportions of fractional flow that enters the olfactory region. Our results revealed dramatic intersubject discrepancies between considered nasal cavity models, especially for the fractional flow that enters the olfactory region. Specifically, the 5-year-old girl nasal model received the highest proportion of fractional flow, which accounts for 13.3% similar to 15% of overall inhalation flow rates under different activity levels. For the 24-year-old female model, on the contrary, the olfactory fractional flow was dramatically reduced (with a local to overall percentage around 4.3%-7.7%). Finally, for the elderly subject-77-year-old male model, minimum level of olfactory flux was observed with a local to overall percentage ranging between 3.1% and 4.9% for considered wide range of inhalation flow rates. Therefore, the local flow intersubject variation can reach nearly fourfold. The vast local flow difference is mainly due to the inherent anatomical features (e.g., immature nasal turbinate structure in the child model, the partial narrowing superior nasal valve in the elder model). The results may further lead to discrepant health effects associated with inhalation exposure to airborne particles.

AB  - It is well known that aging induces a progressive decline in the proliferation and neural differentiation of radial glial cells (RGCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The function of miR-144/451 is to activate stress-regulated molecular gene expression switches for cell proliferation and differentiation. We found that the miR-144/451 expression in the hippocampus was significantly reduced in aged mice compared to adult mice. Furthermore, the proliferation and neural differentiation of RGCs in the mouse hippocampal DG was decreased by miR-144/451 knockout (miR-144/451(-/-)). Antioxidant agents, superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalase, and the expression of melatonin's receptor in the hippocampus were decreased in the miR-144/451(-/-) mice. In addition, the (protein kinase B) AKT/(glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) GSK3 beta/(catenin beta-1) beta-catenin signaling pathway was weakly activated in the hippocampus of miR-144/451(-/-) mice, which was related to brain neurogenesis. Melatonin treatment improved the expression of miR-144/451 and antioxidant enzymes and activated the AKT/GSK3 beta/beta-catenin pathway in the hippocampus of miR-144/451(-/-) mice. When the AKT pathway was inhibited by LY294002, the neurogenerative and antioxidant effects of melatonin were significantly limited in the hippocampus of miR-144/451(-/- )mice. In brief, our results indicated that miR-144/451 plays crucial roles in the proliferation and neural differentiation of RGCs via the regulation of the antioxidant and AKT/GSK3 beta/beta-catenin pathways.

AB  - Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenol with diverse beneficial pharmacological activities, and our previous results have demonstrated its neuroprotective potential. The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of RES in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like behavioral dysfunction induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and explore it's potential mechanism of action. STZ was microinjected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice at a dose of 3 mg/kg, and RES was administered intragastrically at a dose of 25 mg/kg for 5 weeks. Neurobehavioral performance was observed, and serum concentrations of insulin and Nesfatin-1 were measured. Moreover, the protein expression of amyloid beta 1-42 (A beta(1-42)), Tau, phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) (Ser396), synaptic ras GTPase activation protein (SynGAP), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), synapsin-1, synaptogomin-1, and key molecules of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were assessed. Finally, pathological damage to hippocampal tissue was examined by Nissl and immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that compared with the controls, bilateral hippocampal micro-injections of STZ induced task-specific learning and memory impairments, as indicated by the disadvantaged performances in the novel object recognition test (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM), but not the contextual fear conditioning test (CFC). Treatment with RES could improve these behavioral disadvantages. The serum concentrations of insulin and Nesfatin-1 in the model group were remarkably higher than those of the control group. In addition, protein expression of A beta(1-42), Tau, and p-Tau (Ser396) was increased but expression of SynGAP, PSD95, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and p-GSK-3 beta/GSK-3 beta were decreased in the hippocampus. Although the protein expression of BDNF and SynGAP was also markedly decreased in the PFC of the model mice, there was no significant difference among groups in the protein expression of PSD95, BDNF, synapsin-1, synaptogomin-1, and p-GSK-3 beta/GSK-3 beta. RES (25 mg/kg) reversed the enhanced insulin level, the abnormal protein expression of A beta(1-42), Tau, and p-Tau (Ser396) in the hippocampus and PFC, and the hippocampal protein expression of SynGAP, PSD95 and BDNF. In addition, RES reversed the STZ-induced decrease in the number of Nissl bodies and the increase in fluorescence intensity of IBA1 in the hippocampal CA1 region. These findings indicate that RES could ameliorate STZ-induced AD-like neuropathological injuries, the mechanism of which could be partly related to its regulation of BDNF expression and synaptic plasticity-associated proteins in the hippocampus.

AB  - Being the largest still-living terrestrial mammal on earth, an elephant's feet play an important role in its health status. The musculoskeletal structures in the forefoot are well described in the literature, but information about vascularization is limited. The novel aim of this work is to provide anatomical guidance to structures found in the forefoot, focusing on the arterial system. Initially, native CT and MRI sequences were taken of the left forefoot of a deceased 6-year-old female Asian elephant; the foot was then filled with an iodine-containing contrast medium through the a. mediana and the CT scans were repeated in the same position. The images obtained were processed with 3D Slicer software for the 3D reconstruction of the bones and arteries. The results clearly showed the palmar blood supply of the forefoot. A so far undescribed vessel was revealed, stemming from the a. metacarpea, supplying the first digit and the digital cushion. The course of the deep palmar arch's terminal section was also established. This paper provides the first description of the exact disposition of the arteries in the palmar aspect of an elephant's forefoot and may be used in planning surgeries in clinically affected animals.

AB  - Fifteen new triterpenoid saponins designated as huangqiyesaponin A-O (1-15), in addition to eleven previously identified compounds (16-26), were extracted from the leaves of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. utilizing a 70% ethanol solution. The structural characterization of the isolated compounds was achieved through the application of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, in combination with single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Additionally, D-galactose-stimulated HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells were utilized to assess the potential neuroprotective effects of all isolated compounds. The findings indicated that compounds 5 , 11 , and 13-15 exhibited significant neuroprotective effects. To elucidate the signaling pathway associated with the neuroprotective effects of compounds 13 and 15 , the protein expression levels of PINK1, parkin, P62, and LC3-II were evaluated through WB analysis. The results of the study indicated that the compounds 13 and 15 enhanced the proportion of LC3-II to LC3-I as well as the protein expressions of PINK1 and parkin while concurrently reducing the expression of P62 protein, suggesting that these compounds exert neuroprotective effects by promoting mitochondrial autophagy.

AB  - Neuronal differentiation and maturation are extended developmental processes. To determine whether neurons at different developmental stages have divergent chemosensitivities, we screened differentiating and maturing neuronal populations using a small compound library comprising FDA-approved and investigational drugs. Using a neurotoxicity assay format, both respective neuronal population-based screening campaigns performed robustly (Z-factors = 0.7-0.8), although the hit rate for the differentiating neurons (2.8%) was slightly higher than for maturing neurons (1.9%). While the majority of hits were toxic to both neuronal populations, these hits predominantly represented promiscuous drugs. Other drugs were selectively neurotoxic, with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors disproportionally represented after confirmation. Ponatinib and amuvatinib were neuroinhibitory for differentiating and maturing neurons, respectively. Chemoinformatic analyses confirmed differences in potential drug targets that may be differentially expressed during neuronal development. Subsequent studies demonstrated neuronal expression of AXL, an amuvatinib target, in both neuronal populations. However, functional AXL activity was confirmed only in the maturing neuronal population as determined by AXL phosphorylation in response to GAS6, the cognate ligand of AXL, and concurrent STAT3(Y705) phosphorylation. Differentiating neurons were unresponsive to the effects of GAS6 suggesting that the AXL-STAT3 signaling axis was nonfunctional. Amuvatinib treatment of maturing neuronal cultures significantly reduced pAXL levels. These studies indicate that neuronal developmental states may exhibit unique chemosensitivities and that drugs may have different neuro-inhibitory effects depending upon the developmental stage of the neuronal population.

AB  - Simple Summary Dysbiosis, which is an imbalance of gut microbial composition and function, can be caused by several external as well as internal factors, contributing to the onset of human and animal disorders, not limited to the gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, the mechanisms leading to disease development involve a crucial interaction between the gut microbiota, their metabolic products, and the host. The expanded endocannabinoid system, also known as the "endocannabinoidome", includes endocannabinoids (e.g., anandamide) and endocannabinoid-like mediators (e.g., palmitoylethanolamide), their receptors and metabolic enzymes. Dysregulation of this newly recognized endogenous system is also involved in several diseases. It is becoming increasingly apparent that a link between the endocannabinoidome and the gut microbiome exists. Here, we review some of the latest discoveries related to the functional link between these two complex systems and the disorders emerging from the malfunctioning of such a mutual interaction: for example, idiopathic inflammation, chronic enteropathies, metabolic disease and certain neuroinflammatory disorders. It is expected that in the near future new nutritional tools will emerge based on the expanding knowledge in this cutting-edge field. There is growing evidence that perturbation of the gut microbiome, known as "dysbiosis", is associated with the pathogenesis of human and veterinary diseases that are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. In this regard, recent studies have demonstrated that dysbiosis is linked to the pathogenesis of central neuroinflammatory disorders, supporting the existence of the so-called microbiome-gut-brain axis. The endocannabinoid system is a recently recognized lipid signaling system and termed endocannabinoidome monitoring a variety of body responses. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that a profound link exists between the gut microbiome and the endocannabinoidome, with mutual interactions controlling intestinal homeostasis, energy metabolism and neuroinflammatory responses during physiological conditions. In the present review, we summarize the latest data on the microbiome-endocannabinoidome mutual link in health and disease, focalizing the attention on gut dysbiosis and/or altered endocannabinoidome tone that may distort the bidirectional crosstalk between these two complex systems, thus leading to gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases (e.g., idiopathic inflammation, chronic enteropathies and obesity) as well as neuroinflammatory disorders (e.g., neuropathic pain and depression). We also briefly discuss the novel possible dietary interventions based not only on probiotics and/or prebiotics, but also, and most importantly, on endocannabinoid-like modulators (e.g., palmitoylethanolamide) for intestinal health and beyond.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests an essential role of neuroinflammation in behavioral abnormalities associated with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Here, we report the involvement of autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling in HE's pathogenesis. We demonstrate that the autotaxin (ATX) inhibitor PF8380 attenuates neuroinflammation and improves neurological dysfunction in the mouse model of HE. In the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced model of HE, we found a twofold increase in the levels of ammonia in the brain and in plasma along with a significant change in HE-related behavioral parameters. Mice with HE show an increased brain weight, increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 beta (interleukin-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and LPA 18:0 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and increased levels of LPA 18:0 in plasma. Treatment with the autotaxin inhibitor (ATXi) did not affect liver injury, as we observed no change in liver function markers including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin (TBIL) and no change in ammonia levels in the brain and plasma. However, ATXi treatment significantly ameliorated the neuroinflammation, reduced the levels of LPA 18:0 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in the brain and plasma, and reduced brain edema and the levels of IL1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. The neurobehavioral symptoms for HE such as the cognitive and motor function deficit and overall clinical grading score were significantly improved in ATXi-treated mice. Mouse astrocytes and microglia stimulated with NH4CL with or without ATXi showed significant attenuation of oxidative stress and the neuroinflammatory effect of NH4CL in ATXi-treated cells.

KW  - RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM
AB  - This research was aimed at discussing the application value of different machine learning algorithms in the prediction of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), which was based on hippocampal volume changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the research, the 84 cases in American Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database were selected as the research data. Based on the scoring results of cognitive function, all cases were divided into three groups, including cognitive function normal (normal group), early mild cognitive impairment (e-MCI group), and later mild cognitive impairment (l-MCI group) groups. Each group included 28 cases. The features of hippocampal volume changes in MRI images of the patients in different groups were extracted. The samples of training set and test set were established. Besides, the established support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) prediction models were used to predict e-MCI. Metalinear regression was utilized to analyze MRI feature data, and the predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of different models were calculated. The result showed that the volumes of hippocampal left CA1, left CA2-3, left CA4-DG, left presubiculum, left tail, right CA2-3, right CA4-DG, right presubiculum, and right tail in e-MCI group were all smaller than those in normal group (P < 0.01). The corresponding volume of hippocampal subregions in l-MCI group was remarkably reduced compared with that in normal group (P < 0.001). The volumes of regions left CA1, left CA2-3, left CA4-DG, right CA2-3, right CA4-DG, and right presubiculum were all positively correlated with logical memory test-delay recall (LMT-DR) score (R2=0.1702, 0.3779, 0.1607, 0.1620, 0.0426, and 0.1309; P < 0.001). The predictive accuracy of training set sample by DT, SVM, and RF was 86.67%, 93.33%, and 98.33%, respectively. Based on the changes in the volumes of left CA4-DG, right CA2-3, and right CA4-DG, the predictive accuracy of e-MCI and l-MCI by RF model was both higher than those by DT model (P < 0.01). Besides, the predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of e-MCI by RF model was all notably higher than those by DT model (P < 0.01). The above results demonstrated that the effective early AD prediction models were established by the volume changes in hippocampal subregions, which was based on RF in the research. The establishment of early AD prediction models offered certain reference basis to the diagnosis and treatment of AD patients.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain that affects over 65 million people worldwide. Acquired epilepsy is initiated by neurological insults, such as status epilepticus, which can result in the generation of ROS and induction of oxidative stress. Suppressing oxidative stress by upregulation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been shown to be an effective strategy to increase endogenous antioxidant defences, including in brain diseases, and can ameliorate neuronal damage and seizure occurrence in epilepsy. Here, we aim to test the neuroprotective potential of a naturally occurring Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, in in vitro epileptiform activity model and a temporal lobe epilepsy rat model. Sulforaphane significantly decreased ROS generation during epileptiform activity, restored glutathione levels, and prevented seizure-like activity-induced neuronal cell death. When given to rats after 2 h of kainic acid-induced status epilepticus, sulforaphane significantly increased the expression of Nrf2 and related antioxidant genes, improved oxidative stress markers, and increased the total antioxidant capacity in both the plasma and hippocampus. In addition, sulforaphane significantly decreased status epilepticus-induced neuronal cell death. Our results demonstrate that Nrf2 activation following an insult to the brain exerts a neuroprotective effect by reducing neuronal death, increasing the antioxidant capacity, and thus may also modify epilepsy development.

AB  - The present study assessed the effects of supplementation of different antioxidants on oocyte matura-tion, embryo production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and expression of key developmental genes. In this study, using ovine as an animal model, we tested the hypothesis that antioxidant sup-plementation enhanced the developmental competence of oocytes. Ovine oocytes aspirated from local abattoir-derived ovaries were subjected to IVM with different concentrations of antioxidants [(Mela-tonin, Ascorbic acid (Vit C), alpha-tocopherol (Vit E), Sodium selenite (SS)]. Oocytes matured without any antioxidant supplementation were used as controls. The oocytes were assessed for maturation rates and ROS levels. Further, embryo production rates in terms of cleavage, blastocysts and total cell numbers were evaluated after performing in vitro fertilization. Real-Time PCR analysis was used to evaluate the expression of stress related gene (SOD-1), growth related (GDF-9, BMP-15), and apoptosis-related genes (BCL-2 and BAX). We observed that maturation rates were significantly higher in alpha-tocopherol (100 mu M; 92.4%) groups followed by melatonin (30 mu M; 89.1%) group. However, blastocyst rates in ascorbic acid (100 mu M; 19.5%), melatonin (30 mu M; 18.4%), alpha-tocopherol (100 mu M; 18.2%), and sodium selenite (20 mu M; 16.9%) groups were significantly higher (P 0.05) than that observed in the control groups. Total cell numbers in blastocysts in the melatonin, ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol groups were significantly higher than those observed in sodium selenite and control groups. ROS production was reduced in groups treated with melatonin (30 mu M), vitamin C (100 mu M), sodium selenite (20 mu M) and a-tocopherol (200 mu M) compared with that observed in the control group. Supplementation of antioxidants caused the alterations in mRNA expression of growth, stress, and apoptosis related gene expression in matured oocytes. The results recommend that antioxidants alpha-tocopherol (200 mu M), sodium selenite (40 mu M), melatonin (30 mu M) and ascorbic acid (100 mu M) during IVM reduced the oxidative stress by decreasing ROS levels in oocytes, thus improving embryo quantity and quality.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Grin2d is an ionotropic NMDA receptor, a subunit of glutamate-dependent, and a facilitator of cellular calcium influx in neuronal tissue. In this study, we found that Grin2d expression was higher in esophageal cancer than in normal mucosa at both the mRNA and protein level using RT-PCR, bioinformatics analysis, and western blotting (p<0.05). Grin2d mRNA expression was positively correlated with old age, white race, heavy weight, distal location, adenocarcinoma, cancer with Barrett's lesion, or high -grade columnar dysplasia (p<0.05). The differential genes associated with Grin2d mRNA were involved in fat digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism, lipid transfer, lipoproteins, synaptic membranes, and ABC transporters (p<0.05). The Grin2d-related genes were classified into the following categories: metabolism of glycerolipids, galactose, and O-glycan, cell adhesion binding, actin binding, cadherin binding, the Hippo signaling pathway, cell-cell junctions, desmosomes, DNA-transcription activator binding, and skin development and differentiation (p<0.05). Grin2d immunoreactivity was positively correlated with distal metastasis and unfavorable overall survival in esophageal cancer (p<0.05). Grin2d overexpression promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in esophageal cancer cells but blocked apoptosis (p<0.05) and increased the expression of PI3K, Akt and p-mTOR. Grin2d knockout caused the opposite effects. These findings indicated that upregulated Grin2d expression played an important role in esophageal carcinogenesis via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and might be a biological marker for aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Its silencing might represent a targeted therapy approach against esophageal cancer.

AB  - It has been reported from the previous literature that butin restores mitochondrial dysfunction by modulation of oxidative stress and glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in mouse hippocampus HT22 cells. Butin also possesses an anti-Huntington's effect in rats. Considering the current background, this study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of butin against memory loss caused by streptozotocin (STZ). STZ (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into rats. Three days later, diabetic rats were identified and included in the study. A total of 30 rats (12 nondiabetic and 18 diabetics) were grouped as Group A (control-non-diabetic rats) and Group B (STZ diabetic control) were treated with 1 mL of sodium CMC (0.5% w/v). Group C (STZ+ butin 25) were treated with butin 25 mg/kg. Group D (STZ+ butin 50) and Group E (butin per se) were administered with butin 50 mg/kg. Each therapy was administered orally once each day for 15-day. The Morris water maze and the Y-maze behavioural tests were run throughout the experimental programme. Animals were put to death on day 15 and their brains were removed for biochemical assays (CAT, SOD, GSH, MDA, nitrite, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), IL-1, and mitochondrial enzyme complexes). Rats with neurobehavioral impairments brought on by STZ have less spontaneous movement, learning capacity, and memory. Additionally, STZ decreased endogenous antioxidants and increased proinflammatory cytokines, nitrite, MDA, and AchE. Neurobehavioral deficits and metabolic markers were dramatically improved by butin.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that protein translation can be regulated by spontaneous excitatory neurotransmission. However, the impact of spontaneous neurotransmitter release on gene transcription remains unclear. Here, we study the effects of the balance between inhibitory and excitatory spontaneous neurotransmission on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulation and synaptic plasticity. Blockade of spontaneous inhibitory events leads to an increase in the transcription of Bdnf and Npas4 through altered synaptic calcium signaling, which can be blocked by antagonism of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Transcription is bidirectionally altered by manipulating spontaneous inhibitory, but not excitatory, currents. Moreover, blocking spontaneous inhibitory events leads to multiplicative downscaling of excitatory synaptic strength in a manner that is dependent on both transcription and BDNF signaling. These results reveal a role for spontaneous inhibitory neurotransmission in BDNF signaling that sets excitatory synaptic strength at rest.

AB  - Marine fish industries discard huge amounts of fish waste every year, which in turn impose problems of environmental pollution and loss of economic value. About 75% of the total weight of fish is discarded in the form of skins, bones, fins, heads, guts, and scales, which contain high levels of collagen type I. Generally, major sources for commercial collagens are the skin and bone of pigs and cows; however, these sources are chiefly associated with the risk of transference of zoonotic diseases or religious issues. Traditional protocols applied to the extraction of collagen are outdated, mainly with respect to present demands to develop more sustainable processes. This work explores the use of sustainable solvents, such as deep eutectic solvents (DES), to develop a more efficient, cost-effective and biocompatible process to extract collagen from waste from the fish industry waste. The extraction of collagen from the skin of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) using aqueous solutions of various eutectic solvents was studied, and after selection of the best solvent, an aqueous solution of urea (U) and lactic acid (LA) at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 (U : LA 1 : 2), the collagen extracted was properly characterized using SDS-PAGE, CD, FTIR, and XRD, and shown to be of type I. The results obtained here demonstrate an improvement in the yield and quality of the extracted collagen when eutectic mixtures were applied instead of acetic acid. After optimization of the process conditions, a maximum extraction yield of 6% was obtained for the aqueous solution of U : LA 1 : 2 at 0.75 M. The present work demonstrates the potential use of codfish skin waste and an aqueous solution of a DES to develop a more environmentally-friendly process to obtain high-quality collagen type I. It is an effort to convince industries to valorize their own residues under the guidelines of a circular economy.

AB  - Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2) is a key synaptic adhesion protein at virtually all GABAergic synapses, which recruits GABA(A)Rs by promoting assembly of the postsynaptic gephyrin scaffold. Intriguingly, loss of Nlgn2 differentially affects subsets of GABAergic synapses, indicating that synapse-specific interactors and redundancies define its function, but the nature of these interactions remain poorly understood. Here we investigated how Nlgn2 function in hippocampal area CA1 is modulated by two proposed interaction partners, MDGA1 and MDGA2. We show that loss of MDGA1 expression, but not heterozygous deletion of MDGA2, ameliorates the abnormal cytosolic gephyrin aggregation, the reduction in inhibitory synaptic transmission and the exacerbated anxiety-related behaviour characterizing Nlgn2 knockout (KO) mice. Additionally, combined Nlgn2 and MDGA1 deletion causes an exacerbated layer-specific loss of gephyrin puncta. Given that both Nlgn2 and the MDGA1 have been correlated with many psychiatric disorders, our data support the notion that cytosolic gephyrin aggregation may represent an interesting target for novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Lactoferrin is a naturalcationic iron-binding glycoprotein of the transferrin family found in bovine milk and other exocrine secretions, including lacrimal fluid, saliva, and bile. Lactoferrin has been investigated for its numerous powerful influences, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-osteoporotic, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective, and other beneficial health effects. Lactoferrin demonstrated several nutraceutical and pharmaceutical potentials and have a significant impact on improving the health of humans and animals. Lactoferrin plays a critical role in keeping the normal physiological homeostasis associated with the development of pathological disorders. The current review highlights the medicinal value, nutraceutical role, therapeutic application, and outstanding favorable health sides of lactoferrin, which would benefit from more exploration of this glycoprotein for the design of effective medicines, drugs, and pharmaceuticals for safeguarding different health issues in animals and humans.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential quality of tea made from leaves at different development stages. Fresh Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze "Sichuan Colonial" leaves of various development stages, from buds to old leaves, were subjected to transcriptome sequencing and metabolome analysis, and the DESeq package was used for differential expression analysis, followed by functional enrichment analyses and protein interaction analysis. Target metabolome analysis indicated that the contents of most compounds, including theobromine and epicatechin gallate, were lowest in old leaves, and transcriptome analysis revealed that DEGs were significantly involved in extracellular regions and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis-related pathways, and the oleuropein steroid biosynthesis pathway. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified LOC114256852 as a hub gene. Caffeine, theobromine, l-theanine, and catechins were the main metabolites of the tea leaves, and the contents of all four main metabolites were the lowest in old leaves. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis may be important targets for breeding efforts to improve tea quality.

AB  - Background: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a common cause of Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The neuroinflammation caused by ischemia play a key role in the progression of the ailment process. The over activation of NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1/3 signaling aggravates the inflammatory response. We investigated whether NLRP3 inhibitors have a protective effect on cranial nerves in rats with VCI. Methods: Male SD rats were selected arbitrarily and categorized into the sham operation group, CCH group and CCH+MCC950 group (10 mg/kg). The rat model of CCH was formed by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). IP 2038 10920 On: Tue 08 Aug 2023 0508:12 The changes in rat's cerebral bloodflowCopyright:were obserAmericanved byScientificlaser specklePublishersimaging after operation. The sham operation and the CCH group were given intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of normal saline, and the therapeutic Delivered by Ingenta group was given i.p having dose of MCC950 (10 mg/kg). The behavior of the rats was analyzed through the Y maze and open field experiments, and the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining technique was employed to analyze the behavior of the rats. The histological changes of the rat hippocampus were observed under the following conditions, cell apoptosis was observed by Tune staining, and the protein expressions of NLRP3, IL (interleukin)-1/3, and cleaved-Caspase-1 in the hippocampus were analyzed by Western blot. Results: MCC950 treatment enhanced the working memory of CCH rats, and the rats in each group showed no motor deficit. As shown by HE staining, inhibition of NLRP3 reduced neuronal damage caused by pyroptosis. In addition, MCC950 diminishes the appearance of NLRP3, IL-1/3, and cleaved-Caspase-1 in the brain tissue of CCH rats by inhibiting inflammasome formation. Conclusions: inhibitors can improve the learning and cognitive ability of rats with vascular cognitive impairment, and the mechanism might be linked to inhibiting the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1/3 signaling and decreasing apoptosis.

AB  - Previous studies have found that hypomagnetic field (HMF) exposure impairs cognition behaviors in animals; however, the underlying neural mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction are unclear. The hippocampus plays important roles in magnetoreception, memory, and spatial navigation in mammals. Therefore, the hippocampus may be the key region in the brain to reveal its neural mechanisms. We recently reported that long-term HMF exposure impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition through reducing endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in adult neural stem cells that are confined in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. In addition to adult neural stem cells, the redox state of other cells in the hippocampus is also an important factor affecting the functions of the hippocampus. However, it is unclear whether and how long-term HMF exposure affects ROS levels in the entire hippocampus (i.e., the dentate gyrus (DG) and ammonia horn (CA) regions). Here, we demonstrate that male C57BL/6J mice exposed to 8-week HMF exhibit cognitive impairments. We then found that the ROS levels of the hippocampus were significantly higher in these HMF-exposed mice than in the geomagnetic field (GMF) group. PCR array analysis revealed that the elevated ROS levels were due to HMF-regulating genes that maintain the redox balance in vivo, such as Nox4, Gpx3. Since high levels of ROS may cause hippocampal oxidative stress, we suggest that this is another reason why HMF exposure induces cognitive impairment, besides the hippocampal neurogenesis impairments. Our study further demonstrates that GMF plays an important role in maintaining hippocampal function by regulating the appropriate endogenous ROS levels.

AB  - In this study, a high protease-producing strain was screened by spread plate method and identified by molecular biology and morphological identification. It was identified as Bacillus sp. LCB14. A neutral protease gene was cloned and heterologous expressed by B. subtilis SCK6. Then, the recombinant protease was used to dehair the goat skins. The fermentation conditions of neutral protease production by B. subtilis SCK6 were optimized. The single factor experiments, Plackett-Burma experiment, and response surface method were conducted to determine fermentation medium and culture conditions. The optimized medium contained corn meal 49 g/L, soluble starch 28 g/L, soybean meal 17 g/L, corn steep liquor powder 8 g/L, yeast extract 10 g/L, Na2HPO4 2.3 g/L, KH2PO4 1.9 g/L, MgSO4 0.5 g/L, MnCl2 0.1 g/L and ZnSO4 0.05 g/L. The optimized culture conditions were 35 degrees C and pH 7.0. Under the optimum conditions, the recombinant strain reached 33467.28 U/mL after 72 hr ferment. Moreover, by fed batch in 30 L fermenters, neutral protease production reached 39,440.78 U/mL and shortened fermentation time from 72 hr to 46 hr. Finally, the crude enzyme was utilized to replace sodium sulfide for dehairing of goatskins. The enzymatic dehaired pelts were white, smooth, and soft; the grain side of enzymatic dehaired pelts were clear; there was no obvious damage to the grain side of enzymatic dehaired pelts by visual observation and tactile test. Furthermore, there were no hair roots, hair follicles and other glands in enzymatic dehaired belts, and the collagen fibers of enzymatic dehaired belt were dispersed well by histological analysis.

AB  - Synaptic transmission plays an important and time-sensitive role in the nervous system. Although the amplitude of neurotransmission is positively related to the intensity of external stimulus, whether stronger stimulus could trigger synaptic transmission faster remains unsolved. Our present work in the primary sensory system shows that besides the known effect of larger amplitude, stronger stimulus triggers the synaptic transmission faster, which is regulated by the earlier started action potential (AP), independent of the AP's amplitude. More importantly, this model is further extended from the sensory system to the hippocampus, implying broad applicability in the nervous system. Together, we found that stronger stimulus induces AP faster, which suggests to trigger the neurotransmission faster, implying that the occurrence time of neurotransmission, as well as the amplitude, plays an important role in the timely and effective response of nervous system.

AB  - In recent years, the inhibition of beta-amyloid (A beta) aggregation has emerged as a potential strategy for Alzheimer's disease. KLVFF, a small peptide corresponding to the aminoacidic sequence 16-20 of A beta, reduces A beta fibrillation dose dependently. Therefore, the toxic and functional characterization of its brain activity is fundamental for clarifying its potential therapeutic role. Accordingly, we studied the modulatory role of KLVFF on the cholinergic receptors regulating dopamine and noradrenaline release in rat synaptosomes. Nicotinic receptors on dopaminergic nerve terminals in the nucleus acccumbens are inhibited by KLVFF, which closely resembles full-length A beta 1-40. Moreover, KLVFF entrapped in synaptosomes does not modify the nicotinic receptor's function, suggesting that external binding to the receptor is required for its activity. The cholinergic agent desformyl-flustrabromine counteracts the KLVFF effect. Remarkably, muscarinic receptors on dopaminergic terminals and nicotinic receptors regulating noradrenaline release in the hippocampus are completely insensitive to KLVFF. Based on our findings, KLVFF mimics A beta 1-40 as a negative modulator of specific nicotinic receptor subtypes affecting dopamine transmission in the rat brain. Therefore, new pharmacological strategies using the anti-aggregative properties of KLVFF need to be evaluated for potential interference with nicotinic receptor-mediated transmission.

AB  - Cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) expansion and oocyte maturation are crucial processes for embryo development and fertility across species. Although miR-29b has been detected in porcine ovarian granulosa cells, its specific role in regulating oocyte maturation remains largely unknown. In this study, using the pig as a model, we report that over-expression of miR-29b lead to a decrease of COC expansion area and inhibits oocyte maturation (P<0.05). P <0.05). This suppression correlated with a decrease expression of COC-expansion-associated genes, including SHAS2, , ADAMTS1, , ADAMTS2, , ADAMTS17 and PTX 3 in both mural granulosa cells (mGCs) and cumulus granulosa cells (cGCs). Further investigation revealed that miR-29b over-expression induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in both mGCs and cGCs, conversely, knock-down of miR-29b reverses all these effects. Treatment with the antioxidant beta- mercaptoethanol alleviates ROS accumulation, rescues COC expansion and restores oocyte polar body formation impaired by miR-29b mimics. Computational analysis predicted CYCS, , the gene encoding cytochrome C, as a potential target of miR-29b. Subsequent examination demonstrated that miR-29b downregulates CYCS at both mRNA and protein levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assays further confirmed that miR-29b interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of CYCS. Over-expression of CYCS decreases ROS accumulation and promotes COC expansion (P<0.05). P <0.05). These results indicate that miR-29b regulates COC expansion and oocyte maturation in vitro by inducing ROS, likely through targeting of CYCS. This study sheds light on the role of miR-29b in oocyte maturation and provides insight into the regulatory function of miRNAs in ovarian physiology.

AB  - Testosterone has been shown to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis through increased cell survival, but which stages of new neuron development are influenced by testosterone remains unclear. Therefore, we tested the effects of sex steroids administered during three different periods after cell division in the dentate gyrus of adult male rats to determine when they influence the survival of new neurons. Adult male rats were bilaterally castrated. After 7 days of recovery, a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was given on the first day of the experiment (Day 0) to label actively dividing cells. All subjects received five consecutive days of hormone injections during one of three stages of new neuron development (days 1-5, 6-10, or 11-15) after BrdU labeling. Subjects were injected during these time periods with either testosterone propionate (0.250 or 0.500 mg/rat), dihydrotestosterone (0.250 or 0.500 mg/rat), or estradiol benzoate (1.0 or 10 mu g/rat). All subjects were euthanized sixteen days later to assess the effects of these hormones on the number of BrdU-labeled cells. The high dose of testosterone caused a significant increase in the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the hippocampus compared to all other groups, with the strongest effect caused by later injections (11-15 days old). In contrast, neither DHT nor estradiol injections had any significant effects on number of BrdU-labeled cells. Fluorescent double-labeling and confocal microscopy reveal that the majority of BrdU-labeled cells were neurons. Our results add to past evidence that testosterone increases neurogenesis, but whether this involves an androgenic or estrogenic pathway remains unclear.

AB  - Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by vascular malformations affecting skin, eyes and leptomeninges of the brain, which can lead to glaucoma, seizures and intellectual disability. The discovery of a disease-causing somatic missense mutation in the GNAQ gene, encoding an alpha chain of heterotrimeric G-proteins, has initiated efforts to understand how G-proteins contribute to SWS pathogenesis. The mutation is predominantly detected in endothelial cells and is currently believed to affect downstream MAPK signalling. In this study of six Norwegian patients with classical SWS, we aimed to identify somatic mutations through deep sequencing of DNA from skin biopsies. Surprisingly, one patient was negative for the GNAQ mutation, but instead harbored a somatic mutation in GNB2 (NM_005273.3:c.232A>G, p.Lys78Glu), which encodes a beta chain of the same G-protein complex. The positions of the mutant amino acids in the G-protein are essential for complex reassembly. Therefore, failure of reassembly and continuous signalling is a likely consequence of both mutations. Ectopic expression of mutant proteins in endothelial cells revealed that expression of either mutant reduced cellular proliferation, yet regulated MAPK signalling differently, suggesting that dysregulated MAPK signalling cannot fully explain the SWS phenotype. Instead, both mutants reduced synthesis of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo signalling pathway, suggesting a key role for this pathway in the vascular pathogenesis of SWS. The discovery of the GNB2 mutation sheds novel light on the pathogenesis of SWS and suggests that future research on targets of treatment should be directed towards the YAP, rather than the MAPK, signalling pathway.

AB  - Methylglyoxal (MG) is considered a classical biomarker of diabetes mellitus and its comorbidities. However, a role for this compound in exacerbated immune responses, such as septicemia, is being increasingly observed and requires clarification, particularly in the context of neuroinflammatory responses. Herein, we used two different approaches (in vivo and acute hippocampal slice models) to investigate MG as a biomarker of neuroinflammation and the neuroimmunometabolic shift to glycolysis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inflammation models. Our data reinforce the hypothesis that LPS-induced neuroinflammation stimulates the cerebral innate immune response by increasing IL-1 beta, a classical pro-inflammatory cytokine, and the astrocyte reactive response, via elevating S100B secretion and GFAP levels. Acute neuroinflammation promotes an early neuroimmunometabolic shift to glycolysis by elevating glucose uptake, lactate release, PFK1, and PK activities. We observed high serum and cerebral MG levels, in association with a reduction in glyoxalase 1 detoxification activity, and a close correlation between serum and hippocampus MG levels with the systemic and neuroinflammatory responses to LPS. Findings strongly suggest a role for MG in immune responses.

AB  - Background: Sirtuin 1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase that is highly expressed in the hippocampus and anterior cortex tissues related to Alzheimer's Disease pathology, can cross the blood -brain barrier and is a promising biomarker. Methods: A 1:1:1 case-control study was conducted and serum fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, SIRT1, IL-6, A beta 1-42, T-tau and P-tau-181 levels were evaluated in blood samples of 26 patients form the Alzheimer's Disease group, 26 patients form the mild cognitive impairment group, and 26 individuals form the normal control group. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic significance. Results: Serum SIRT1 level was significantly down-regulated in the mild cognitive impairment patients and Alzheimer's Disease patients compared with that in the normal control group (P<0.05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that SIRT1 was a promising biomarker to distinguish Alzheimer's Disease patients from the mild cognitive impairment patients and the normal control group. In addition, SIRT1 was estimated to perform well in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease ([AUC] = 0.742). Conclusions: In summary, the present study suggested that serum SIRT1 might be an early promising diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Ellagic acid (EA) exhibits potential antiaging activity. Differences in individual ability to produce urolithins may result in large interindividual variability in the health effects of EA. Therefore, the effects and mechanism of EA on D-galactose-induced aging, considering urolithin A-producing ability, were investigated. Our results showed that EA improved cognitive impairment and hippocampal damage, increased the GABA (by 107.84-117.86%) and 5-HT (by 72.56-100.85%) levels, and suppressed the inflammatory and oxidative stress in aging rats. Thirteen plasma metabolites and 12 brain metabolites were improved by EA administration in aging rats. In particular, EA showed a better anti-aging effect in high-UroA-producing rats than in the low counterparts, while antibiotic intervention almost offset EA-alleviated aging induced by D-gal. Furthermore, the lower ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota as well as the greater abundances of Akkermansia (by 139.21%), Bifidobacterium (by 88.04%), Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (by 183.47%), Lactobacillus (by 97.23%), and Turicibacter (by 83.06%) were observed in the high-UroAproducing group compared with the model group (p < 0.05). These findings provide novel insights into the anti-aging effects of EA and suggest that the ability of the gut microbiota responding to EA largely determines EA's anti-aging performance.

AB  - The hippocampus is a brain area central for cognition. Mutations in the human SOX2 transcription factor cause neurodevelopmental defects, leading to intellectual disability and seizures, together with hippocampal dysplasia. We generated an allelic series of Sox2 conditional mutations in mouse, deleting Sox2 at different developmental stages. Late Sox2 deletion (from E11.5, via Nestin-Cre) affects only postnatal hippocampal development; earlier deletion (from E10.5, Emx1-Cre) significantly reduces the dentate gyrus (DG), and the earliest deletion (from E9.5, FoxG1-Cre) causes drastic abnormalities, with almost complete absence of the DG. We identify a set of functionally interconnected genes (Gli3, Wnt3a, Cxcr4, p73 and Tbr2), known to play essential roles in hippocampal embryogenesis, which are downregulated in early Sox2 mutants, and (Gli3 and Cxcr4) directly controlled by SOX2; their downregulation provides plausible molecular mechanisms contributing to the defect. Electrophysiological studies of the Emx1-Cre mouse model reveal altered excitatory transmission in CA1 and CA3 regions.

AB  - Echinops spinosus (ES) is a medicinal plant with a wide range of pharmacological and biological effects. It is a medicinal herb having a variety of therapeutic characteristics, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial capabilities. The primary goal of this research is to investigate the neuroprotective and anticonvulsant characteristics of E. spinosa extract (ESE) against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced acute seizures. Negative control rats, ESE treatment rats, PTZ acute seizure model rats, ESE + PTZ rats, and Diazepam + PTZ rats were used in the study. The rats were given a 7-day treatment. ESE pretreatment elevated the latency to seizure onset and lowered seizure duration after PTZ injection. By reducing Bax levels and enhancing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 production, ESE prevented the release of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and cyclooxygenase-2, as well as preventing hippocampal cell death after PTZ injection. ESE corrected the PTZ-induced imbalance in gamma-aminobutyric acid levels and increased the enzyme activity of Na+/K+-ATPase. Echinops spinosus is a potent neuromodulatory, antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic plant that could be employed as a natural anticonvulsant in the future.

AB  - Background The development of the amniote limb has been an important model system to study patterning mechanisms and morphogenesis. For proper growth and patterning, it requires the interaction between the distal sub-apical mesenchyme and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) that involve the separate implementation of coordinated and tissue-specific genetic programs. Results Here, we produce and analyze the transcriptomes of both distal limb mesenchymal progenitors and the overlying ectodermal cells, following time-coursed dissections that cover from limb bud initiation to fully patterned limbs. The comparison of transcriptomes within each layer as well as between layers over time, allowed the identification of specific transcriptional signatures for each of the developmental stages. Special attention was given to the identification of genes whose transcription dynamics suggest a previously unnoticed role in the context of limb development and also to signaling pathways enriched between layers. Conclusion We interpret the transcriptomic data in light of the known development pattern and we conclude that a major transcriptional transition occurs in distal limb buds between E9.5 and E10.5, coincident with the switch from an early phase continuation of the signature of trunk progenitors, related to the initial proximo distal specification, to a late intrinsic phase of development.

AB  - Clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a large family of cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins that are central for neurite self-avoidance and neuronal connectivity in the brain. Their downstream nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, also known as Ptk2b, Cakb, Raftk, Fak2, and Cadtk) is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus. We constructed Pyk2-null mouse lines and found that these mutant mice showed enhancement in contextual fear memory, without significant change in auditory-cued and spatial-referenced learning and memory. In addition, by preparing Y402F mutant mice, we observed that Pyk2 suppressed contextual fear memory in an autophosphorylation-independent manner. Moreover, using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we found that immediate early genes, such as Npas4, cFos, Zif268/Egr1, Arc, and Nr4a1, were enhanced in Pyk2-null mice. We further showed that Pyk2 disruption affected pyramidal neuronal complexity and spine dynamics. Thus, we demonstrated that Pyk2 is a novel fear memory suppressor molecule and Pyk2-null mice provide a model for understanding fear-related disorders. These findings have interesting implications regarding dysregulation of the Pcdh-Pyk2 axis in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease. Elephantopus scaber L. (E. scaber) is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating inflammatory skin diseases. However, the effects and mechanisms of E.scaber on AD remain unclear. Aim of the study: To evaluate the effects and underlying mechanisms of the ethanol extract of E.scaber (ESE) on AD. Methods: MC903 (calcipotriol) was painted on the ears of mice for continuous 9 days. The application area exhibited AD-like skin lesions, and the degree of cutaneous inflammation was evaluated. Histopathology assessed epidermal thickness and mast cell infiltration. Cytokine and chemokine levels in inflamed skin were measured by ELISA. TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma-activated human keratinocytes (HaCaT) were used for in vitro studies. The cells were transfected with reporter plasmids for AP-1, NF-kappa B, or STAT1 signaling assay. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used for determining the transcription and translation levels of chemokines. Results: MC903 caused AD-like skin lesions, while local application of ESE decreased ear (epidermal) thickness, reduced the dermatitis score, and lowered the number of mast cells. Furthermore, it suppressed the levels of IgE, Th2-related cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), and chemokines (CCL22, TSLP, and CCL2) in inflamed skin. In TNF alpha/IFN-gamma-activated HaCaT cells, ESE reduced the transcription and translation levels of multiple chemokines. Furthermore, it inhibited the activation of AP-1 signaling by enhancing the expression of MKP-1 to reduce the phosphorylation levels of p38 and JNK. Conclusion: ESE alleviates the skin lesions of AD mice through suppressing Th2-related chemokines and cytokines. In vitro, it reduces the levels of Th2-related chemokines in TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma-activated HaCaT cells, which is attributed to the inhibition of MKP-1-mediated AP-1 signaling.

AB  - Background: Fatigue can be induced after acceleration exposure, however its mechanism is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine whether metabolites' changes can decrease cognitive and physical function after acceleration. Methods: Graybiel scale and Fatigue Self-rating scale were used to assess the seasickness and fatigue degrees of 87 male seafarers respectively after sailing. To test the effect of pyruvate on cognitive and physical functions, five different doses of pyruvate were administrated into rats. Insulin can reduce the accumulation of pyruvate. To observe the insulin effect on pyruvate, cognitive and physical functions after acceleration, insulin administration or treatment of promoting insulin secretion was used. Physical and cognitive functions were assessed using open field test (OFT), morris water maze (MWM) and loaded swimming test (LST) in animals. Results: Physical and cognitive abilities were decreased obviously, and serum pyruvate increased mostly in human and rats after acceleration. Compared with vehicle group, physical and cognitive abilities were significantly decreased after pyruvate administration. Besides, we found a significant decline in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and pyruvate de-hydrogenase (PDH) activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, liver, and muscle of rats treated with acceleration or pyruvate injection, while insulin administration or treatment of promoting insulin secretion markedly alleviated this decline and the impairment of physical and cognitive abilities, compared with the control group. Conclusion: Our results indicate that pyruvate has a negative effect on physical and cognitive abilities after acceleration. Insulin can inhibit pyruvate accumulation and cognitive and physical function after acceler-ation exposure.

AB  - Background: To assess the long-term outcomes and independent predictors of surgical success of a one-stage minimally invasive surgical procedure for congenital choanal atresia (C.C.A.). Methods: a retrospective multicentric study was conducted between 2010 and 2022. An endonasal endoscopic approach was performed in 38 unilateral or bilateral C.C.A. children. All the patients were clinically and radiologically assessed and followed for at least 2 years. Seven outcome measures were applied. Consequently, surgical success was correlated with all the independent variables reported. Results: 18/38 (47.36%) patients presented normal postoperative healing, 8/38 (21.05) had moderate restenosis (<50%), while 12/38 (31.57%) cases were severe (>50%), requiring a surgical revision. No statistical significance was found for average hospital stay between stenosis >50% and <50% patients (p = 0.802) and postoperative pain (p = 0.075); instead, the severe restenosis group demonstrated a higher delay of breast suction (p < 0.001). Among the independent variables predictors of surgical success, the presence of Charge syndrome and rhinopharyngeal stenosis demonstrated higher risks for surgical revision (OR: 4.00, 95% CI: 0.57-28.01, and OR: 2.75, 95% CI: 0.55-13.69, respectively). On the contrary, the hypoplastic inferior turbinate and bilateral C.C.A. showed a lower risk for severe restenosis by a higher endoscopic surgical space and creating a single larger opening (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.22-3.52, and OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.10-2.08). Conclusion: Several independent variables could influence the surgical success after C.C.A. endoscopic repair; however, more high-quality evidence is needed to generate an effective predictive model.

AB  - Simple Summary Imagine that you need to reach a designated destination, but the familiar path you most often choose suddenly becomes impassable. Then, what will you do? Of course, you will try to adjust the path according to your cognition of the current environment and the goal. During this, how will be the spatial environment, especially the path adjustment process, be represented in your brain? That is a very interesting research topic. In this study, we attempted to explore the internal neural patterns within the brain, especially within the higher-order cognitive brain areas, by taking pigeons, a species with excellent navigation ability, as a model animal. The most classical detour paradigm was used to train pigeons in a task of spatial path adjustment, and the neural signals in pigeons' nidopallium caudolaterale ((NCL) functionally similar to mammalian "prefrontal cortex") were recorded. We found that the spatial path adjustment process is accompanied by modifications of the changes in spectral and connectivity properties of the neural activities in the NCL. The elevated gamma connectivity in the NCL found in this study supports the role of the NCL in spatial cognition and contributes to explaining the potential neural mechanism of path adjustment. Previous studies showed that spatial navigation depends on a local network including multiple brain regions with strong interactions. However, it is still not fully understood whether and how the neural patterns in avian nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), which is suggested to play a key role in navigation as a higher cognitive structure, are modulated by the behaviors during spatial navigation, especially involved path adjustment needs. Hence, we examined neural activity in the NCL of pigeons and explored the local field potentials' (LFPs) spectral and functional connectivity patterns in a goal-directed spatial cognitive task with the detour paradigm. We found the pigeons progressively learned to solve the path adjustment task when the learned path was blocked suddenly. Importantly, the behavioral changes during the adjustment were accompanied by the modifications in neural patterns in the NCL. Specifically, the spectral power in lower bands (1-4 Hz and 5-12 Hz) decreased as the pigeons were tested during the adjustment. Meanwhile, an elevated gamma (31-45 Hz and 55-80 Hz) connectivity in the NCL was also detected. These results and the partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) modeling analysis provide insights into the neural activities in the avian NCL during the spatial path adjustment, contributing to understanding the potential mechanism of avian spatial encoding. This study suggests the important role of the NCL in spatial learning, especially path adjustment in avian navigation.

AB  - Growing evidence suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hippocampus and amygdala is involved in the pathophysiology of PTSD. Our previous studies have demonstrated that apoptosis of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contributes to the pathological progression of PTSD. Recent studies by others have shown that in brain injury sodium aescinate (SA) has a protective effect on neurons by inhibiting inflammatory response pathways, thereby relieving symptoms. Here, we extend the therapeutic effects of SA to PTSD rats. We found that PTSD was associated with significant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in DRN, whereas administration of SA significantly inhibited DRN NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced DRN apoptosis level. SA also improved learning and memory ability and reduced anxiety and depression level in PTSD rats.

AB  - Sevoflurane is widely used in pediatric anesthesia due to its rapid induction, minimal airway irritation, and stable hemodynamics. However, concerns have been raised regarding its potential adverse effects on cognition. Recent studies suggest that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors play a key role in the memory deficits associated with sevoflurane exposure. In this study, we investigated whether the GluN2B small interfering peptide (GluN2B-sip) could protect against neurotoxicity induced by neonatal sevoflurane exposure. Our findings show that neonatal sevoflurane exposure leads to an increase in apoptosis-related proteins, long-term memory impairment, and reduced levels of synaptic proteins in the hippocampus of adolescent rats. GluN2B-sip partially restored synapse development and cognitive function. Together, these results suggest that GluN2B-sip mitigates sevoflurane-induced neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in developing rats, providing a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent sevoflurane neurotoxicity. The Cdk5/GluN2B and Cdk5/CRMP2 signaling pathways may play central roles in this protective effect.image

AB  - In the last decade, extensive research has emerged into understanding the impact of risk factors for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) on brain in pre-symptomatic stages. We investigated the neuroimaging correlates of the APOEe4 genetic risk factor for AD in young adulthood, its relationship with cognition, and potential effects of other variables on the findings. While conventional volumetric analyses revealed no consistent differences, more sophisticated analyses identified subtle structural differences between APOEe4 carriers and non-carriers. Findings from diffusion studies were limited, but functional studies demonstrated consistent alterations in connectivity and activity. The complex relationship between APOE genotype, neuroimaging variables, and cognition revealed no consensus on the directionality of findings. Methodological choices, including analytical approaches, sample size, and the influence of other genes, gender, and ethnicity, varied across studies, impacting comparability and generalizability. Recommendations for future research include multimodal and longitudinal imaging, standardisation of pipelines, advanced analytical techniques, and collaborative data pooling.

AB  - Background: Status epilepticus (SE) is the most severe epilepsy type and exhibits a high resistance rate to the first-line therapy diazepam (DZP), which terms as refractory SE. Activated neuroinflammation is a key factor in the genesis of refractory SE. Gardeniae Fructus, a commonly used traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been reported to exhibit anti-neuroinflammatory efficacies. Purpose: In this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of Gardenia extract (GE) in two animal models of refractory SE and explore the mechanism of GE on SE. Methods: We identified the main components of GE using LC-MS. The pilocarpine (Salagen Tablet) and kainic acid (KA)-induced refractory SE models were established to evaluate the efficacy of GE. We used NeuN staining to observe the neuroprotective effects of GE. Then we employed network pharmacology to find potential therapeutic targets of GE. We verified the potential therapeutic mechanisms via western blot, immunohistochemistry, in vitro electrophysiological recording and pharmacological means. Results: We identified thirteen main compounds, and demonstrated that combining GE with DZP could effectively terminate refractory SE induced by pilocarpine or KA, with an extended therapeutic time window of up to 3 h. GE also protected against neuronal injuries caused by refractory SE. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that inflammatory high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a potential therapeutic target of GE. GE could reverse the upregulated expression and translocation of HMGB1 in mice with refractory SE and directly inhibited the enhancement of hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission mediated by HMGB1 activation. Finally, GE was effective in terminating refractory SE caused by HMGB1 activation; whereas GE could not exhibit superior terminating efficacy when HMGB1 was pharmacologically inhibited. Conclusion: These findings indicated for the first time that GE can terminate refractory SE by inhibiting HMGB1-induced neuroinflammation, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for this neurological emergency.

AB  - Background: Smilagenin (SMI) is a lipid-soluble steroidal sapogenin, extracted from traditional Chinses medicinal herbs Radix Asparagi, which is extracted from the dry root of Asparagus cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr. We previously found that SMI significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in A beta-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells.
   Methods: In this study, we performed behavioral tests to analyze cognitive function of WT and APP/PS1 mice treated with or without SMI, and found that SMI could significantly improve the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, immunofluorescence and ELISA results showed that SMI pretreatment could effectively reduce the deposition of eta-amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (26 mg/kg/ day for 60 days) and inhibit the secretion of A & beta;1-42 in N2a/APPswe cells (10 & mu;M concentration for 24 hours).
   Results: Mechanistically, SMI enhanced BDNF mRNA expression, elevated the global level of H3AC and H4AC, and increased the expression of P300 in AD models. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation results showed that SMI could increase the levels of H3AC and H4AC at the promoter of BDNF promoter II and IV, indicating that SMI epigenetically regulates BDNF expression through HAT enhancement. To further verify the critical role of P300 by which SMI upregulated histone acetylation in BDNF, AD mice were treated with SMI and C646 simultaneously. Behavioral experiments showed that the improvement effects of SMI on cognitive impairment were abolished after P300 inhibition in APP/PS1 mice.
   Conclusions: Our research for the first time demonstrated that SMI showed neuroprotective effects by increasing the expression of P300 protein, thus upregulating histone acetylation levels in the promoter region of BDNF and promoting its transcription. Our findings provide an important theoretical basis for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with SMI extracted from Asparagus cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr.

AB  - Due to the pleiotropic effects of ketogenic diet (KD) on pathophysiology, including inflammation and oxidative stress, medical personnels have been intensively exploring the application of it in the management of epilepsy. Meanwhile, the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is believed to be involved in regulating inflammatory and oxidative stress processes. However, the correlation between KD and VDAC1 in epilepsy has not been elucidated. Pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy model was utilized to examine the effects of VDAC1 antagonist VBIT-4 treatment on seizure activity, behavioral changes, inflammation, and oxidative stress under control diet (CD) and KD conditions, respectively. Chronic VBIT-4 administration mitigates seizure activity and behavioral abnormalities of epileptic mice under KD rather than CD conditions. Our further findings demonstrated that VBIT-4 treatment attenuates inflammatory response and oxidative stress in the hippocampi and serum samples of epileptic mice under KD rather than CD. Taken together, our data suggest a critical role of VDAC1 in mediating the anti-seizure efficacy of the KD, shedding light on developing novel therapeutic interventions to seizure control.

AB  - Background: Bao Yuan Capsule (BYC) is a patented Chinese medicinal formula for health promotion but its application for ischemic stroke remains unknown. In this study, we proposed the hypothesis that BYC could promote neurogenesis and neurological functional recovery through promoting mitochondrial function and activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
   Methods: We firstly performed chemical identification studies by using QIT-TOF-MS technology. Then, we investigated the effects of BYC (1 g/kg, 2 g/kg, 4 g/kg per day) on improving the recovery of the neurological functions in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) ischemic mice.
   Results: We tentatively characterized 36 compounds from the BYC extractions. At dosage of 4 g/kg, BYC effec-tively improved locomotor ability, attenuated anxiety-like behaviors, and enhanced the exploring behaviors, learning and memory capability in the transient MCAO ischemic mice. BYC treatment promoted neural stem cell differentiations in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the MCAO mice. BYC also up-regulated the expression of Aconitase 2 (ACO2), Succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A (SDHA), phos-phorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), protein kinase B (p-Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 38 (p-GSK38) in the hippocampus of the MCAO mice. BYC (200 mu g/ml) significantly improved the mitochondrial functions in cultured mouse multipotent neural stem like C17.2 cells. BYC treatment also promoted neuronal differentiations in the C17.2 cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) condition. The neurogenetic effects were abolished by co-treatments of ATP synthesis inhibitor oligomycin and PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin. Moreover, Akt phosphorylation was dramatically reduced by oligomycin.
   Conclusion: BYC could promote neurogenesis and neurological functional recovery in post ischemic brains by regulating the mitochondrial functions and Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - Since December 2019, COVID-19 has greatly influenced public healthcare systems around the globe in various aspects, including limitation of healthcare accessibility due to lack of both human and financial resources, suspension of clinics, and fear of infection causing healthcare avoidance. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on access to healthcare for otorhinolaryngology patients from different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Otorhinolaryngology patients' disease severity status, diagnosed at the first hospital visit, was investigated during the pre -and post-COVID-19 pandemic era in a single medical center located in Seoul, Korea. An ordinal regression model was used to assess the impact of both SES and the COVID-19 pandemic on otorhinolaryngology diseases. Within the chronic rhinosinusitis group, lower SES was associated with a higher disease severity at the first visit compared to higher SES (OR = 3.25). During the COVID-19 pandemic, while the total number of outpatients was reduced, the severity of these ENT diseases seemed to increase compared to the pre-pandemic severity in every SES group. Our study demonstrates the negative impact a worldwide pandemic can have on healthcare inequity and disease severity, and highlights the importance of re-allocating fundamental resources for those in need during periods of public health crisis.

AB  - Aberrant adult hippocampal neurogenesis is implicated in neurological and mood disorders associated with dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Understanding how the mTOR pathway shapes the functional development of different subpopulations of adult-born hippocampal neural stem cells will enable insight into potential therapeutic pathways for these disorders. Here we study how loss of TSC2, a regulator of mTOR pathway and a causal gene for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), affects dentate gyrus granule cell morphogenesis and hippocampal-dependent function. We found that Tsc2KO mice with TSC2 specifically ablated from Gli1+ adult-born neural stem cells showed neuronal hypertrophy, reduced NEUN expression, increased dendritic arborization, premature cellular senescence, and hypervascularization of the dentate gyrus. Neurologically, Tsc2KO mice showed altered exploratory behavior, impaired spatial learning, abnormal contextual recall, and hypersensitivity to kainic acid-induced seizures. Importantly, genetic reduction of Raptor, essential for mTORC1 signaling, rebalanced mTORC1 signaling and mitigated molecular, cellular, and neurological deficits in Tsc2KO mice. This study uncovered functions of TSC2 in Gli1+ adult-born neural stem cells and highlights RAPTOR as a potential therapeutic target for reversing disease features associated with TSC2 mutations.

AB  - Adult mouse hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons that integrate into existing hippocampal networks and modulate mood and memory. These NSCs are largely quiescent and are stimulated by niche signals to activate and produce neurons. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling acts at different steps along the hippocampal neurogenic lineage, but whether it has a direct role in the regulation of NSCs remains unclear. Here, we used Wnt/beta-catenin reporters and transcriptomic data from in vivo and in vitro models to show that adult NSCs respond to Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Wnt/beta-catenin stimulation instructed the neuronal differentiation of proliferating NSCs and promoted the activation or differentiation of quiescent NSCs in a dose-dependent manner. However, deletion of beta-catenin in NSCs did not affect either their activation or maintenance of their stem cell characteristics. Together, these results indicate that, although NSCs do respond to Wnt/beta-catenin stimulation in a dose-dependent and state-specific manner, Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is not cell-autonomously required to maintain NSC homeostasis, which reconciles some of the contradictions in the literature as to the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in adult hippocampal NSCs.

AB  - Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids (MSNAs) are atomically uniform dendritic nanostructures and potential delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The radial formulation combined with covalent conjugation may hide the oligonucleotide content and simultaneously enhance the role of appropriate conjugate groups on the outer sphere. The conjugate halo may be modulated to affect the delivery properties of the MSNAs. In the present study, [60]fullerene-based molecular spherical nucleic acids, consisting of a 2 '-deoxyribonucleotide and a ribonucleotide sequence, were used as hybridization-mediated carriers ("DNA and RNA-carriers") for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, (i. e. Tau-ASO) and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides (CS) with different sulfation patterns. The impact of the MSNA carriers, CS-moieties on the conjugates and the CS-decorations on the MSNAs on cellular uptake and - activity (Tau-suppression) of the Tau-ASO was studied with hippocampal neurons in vitro. The formation and stability of these heteroduplex ASO-MSNAs were evaluated by UV melting profile analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion chromatography equipped with a multi angle light scattering detector (SEC-MALS). The cellular uptake and - activity were studied by confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis, respectively.

AB  - Significance of ethnopharmacology: AnMei Decoction (AMD) is a renowned herbal prescription that has been widely demonstrated to have positive therapeutic effects on sleep disorders, depression, and cognitive impairments. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying AMD's resistance to sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment remain to be further investigated. Research objective: To clarify whether AMD may alleviate neuroinflammation by inhibiting NLRP3/Caspase1 signaling pathway and repair neuronal damage by regulating BDNF/TrkB pathway, thereby improving cognitive dysfunction in rats with chronic sleep deprivation. Materials and methods: LC-MS/MS was used to detect the active components in AMD. After behavioral tests, HE staining, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and Golgi staining were performed to assess the effects of AMD on chronic sleep deprivation. Western blot was used to detect the expression of hippocampal proteins NLRP3, Caspase-1, BDNF, p-TrkB, TrkB, Bax, Bcl-2, GAP43, PSD95, SNAP25, SYN, STX1A, and VAMP2. Hippocampal transcriptome sequencing was employed to observe differentially expressed genes after AMD intervention. Results: A total of 15 active components were identified from the AMD extract. AMD effectively improved the exploration and learning and memory abilities of sleep-deprived rats. AMD reduced neuroinflammation by inhibiting the NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway and repaired neuronal damage by regulating the BDNF/TrkB pathway. Simultaneously, AMD upregulated the expression of BDNF, p-TrkB, Bcl-2, GAP43, PSD95, SNAP25, SYN, STX1A, and VAMP2 proteins and inhibited the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and Bax proteins. Analysis of GO and KEGG pathway enrichment for the differentially expressed inflammation-related pathways may be involved in the therapeutic mechanism of AMD on sleep deprivation. Conclusion: AMD can effectively inhibit the NLRP3/Caspase1 signaling pathway to alleviate neuroinflammation, regulate the BDNF/TrkB pathway to maintain hippocampal neuronal viability, repair synaptic structural damage, and improve cognitive impairment in the sleep deprivation model.

AB  - Background Methamphetamine (MA) is well recognized as a psychostimulant that can cause neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration, which is associated with cognitive decline, has been confirmed experimentally.Objective The research aimed to investigate the neuroprotective properties of europinidin (Eu) in rodents affected by methamphetamine (MA)-induced cognitive impairments and hippocampal alterations. This was achieved by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and pro-inflammatory markers.Methods Rats were exposed to cognitive impairment produced by MA. The Morris water maze (MWM) is utilized to evaluate behavioral parameters. Biochemical tests were conducted on malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), interleukins-1 beta (IL-1 beta), reduced glutathione (GSH), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the expression of neurotransmitters (Norepinephrine [NE], dopamine [DA], glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) as well as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), IL-6, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and caspase 3 proteins. An investigation was carried out using docking methodology to ascertain whether Eu interacts with relevant molecular targets.Results Significant decline in the transfer latency and there were significant changes in the amount of SOD, GSH, CAT, and MDA and alterations in levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, CREB, TNF-alpha, BDNF, and Caspase 3 proteins expression. considerably restored level of neurotransmitters (NE, DA, Glutamate, and GABA) were observed in the Eu-treated rats compared to the MA-induced rats. Eu had a favorable affinity towards BDNF with docking scores of -9.486 kcal/mol.Conclusion The experiment found that administering Eu to rats improved cognitive abilities by changing antioxidant enzymes, reducing cytokines, and modifying neurotransmitter levels, compared to rats in the control group treated with MA.

AB  - Introduction: Depression is a prevalent and persistent mental disease characterized by symptoms such as anhedonia, anxiety, and desperation. Although our previous study shows that Xiaochaihutang (XCHT) upregulates hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in depressed mice and rats, the underlying mechanism requires further clarification. Objectives: To assess the mechanism by which XCHT regulates hippocampal BDNF expression in chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced mice. Methods: Adult C57BL/6J mice were exposed to CSDS for 10 consecutive days to establish a depression model. XCHT treatment (2.3, 7 and 21 g/kg, intragastric administration) was administered for 4 consecutive weeks. Behavioral assessments were sequentially conducted to investigate the antidepressant effects of CSDS-induced XCHT. Golgi staining, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, real time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction and chromatin immunoprecipitation were then employed to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of XCHT on hippocampal BDNF expression. Results: XCHT significantly improved CSDS-induced anhedonia, social avoidance, recognition memory impairment, and anxiety/depression-like behaviors in mice. XCHT significantly promoted neuronal complexity and dendritic spine maturation in the mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, XCHT reversed the CSDS-induced reduction in the number of hippocampal BDNF+ cells and increased hippocampal BDNF protein and mRNA levels by upregulating the expression of specific Bdnf exons I, IV and VI. XCHT increased Bdnf transcripts by upregulating histone H3K18 acetylation at the Bdnf promoters. The administration of an acetyltransferase inhibitor reversed the effects of these changes. Conclusion: XCHT may enhance the transcripts of specific Bdnf exons I, VI and VI by upregulating the H3K18 acetylation at the corresponding Bdnf promoters, which consequently promotes BDNF expression levels. This further promotes neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, ultimately ameliorating anxiety/depression-like behavior in CSDS-induced mice.

AB  - Tea plants can accumulate aluminum (Al) in their leaves to a greater extent than most other edible plants. Few studies, however, address the Al concentration in leaves at different positions, which is important information for tea quality control. Leaves from four different cultivars of Camellia sinensis L. grown in Hawaii were analyzed for Al concentrations at 10 different leaf positions. Each cultivar was harvested in the winter and summer to determine seasonal variations of Al concentrations in the leaves. The results showed that Al concentrations in the winter leaves were an average of 1.2-fold higher than those in the summer leaves, although the seasonal variations were not statistically significant. The total Al concentration of successively lower leaves showed an exponential increase (R-2 >= 0.900) for all four cultivars in the summer season, whereas those of the winter leaves fit a bi-phase linear regression (R-2 >= 0.968). The regression of the Al concentrations against the top-5 leaf positions in the winter season fit one linear regression, while that against leaf positions 6-11 fit another linear regression. The average Al concentrations between the third leaf and the shoot plus first two leaves increased approximately 2.7-fold and 1.9-fold for all cultivars in the winter and summer months, respectively. The Al concentrations in the rest of the leaves increased approximately 1.5-fold in a sequential order. The target hazard quotient being between 1.69 x 10(-2) and 5.06 x 10(-1) in the tea leaf samples of the four cultivars in Hawaii were all less than 1, suggesting negligible health risks for consumers. The results of this study may be useful for directing harvest practices and estimating tea quality.

AB  - Insecticide resistance poses a significant challenge in managing generalist herbivores such as the tobacco cutworm (TCW), Spodoptera litura. This study investigates the potential risks associated with using the novel diamide insecticide tetraniliprole to control TCW. A tetraniliprole-resistant strain was developed through twelve generations of laboratory selection, indicating an intermediate risk of resistance development. Field monitoring in China revealed a significant incidence of resistance, particularly in the Nanchang (NC) population (>100fold). Tetraniliprole showed moderate to high cross-resistance to multiple insecticides and was autosomally inherited with incomplete dominance, controlled by multiple genes, some of which belong to the cytochrome P450 family associated with enhanced detoxification. Life table studies indicated transgenerational hormesis, stimulating TCW female fecundity and increasing population net reproduction rates (R-0). These findings suggest a potential for pest resurgence under tetraniliprole use. The integrated risk assessment provides a basis for the sustainable management of TCW using tetraniliprole.

AB  - Objective To explore the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and postoperative outcomes in patients with chronic sinusitis (CRS) after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS).Methods We conducted an observational cohort study of 1,047 patients with CRS undergoing ESS. Discharged patients were followed up to 72 weeks for all-cause recurrence events. Baseline SES was established based on occupation, education level, and family income of the patients 1 year before the operation. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the recovery rate after ESS, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between SES and prognosis.Results Patients of middle SES had lower unadjusted all-cause recurrence than those of low or high SES; 24-week overall recovery rate was 90.4% [95 % confidence interval (CI): 89.6%-91.2%] in patients of middle SES, 13.5% (95 % CI: 12.8%-14.2%) in patients of low SES, and 31.7% (95 % CI: 30.7%-32.7%) in patients of high SES (both log-rank P < 0.001). After adjustment for covariates, hazard ratios (HRs) were 7.69 (95 % CI: 6.17-9.71, P-trend < 0.001) for all-cause recurrence for low SES versus middle SES, and 6.19 (95 % CI: 4.78-7.93, P-trend < 0.001) for middle SES versus high SES.Conclusion Low SES and high SES were more associated with the worse prognosis of CRS patients after ESS than middle SES.

AB  - Precise development of the dendritic architecture is a critical determinant of mature neuronal circuitry. MicroRNA (miRNA)mediated regulation of protein synthesis plays a crucial role in dendritic morphogenesis, but the role of miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) protein components in this process is less studied. Here, we show an important role of a key miRISC protein, the GW182 paralog TNRC6A, in the regulation of dendritic growth. We identified a distinct brain region-specific spatiotemporal expression pattern of GW182 during rat postnatal development. We found that thewindow of peak GW182 expression coincides with the period of extensive dendritic growth, both in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Perturbation of GW182 function during a specific temporal window resulted in reduced dendritic growth of cultured hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, we show that GW182 modulates dendritic growth by regulating global somatodendritic translation and actin cytoskeletal dynamics of developing neurons. Furthermore, we found that GW182 affects dendritic architecture by regulating the expression of actin modulator LIMK1. Taken together, our data reveal a previously undescribed neurodevelopmental expression pattern of GW182 and its role in dendritic morphogenesis, which involves both translational control and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement.

AB  - A tight regulation of the balance between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission is a prerequisite for synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks. In this context, the neurite growth inhibitor membrane protein Nogo-A modulates synaptic plasticity, strength, and neurotransmitter receptor dynamics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these actions are unknown. We show that Nogo-A loss-of-function in primary mouse hippocampal cultures by application of a function-blocking antibody leads to higher excitation following a decrease in GABA(A)Rs at inhibitory and an increase in the GluA1, but not GluA2 AMPAR subunit at excitatory synapses. This unbalanced regulation of AMPAR subunits results in the incorporation of Ca2+-permeable GluA2-lacking AMPARs and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels due to a higher Ca2+ influx without affecting its release from the internal stores. Increased neuronal activation upon Nogo-A loss-of-function prompts the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB and the expression of c-Fos. These results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the excitation/inhibition balance and thereby of plasticity in the brain.

AB  - Metabolic stress and the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two main contributors to neuronal damage and synaptic plasticity in acute ischemic stroke. The superoxide scavenger MnTMPyP has been previously reported to have a neuroprotective effect in organotypic hippocampal slices and to modulate synaptic transmission after in vitro hypoxia and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). However, the mechanisms involved in the effect of this scavenger remain elusive. In this study, two concentrations of MnTMPyP were evaluated on synaptic transmission during ischemia and post-ischemic synaptic potentiation. The complex molecular changes supporting cellular adaptation to metabolic stress, and how these are modulated by MnTMPyP, were also investigated. Electrophysiological data showed that MnTMPyP causes a decrease in baseline synaptic transmission and impairment of synaptic potentiation. Proteomic analysis performed on MnTMPyP and hypoxia-treated tissue indicated an impairment in vesicular trafficking mechanisms, including reduced expression of Hsp90 and actin signalling. Alterations of vesicular trafficking may lead to reduced probability of neurotransmitter release and AMPA receptor activity, resulting in the observed modulatory effect of MnTMPyP. In OGD, protein enrichment analysis highlighted impairments in cell proliferation and differentiation, such as TGF beta 1 and CDKN1B signalling, in addition to downregulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and an increased expression of CAMKII. Taken together, our results may indicate modulation of neuronal sensitivity to the ischemic insult, and a complex role for MnTMPyP in synaptic transmission and plasticity, potentially providing molecular insights into the mechanisms mediating the effects of MnTMPyP during ischemia.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Nao Tai Fang (NTF) is modified from Buyang Huanwu Decoction. Modern pharmacological research showed that NTF has a good anti-cerebral ischemic effect and can improve the learning and memory ability of cerebrovascular disease.
   Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore the regulation mechanism of NTF on the regulation mechanism of vascular dementia (VD)?s biological network based on chemoinformatics and transcriptomics strategies.
   Method: First, the bilateral common carotid artery ligation method was used to create a rat VD model. After NTF intervention for 30 days, the treatment effect was evaluated by HE staining and water maze experiment. Then, the Agilent mRNA expression profiling chip was used to obtain mRNA expression data of hippocampal tissues of VD model rats before and after NTF intervention, and microarray analysis was used to screen for genes with significant differential expression. The BATMAN database was utilized to obtain the potential targets of NTF and the Genecards and OMIM were utilized to collect the VD potential genes. The cytoscape was utilized to construct and analyze the networks. Result: The animal experiments showed that NTF can improve VD. A total of 180 up-regulated proteins and 289 down-regulated proteins were identified. The top 20 up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes were utilized to construct differentially expressed gene?s protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. A total of 677 NTF potential targets and 550 VD genes were obtained and were utilized to construct NTF-VD PPI network. The cheminformatics analysis showed that NTF can regulate a lot of biological processes and signaling pathways (such as inflammation modules, vasodilation and contraction modules, hypoxia modules, angiogenesis, coagulation, neurovascular unit modules, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Calcium signaling pathway, Serotonergic synapse).
   Conclusion: NTF may play a role in the treatment of VD through the targets, signaling pathways and biological processes discovered in this study.

AB  - Overview: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has emerged as a severely debilitating psychiatric disorder associated with critical illness. Little progress has been made in the treatment of post-intensive care unit (ICU) PTSD. Aim: To synthesize neurobiological evidence on the pathophysiology of PTSD and the brain areas involved, and to highlight the potential of music to treat post-ICU PTSD. Methods: Critical narrative review to elucidate an evidence-based neurobiological framework to inform the study of music interventions for PTSD post-ICU. Literature searches were performed in PubMed and CINAHL. The Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) guided reporting. Results: A dysfunctional HPA axis feedback loop, an increased amygdalic response, hippocampal atrophy, and a hypoactive prefrontal cortex contribute to PTSD symptoms. Playing or listening to music can stimulate neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, enhance brain recovery, and normalize stress response. Additionally, evidence supports effectiveness of music to improve coping and emotional regulation, decrease dissociation symptoms, reduce depression and anxiety levels, and overall reduce severity of PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Despite the lack of music interventions for ICU survivors, music has the potential to help people suffering from PTSD by decreasing amygdala activity, improving hippocampal and prefrontal brain function, and balancing the HPA-axis.

AB  - Methotrexate (MTX) is an antineoplastic agent and has neurotoxic effects. It exerts its toxic effect on the brain by triggering inflammation and apoptosis. Cannabidiol (CBD) is an agent known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects in various tissues. The aim of this study is to examine the protective effects of CBD treatment in various brain structures from MTX damage and to evaluate the effect of intracellular pathways involved in apoptosis. Thirty-two adult Wistar Albino female rats were divided into four groups as control, MTX (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]), MTX + CBD (0.1 mL of 5 mg/kg i.p.), and CBD (for 7 days, i.p.). At the end of the experiment, brain tissues collected for biochemical analyses as total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status, oxidative stress index (OSI), histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), serotonin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) staining, genetic analyses as caspase-9 (Cas-9), caspase-12 (Cas-12), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) gene expressions. In the histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation, hyperemia, microhemorrhage, neuronal loss, and significant decreasing expressions of seratonin were observed in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum regions in the MTX group. mTOR, TNF-alpha, Cas-9, Cas-12, CHOP, and Cyt-c expressions with TOS and OSI levels were increased in the cortex. It was observed that these findings were reversed after CBD application in all regions. MTX triggers neuronal apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress while destroying serotonergic neurons. The reversal of the pathological changes with CBD treatment proves that it has anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic activity in brain.

AB  - Objective Postoperative delirium (POD) has become a critical challenge with severe consequences and increased incidences as the global population ages. However, the underlying mechanism is yet unknown. Our study aimed to explore the changes in metabolites in three specific brain regions and saliva of older mice with postoperative delirium behavior and to identify potential non-invasive biomarkers. Methods Eighteen-month-old male C57/BL6 mice were randomly assigned to the anesthesia/surgery or control group. Behavioral tests were conducted 24 h before surgery and 6, 9, and 24 h after surgery. Complement C3 (C3) and S100 calcium-binding protein B protein (S100beta) levels were measured in the hippocampus, and a metabolomics analysis was performed on saliva, hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala samples. Results In total, 43, 33, 38, and 14 differential metabolites were detected in the saliva, hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala, respectively. "Pyruvate" "alpha-linolenic acid" and "2-oleoyl-1-palmitoy-snglycero-3-phosphocholine" are enriched in one common pathway and may be potential non-invasive biomarkers for POD. Common changes were observed in the three brain regions, with the upregulation of 1-methylhistidine and downregulation of D-glutamine. Conclusion Dysfunctions in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter dysregulation are implicated in the development of POD. The identification of changes in the level of salivary metabolite biomarkers could aid in the development of noninvasive diagnostic methods for POD.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the circulation of influenza and other seasonal respiratory viruses in the United States. All data were obtained from the US Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program over five consecutive respiratory seasons from 2016-2017 through to 2020-2021. A total of 62,476 specimens were tested for seasonal respiratory viruses. The circulating patterns of seasonal respiratory viruses have been greatly altered during the pandemic. The 2019-2020 influenza season terminated earlier compared to the pre-pandemic seasons, and the 2020-2021 influenza season did not occur. Moreover, weekly test positivity rates dramatically decreased for most of the seasonal respiratory viruses from the start of the pandemic through spring 2021. After the easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), circulations of seasonal coronavirus, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus have returned since spring 2021. High rhinovirus/enterovirus activity was evident throughout the 2020-2021 respiratory season. The findings suggest a strong association between the remarkably changed activity of seasonal respiratory viruses and the implementation of NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The NPIs may serve as an effective public health tool to reduce transmissions of seasonal respiratory viruses.

AB  - Recent evidence has shown that presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen2; Psenen) plays an essential role in corticogenesis by regulating the switch of apical progenitors (APs) to basal progenitors (BPs). The hippocampus is a brain structure required for advanced functions, including spatial navigation, learning and memory. However, it remains unknown whether Pen2 is important for hippocampal morphogenesis. To address this question, we generated Pen2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice, in which Pen2 is inactivated in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the hippocampal primordium. We showed that Pen2 cKO mice exhibited hippocampal malformation and decreased population of NPCs in the neuroepithelium of the hippocampus. We found that deletion of Pen2 neither affected the proliferative capability of APs nor the switch of APs to BPs in the hippocampus, and that it caused enhanced transition of APs to neurons. We demonstrated that expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) significantly increased the population of NPCs in the Pen2 cKO hippocampus. Collectively, this study uncovers a crucial role for Pen2 in the maintenance of NPCs during hippocampal development.

AB  - Background and aim: There is evidence to support the favorable impact of physical activity (PA) on brain volume. However, the empirical evidence exploring the relationship between physical and sedentary behavior remains mixed. We aimed to explore the relationship between PA and sedentary behavior and brain volume. Methods: The study sample (n = 150, mean age = 39.7 years) included patients interviewed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) who underwent an MRI brain scan. From the images obtained, we measured total intracranial, gray matter, and white matter volume along with the hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Multivariable linear regression analysis was done. Results and discussion: Left hippocampus and overall PA were positively and significantly associated (beta = 0.71, p = 0.021) whereas time spent on vigorous physical activity showed a negative association (beta = -0.328, p = 0.049) with left hippocampal volume. Conclusion: We found a positive association between total PA and the left hippocampus, whereas vigorous PA showed a negative association with the left hippocampus.

AB  - The ability of "target tracking,"such as keeping a target object in sight, is crucial for various activities. However, most sensing systems experience a certain degree of delay due to information processing, which challenges accurate target tracking. The long history of studies on animal behavior has revealed several tactics for it, although a systematic understanding of how individual tactics are combined into a strategy has not been reached. This study demonstrates a multifaceted tracking strategy in animals, which mitigates the adverse delay effects with small implementation costs. Using an active-sensing bat to measure their sensing state while chasing natural prey, we found that bats use a tracking strategy by combining multiple echolocation and flight tactics. The three echolocation tactics, namely the predictive control of sensing direction accompanied by adjusting the sensing rate and angular range, produce a direct compensation effect. Simultaneously, the flight tactic, the counter maneuver, assists echolocation by stabilizing the target direction. Our simulation results demonstrate that these combined tactics improve tracking accuracy over a wide range of delay constraints. In addition, a concise rule based on the angular velocity between bats and targets explains how bats control these tactics, suggesting that bats successfully reduce the burden of multitasking management. Our findings reveal the sophisticated strategy in animals' tracking systems and provide insights into understanding and developing efficiently integrated strategies in target tracking across various disciplines.

AB  - The monoaminergic systems dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) play important roles in neuromodulation, such as motor control, cognitive, affective, and neuroendocrine functions. In the present research study, we addressed the hypothesis that exposure to Type I pyrethroid tefluthrin may specifically target the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems. Tefluthrin could modify brain monoamine neurotransmitters, DA and 5-HT levels as well as dopaminergic and serotoninergic signaling pathways. Adult male Wistar rats were treated with tefluthrin [2.2, 4.4 and 5.5 mg/kg bw, equivalent to 1/10, 1/5 and 1/4 of the acute oral rat lethal dose 50 (LD50) value] by oral gavage, six days. After last dose of tefluthrin, DA and 5-HT and metabolites levels were determined in brain regions (striatum, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus). Tefluthrin induced a decrease of DA, 5-HT and metabolites contents, in a brain regional- and dose-related manner. The major decreases in DA and 5-HT contents were observed in prefrontal cortex tissue. Here, we studied that in vivo exposure to tefluthrin may alter DA and 5-HT neurotransmission in prefrontal cortex. Transcripts related to (i) dopaminergic [dopamine transporter 1 (Dat1), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2)], (ii) serotoninergic [serotonin transporter (SERT), tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), serotonin receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A)] and (iii) DA and 5-HT degradation [monoamine oxidases (MAOA, MAOB)] signaling pathways were investigated. Results showed that tefluthrin induced down-regulation of transcripts responsible for the synthesis and action of DA (TH, Drd1, Drd2) and 5-HT (SERT, TPH2). In contrast, tefluthrin treatment induced up-regulation of genes involved in DA transporter (Dat1), 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and monoamine oxidases (MAOA, MAOB). Given the integral roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic and serotoninergic alterations as hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, our data suggest that tefluthrin may be a candidate for pesticides contributing to neurodegenerative disorders pathogenesis by causing damage to the DA and 5-HT systems.

AB  - Background: Obesity is one of the critical risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The glymphatic system (GS) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits. Alisma orientale has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antihyperlipidemic effects, whereas its effects and underlying mechanisms on obesity-associated cognitive impairment (OACI) are unclear.
   Purpose: This work aims to decipher the mechanism of ethanol extracts from Alisma orientale (EEAO) in restoring cognitive impairment in HFD-induced obese mice through a GS approach.
   Methods: The restoration of abnormal glucose/lipid metabolism and excess adipose deposition by EEAO were assayed by biochemical analysis and visually displayed by a micro-CT scanner and Oil Red O staining. Biochemical assays and Western blotting (WB) were used to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), free fatty acid (FFAs) levels and the structural integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Microglial activation and neuro -inflammation were assessed with immunohistochemistry staining, ELISA and WB. Moreover, GS function was determined by immunofluorescence staining, fluorescence tracer imaging and WB. Finally, the neuropathological features and cognitive functions were detested with immunohistochemistry staining, immunofluorescence and Morris Water Maze.
   Results: EEAO not only alleviated body weight, cerebral lipid accumulation and serum FFAs in HFD-induced obese mice, but also increased CBF and BBB integrity. EEAO suppressed microglial activation and lipid depo-sition in the hippocampus and reduced the level of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-113 and TNF-alpha in brain tissue. Interestingly, long-term HFD-induced GS dysfunction was significantly restored after EEAO intervention, and neuropathological lesions and cognitive deficits were also markedly rescued.
   Conclusion: EEAO rescued the cognitive deficits of OACI by inhibiting neuroinflammation and restoring GS dysfunction, indicating a potential remedy for OACI.

AB  - Different preventive public health measures were adopted globally to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, such as hand hygiene and the use of masks, travel restrictions, social distance actions such as the closure of schools and workplaces, case and contact tracing, quarantine and lockdown. These measures, in particular physical distancing and the use of masks, might have contributed to containing the spread of other respiratory viruses that occurs principally by contact and droplet routes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of different respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and human coronaviruses) after one year of the pandemic. Furthermore, another aim was to evaluate the possible impact of these non-pharmaceutical measures on the circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses. This single center study was conducted between January 2017-February 2020 (pre-pandemic period) and March 2020-May 2021 (pandemic period). All adults >18 years with respiratory symptoms and tested for respiratory pathogens were included in the study. Nucleic acid detection of all respiratory viruses was performed by multiplex real time PCR. Our results show that the test positivity for influenza A and B, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and human coronaviruses decreased with statistical significance during the pandemic. Contrary to this, for adenovirus the decrease was not statistically significant. Conversely, a statistically significant increase was detected for rhinovirus. Coinfections between different respiratory viruses were observed during the pre-pandemic period, while the only coinfection detected during pandemic was between SARS-CoV-2 and rhinovirus. To understand how the preventive strategies against SARS-CoV-2 might alter the transmission dynamics and epidemic patterns of respiratory viruses is fundamental to guide future preventive recommendations.

AB  - The collection, evaluation and listing of all available data related to the supply, collection and disposal of water, is a project of combining and recording all the data for infrastructure projects and their structure within the urban structure of Alexandria and the wider region, as it was discovered and studied to this day. The paper is a description of the most important storage structures for the waters of the Nile River and the rain. Composing data from previous descriptions, archaeological excavations and random discoveries during construction work created a database. This database currently has 144 tanks of 1 to 4 levels, from 6 m(3) to 2,500 m(3). In particular they have been identified 27 tanks in 1 level, 50 tanks on 2 levels, 49 tanks on 3 levels, 9 tanks on 4 levels and 9 tanks whose exact morphology is unknown to us. The examples of reservoir technologies and management practices given in this work may be of some importance to the sustainability of water resources for the present and the future. Reservoirs have been used to store both rainwater and spring and river water to meet the needs of seasonal variations. The tanks range from simple to large underground structures. Then a comparison is made with the water management systems in the wider Mediterranean region and especially in Istanbul, where there is such infrastructure.

AB  - Background/Aims: Swine erysipelas is a disease caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, a Gram-positive bacillus, which has great economic importance because it leads to the loss of the swine herd. To control this disease, animals are immunized with a cellular vaccine of killed or attenuated E. rhusiopathiae, but even with herd vaccination, cases of swine erysipelas outbreaks have been reported in the United States, China and Japan, leading to the search for other antigenic components of the bacteria that may promote greater protection against E. rhusiopathiae. The surface protein SpaA from E. rhusiopathiae has been shown to be a candidate to constitute a subunit vaccine, since it has already been reported to induce a host immune response against the bacterium. DnaK, a hsp70 molecular chaperone, also seems to be a good candidate in the composition of a vaccine, as it has been demonstrated to be an antigenic protein of the bacteria. Methods: This work evaluated the immunogenicity and protection induced by the E. rhusiopathiae SpaA and DnaK recombinant proteins in a murine model, by intramuscular administration to mice with two doses of 100 mu g at 21-day interval between them. The candidate proteins were tested either separately and together, compared with the commercial vaccine and the non-vaccination condition, and mice were challenged with a virulent strain of E. rhusiopathiae. Serum was collected to assess the produced antibodies and peripheral blood cells, whereas spleen and kidney tissues were assayed for E. rhusiopathiae presence by colony counting. Results: A survival curve of the animals was performed, which confirmed the protection induced by the proteins. IgG antibodies increased in the animal serum inoculated with the proteins when compared to the control, and a significant delay in disease symptoms was observed. Conclusion: These results suggest that E. rhusiopathiae DnaK and SpaA are immunogenic in mice and interfere with the disease development. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Social distancing measures are used to reduce the spreading of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of local restrictions on the transmission of respiratory virus infections. Methods: we retrospectively analyzed the nasopharyngeal samples of all patients (0-18 years old) admitted with respiratory symptoms in a large Italian tertiary hospital during the last three seasons from 2018 to 2021. Results: A strong reduction in all viral respiratory infections was observed in the last season (2020-2021) compared to the two previous seasons (-79.69% and -80.66%, respectively). In particular, we found that during the epidemic period 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, the total number of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) cases was, respectively 726 and 689, while in the last season a total of five cases was detected. In the first months of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, the total flu infections were 240 and 354, respectively, while in the last season we did not detect any influenza virus. As other viruses, the presence of Rhinovirus declined, but to a lesser extent: a total of 488 cases were assessed compared to the 1030 and 1165 cases of the two previous respective epidemic seasons. Conclusions: Public health interventions and distancing (including continuous use of face masks) settled to counter the pandemic spread of COVID-19 had a macroscopic impact on all respiratory virus transmission and related diseases, with a partial exception of Rhinovirus. The absence of viruses' circulation could result in a lack of immunity and increased susceptibility to serious infections in the next seasons.

AB  - When humans mentally "navigate" bidimensional uniform conceptual spaces, they recruit the same grid-like and distance codes typically evoked when exploring the physical environment. Here, using fMRI, we show evidence that conceptual navigation also elicits another kind of spatial code: that of absolute direction. This code is mostly localized in the medial parietal cortex, where its strength predicts participants' comparative semantic judgments. It may provide a complementary mechanism for conceptual navigation outside the hippocampal formation.
   Vigano et al. use fMRI in healthy human participants to show that conceptual navigation elicits a spatial code for absolute direction in the medial parietal cortex. Their findings are suggestive of a complementary mechanism for conceptual navigation outside the hippocampal formation.

AB  - BackgroundN(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to participate in various essential biological processes by regulating the level of target genes. However, the function of m6A modification mediated by KIAA1429 [alias virus-like m6A methyltransferase-associated protein (VIRMA)] during the progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains undefined.MethodsThe expression and clinical significance of KIAA1429 were verified by our clinical data. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated KIAA1429 deletion, and CRISPR/dCas9-VP64 for activating endogenous KIAA1429 was used to evaluate its biological function. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, luciferase activity assay, RNA stability experiments, and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of KIAA1429 in DLBCL. Tumor xenograft models were established for in vivo experiments.ResultsDysregulated expression of m6A regulators was observed, and a novel predictive model based on m6A score was established in DLBCL. Additionally, elevated KIAA1429 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with DLBCL. Knockout of KIAA1429 repressed DLBCL cell proliferation, facilitated cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, induced apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11 (CHST11) was identified as a downstream target of KIAA1429, which mediated m6A modification of CHST11 mRNA and then recruited YTHDF2 for reducing CHST11 stability and expression. Inhibition of CHST11 diminished MOB1B expression, resulting in inactivation of Hippo-YAP signaling, reprogramming the expression of Hippo target genes.ConclusionsOur results revealed a new mechanism by which the Hippo-YAP pathway in DLBCL is inactivated by KIAA1429/YTHDF2-coupled epitranscriptional repression of CHST11, highlighting the potential of KIAA1429 as a novel predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for DLBCL progression.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the dose-response relationships of different dimensions of physical activity (intensity, time, frequency, capacity, and metabolic equivalent) with daily physical function (DPF) and cognitive function (CF) in Chinese adults with hypertension. Methods: The 6216 hypertensive patients included in this study were from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which was conducted in 2015. Physical activity (PA) was divided into vigorous PA (VPA), moderate PA (MPA), and light PA (LPA). Linear regression models and binary logistic regression models were established to assess the associations with indicators. Results: Patients with VPA have a lower probability of impaired DPF; however, patients with VPA had lower CF scores. Patients with nearly all the aspects of MPA have lower rates of impaired DPF and higher CF scores (p < 0.05). Patients with LPA have a lower probability of impaired DPF and higher CF scores. In addition, patients with between 1800 and 2999 MET-minutes per week had the lowest rates of impaired DPF (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.02, 0.39) and the highest CF scores (beta = 3.28, 95% CI 2.25, 4.31). Conclusions: This study found that patients with hypertension with moderate-intensity physical activity (nearly all aspects) and LPA had better DPF and CF. The best daily physical function and CF was with METs of 1800-2999 min per week. However, VPA should be recommended with caution in Chinese adults with hypertension.

AB  - The effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activators D-serine, D-alanine, and sarcosine against schizophrenia and depression are promising. Nevertheless, high doses of D-serine and sarcosine are associated with undesirable nephrotoxicity or worsened prostatic cancer. Thus, alternatives are needed. DAAO inhibition can increase D-serine as well as D-alanine and protect against D-serine-induced nephrotoxicity. Although several DAAO inhibitors improve the symptoms of schizophrenia and depression, they can increase the plasma levels but not brain levels of D-serine. The mechanism of action of DAAO inhibitors remains unclear. We investigated the effects of the DAAO inhibitor sodium benzoate on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal level of D-alanine as known another substrate with antipsychotic and antidepressant properties and other NMDAR-related amino acids, such as, L-alanine, D-serine, L-serine, D-glutamate, L-glutamate, and glycine levels. Our results indicate that sodium benzoate exerts antipsychotic and antidepressant-like effects without changing the D-serine levels in the brain prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Moreover, D-alanine levels in the PFC and hippocampus did not change. Despite these negative findings regarding the effects of D-amino acids in the PFC and hippocampus, sodium benzoate exhibited antipsychotic and antidepressant-like effects. Thus, the therapeutic effects of sodium benzoate are independent of D-serine or D-alanine levels. In conclusion, sodium benzoate may be effective among patients with schizophrenia or depression; however, the mechanisms of actions remain to be elucidated.

AB  - Simple Summary
   We investigated the use of the qualitative behavior assessment (QBA) to evaluate the emotional state of African elephants managed in captive and semi-captive environments by three groups of people with differing ages and levels of knowledge of the species. We also examined whether their assessments correlated with behaviors exhibited by the animals. Fifteen video-clips of a total of 18 African elephants recorded in three different situations (release from the night boma; interactions with visitors; return to the night boma) were used. The result of the performed analysis supported that the consensus found was not due to chance. This notwithstanding, all the adjectives used by the three observer groups were not strong descriptors of the consensus variables resulting from statistical analysis. All three groups showed a degree of separation between captive and semi-captive management, with semi-captive animals rated as being in a more positive emotional state. For all three groups of observers, stereotypic "trunk swirling" behavior correlated with negative emotional descriptors. Although definitive evaluation of animal welfare requires the services of experts, more studies are needed to investigate the perception of elephants' emotional states amongst visitors of different ages and background.
   This study aimed to investigate how three groups of people of differing ages, and with differing knowledge of the species, perceived the emotional state of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) managed in captive and semi-captive environments. Fifteen video-clips of 18 elephants, observed during three different daily routines (release from and return to the night boma; interactions with visitors), were used for a free choice profiling assessment (FCP) and then analyzed with quantitative methods. A general Procrustes analysis identified two main descriptive dimensions of elephant behavioral expression explaining 27% and 19% of the variability in the children group, 19% and 23.7% in adults, and 21.8% and 17% in the expert group. All the descriptors the observers came up with showed a low level of correlation on the identified dimensions. All three observers' groups showed a degree of separation between captive and semi-captive management. Spearman analyses showed that stereotypic "trunk swirling" behavior correlated negatively with first dimension (free/friendly versus sad/bored) in the children's group; second dimension (agitated/confident versus angry/bored) amongst the adults; and first dimension (active/excited versus agitated/bored) amongst the experts. More studies are needed to investigate other potential differences in assessing elephants' emotional states by visitors of different ages and backgrounds.

TI  - Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated protein 1 (CAND1) promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration by enhancing the ubiquitinated degradation of Mps one binder kinase activator 1b (Mob1b)

AB  - Activation of the intrinsic regenerative potential of adult mammalian hearts by promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation holds great potential in heart repair. CAND1 (Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated protein 1) functions as a critical regulator of cellular protein homeostasis by fine-tuning the ubiquitinated degradation of specific abnormally expressed protein substrates. Here, we identified that cardiac-specific transgenic overexpression of CAND1 reduced the infarct size, restored cardiac function, and promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation after myocardial infarction in juvenile (7-day-old) and adult (8-week-old) mice. Conversely, CAND1 deficiency blunted the regenerative capacity of neonatal hearts after apex resection. MS and functional verification demonstrated that CAND1 enhanced the assembly of Cullin1, FBXW11(F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 11), and Mob1b (Mps one binder kinase activator 1b) complexes, and thus promotes the degradation of Mob1b. The ubiquitination of Mob1b occurred at K108 and was linked by K48 of ubiquitin. Mob1b deletion partially rescued the loss of regenerative capacity in neonatal hearts induced by CAND1 deficiency and improved cardiac function in adult mice post-MI. Moreover, CAND1 promoted the proliferation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Our data demonstrate that CAND1 promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation via FBXW11-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of Mob1b, and improves heart regeneration after cardiac injury. The findings provide a novel strategy to promote cardiac regeneration and repair.Schematic diagram of the role of CAND1 in regulating ubiquitination and degradation of Mob1b and cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. Under CAND1-High condition, CAND1 promotes the incorporation of Cullin1, FBXW11, and Mob1b complexes, and accelerates SCFFBXW11-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of Mob1b at the K108 site, which leads to the degradation of Mob1b and thus suppresses the Hippo signaling pathway and facilitates cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration post-MI.

AB  - BackgroundDoxorubicin (DOX), a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, can cause neurodegeneration in the brain, which leads to a condition known as chemobrain. In fact, chemobrain is a deteriorating condition which adversely affects the lives of cancer survivors. This study aimed to examine the potential therapeutic effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and their derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exo) in DOX-induced chemobrain in rat models.MethodsChemobrain was induced by exposing rats to DOX (2mg/kg, i.p) once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. After 48h of the last DOX dose, a subset of rats was supplied with either an intravenous injection of BMSCs (1 x 10(6)) or a single dose of 150 mu g of BMSCs-Exo. Behavioral tests were conducted 7days post injection. Rats were sacrificed after 14days from BMSCs or BMSCs-Exo injection.ResultsBMSCs and BMSCs-Exo successfully restored DOX-induced cognitive and behavioral distortion. These actions were mediated via decreasing hippocampal neurodegeneration and neural demyelination through upregulating neural myelination factors (myelin%, Olig2, Opalin expression), neurotropic growth factors (BDNF, FGF-2), synaptic factors (synaptophysin), and fractalkine receptor expression (Cx3cr1). Halting neurodegeneration in DOX-induced chemobrain was achieved through epigenetic induction of key factors in Wnt/beta -catenin and hedgehog signaling pathways mediated primarily by the most abundant secreted exosomal miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-24-3p, let-7a-5p). Moreover, BMSCs and BMSCs-Exo significantly abrogate the inflammatory state (IL-6, TNF-alpha), apoptotic state (BAX/Bcl2), astrocyte, and microglia activation (GFAP, IBA-1) in DOX-induced chemobrain with a significant increase in the antioxidant mediators (GSH, GPx, SOD activity).ConclusionsBMSCs and their derived exosomes offer neuroprotection against DOX-induced chemobrain via genetic and epigenetic abrogation of hippocampal neurodegeneration through modulating Wnt/beta -catenin and hedgehog signaling pathways and through reducing inflammatory, apoptotic, and oxidative stress state.Graphical abstractProposed mechanisms of the protective effects of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and their exosomes (BMSCs-Exo) in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced chemobrain.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction often occurs in diabetes mellitus patients. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of melatonin (MLT) in improving diabetes-associated cognitive decline and the underlying mechanism involved. Type 2 diabetic mice and palmitic acid (PA)-stimulated BV-2 cells were treated by MLT, and the potential mechanisms among MLT, cognition, and autophagy were explored. The results showed that type 2 diabetic mice showed obvious learning and memory impairments in the Morris water maze test compared with normal controls, which could be ameliorated by MLT treatment. Meanwhile, MLT administration significantly improved neuroinflammation and regulated microglial apoptosis. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) increased the microglial inflammation and apoptosis, indicating that the treatment effect of MLT was mediated by autophagy. Lastly, MLT treatment significantly decreased the levels of toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4), phosphorylated-protein kinase B (Akt), and phosphorylated-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), indicating that blocking TLR4/Akt/mTOR pathway might be an underlying basis for the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects of MLT. Collectively, our study suggested that MLT could improve learning and memory in type 2 diabetic mice by activating autophagy via the TLR4/Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation and microglial apoptosis.

AB  - Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a member of the genus Pestivirus, which causes serious economic losses. The re-emergence of the disease in Japan in 2018 has increased awareness of CSFV. In this study, Balb/c mice were immunized with plant-derived E2 protein, and four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 4B11, 7B3, 11A5 and 6F3 were generated. Two of these mAbs, 4B11 and 7B3, effectively blocked CSFV infection of PK-15 cells. Both mAbs recognized a novel linear epitope, (256)CLIGNTTVKVHASDER(271). The neutralizing ability of anti-CSFV serum decreased 63%, when pre-incubated with the linear peptide at 200 mu g/mL. Structural analysis showed that this linear epitope is present at the border of Domain C and Domain D on the surface of the E2 protein. Alignment of amino acid sequences showed that the epitope was conserved in different subgroups of CSFV but not in other members of the Pestivirus genus. Consistently with the analysis above, this epitope distinguished antibodies against CSFV from those against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Our study provides an ideal candidate peptide for new vaccine design and differential diagnosis of CSFV. These findings will contribute to the control and eradication of classical swine fever.

AB  - Cognitive decline is inevitable with age, and due to the lack of well-established pharmacotherapies for neurodegenerative disorders, dietary supplements have become important alternatives to ameliorate brain deterioration. Hydrolyzed chicken meat extract (HCE) and its bioactive components were previously found to improve neuroinflammation and cognitive decline by regulating microglia polarization. However, the effects and mechanisms of these bioactives on neurons remain unclear. Here, the most potent bioactive component on neural function in HCE was screened out, and the detailed mechanism was clarified through in vivo and in vitro experiments. We found that HCE, cyclo(Val-Pro), cyclo(Phe-Phe), cyclo(His-Pro), cyclo(Leu-Lys), and arginine exerted stronger anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects among the 12 bioactives in amyloid beta (A beta)-treated HT-22 cells. Further transcriptome sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array analysis showed that these bioactives participated in different signaling pathways, and cyclo(Val-Pro) was identified as the most potent cyclic dipeptide. In addition, the antiapoptotic and neuroprotective effect of cyclo(Val-Pro) was partly regulated by the activation of PI3K/AKT and AMPK pathways, and the inhibition of these pathways abolished the effect of cyclo(Val-Pro). Moreover, cyclo(Val-Pro) enhanced cognitive function and neurogenesis and alleviated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in middle-aged mice, with an effect similar to HCE. Hippocampal transcriptome analysis further revealed that HCE and cyclo(Val-Pro) significantly enriched the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, verified by enhanced neurotransmitter levels and upregulated neurotransmitter receptor-related gene expression. Therefore, the mechanism of cyclo(Val-Pro) on neural function might be associated with PI3K/AKT and AMPK pathway-mediated antiapoptotic effect and neurogenesis and the activation of the neurotransmitter-receptor pathway.

AB  - Neonatal music therapy (MT) has become more accessible worldwide. Previous research suggests multiple benefits of MT for preterm infants and their caregivers; however, far too little attention has been paid to understanding the mechanisms of change in previous Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)-MT research so far. This perspective article describes potential mechanisms of MT interventions exposed during kangaroo mother care on the preterm infant's response (behavioral and physiological outcomes) and the mother-infant relationship. The paper focuses on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis' role in stabilization of behavioral state, the autonomic nervous system's role in stabilization of physiologic state, as well as co-regulation as a potential mechanism for the developing of the parent-infant relationship. Mechanisms play a pivotal role in understanding variables related to the therapy course and well as in generating new knowledge regarding treatment susceptibility and optimizing resources. Understanding of the mechanisms of how interventions may lead to specific outcomes plays an important role in addressing the issue of improvement of currently available approaches of MT used in the NICU.

AB  - Stem cells regenerate differentiated cells to maintain and repair tissues and organs. They also replenish themselves, i.e. self-renew, to support a lifetime of regenerative capacity. Here we study the renewal of skeletal muscle stem cell (MuSC) during regeneration. The transcriptional co-factors TAZ/YAP (via the TEAD transcription factors) regulate cell cycle and growth while the transcription factor YY1 regulates metabolic programs for MuSC activation. We show that MPP7 and AMOT join TAZ and YY1 to regulate a selected number of common genes that harbor TEAD and YY1 binding sites. Among these common genes, Carm1 can direct MuSC renewal. We demonstrate that the L27 domain of MPP7 enhances the interaction as well as the transcriptional activity of TAZ and YY1, while AMOT acts as an intermediate to bridge them together. Furthermore, MPP7, TAZ and YY1 co-occupy the promoters of Carm1 and other common downstream genes. Our results define a renewal program comprised of two progenitor transcriptional programs, in which selected key genes are regulated by protein-protein interactions, dependent on promoter context.
   Renewal divisions of muscle stem cells are regulated by the methyltransferase CARM1. This study shows that Carm1 is transcriptionally regulated by the coordinated action of MPP7, AMOT, YAP/TAZ, and YY1.Mpp7 cKO and Amot cKO mice display similar muscle stem cell renewal defects.Mpp7 cKO, Amot cKO, and Yap/Taz double cKO transcriptomes reveal a common set of down-regulated genes, including Carm1.MPP7, AMOT, YAP/TAZ, and YY1 form a protein complex to activate transcription.The L27 domain of MPP7 facilitates complex formation and contributes to the enhanced transcriptional activity.

AB  - The giant panda, a strict herbivore that feeds on bamboo, still retains a typical carnivorous digestive system. Reference catalogs of microbial genes and genomes are lacking, largely limiting the antibiotic resistome and functional exploration of the giant panda gut microbiome. Here, we integrated 177 fecal metagenomes of captive and wild giant pandas to construct a giant panda integrated gene catalog (GPIGC) comprised of approximately 4.5 million non-redundant genes and reconstruct 393 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Taxonomic and functional characterization of genes revealed that the captivity of the giant panda significantly changed the core microbial composition and the distribution of microbial genes. Higher abundance and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were detected in the guts of captive giant pandas, and ARG distribution was influenced by geography, for both captive and wild individuals. Escherichia, as the prevalent genus in the guts of captive giant pandas, was the main carrier of ARGs, meaning there is a high risk of ARG transmission by Escherichia. We also found that multiple mcr gene variants, conferring plasmid-mediated mobile colistin resistance, were widespread in the guts of captive and wild giant pandas. There were low proportions of carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes in GPIGC and MAGs compared with several omnivorous and herbivorous mammals. Many members of Clostridium MAGs were significantly enriched in the guts of adult, old and wild giant pandas. The genomes of isolates and MAGs of Clostridiaceae harbored key genes or enzymes in complete pathways for degrading lignocellulose and producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indicating the potential of these bacteria to utilize the low-nutrient bamboo diet. Overall, our data presented an exhaustive reference gene catalog and MAGs in giant panda gut and provided a comprehensive understanding of the antibiotic resistome and microbial adaptability for a high-lignocellulose diet.

AB  - The Hippo pathway plays an imperative role in cellular processes such as differentiation, regeneration, cell migration, organ growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle. Transcription coregulator component of Hippo pathway, YAP1, promotes transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and suppressing apoptosis. However, its role in epimorphic regeneration has not been fully explored. The axolotl is a wellestablished model organism for developmental biology and regeneration studies. By exploiting its remarkable regenerative capacity, we investigated the role of Yap1 in the early blastema stage of limb regeneration. Depleting Yap1 using gene-specific morpholinos attenuated the competence of axolotl limb regeneration evident in bone formation defects. To explore the affected downstream pathways from Yap1 down-regulation, the gene expression profile was examined by employing LC-MS/MS technology. Based on the generated data, we provided a new layer of evidence on the putative roles of increased protease inhibition and immune system activities and altered ECM composition in diminished bone formation capacity during axolotl limb regeneration upon Yap1 deficiency. We believe that new insights into the roles of the Hippo pathway in complex structure regeneration were granted in this study.

AB  - Elevated levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) are implicated in the transformation of astrocytes into astrogliomas, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we found that hypoxia led to a significant increase in GDNF expression in primary rat astrocytes from various brain regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum. This was accompanied by the activation of astrocytes, particularly those of the A2 subtype, and a concurrent increase in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha) expression. The elevated levels of HIF-1 alpha enhanced its binding to the GDNF promoter, resulting in increased GDNF expression. Interestingly, this process formed a positive feedback loop, as elevated GDNF further activated HIF-1 alpha in primary rat and human astrocytes. Furthermore, lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 (LOXL2), a novel downstream oncogene of GDNF, showed a significant increase following hypoxia treatment and exhibited a positive correlation with GDNF expression. Inhibiting GDNF signaling effectively suppressed this expression. Hypoxia-induced GDNF also increased the phosphorylation of ERK, P38, and CREB through the classical GDNF receptors, GFR alpha 1 and RET. This led to increased binding of phosphorylated CREB to the LOXL2 promoter, resulting in enhanced LOXL2 expression. Consequently, rat astrocytes under hypoxic stress exhibited increased cell viability, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which were mitigated by inhibiting GDNF signaling or silencing LOXL2. This phenomenon was also observed in C6 cells. Our findings suggest that hypoxia induces astrocyte activation and upregulates LOXL2 expression through the HIF-1 alpha/GDNF/P-CREB signaling axis, facilitating the infiltration-like growth of astrocytes and the infiltrative growth of C6 astroglioma cells.

AB  - The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was established as an international framework for monitoring rehabilitation outcomes and the impacts of health interventions since, as the term "functioning" implies, it emphasizes a person's "lived health" in addition to their biological health status. Equine-assisted therapy (EAT) represents a holistic intervention approach that aims to improve both biomedical functioning and the patient's lived health in relation to performing activities and participating in social situations. In this study, the psychometric properties of an ICF-based digital assessment tool for the measurement of the rehabilitation impacts of EAT were analyzed via simultaneous confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and reliability and sensitivity tests. In total, 265 patients from equine-assisted therapy centers in Germany were included for CFA. Change sensitivity was assessed via multi-level analyses based on 876 repeated assessments by 30 therapists. Results show satisfactory model-fit statistics; McDonald's omega (ML) showed excellent scores for the total scale (omega = 0.96) and three subscales (omega = 0.95; omega = 0.95, omega = 0.93). The tool proved itself to be change sensitive and reliable (change sensitivity p <= 0.001), retest r = 0.745 **, p <= 0.001). Overall, the developed assessment tool satisfactorily fulfills psychometric requirements and can be applied in therapeutic practice.

AB  - Collagen obtained from fish offal (skin, scales, and bones) is required from some religious and ethnic groups, thus indirectly increasing demands for fish collagen for biomedical applications. The limitation of fish collagen is its lower thermal stability compared to mammalian collagen. In this study, we focused on collagen extracted from scales of the marine fish barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and demonstrated the suitability for the collagen to be utilized in collagen fibril matrices (CFM). Collagen was extracted from the scales through pepsin-digestion and purified (designated as "BC "). The denaturation temperature (Td) for BC was determined to be 36.4 degrees C, one of the highest among fish collagens. BC formed CFM which was thermally stable at 37 degrees C, while Td was lower than 37 degrees C. This could be explained by the fast fibril formation, initiating at temperatures near 20 degrees C in a temperature-elevated process. As a result, the NIH3T3 cells were successfully encapsulated in the CFM of BC and cultured three-dimensionally for 7 d. The cells spread and exhibited well-developed pseudopodia in the CFM of BC as observed in the CFM of pig collagen matrices. This is the first report on fish CFM used for conventional 3-D cell culture.

AB  - High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the deadliest and most common subtype of ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, most patients develop recurrence and, ultimately, resistance to standard platinum chemotherapy. Large tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2, the core Hippo signaling kinases, have been implicated in various cancer types, including ovarian cancer. The mechanism by which LATS1/2 suppresses ovarian cancer progression is currently elusive, but the expression of LATS1/2 is frequently reduced or lost in these cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that the inactivation of LATS1/2 is sufficient to transform normal mouse ovarian epithelium into tumorigenic cells associated with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics. The knockout of Lats1/2 in the epithelial cells also leads to higher expression levels of the immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1, suggesting a regulatory role of LATS1/2 in modulating immune responses and immune evasion. In addition to the loss of LATS1/2 activating the downstream transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, PI3K-AKT activity was also increased, likely contributing to enhanced tumor proliferation and survival. The stimulatory effect of Lats1/2 knockout on cell proliferation can be partially reversed by treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK2206. Treatment with verteporfin, a potent inhibitor of YAP/TAZ, decreases ovarian tumor progression and reduces the activated AKT in the tumors. In summary, this study uncovers several biological mechanisms for the initiation of HGSOC and identifies LATS1/2 as potential prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that, because of its broad host range, poses a potential threat to public health. Here, to identify the neutralizing B-cell epitopes within the S1-CTD protein, we generated three anti-PDCoV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Of these, the antibody designated 4E-3 effectively neutralized PDCoV with an IC50 of 3.155 & mu;g/mL. mAb 4E-3 and one other, mAb 2A-12, recognized different linear B-cell epitopes. The minimal fragment recognized by mAb 4E-3 was mapped to 280FYSDPKSAV288 and designated S280-288, the minimal fragment recognized by mAb 2A-12 was mapped to 506TENNRFTT513, and designated S506-513. Subsequently, alanine (A)-scanning mutagenesis indicated that Asp283, Lys285, and Val288 were the critical residues recognized by mAb 4E-3. The S280-288 epitope induces PDCoV specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, demonstrating that it is a neutralizing epitope. Of note, the S280-288 coupled to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) produces PDCoV neutralizing antibodies in vitro and in vivo, in challenged piglets it potentiates interferon-& gamma; responses and provides partial protection against disease. This is the first report about the PDCoV S protein neutralizing epitope, which will contribute to research of PDCoV-related pathogenic mechanism, vaccine design and antiviral drug development.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteropathogenic coronavirus, has catastrophic impacts on the global pig industry. However, there are still no anti-PEDV drugs with accurate targets. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical secondary structures formed within guanine-rich regions of DNA or RNA, and have attracted great attention as potential targets for antiviral strategy. In this study, we reported two putative G4-forming sequences (PQS) in S and Nsp5 genes of PEDV genome based on bioinformatic analysis, and identified that S-PQS and Nsp5-PQS were enabled to fold into G4 structure by using circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence turn-on assay. Furthermore, we verified that both S-PQS and Nsp5-PQS PQS could form G4 structure in live cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, G4-specific compounds, such as TMPyP4 and PDS, could signifi-cantly inhibit transcription, translation and proliferation of PEDV in vitro. Importantly, these compounds exert antiviral activity at the post-entry step of PEDV infection cycle, by inhibiting viral genome replication and protein expression. Lastly, we demonstrated that TMPyP4 can inhibit reporter gene expression by targeting G4 structure in Nsp5. Taken together, these findings not only reinforce the presence of viral G-quadruplex sequences in PEDV genome but also provide new insights into developing novel antiviral drugs targeting PEDV RNA G-quadruplexes.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the most relevant health threats in recent years has been the antimicrobial resistance of both pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of drug resistance among 413 Gram-negative and 183 Gram-positive bacteria, previously isolated from six bat populations living in Sicilian and Calabrian territory (Italy), using the disk diffusion method. Antimicrobial susceptibility analysis showed high resistance to some of the molecules tested and the presence of numerous multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains. The spread of antimicrobial resistance is one of the major health emergencies of recent decades. Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria threaten not only humans but also populations of domestic and wild animals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distribution of antibiotic resistance (AMR) and multidrug resistance (MDR) in bacterial strains isolated from six Southern-Italian bat populations. Using the disk diffusion method, we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility of 413 strains of Gram-negative bacteria and 183 strains of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from rectal (R), oral (O) and conjunctival (C) swabs of 189 bats belonging to 4 insectivorous species (Myotis capaccinii, Myotis myotis, Miniopterus schreibersii and Rhinolophus hipposideros). In all bat species and locations, numerous bacterial strains showed high AMR levels for some of the molecules tested. In both Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, the resistance patterns ranged from one to thirteen. MDR patterns varied significantly across sites, with Grotta dei Pipistrelli in Pantalica displaying the highest levels of MDR (77.2% of isolates). No significant differences were found across different bat species. Monitoring antibiotic resistance in wildlife is a useful method of evaluating the impact of anthropic pressure and environmental pollution. Our analysis reveals that anthropic contamination may have contributed to the spread of the antibiotic resistance phenomenon among the subjects we examined.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a diet supplemented with fresh amla fruit as a natural feed additive on blood metabolic parameters, milk antioxidant capacity, and milk fatty acid (FA) proportions in lactating dairy cows. Eight ruminally cannulated mid-lactation dairy cows were used in a repeated crossover design. The first group of four cows received total mixed ration (TMR) feed without fresh amla fruit (control group). The remaining four cows sequentially supplemented fresh amla fruit (FAF) at three levels (200, 400, then 600 g/d) (treatment group) at 14-day intervals. In second period, control and treatment groups were exchanged. The first ten days were adjusted to diet adaptation for each sub-period, and the last four days for sampling milk and blood. A total of 514 metabolites were detected from FAF using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The five main metabolites in FAF were phenolic acids (22%), flavonoids (20%), lipids (20%), amino acids and derivatives (9%), and tannins (7%). Amla fruit supplementation reduced total saturated fatty acid and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio at 200 or 400 g/d FAF dose compared to controls. In addition, amla fruit increased unsaturated FA, such as C-20:5 (Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) and C-22:6 (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA), and branched-chain FA in a dose-dependent manner at 200 or 400 g/d compared to controls. In addition, amla fruit increased the antioxidant capacity biomarkers in the blood, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and albumin; this confirms that amla fruit is an excellent antioxidant, inhibiting reactive oxygen species' (ROS) metabolism, and can thereby protect cells from oxidative stress. Moreover, the most remarkable improvement of ferric reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in milk was recorded at 400 g/d FAF doses compared to controls. Therefore, fresh amla fruit doses for lactating cows at 400 g/d on an as-fed basis can be used as an alternative additive feed in dairy cow diets to improve antioxidant capacity, protein efficiency, butter quality, and to produce more desirable milk fatty acid profiles for human consumption.

AB  - The irradiation by gamma-rays is a widely used technique for disinfection in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In view of growing concerns by consumers about this technique, further investigation of the effects of radiation is required. In this work electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was applied to study the free radicals in irradiated horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) seeds and to evaluate the free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) using the stable DPPH radical. In order to evaluate the antiradical potential, a spectrophotometric study was also used. The identification and quantification of some individual polyphenol compounds before and after irradiation by 1, 5, and 10 kGy gamma rays of peeled and shell seeds were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The EPR spectrum recorded on irradiated horse chestnut is a typical signal for irradiated cellulose-contained substances. The results show that the signal is stable, and it can be found in the samples irradiated with a dose of 1 kGy, 45 days after treatment, whereas for samples irradiated by 5 and 10 kGy, it is even found 250 days later. The study showed that free radical scavenging activity increases in shell seeds, while it decreases in peeled seed extracts after irradiation depending on the dosage, which corresponds to the total phenolic content. Shell seed extracts have significantly stronger antiradical activity than that of peeled seeds. Regarding the HPLC analysis, some polyphenolics were degraded and others were formed as a result of irradiation. The irradiation by 5 kGy dosage has a most significant positive effect on the antioxidant potential of shell chestnut seeds.

AB  - Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common disorder after general anesthesia in elderly patients, the precise mechanisms of which remain unclear. Methods: We investigated the effect of isoflurane with or without dantrolene pretreatment on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leak, calpain activity, and cognitive function using the Morris water maze test of young (3 months), middle-aged (12-13 months), and aged (24-25 months) C57BL6/J mice. Results: Aged cortical and hippocampal neurons showed chronically elevated [Ca2+](i) compared to young neurons. Furthermore, aged hippocampal neurons exhibited higher ROS production, increased LDH leak, and elevated calpain activity. Exposure to isoflurane exacerbated these markers in aged neurons, contributing to increased cognitive deficits in aged mice. Dantrolene pretreatment reduced [Ca2+](i) for all age groups and prevented or significantly mitigated the effects of isoflurane on [Ca2+](i), ROS production, LDH leak, and calpain activity in aged neurons. Dantrolene also normalized or improved age-associated cognitive deficits and mitigated the cognitive deficits caused by isoflurane. Conclusions: These findings suggest that isoflurane-induced cytotoxicity and cognitive decline in aging are linked to disruptions in neuronal intracellular processes, highlighting the reduction of [Ca2+](i) as a potential therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Not much is known about how the dentate gyrus (DG) and hippocampal CA3 networks, critical for memory and spatial processing, malfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While studies of associative memory deficits in AD have focused mainly on behavior, here, we directly measured neurophysiological network dysfunction. We asked what the pattern of deterioration of different networks is during disease progression. We investigated how the associative memory-processing capabilities in different hippocampal subfields are affected by familial AD (fAD) mutations leading to amyloid-beta dyshomeostasis. Specifically, we focused on the DG and CA3, which are known to be involved in pattern completion and separation and are susceptible to pathological alterations in AD. To identify AD-related deficits in neural-ensemble dynamics, we recorded single unit activity in wild-type (WT) and fAD model mice (APPSwe+PSEN1/Delta E9) in a novel tactile morph task, which utilizes the extremely developed somatosensory modality of mice. As expected from the sub-network regional specialization, we found that tactile changes induced lower rate map correlations in the DG than in CA3 of WT mice. This reflects DG pattern separation and CA3 pattern completion. In contrast, in fAD model mice, we observed pattern separation deficits in the DG and pattern completion deficits in CA3. This demonstration of region-dependent impairments in fAD model mice contributes to understanding of brain networks deterioration during fAD progression. Furthermore, it implies that the deterioration cannot be studied generally throughout the hippocampus but must be researched at a finer resolution of microcircuits. This opens novel systems-level approaches for analyzing AD-related neural network deficits.

AB  - Food intake influences neurofunction via the gut microbiota-brain axis. Monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) consumption is highly associated with neuroprotection; the mechanism behind the effects of olive oil and camellia oil on gut microbiota remains unclear. In this study, the objective was to compare the neuroprotective role of oleic acid-rich camellia oil and olive oil against AlCl3-induced mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in rats. Morris water maze tests revealed that learning and memory capacities improved in AlCl3-induced rats subjected to camellia oil administration better than olive oil treatment. Moreover, the results showed that the camellia oil- and olive oil-treated AlCl3-induced rat groups had significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. Notably, Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the inflammatory cytokines negatively correlated with the microbial strains (Bacteroides pectinophilus_group and Blautia) in response to camellia oil administration. Furthermore, Ruminococcaceae_UCG014 abundance was significantly enhanced by camellia oil intake, which was highly positively associated with antioxidant activity expression. In conclusion, the novel data suggest that the outcomes of camellia oil consumption were superior to those of olive oil intake as camellia oil may have a beneficial effect on MCI protection and improvement through the gut microbiota-brain communication.

AB  - Flavan-3-ols are an important class of secondary metabolites in many plants. Their bioavailability and bioactivity are largely determined by the metabolism of intestinal microbiota. However, little is known about the intestinal bacteria involved in the metabolism of flavan-3-ols and the activities of the metabolites. C-ring cleavage is the initial and key step in the metabolism of flavan-3-ol monomers. Here, we isolated a strain from porcine cecum content, which is capable of cleaving the heterocyclic C-ring to form 1-(3 ',4 '-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(2 '',4 '',6 ''-trihydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol from (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, and 1-(3 ',4 ',5 '-trihydroxyphenyl)-3-(2 '',4 '',6 ''-trihydroxyphenyl) propan-2-ol from (-)-epigallocatechin. The strain was identified as Streptococcus pasteurianus (Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. Pasteurianus, designated as F32-1) based on 16S rDNA similarity and MALDI-TOF-MS identification. The formation of the C-ring cleavage structural unit by the F32-1 strain enhanced the chemical antioxidant ability and altered the cellular antioxidant activity of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin. Overall, in this study we isolated a new intestinal bacterium involved in the C-ring cleavage of flavan-3-ol monomers and elucidated the bioactivity of their metabolites.

AB  - Background: Acidic microenvironment is a common physiological phenomenon in tumors, and is closely related to cancer development, but the effects of acidosis on pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains to be elucidated.
   Methods: Metabonomic assay and transcriptomic microarray were used to detect the changes of metabolites and gene expression profile respectively in acidosis-adapted PDAC cells. Wound healing, transwell and in vivo assay were applied to evaluate cell migration and invasion capacity. CCK8 and colony formation assays were performed to determine cell proliferation.
   Results: The acidosis-adapted PDAC cells had stronger metastasis and proliferation ability compared with the control cells. Metabonomic analysis showed that acidosis-adapted PDAC cells had both increased glucose and decreased glycolysis, implying a shift to pentose phosphate pathway. The metabolic shift further led to the inactivation of AMPK by elevating ATP. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes in acidosis-adapted cells were enriched in extracellular matrix modification and Hippo signaling. Besides, MMP1 was the most upregulated gene in acidosis-adapted cells, mediated by the YAP/TAZ pathway, but could be reduced by AMPK activator.
   Conclusion: The present study showed that metabolic reprogramming promotes proliferation and metastasis of acidosis-adapted PDAC cells by inhibiting AMPK/Hippo signaling, thus upregulating MMP1.

AB  - Although protein kinase C (PKC) regulates various biological activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, tissue remodeling, gene expression, and cell death, the antifibrotic effect of PKC in myofibroblasts is not fully understood. We investigated whether 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a PKC activator, reduced the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and explored the involvement of the Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivator YAP. We analyzed the effect of TPA on the proliferation and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in the LX-2 HSC line. We also analyzed the phosphorylation of the Hippo pathway molecules YAP and LATS1 and investigated YAP nuclear translocation. We examined whether Go 6983, a pan-PKC inhibitor, restored the TPA-inhibited activities of HSCs. Administration of TPA decreased the growth rate of LX-2 cells and inhibited the expression of alpha-SMA and collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1). In addition, TPA induced phosphorylation of PKC delta, LATS1, and YAP and inhibited the nuclear translocation of YAP compared with the control. These TPA-induced phenomena were mostly ameliorated by Go 6983. Our results indicate that PKC delta exerts an antifibrotic effect by inhibiting the Hippo pathway in HSCs. Therefore, PKC delta and YAP can be used as therapeutic targets for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.

AB  - Pumpkin has received significant attention due to its nutritional compounds that have antioxidant, antifatigue, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study is aimed at assessing the antidepressant-like effect of L. Cucurbita pepo, sweet pumpkin, in an animal model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and investigating its effect on the histological structure of hippocampus compared to fluoxetine. Forty male albino rats assigned into the negative control, positive control (CUMS), and Flu-treated and pumpkin-treated groups (n=10) were utilized in this study. Exposing rats to CUMS continued for 28 days, and treatments used were applied during the last 14 days of exposure. Behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological changes were assessed after 28 days. In this study, pumpkin significantly reduced the immobility time (p=0.02), corticosterone (p<0.001), TNF-alpha, IL-6 (p<0.001), and malondialdehyde (p=0.003), whereas it significantly increased the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in the serum of rats exposed to CUMS. Pumpkin markedly relieved the degenerative and atrophic changes observed in the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. It significantly reduced caspase-3 and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoexpression in the CA3 and DG. In conclusion, administration of pumpkin extract improved the behavioral, biochemical, and hippocampal pathological alternations induced in rats after exposure to CUMS in a comparable pattern to fluoxetine. This study highlighted the potential efficacy of pumpkin in alleviating depression disorder either alone or in conjugation with conventional antidepressant therapy.

AB  - Liver fibrosis is closely related to the proliferation and differentiation of liver progenitor cells (LPCs). Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key effector molecule of the Hippo signaling pathway and plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and liver homeostasis. However, its role in LPCs proliferation and differentiation during liver fibrosis are not well understood. Using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, quantitative PCR and Western blotting, we discovered that LPCs expansion and enhanced YAP expression in LPCs in either choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet or 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet-induced fibrotic mice, as well as in patients with liver fibrosis. By injecting adeno-associated virus vectors under the transcriptional control of Lgr5 promoter, we found that targeted knockdown of YAP in LPCs attenuated the CDE/DDC diet-induced ductular reaction and liver fibrosis. Using EdU incorporation and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, we demonstrated that YAP can modulate LPCs proliferation. Importantly, spleen transplantation of YAP-overexpressing LPCs improved their ability to differentiate into hepatocytes and alleviated carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis. Collectively, our findings indicate that LPCs expansion and differentiation during liver fibrosis could be modulated by YAP, further suggesting the possibility of manipulating YAP expression in LPCs as a potential treatment for chronic liver diseases.

AB  - Terahertz (THz) waves, a novel type of radiation with quantum and electronic properties, have attracted increasing attention for their effects on the nervous system. Spatial working memory, a critical component of higher cognitive function, is coordinated by brain regions such as the infralimbic cortex (IL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral cornu ammonis 1 (vCA1) of hippocampus. However, the regulatory effects of THz waves on spatial working memory and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the effects of 0.152 THz waves on glutamatergic neuronal activity and spatial working memory and the related mechanisms were investigated in cell, brain slice, and mouse models. Cellular experiments revealed that THz waves exposure for 60 min significantly increased the intrinsic excitability of primary hippocampal neurons, enhanced glutamatergic neuron activity, and upregulated the expression of molecules involved in glutamate metabolism. In brain slice experiments, THz waves markedly elevated neuronal activity, promoted synaptic plasticity, and increased glutamatergic synaptic transmission within the IL and vCA1 regions. Molecular dynamics simulations found that THz waves could inhibit the ion transport function of glutamate receptors. Moreover, Y-maze tests demonstrated that mice exposed to THz waves exhibited significantly improved spatial working memory. Multiomics analyses indicated that THz waves could induce changes in chromatin accessibility and increase the proportion of excitatory neurons. These findings suggested that exposure to 0.152 THz waves increased glutamatergic neuronal activity, promoted synaptic plasticity, and improved spatial working memory, potentially through modifications in chromatin accessibility and excitatory neuron proportions.

AB  - Background The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and depression is increasing year by year around the world, bringing a serious burden to patients and their families. Jiao-tai-wan (JTW), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been approved to have hypoglycemic and antidepressant effects, respectively, but whether JTW has such dual effects and its potential mechanisms is still unknown. This study is to evaluate the dual therapeutic effects of JTW on chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced DM combined with depression mice, and to explore the underlying mechanisms through network pharmacology. Methods CRS was used on db/db mice for 21 days to induce depression-like behaviors, so as to obtain the DM combined with depression mouse model. Mice were treated with 0.9% saline (0.1 ml/10 g), JTW (3.2 mg/kg) and Fluoxetine (2.0 mg/kg), respectively. The effect of JTW was accessed by measuring fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, conducting behavioral tests and observing histopathological change. The ELISA assay was used to evaluate the levels of inflammatory cytokines and the UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to determine the depression-related neurotransmitters levels in serum. The mechanism exploration of JTW against DM and depression were performed via a network pharmacological method. Results The results of blood glucose measurement showed that JTW has a therapeutic effect on db/db mice. Behavioral tests and the levels of depression-related neurotransmitters proved that JTW can effectively ameliorate depression-like symptoms in mice induced by CRS. In addition, JTW can also improve the inflammatory state and reduce the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus. According to network pharmacology, 28 active compounds and 484 corresponding targets of JTW, 1407 DM targets and 1842 depression targets were collected by screening the databases, and a total of 117 targets were obtained after taking the intersection. JTW plays a role in reducing blood glucose level and antidepressant mainly through active compounds such as quercetin, styrene, cinnamic acid, ethyl cinnamate, (R)-Canadine, palmatine and berberine, etc., the key targets of its therapeutic effect include INS, AKT1, IL-6, VEGF-A, TNF and so on, mainly involved in HIF-1 signal pathway, pathways in cancer, Hepatitis B, TNF signal pathway, PI3K-Akt signal pathway and MAPK signaling pathway, etc. Conclusion Our experimental study showed that JTW has hypoglycemic and antidepressant effects. The possible mechanism was explored by network pharmacology, reflecting the characteristics of multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway, which provides a theoretical basis for the experimental research and clinical application of JTW in the future.

AB  - Many plant-derived flavonoids are known for their anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-neurodegenerative effects. The fruits and leaves of the black currant (BC, Ribes nigrum) contain these phytochemicals with therapeutic benefits. The current study presents a report on a standardized BC gemmotherapy extract (BC-GTE) that is prepared from fresh buds. It provides details about the phytoconstituent profile specific to the extract as well as the associated antioxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory properties. The reported BC-GTE was found to contain approximately 133 phytonutrients, making it unique in its composition. Furthermore, this is the first report to quantify the presence of significant flavonoids such as luteolin, quercetin, apigenin, and kaempferol. Drosophila melanogaster-based tests revealed no cytotoxic but nutritive effects. We also demonstrated that adult male Wistar rats, pretreated with the analyzed BC-GTE and assessed after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, did not show any apparent increase in body size in the microglial cells located in the hippocampal CA1 region, while in control experiments, the activation of microglia was evident. Moreover, no elevated levels of serum-specific TNF-a were observed under the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory condition. The analyzed BC-GTE's specific flavonoid content, along with the experimental data based on an LPS-induced inflammatory model, suggest that it possesses anti-neuroinflammatory/neuroprotective properties. This indicates that the studied BC-GTE has the potential to be used as a GTE-based complementary therapeutic approach.

AB  - Navigation tasks involve the gradual selection and deployment of increasingly effective searching procedures to reach targets. The brain mechanisms underlying such complex behavior are poorly understood, but their elucidation might provide insights into the systems linking exploration and decision making in complex learning. Here, we developed a trial -by -trial goal -related search strategy analysis as mice learned to navigate identical water mazes encompassing distinct goal -related rules and monitored the strategy deployment process throughout learning. We found that navigation learning involved the following three distinct phases: an early phase during which maze -specific search strategies are deployed in a minority of trials, a second phase of preferential increasing deployment of one search strategy, and a final phase of increasing commitment to this strategy only. The three maze learning phases were affected differently by inhibition of retrosplenial cortex (RSC), dorsomedial striatum (DMS), or dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Through brain region -specific inactivation experiments and gain -of -function experiments involving activation of learningrelated cFos+ ensembles, we unraveled how goal -related strategy selection relates to deployment throughout these sequential processes. We found that RSC is critically important for search strategy selection, DMS mediates strategy deployment, and DLS ensures searching consistency throughout maze learning. Notably, activation of specific learning -related ensembles was sufficient to direct strategy selection (RSC) or strategy deployment (DMS) in a different maze. Our results establish a goal -related search strategy deployment approach to dissect unsupervised navigation learning processes and suggest that effective searching in navigation involves evidence -based goal -related strategy direction by RSC, reinforcement -modulated strategy deployment through DMS, and online guidance through DLS.

AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by immune dysregulation and skin barrier impairment. This study evaluated the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of Camellia japonica extract in a 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD mouse model using SKH-1 hairless mice. Topical application of Camellia japonica extract for four weeks significantly alleviated AD-like symptoms by reducing epidermal thickness, mast cell infiltration, and overall skin inflammation. Hematological analysis revealed a marked decrease in total white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts. Furthermore, the Camellia japonica extract significantly decreased oxidative stress, as evidenced by reduced serum reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, while enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase. Importantly, allergic response markers including serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), histamine, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), were also downregulated. At the molecular level, Camellia japonica extract suppressed the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and T helper 2 (Th2)-type cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5, while slightly upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Collectively, these findings suggest that Camellia japonica extract effectively modulates immune responses, suppresses allergic responses, attenuates oxidative stress, and promotes skin barrier recovery. Therefore, application of Camellia japonica extract holds the promising effect as a natural therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of AD-like skin conditions.

AB  - Recruitment and accumulation of reactive astrocytes around senile plaques are common pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with unclear mechanisms. Chemerin, an adipokine implicated in neuroinflammation, acts through its receptor, chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), which also functions as a receptor for amyloid beta (A beta). The impact of the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis on astrocyte migration towards A beta plaques is unknown. Here we investigated the effect of CMKLR1 on astrocyte migration around A beta deposition in APP/PS1 mice with Cmklr1 knockout (APP/PS1-Cmklr1-/-). CMKLR1-expressed astrocytes were upregulated in the cortices and hippocampi of 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Chemerin mainly co-localized with neurons, and its expression was reduced in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, compared to WT mice. CMKLR1 deficiency decreased astrocyte colocalization with A beta plaques in APP/PS1-Cmklr1-/- mice, compared to APP/PS1 mice. Activation of the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis promoted the migration of primary cultured astrocytes and U251 cells, and reduced astrocyte clustering induced by A beta 42. Mechanistic studies revealed that chemerin/CMKLR1 activation induced STING phosphorylation. Deletion of STING attenuated the promotion of the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis relative to astrocyte migration and abolished the inhibitory effect of chemerin on A beta 42-induced astrocyte clustering. These findings suggest the involvement of the chemerin/CMKLR1/STING pathway in the regulation of astrocyte migration and recruitment to A beta plaques/A beta 42.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Erigeron breviscapus is a common medicine of eight ethnic minorities, including Miao, Naxi, and Yi. As early as the Ming Dynasty (AD 1368-1644), Lanmao's Materia Medica of Southern Yunnan (AD 1436) recorded that the medicine is used for the treatment of "Zuo tan you huan." In modern pharmacological research, Erigeron breviscapus injection is the most commonly used preparation in the treatment of ischemic stroke caused by acute cerebral infarction, but its mechanism of action in the treatment of ischemic stroke is not well understood.Aim of the study: In this study, a metabonomics study based on ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) was used in investigating the effect of a traditional Chinese medicine preparation Erigeron breviscapus injection on the rat model of focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and the affinity of its main components with the targets of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.Materials and methods: This study used molecular docking technology to verify the effective binding ability of main effective components of Erigeron breviscapus injection to target proteins related to mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. This study developed a metabonomics method based on the ultra-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC Q-TOF MS) to evaluate the efficacy and study the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine preparation. With pattern recognition analysis (principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminate analysis) of urinary metabolites, a clear separation of focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model group and healthy control group was achieved.Results: Erigeron breviscapus injection can significantly reduce the area of cerebral infarction, improve tissue morphological lesion in rats, and can increase the number of Nissl bodies. It may be a promoting factor by inhibiting hippocampal nerve cell apoptosis and Bax protein expression and by exerting effects against ischemia reperfusion after the induction of apoptosis. Thus, it plays a role in brain protection. Moreover, it can considerably promote the recovery of neurological deficiency signs in advance. Meanwhile, Erigeron breviscapus decreased malondialdehyde content and T-NOS activity. Its curative effect from strong to weak order: low dose > high dose > medium dose. The representative components of Erigeron breviscapus have good affinity with the active sites of mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins. Metabolomics found that the potential biomarkers regulated by breviscapine are kynurequinolinic acid, succinylornithine, and leucine proline. It is speculated that it may participate in TRP-kynurequinolinic acid and succinylornithine-urea cycle-NO metabolic pathways.Conclusions: This paper revealed the potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways regulated by Erigeron breviscapus. It was speculated that the mechanism is related to its inhibition of mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis. Erigeron breviscapus could restore the metabolic profiles of the model animals to normal animal levels. The mechanism may be related to the potential biomarkers of quinolinic acid, succinylornithine, and leucine proline and the metabolic pathways involved. However, the exact mechanism by which Erigeron breviscapus inhibits mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis remains to be further explored.

AB  - Phyto-based foods are becoming more and more popular worldwide, and people are consuming phyto-active components for purposes other than traditional health and nutrition. The study aimed to ascertain the impact of tea polyphenols (TPs) on fish. The outcomes showed that cold-water coho salmon exhibit improved growth, feed intake, and immunity. These results are helpful in promoting the development of novel feed additives for the aquaculture industry. To evaluate the impact of nutritional tea polyphenols (TPs) on body composition, growth, biochemical markers, antioxidant capacity, and hemato-immunological levels, a ten-week feeding experiment was carried out on coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch, 180.51 +/- 0.15 g). The control group was fed a basal diet; the T1, T2, T3, and T4 groups were fed 0.005%, 0.01%, 0.02%, and 0.04% TPs, respectively. These results demonstrate that adding TPs significantly (p < 0.05) increased the coho salmon fish's weight gain (WG), relative growth rate (RGR), condition factor (CF), feed efficacy (FE), daily growth rate (DGR), and specific growth rate (SGR). There was no discernible difference in the body compositions of the treated TPs and the control group (p > 0.05). In addition, the T3 group showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in GPT, LDL, HDL, TC, and CAT. Fish given a 0.02% diet containing TPs had significantly lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in their liver; yet, the TP-treated groups had higher levels of SOD and CAT than the control (p < 0.05). The data analysis shows a significant rise in lysozyme, respiratory burst activity, bactericidal activity, and blood hematological parameters in the 0.01-0.04% TP groups. According to these findings, TPs could be a useful dietary supplement for raising the antioxidant status, growth parameters, haemato-immunological response, and whole-body composition of coho salmon fish.

AB  - A growing number of studies link dysfunction of macroautophagy/autophagy to the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Given the global importance of autophagy for homeostasis, how its dysfunction can lead to specific neurological changes is puzzling. To examine this further, we compared the global deactivation of autophagy in the adult mouse using the atg7iKO with the impact of AD-associated pathogenic changes in autophagic processing of synaptic proteins. Isolated forebrain synaptosomes, rather than total homogenates, from atg7iKO mice demonstrated accumulation of synaptic proteins, suggesting that the synapse might be a vulnerable site for protein homeostasis disruption. Moreover, the deactivation of autophagy resulted in impaired cognitive performance over time, whereas gross locomotor skills remained intact. Despite deactivation of autophagy for 6.5 weeks, changes in cognition were in the absence of cell death or synapse loss. In the symptomatic APP PSEN1 double-transgenic mouse model of AD, we found that the impairment in autophagosome maturation coupled with diminished presence of discrete synaptic proteins in autophagosomes isolated from these mice, leading to the accumulation of one of these proteins in the detergent insoluble protein fraction. This protein, SLC17A7/Vglut, also accumulated in atg7iKO mouse synaptosomes. Taken together, we conclude that synaptic autophagy plays a role in maintaining protein homeostasis, and that while decreasing autophagy interrupts normal cognitive function, the preservation of locomotion suggests that not all circuits are affected similarly. Our data suggest that the disruption of autophagic activity in AD may have relevance for the cognitive impairment in this adult-onset neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Mephedrone is a psychoactive drug that increases dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline levels in the central nervous system via interaction with transporters or monoamines. The aim of the presented study was to assess the role of the GABA-ergic system in the expression of mephedrone-induced reward. For this purpose, we conducted (a) a behavioral evaluation of the impact of baclofen (a GABA(B) receptors agonist) and GS39783 (a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(B) receptors) on the expression of mephedrone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats, (b) an ex vivo chromatographic determination of the GABA level in the hippocampi of rats subchronically treated with mephedrone and (c) an in vivo evaluation of GABA hippocampal concentration in rats subchronically administered with mephedrone using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The results show that GS39783 (but not baclofen) blocked the expression of CPP induced by (20 mg/kg of) mephedrone. The behavioral effect was consistent with chromatographic analysis, which showed that mephedrone (5 and 20 mg/kg) led to a decrease in GABA hippocampal concentration. Altogether, the presented study provides a new insight into the involvement of the GABA-ergic system in the rewarding effects of mephedrone, implying that those effects are at least partially mediated through GABA(B) receptors, which suggests their potential role as new targets for the pharmacological management of mephedrone use disorder.

AB  - Aim and objective: The purpose of the study is to determine the neuroprotective effect of capric acid on sodium valproate-induced model of autism. Methods: In this study, the effect of CA was observed in animals with single dose of valproic acid (600 mg/kg, i. p.) where the disease condition was confirmed by developmental impairment in pups. Behavioral tests that assess anxiety, depression, stereotypical and repetitive behavior, social interaction, learning and memory, and other confounding variables were performed. Subsequently, oxidative stress parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and mitochondrial complex activities in the selected brain regions were analyzed. Results: Valproic acid successfully produced autism-like symptoms from post-natal day 7 and also demonstrated impairment in social behavior, learning and memory, and anxiety and depression. Valproic acid was found to produce oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum. Treatment with capric acid produced a positive effect on the alterations with maximum effects evident at 400 mg/kg, p. o. through amelioration of behavioral as well as biochemical changes. Conclusion: The current study concluded that capric acid could act as a likely candidate for the treatment and management of autism via significant modulation of neurobehavioral parameters, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory markers.

AB  - Asthma is an inflammatory disease whose etiology remains unclear. Its characteristics encompass a wide range of clinical symptoms, inflammatory processes, and reactions to standard therapies. Plants produce a range of constitutive products and secondary metabolites that may have therapeutic abilities. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Senna obtusifolia transgenic hairy root extracts on virus-induced airway remodeling conditions. Three cell lines were incubated with extracts from transformed (SOA4) and transgenic (SOPSS2, with overexpression of the gene encoding squalene synthase 1) hairy roots of Senna obtusifolia in cell lines undergoing human rhinovirus-16 (HRV-16) infection. The effects of the extracts on the inflammatory process were determined based on the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and IFN-gamma) and total thiol content. The transgenic Senna obtusifolia root extract reduced virus-induced expression of TNF, IL-8 and IL-1 in WI-38 and NHBE cells. The SOPSS2 extract reduced IL-1 expression only in lung epithelial cells. Both tested extracts significantly increased the concentration of thiol groups in epithelial lung cells. In addition, the SOPPS2 hairy root extract yielded a positive result in the scratch test. SOA4 and SOPPS2 Senna obtusifolia hairy root extracts demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects or wound healing activity. The SOPSS2 extract had stronger biological properties, which may result from a higher content of bioactive secondary metabolites.

AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) survivors often develop long-term neurological deficits, but its long-term impact on vulnerable brain regions and neurological outcomes remains unclear. In a previous CA model with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we found reduced heme oxygenase (HO) activity in the hippocampus and cortex 14 days post-CA, suggesting its potential as a functional outcome marker. Here, we used a rat model with 6 or 8 min of CA followed by extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. While in the 6 min-CA group, 67% survived to day 14, increased mortality within 4 days resulted in only 33% survival in the 8 min group post-ROSC. All animals displayed neurological impairment assessed by daily neurologic deficit scoring (NDS). While deficits declined within the first 3-4 days in the 6 min-CA animals, the 8 min-CA group showed significantly worse neurological outcomes until day 14. Two weeks post-CA, neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative markers (HO-1, TNF-R1, Iba1, and GFAP) were elevated in the hippocampus, while HO and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex activities were reduced in all rats, indicating a decrease in anti-oxidative capacity and mitochondrial capacity for metabolizing glutamate. NDS at day 4-5 strongly correlated with the delayed CA-mediated enzymatic dysfunction determined in the hippocampus. This finding highlights this time point for identifying at-risk individuals and suggests a prolonged therapeutic intervention lasting at least until 4 days post-CA.

AB  - Teriflunomide (TFN) limits relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by reducing lymphocytic proliferation through the inhibition of the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and the subsequent modulation of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Alterations of mitochondrial function as a consequence of oxidative stress have been reported during neuroinflammation. Previously, we showed that TFN prevents alterations of mitochondrial motility caused by oxidative stress in peripheral axons. Here, we aimed to validate TFN effects on mitochondria and neuronal activity in hippocampal brain slices, in which cellular distribution and synaptic circuits are largely preserved. TFN effects on metabolism and neuronal activity were investigated by assessing oxygen partial pressure and local field potential in acute slices. Additionally, we imaged mitochondria in brain slices from the transgenic Thy1-CFP/COX8A)S2Lich/J (mitoCFP) mice using two-photon microscopy. Although TFN could not prevent oxidative stress-related depletion of ATP, it preserved oxygen consumption and neuronal activity in CNS tissue during oxidative stress. Furthermore, TFN prevented mitochondrial shortening and fragmentation of puncta-shaped and network mitochondria during oxidative stress. Regarding motility, TFN accentuated the decrease in mitochondrial displacement and increase in speed observed during oxidative stress. Importantly, these effects were not associated with neuronal viability and did not lead to axonal damage. In conclusion, during conditions of oxidative stress, TFN preserves the functionality of neurons and prevents morphological and motility alterations of mitochondria.

AB  - BT75, a boron-containing retinoid, is a novel retinoic acid receptor (RAR)alpha agonist synthesized by our group. Previous studies indicated that activation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling may attenuate progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presently, we aimed to examine the anti-inflammatory effect of BT75 and explore the possible mechanism using cultured cells and an AD mouse model. Pretreatment with BT75 (1-25 mu M) suppressed the release of nitric oxide (NO) and IL-1 beta in the culture medium of mouse microglial SIM-A9 cells activated by LPS. BMS195614, an RAR alpha antagonist, partially blocked the inhibition of NO production by BT75. Moreover, BT75 attenuated phospho-Akt and phospho-NF-kappa B p65 expression augmented by LPS. In addition, BT75 elevated arginase 1, IL-10, and CD206, and inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IL-6 formation in LPS-treated SIM-A9 cells, suggesting the promotion of M1-M2 microglial phenotypic polarization. C57BL/6 mice were injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) with streptozotocin (STZ) (3 mg/kg) to provide an AD-like mouse model. BT75 (5 mg/kg) or the vehicle was intraperitoneally (ip) injected to icv-STZ mice once a day for 3 weeks. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that GFAP-positive cells and rod or amoeboid-like Iba1-positive cells, which increased in the hippocampal fimbria of icv-STZ mice, were reduced by BT75 treatment. Western blot results showed that BT75 decreased levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), GFAP, and phosphorylated Tau, and increased levels of synaptophysin in the hippocampus of icv-STZ mice. BT75 may attenuate neuroinflammation by affecting the Akt/NF-kappa B pathway and microglial M1-M2 polarization in LPS-stimulated SIM-A9 cells. BT75 also reduced AD-like pathology including glial activation in the icv-STZ mice. Thus, BT75 may be a promising anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent worthy of further AD studies.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant cancers with high mortality. Therefore, it is of great urgency to develop new agents that could improve the prognosis of Pancreatic cancer patients. Chinese propolis (CP), a flavonoid-rich beehive product, has been reported to have an anticancer effect. In this study, we applied CP to the human Pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 to verify its impact on tumor development. CP induced apoptosis in Panc-1 cells from 12.5 mu g/mL in a time- and dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of approximately 50 mu g/mL. Apoptosis rate induced by CP was examined by Annexing FITC/PI assay. We found that 48 h treatment with 50 mu g/mL CP resulted in 34.25 +/- 3.81% apoptotic cells, as compared to 9.13 +/- 1.76% in the control group. We further discovered that the Panc-1 cells tended to be arrested at G2/M phase after CP treatment, which is considered to contribute to the anti-proliferation effect of CP. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that CP suppressed Panc-1 cell migration by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly, the Hippo pathway was activated in Panc-1 cells after CP treatment, serving as a mechanism for the anti-pancreatic cancer effect of CP. These findings provide a possibility of beehive products as an alternative treatment for pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Cisplatin (CP) is a chemotherapy agent used in the treatment of cancer, but it has various side effects, in particular, neurotoxicity. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are a potent antioxidant. However, there is limited knowledge about the protective effects of ZnO NPs against CP-induced hippocampal toxicity. The present study aimed to explore the potential protective effects of ZnO NPs against CP-induced oxidative stress, loss of neurotrophins support, and tissue damage in the hippocampus of the rats. Eighty adult male Wistar rats were dividing into ten groups including: control (Con), sham, ZnO Bulk (ZnB), chemical ZnO NPs (ChZnO NPs), Green ZnO NPs (GrZnO NPs), CP, CP + ZnB, CP + ChZnO NPs, CP + GrZnO NPs and CP + AE. CP was administrated (5 mg/kg/weekly) for four weeks, and animals were treated simultaneously with different forms of ZnO (5 mg/kg/ day). At the end of the experiment, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA), changes of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and GSH/GSSG ratio, histological changes, expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) genes were assessed in the hippocampus. The results revealed that a decrease in BDNF and NGF mRNA expression, GSH concentration and GSH/GSSG ratio, increasing of GSSG and MDA levels, and neuronal loss in the CP-treated rats were reversed following the administration of different forms of ZnO, especially Gr ZnO NPs and ch ZnO NPs. Co-administration of ZnO NPs to CP-treated rats restored the suppressive effects of CP on activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPX, CAT). The results showed that in most of the evaluated factors, Gr ZnO NPs showed a greater protective effect than other forms of ZnO. The results suggest that ZnO NPs, in particular Green ZnO NPs (GrZnO NPs) had more potential protective effects against CP-induced oxidative stress, inadequate support neurotrophin and tissue damage in rat hippocampus.

AB  - Background: Cognitive dysfunction is commonly observed in diabetic patients, yet, the underlying mechanisms are obscure and there are no approved drugs. Skeletal muscle is a key pathological organ in diabetes. Evidence is accumulating that skeletal muscle and brain communication are important for cognitive, and kynurenine (KYN) metabolism is one of the mediators.
   Purpose: This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of diabetes-induced cognitive impairment (DCI) from the perspective of skeletal muscle and brain communication, and to explore the therapeutic effect of Zi Shen Wan Fang (ZSWF, a optimized prescription consists of Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge.), Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex (Phellodendron chinense Schneid.) and Cistanches Herba (Cistanche deserticola Y.C. Ma)), in order to provide new strategies for the prevention and treatment of DCI and preliminarily explore valuable drugs.
   Methods: DCI was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) combined with a high-fat diet and treated with different dosage ZSWF extract by oral gavage for 8 weeks, once a day. Cognitive and skeletal muscle function was assessed, synaptic plasticity and L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1) was measured. KYN and its metabolites as well as metabolic enzymes in the hippocampus, peripheral blood and skeletal muscle were measured. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) were measured in skeletal muscle.
   Results: Compared with healthy mice, DCI mice not only showed decreased cognitive function and abnormal skeletal muscle function, but also showed imbalance of KYN metabolism in brain, circulating blood and skeletal muscle. Fortunately, ZSWF administration for 8 weeks notably attenuated the cognitive function, synaptic plasticity and skeletal muscle function in DCI mice. Besides, ZSWF significantly attenuated KYN metabolism in brain, circulation and skeletal muscle of DCI mice. Furthermore, ZSWF activated PGC1 alpha-PPAR alpha in skeletal muscle of DCI mice.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that abnormal PGC1 alpha-PPAR alpha signaling in skeletal muscle mediating KYN metabolism disorder is one of the pathological mechanisms of DCI, and ZSWF can reverse diabetes-induced cognitive impairment via activating skeletal muscle PGC1 alpha-PPAR alpha signaling to maintain KYN metabolism homeostasis.

AB  - Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), a mammalian homolog of the yeast kinase Atg1, has an essential role in autophagy induction. In nutrient and growth factor signaling, ULK1 activity is regulated by various posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. We previously identified glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) as an upstream regulator of insulin withdrawal-induced autophagy in adult hippocampal neural stem cells. Here, we report that following insulin withdrawal, GSK3B directly interacted with and activated ULK1 via phosphorylation of S405 and S415 within the GABARAP-interacting region. Phosphorylation of these residues facilitated the interaction of ULK1 with MAP1LC3B and GABARAPL1, while phosphorylation-defective mutants of ULK1 failed to do so and could not induce autophagy flux. Furthermore, high phosphorylation levels of ULK1 at S405 and S415 were observed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines, all of which are known to exhibit high levels of autophagy. Our results reveal the importance of GSK3B-mediated phosphorylation for ULK1 regulation and autophagy induction and potentially for tumorigenesis.
   Cell biology: Modified enzyme implicated in tumor formation Similar to cellular starvation conditions, insulin withdrawal may trigger the modification of an enzyme involved in the induction of autophagy, a key cellular recycling process. The ULK1 enzyme has a critical role in autophagy induction. Seong-Woon Yu at the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea, and co-workers investigated how ULK1 is activated under insulin withdrawal condition. They found that another enzyme called GSK3B modifies two specific ULK1 amino acids, activating ULK1 and triggering autophagy. Further, they found high levels of this type of ULK1 modification in human pancreatic cancer cell lines that exhibited increased autophagy, suggesting possible implications for the development of certain cancerous tumors.

AB  - Wilson disease (WD) is a severely autosomal genetic disorder triggered by dysregulated copper metabolism. Autophagy and apoptosis share common modulators that process cellular death. Emerging evidences suggest that Forkhead Box O1 over-expression (FoxO1-OE) aggravates abnormal autophagy and apoptosis to induce neuronal injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. Herein, the aim of this study was to investigate how regulating FoxO1 affects cellular autophagy and apoptosis to attenuate neuronal injury in a well-established WD cell model, the high concentration copper sulfate (CuSO4, HC)-triggered Atp7b(-/-) (Knockout, KO) neural stem cell (NSC) lines. The FoxO1-OE plasmid, or siRNA-FoxO1 (siFoxO1) plasmid, or empty vector plasmid was stably transfected with recombinant lentiviral vectors into HC-induced Atp7b(-/-) NSCs. Toxic effects of excess deposited copper on wild-type (WT), Atp7b(-/-) WD mouse hippocampal NSCs were tested by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Subsequently, the FoxO1 expression was evaluated by immunofluorescence (IF) assay, western blot (WB) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Meanwhile, the cell autophagy and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry (FC), TUNEL staining, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), JC-1, WB, and qRT-PCR. The current study demonstrated a strong rise in FoxO1 levels in HC-treated Atp7b(-/-) NSCs, accompanied with dysregulated autophagy and hyperactive apoptosis. Also, it was observed that cell viability was significantly decreased with the over-expressed FoxO1 in HC-treated Atp7b(-/-) WD model. As intended, silencing FoxO1 effectively inhibited abnormal autophagy in HC-treated Atp7b(-/-) NSCs, as depicted by a decline in LC3II/I, Beclin-1, ATG3, ATG7, ATG13, and ATG16, whereas simultaneously increasing P62. In addition, silencing FoxO1 suppressed apoptosis via diminishing oxidative stress (OS), and mitochondrial dysfunction in HC-induced Atp7b(-/-) NSCs. Collectively, these results clearly demonstrate the silencing FoxO1 has the neuroprotective role of suppressing aberrant cellular autophagy and apoptosis, which efficiently attenuates neuronal injury in WD.

AB  - The fundamental role of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in neuroplasticity and adaptive responses to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is gaining increased recognition. TBI-induced neurodegeneration is associated with several changes in the expression-activity of various epigenetic regulatory enzymes, including histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this study, PET/CT with 6-([F-18]trifluoroacetamido)-1- hexanoicanilide ([F-18]TFAHA) to image spatial and temporal dynamics of HDACs class IIa expression-activity in brains of adult rats subjected to a weight drop model of diffuse, non-penetrating, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The mTBI model was validated by histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of brain tissue sections for localization and magnitude of expression of heat-shock protein-70 kDa (HSP70), amyloid precursor protein (APP), cannabinoid receptor-2 (CB2), ionized calcium-binding adapter protein-1 (IBA1), histone deacetylase-4 and -5 (HDAC4 and HDAC5). In comparison to baseline, the expression-activities of HDAC4 and HDAC5 were downregulated in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, peri-3rd ventricular part of the thalamus, and substantia nigra at 1-3 days post mTBI, and remained low at 7-8 days post mTBI. Reduced levels of HDAC4 and HDAC5 expression observed in neurons of these brain regions post mTBI were associated with the reduced nuclear and neuropil levels of HDAC4 and HDAC5 with the shift to perinuclear localization of these enzymes. These results support the rationale for the development of therapeutic strategies to upregulate expression-activity of HDACs class IIa post-TBI. PET/CT (MRI) with [F-18]TFAHA can facilitate the development and clinical translation of unique therapeutic approaches to upregulate the expression and activity of HDACs class IIa enzymes in the brain after TBI.

AB  - Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a prevalent upper respiratory inflammatory disorder, remains challenging in clinical management due to the high recurrence rates. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) pathogenesis theory posits that CRS primarily stems from deficiency syndromes involving pulmonary and splenic dysfunction. Shenling Tongqiao Powder (SLTQP), a formulated herbal preparation, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in enhancing pulmonary-splenic function and CRS symptom alleviation. But its underlying pharmacological mechanisms require systematic elucidation. Methods: Nasal mucosa of nasal septum deviation and CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) patients were collected for histopathological analysis in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The rat model of CRS was established using Staphylococcus aureus while the body weight, the number of nose-scratching and sneezing were recorded. Sinus inflammation was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) scanning. Histopathological staining, Reverse Transcription Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot were applied for assessment of TGF-(31/Smad and Wnt/(3-catenin signaling and EMT in rat and cell model. Inflammatory factors of rat nasal lavage solution and serum were analyzed by ELISA. LC-MS/MS was used for analysis of SLTQP decoction and pharmaceutic serum. The energy between these molecules and TGF-(31/Smad and Wnt/(3-catenin was calculated by molecular docking, the direct binding affinity was confirmed and quantified via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Results: Histopathological analysis revealed marked EMT elevation in nasal mucosa specimens from CRSsNP patients. SLTQP administration significantly attenuated EMT progression and suppressed nasal inflammatory responses in CRS rat models, likely mediated via concurrent inhibition of TGF-(31/Smad and Wnt/(3-catenin signaling cascades. Phytochemical profiling via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) characterized both the native SLTQP decoction components and their bioactive metabolites in systemic circulation. Notably, molecular docking analyses predicted and SPR confirmed strong binding affinities between these identified compounds and critical regulatory nodes within TGF-(31/Smad and Wnt/(3-catenin, suggesting a potential multi-target therapeutic mechanism.<br /> Conclusions: Our integrated approaches firstly documented EMT dysregulation by multiple makers in CRSsNP patients, and provided novel insights into SLTQP's anti-EMT effects through dual pathway modulation, supporting its application as a complementary CRS treatment strategy.

AB  - Background: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Currently, no FDA-approved drugs are available for the treatment of VaD. Artemisia annua Linne (AA) is known to have antioxidant properties, but its effects and mechanisms of action on cognitive impairment are still unknown.
   Purpose: In this study, the improvement in cognitive impairment by AA in terms of protection against oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and preservation of the integrity of the neurovascular unit (NVU) was assessed in an animal model of VaD with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO).
   Methods: Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were allowed to adapt for four weeks, and BCCAO was induced at 12 weeks of age. The rats were randomly assigned into four groups, with seven rats in each group: sham group without BCCAO, VaD group that received oral administration of distilled water after BCCAO surgery, and two AA groups that received oral administration of 150 mg/kg or 750 mg/kg AA after BCCAO surgery for 8 weeks. Nine weeks after BCCAO surgery, the cognitive function of the rats was evaluated and accumulated oxidative stress was assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Damage to the components of the NVU was evaluated, and sirtuin (Sirt) 1 and 2 expression and nuclear factor-erythrocyte 2-associated factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein1 (Keap1) activation were investigated to assess the reduction in cell signaling and antioxidant pathways.
   Results: BCCAO-induced cerebral perfusion decreased memory function and induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. But AA treatment mitigated cognitive impairment and reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. AA extracts activated the Nrf2/Keap1/activating antioxidant response elements pathway and maintained Sirt 1 and 2, subsequently leading to the maintenance of neurons, improved construct of microvessels, increased platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 associated with the blood-brain barrier integrity.
   Conclusion: AA is effective in alleviating BCCAO-induced cognitive decline and its administration may be a useful therapeutic approach for VaD.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) is considered the cellular basis of learning and memory. Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) are neuromodulation tools for regulating LTP. However, the temporal effects of short-term ELF-EMF stimulation on LTP are not yet known. In this study, we evaluated the time-dependent effects of 15 Hz/2 mT ELF-EMF stimulation on LTP at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) synapses in Sprague-Dawley rats. Hippocampal slices were exposed to three different modes of ELF-EMFs (sinusoidal, single-frequency pulse, and rhythm pulse) and durations (10, 20, 40, and 60 s). The baseline was recorded for 20 min and field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) was recorded for 60 min using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) after plasticity induction using 100 Hz electrical high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Compared to the control group, the LTP decreased under three different magnetic fields and was proportional to time; that is, the longer the time, the greater the inhibition. We also compared the three magnetic fields and showed that the continuous sinusoidal magnetic field had the largest inhibitory rate of LTP, while pulsed and rhythm pulsed magnetic fields were similar. We showed that different modes of ELF-EMF stimulation had a time-dependent effect on LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, which provides experimental evidence for the treatment of related neurological diseases.

AB  - Cholestasis is a bile flow reduction that is induced following Bile Duct Ligation (BDL). Cholestasis impairs memory and induces apoptosis. Apoptosis consists of two pathways: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic pathway is modulated by BCL-2 (B cell lymphoma-2) family proteins. BCL-2 (a pro-survival BCL-2 protein) has anti-apoptotic effect, while BAD (BCL-2-associated death) and BAX (BCL-2-associated X), the other members of BCL-2 family have pro-apoptotic effect. Furthermore, TFAM (mitochondrial transcriptional factor A) is involved in transcription and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA and PGC-1 alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha) is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. On the other hand, NeuroAid is a Traditional Chinese Medicine with neuroprotective and anti-apoptosis effects. In this study, we evaluated the effect of cholestasis on spatial memory and expression of BCL-2, BAD, BAX, TFAM, and PGC-1 alpha in the hippocampus of rats. Additionally, we assessed the effect of NeuroAid on cholestasis-induced cognitive and genetic alterations. Cholestasis was induced by BDL surgery and NeuroAid was injected intraperitoneal at the dose of 0.4 mg/kg. Furthermore, spatial memory was evaluated using Morris Water Maze (MWM) apparatus. The results showed cholestasis impaired spatial memory, increased the expression of BAD and BAX, decreased the expression of TFAM and PGC-1 alpha, and did not alter the expression of BCL-2. Also, NeuroAid decreased the expression of BAD and BAX and increased the expression of TFAM, PGC-1 alpha, and BCL-2. In conclusion, cholestasis impaired spatial memory and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. Also, cholestasis decreased the expression of TFAM and PGC-1 alpha. Interestingly, NeuroAid restored the effects of cholestasis.

AB  - Background: A type of gastric mucosal injury disease known as gastric ulcer (GU) is clearly connected to the aberrant release of gastric acid. Traditional botanicals have the potential for anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, and other multitarget therapies, as well as being safe.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential effects of Xiangshao Decoction (XST) on gastric mucosal injury in GU rats and to explore the possible molecular mechanisms.
   Methods: After identifying XST and its components, we established GU rats and cell models by acetic acid and H2O2 induction, respectively. SOD and MDA indexes in gastric tissues and GES-1 cells, and the serum levels of BDNF, ALT, and AST were detected with relevant kits, changes of the gastric mucosa were observed and recorded, and gastric tissue pathology was observed by H&E staining. The production of ROS in GES-1 cells was detected by fluorescent probes. Cell transfection techniques were used to silence or overexpress NRF2. The mRNA or protein expressions of NRF2, KEAP1, NQO1, HO-1, SOD2, IL-1 ss, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IBA1, GFAP, or gamma-H2AX in the gastric tissue, hippocampus, or GES-1 cells were measured via qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, or immunohistochemical staining.
   Results: The pH of gastric acid, ulcer score, and pathological damage score in GU rats could be reversed by XST administration. Expressions of IL-1 ss, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in the gastric mucosal tissues and the hippocampus of GU rats after administration of XST were down. Expressions of NRF2, NQO1, HO-1, SOD2, etc. in the gastric mucosal tissues and BDNF in the hippocampus were up-regulated. The production of ROS and MDA and the expressions of IL-1 ss, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and KEAP1 in H2O2-induced GES-1 cells were significantly reduced after XST intervention, while the activities of SOD and the expression of NRF2, NQO1, HO-1, and SOD2 were significantly increased, and these could be blocked by silencing NRF2 expression.
   Conclusions: XST can improve oxidative stress injury and inflammatory response in GU rats and cell models, and its mechanism is mediated by the NRF2 signaling pathway.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia may share common pathogenic factors such as atherosclerosis and hyperlipoproteinemia. Dyslipidemia-induced oxidative stress contributes to dementia comorbidity in CVD. Abelmoschus esculentus (AE, okra) potentiates in alleviating hyperlipidemia and diabetes-related cognitive impairment. This study evaluated the effects of AE in hyperlipidemic ApoE(-/-) mice treated with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) and fed a high-fat diet (17% lard oil, 1.2% cholesterol). AE fractions F1 or F2 (0.65 mg/kg) were administered for 8 weeks. AE significantly reduced serum LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, and glucose, improved cognitive and memory function, and protected hippocampal neurons. AE also lowered oxidative stress markers (8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG) and modulated neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and doublecortin (DCX) expression. In vitro, AE promoted neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation in retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells under metabolic stress (glucose and palmitate), alongside the upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These findings suggest AE may counter cognitive decline via oxidative stress regulation and the enhancement of neuronal differentiation.

AB  - Neural stem and progenitor cell (NSPC) depletion may play a crucial role in the cognitive impairment observed in many age-related non-communicable diseases. Insulin resistance affects brain functions through a plethora of mechanisms that remain poorly understood. In an experimental model of insulin resistant NSPCs, we identified a novel molecular circuit relying on insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/ Forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling cascade and inhibiting the recruitment of transcription factors FoxO1 and FoxO3a on the promoters of genes regulating proliferation and self-renewal. Insulin resistance also epigenetically increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) and accelerated NSPC senescence. Of note, we found that stimulation of NSPCs with NSPC-derived exosomes (exo-NSPC) rescued IRS-1/FoxO activation and counteracted both the reduced proliferation and senescence of stem cells. Accordingly, intranasal administration of exo-NSPC counteracted the high-fat diet-dependent impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice by restoring the balance between proliferating and senescent NSPCs in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism underlying the metabolic control of NSPC fate potentially involved in the detrimental effects of metabolic disorders on brain plasticity. In addition, our data highlight the role of extracellular vesicle-mediated signals in the regulation of cell fate within the adult neurogenic niche.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Huangxiong Formula (HXF) is composed of four herbs: Rheum palmatum L., Ligusticum striatum DC., Curcuma aromatica Salisb., and Acorus gramineus Aiton. HXF is clinically used for the treatment of ischemic stroke (IS). However, its molecular mechanism remains unclear.
   Aim of the study: A network pharmacology-based strategy combined with experimental study in vivo and in vitro to were used to investigate the bioactive components, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms of HXF in the treatment of IS.
   Materials and methods: The components of HXF were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). The potential active ingredients of HXF were acquired from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and literature, and corresponding targets were discerned through the Swiss TargetPrediction database. IS-related targets were obtained from Genecards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), and DisGeNET. The intersection of ingredient and disease targets was screened, and a herbal-compound-target network was constructed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Based on these analyses, we established compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) network. A cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) animal model was established, and the cerebral protective effect of HXF was assessed. The accuracy of the predicted targets was verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Hippocampal neuronal injury cell model induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) was used to evaluate the protective effect of alpha-Asarone. Furthermore, molecular docking, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay, and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) were performed to verify whether alpha-Asarone can bind to PI3K.
   Results: A total of 44 active ingredients and 795 gene targets were identified through network pharmacology. Network analysis showed that naringenin, eupatin, kaempferol, and alpha-Asarone were possible drug candidates. SRC, AKT1, TP53, MAPK3, STAT3, HRAS, CTNNB1, EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1 could serve as potential drug targets. KEGG analysis implied that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway might play an important role in treating IS by HXF. Moreover, HXF significantly reduced neurological impairment, cerebral infarct volume, brain index, and brain histopathological damage in I/R rats. The mRNA expression of the top 10 potential targets was verified in the brain tissue. The C-T-P network and UPLC analysis suggested that alpha-Asarone might be an important component of HXF and can inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis in HT22 cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Molecular docking, DARTS, and CETSA assay analysis confirmed that there were direct interactions between alpha-Asarone and PI3K.
   Conclusion: HXF had a therapeutic effect in IS with multi-component, multi-target, and multi-approach features. alpha-Asarone, identified as one of the major active components of HXF, could alleviate oxidative stress and apoptosis by targeting PI3K/AKT pathway.

AB  - The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) provides multisensory information to the hippocampus, directly to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. LEC neurons perform important functions for episodic memory processing, coding for contextually salient elements of an environment or experience. However, we know little about the functional circuit interactions between the LEC and the hippocampus. We combine functional circuit mapping and computational modeling to examine how long-range glutamatergic LEC projections modulate compartment-specific excitation-inhibition dynamics in hippocampal area CA1. We demonstrate that glutamatergic LEC inputs can drive local dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons, aided by the recruitment of a disinhibitory VIP interneuron microcircuit. Our circuit mapping and modeling further reveal that LEC inputs also recruit CCK interneurons that may act as strong suppressors of dendritic spikes. These results highlight a cortically driven GABAergic microcircuit mechanism that gates nonlinear dendritic computations, which may support compartment-specific coding of multisensory contextual features within the hippocampus.

AB  - Glutamate acts at eight metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor subtypes expressed in a partially overlapping fashion in distinct brain circuits. Recent evidence indicates that specific mGlu receptor protomers can heterodimerize and that these heterodimers can exhibit different pharmacology when compared to their homodimeric counterparts. Group III mGlu agonist-induced suppression of evoked excitatory potentials and induction of long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) synapses in the rodent hippocampus can be blocked by the selective mGlu(7) negative allosteric modulator (NAM), ADX71743. Curiously, a different mGlu(7) NAM, 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-3-pyridin-4-ylisoxazo nolo[4,5-c]pyridin-4(5H)-one, failed to block these responses in brain slices despite its robust activity at mGlu(7) homodimers in vitro. We hypothesized that this might result from heterodimerization of mGlu(7) with another mGlu receptor protomer and focused on mGlu(8) as a candidate given the reported effects of mGlu(8)-targeted compounds in the hippocampus. Here, we used complemented donor acceptor-resonance energy transfer to study mGlu(7/8) heterodimer activation in vitro and observed that ADX71743 blocked responses of both mGlu(7/7) homodimers and mGlu(7/8) heterodimers, whereas 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-3-pyridin4-ylisoxazonolo[4,5-c]pyridin-4(5H)-one only antagonized responses of mGlu(7/7) homodimers. Taken together with our electrophysiology observations, these results suggest that a receptor with pharmacology consistent with an mGlu(7/8) heterodimer modulates the activity of SC-CA1 synapses. Building on this hypothesis, we identified two additional structurally related mGlu(7) NAMs that also differ in their activity at mGlu(7/8) heterodimers, in a manner consistent with their ability to inhibit synaptic transmission and plasticity at SC-CA1. Thus, we propose that mGlu(7/8) heterodimers are a key molecular target for modulating the activity of hippocampal SC-CA1 synapses.

AB  - Brain aging is associated with alterations in the behavioral capacity to process information, dueto mechanisms that are still largely unclear. Short-term neuronal activity dynamics are basic properties of local brain networks profoundly involved in neural information processing. In this study, we investigated the properties of short-term changes in excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal excitation in the CA1 field of dorsal and ventral hippocampal slices from young adult and old rats. We found that short-term synaptic plasticity (i.e. short-term dynamics of input to CA1 circuit) does not significantly differ between young and old dorsal or ventral hippocampus. However, short-term dynamics of hippocampal output differ markedly between young and old rats. Notably, age-dependent alterations in short-term neuronal dynamics were detected mainly in the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, the dorsal hippocampus of young rats can detect and facilitate transmission of 1-30 Hz input and depress transmission of higher-frequency input. In contrast, the old dorsal hippocampus appears unable to transmit information in a frequency-dependent discriminatory manner. Furthermore, the amplification of steady-state output at frequencies < 40 Hz is considerably lower in the old than the young dorsal hippocampus. The old ventral hippocampus did not show major alterations in short-term processing of neural information, though under conditions of intense afferent activation, neuronal output of the ventral hippocampus is depressed at steady-state more in old than in young rats. These results suggest that aging is accompanied by alterations in neural information processing mainly in the dorsal hippocampus, which displays a narrower dynamic range of frequency-dependent transient changes in neuronal activity in old compared with young adult rats. These alterations in short-term dynamics may relate to deficits in processing ongoing activity seen in old individuals.

AB  - Remembering familiar versus novel stimuli is fundamental to survival, but it is compromised in several neurodegenerative disorders where aging is a key factor. Although the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been suggested to be implicated in memory maintenance, the mechanistic and behavioral roles of ECM during the aging process remain unclear. Here, we employed an accelerated mouse model of aging to elucidate the causal link between ECM dynamics and recognition memory during aging. Aged mice exhibited impaired social and non-social recognition memory, accompanied by increased intensity of perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized ECM structures in the hippocampal dorsal CA2 (dCA2). A reduction in the power of theta oscillations (3-7 Hz) in the dCA2 of aged mice was also observed. Notably, selective degradation of PNNs in the dCA2 using chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) rescued recognition memory deficits and restored theta oscillations. Together, our findings identify abnormal PNN in the CA2 as a critical factor for age-related deficits in hippocampal-dependent recognition memory and network rhythmicity. These insights raise the possibility that targeting CA2 PNNs could facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to address age-associated cognitive frailty.

AB  - Introduction: Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in tissue injury and repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury and varies by sex. Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a cytokine released by macrophages during inflammation and is upregulated after brain ischemia. We examined the impact of GDF-15 knockout (KO) on volume loss and the combined microglia/macrophage response in the Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal HI injury. Methods: Male and female wild-type (WT) Gdf15(+/+), heterozygous Gdf15(nuGFP-CE/+) (Het), and homozygous Gdf15(nuGFP-CE/nuGFP-CE) (KO) mice were bred at the University of Pittsburgh. Postnatal day 9-11 mice were randomized to sham procedure or unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% O-2 for 25 min. Pups were subsequently genotyped and survived for 14 days before sacrifice. Lesion volume and number of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive cells were quantified. Results: Injured male KO pups had decreased hemispheric and hippocampal lesion volume versus injured male WT pups. Injured male Het pups demonstrated an intermediate phenotype. In males, the number of Iba-1-positive cells correlated with extent of tissue loss. In females, the extent of volume loss and Iba-1 cell counts post-injury did not vary by genotype. Conclusion: GDF-15 exerts a sex-dependent deleterious effect on lesion volume in a neonatal HI model. Future work should identify how GDF-15 mediates different neuroinflammatory responses between sexes, establish if brain-secreted versus peripherally derived GDF-15 mediates the pro-injury phenotype that was inhibited in male KOs, and test if therapeutic inhibition of GDF-15 signaling is a novel treatment for neonatal HI brain injury.

AB  - The Southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) has been kept in European zoos since the 1960s. However, captive breeding success has been low, with social group composition, group size, and available space all playing a role. Female rhinoceroses that have never bred or not bred for a long time have a particularly increased risk of developing reproductive tract pathologies, often resulting in infertility at a young age. One management measure to stimulate breeding is to transfer non-reproducing animals to other zoos. This study evaluated the success of transfers of 4-28 years old white rhinoceroses between European zoos. We analyzed n = 90 (45 males and 45 females) transfers of white rhinoceroses between 1990 and 2018. Fecal progesterone metabolite levels were analyzed for a subset of female rhinoceroses. The success of a transfer was defined as a calf born within five years. The success rate after female transfers was 26.7%; however, when the age limit of transferred females is set at 18 years, the success rate was 44.4%. The success rate after a male transfer was 23.2%. In transferred females, 83% of births occurred within three years after a transfer. Births following the arrival of a new male were distributed over five years. After a male transfer, endocrine data were determined in 26 of 82 females affected by the transfer. Positive development of estrous cycle activity after the arrival of the new bull occurred in 13 females. In summary, the success of the transfers in terms of offspring birth and endocrine stimulation of cycle activity was lower than anticipated, and sometimes a considerable amount of time elapsed before a calf was born. Nonetheless, transfers are essential to promote breeding. The relatively low success of the transfers analyzed in this study relates to the partially advanced age of the white rhinoceroses studied. Transfers of juvenile or adolescent females currently conducted between European zoos reveal a better birth rate than the present study.

AB  - Human agents build models of their environment, which enable them to anticipate and plan upcoming events. However, little is known about the properties of such predictive models. Recently, it has been proposed that hippocampal representations take the form of a predictive map-like structure, the so-called successor representation (SR). Here, we used human functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe whether activity in the early visual cortex (V1) and hippocampus adhere to the postulated properties of the SR after visual sequence learning. Participants were exposed to an arbitrary spatiotemporal sequence consisting of four items (A-B-C-D). We found that after repeated exposure to the sequence, merely presenting single sequence items (e.g., - B - -) resulted in V1 activation at the successor locations of the full sequence (e.g., C-D), but not at the predecessor locations (e.g., A). This highlights that visual representations are skewed toward future states, in line with the SR. Similar results were also found in the hippocampus. Moreover, the hippocampus developed a coactivation profile that showed sensitivity to the temporal distance in sequence space, with fading representations for sequence events in the more distant past and future. V1, in contrast, showed a coactivation profile that was only sensitive to spatial distance in stimulus space. Taken together, these results provide empirical evidence for the proposition that both visual and hippocampal cortex represent a predictive map of the visual world akin to the SR.

AB  - Camelid heavy-chain antibody variable domains (VHH), nanobodies, are the smallest-known functional antibody fragments with high therapeutic potential. In this study, we investigate a VHH binding to hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL). We structurally and dynamically characterized the conformational diversity of four VHH variants to elucidate the antigen-binding process. For two of these antibodies, not only are the dissociation constants known, but also the experimentally determined crystal structures of the VHH in complex with HEL are available. We performed well-tempered metadynamics simulations in combination with molecular dynamics simulations to capture a broad conformational space and to reconstruct the thermodynamics and kinetics of conformational transitions in the antigen-binding site, the paratope. By kinetically characterizing the loop movements of the paratope, we found that, with an increase in affinity, the state populations shift towards the binding competent conformation. The contacts contributing to antigen binding, and those who contribute to the overall stability, show a clear trend towards less variable but more intense contacts. Additionally, these investigated nanobodies clearly follow the conformational selection paradigm, as the binding competent conformation pre-exists within the structural ensembles without the presence of the antigen.

AB  - Strigolactones (SLs) are known to regulate plant architecture formation, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) responses, and secondary metabolism, but their effects in tea plants remain unclear. We demonstrated that the application of a bioactive SL analogue GR24 either to tea roots or leaves initially stimulated but later inhibited catechins, theanine, and caffeine biosynthesis. GR24 treatment also promoted the accumulation of flavonols and insoluble proanthocyanidins in a time- and dose-dependent manner. GR24 influenced flavonoid and theanine biosynthesis genes, such as up-regulating CsTT2c, CsMYB12, and CsbZIP1, modulating N-responsive and assimilation genes (CsNRT1,1, CsGSI/TS1, CsHRS1, CsPHR1, CsNLA1, and CsLBD37/38/39), and repressing N/P transport and signaling genes (CsPHO2, CsPHT1s, CsNRT2,2, CsHHO1, and CsWRKY38). GR24-induced changes in secondary metabolites were also observed in the leaves of tea plants. GR24-regulated CsLBD37a interacted with CsTT8a and CsTT2c, repressing catechins biosynthesis by interrupting MBW complex formation. GR24 regulated caffeine biosynthesis and regulator genes CsS40 and CsNAC7 and may thereby suppress caffeine production. GR24 altered the transcriptomic profiles of multiple hormone biosynthesis and signaling genes that potentially regulate tea characteristic metabolism and N/P signaling. This study provides new insights into SL-induced transcriptional reprogramming that leads to changes in N/P nutrition, secondary metabolism, and hormone signaling in tea plants.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-ss (A ss) which ultimately forms plaques. These A ss deposits can be induced in APP transgenic mouse models by prion-like seeding. It has been widely accepted that anosmia and hyposmia occur during the early stages of AD, even before cognitive deficits are present. In order to determine the impact of seed-induced A ss deposits on olfaction, we performed intracerebral injections of seed-competent brain homogenate into the olfactory bulb of young pre-depositing APP transgenic mice. Remarkably, we observed a dramatic olfactory impairment in those mice. Furthermore, the number of newborn neurons as well as the activity of cells in the mitral cell layer was decreased. Notably, exposure to an enriched environment reduced A ss seeding, vivified neurogenesis and most importantly reversed olfactory deficits. Based on our findings, we conclude that altered neuronal function as a result of induced A ss pathology might contribute to olfactory dysfunction in AD.

AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is a major clinical problem that lacks effective treatments. The sensory innervation in porous vertebral endplates and anxiety contributes to spinal hyperalgesia. We hypothesized that SIRT1 activator resveratrol alleviates LBP and anxiety via promotion of osteogenesis in the porous endplates. The hyperalgesia and anxiety-related behaviors; sensory innervation, inflammation and porosity of endplates; and osteogenic/osteoclastic factors expression were measured following resveratrol treatment after lumbar spine instability (LSI) surgery. To explore whether resveratrol promotes endplates osteogenesis and thus alleviates LBP through activation of SIRT1 in the osteoprogenitor cells of endplates, SIRT1(OSX)(-/-) mice were employed. Additionally, the levels of inflammation markers, phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus were evaluated. After 4 or 8 weeks LSI surgery, the mice suffered from hyperalgesia and anxiety, which were efficiently attenuated by resveratrol at 8 weeks. Resveratrol treatment-enhanced osteogenesis and decreased endplates porosities accompanied with the reduction of TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, and COX2 levels and CGRP+ nerve fibers innervation in porous endplates. Resveratrol-mediated endplates osteogenesis, decreased endplates porosities, and analgesic and antianxiety effects were abrogated in SIRT1(OSX)(-/-) mice. Furthermore, resveratrol relieved inflammation and increased pCREB and BDNF expression in the hippocampus after 8 weeks, which alleviate anxiety-related behaviors. This study provides that resveratrol-mediated porous endplates osteogenesis via the activation of SIRT1 markedly blocked sensory innervation and inflammation in endplates, therefore, alleviating LSI surgery-induced LBP and hippocampus-related anxiety.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are known to influence hippocampal function, but their rapid non-genomic effects on specific neurons in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit remain underexplored. This study investigated the immediate effects of glucocorticoids on CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, and dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons in rats using the patch-clamp technique. We found that a 5 min extracellular application of corticosterone significantly reduced action potential firing frequency in CA1 pyramidal neurons, while no effects were observed in CA3 or DG neurons. The corticosterone-induced inhibition in CA1 was blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist CORT125281, but remained unaffected by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone. Notably, membrane-impermeable bovine serum albumin-conjugated dexamethasone mimicked corticosterone's effects on CA1 neurons, which exhibited prominent hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel currents. Pyramidal neurons in CA3 and granular neurons in the DG showed little HCN channel currents. Corticosterone enhanced HCN channel activity in CA1 neurons via glucocorticoid receptors, and the HCN channel inhibitor ZD7288 abolished corticosterone's suppressive effects on action potentials. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids selectively inhibit CA1 pyramidal neuron activity through HCN channels, providing new insight into the mechanisms of glucocorticoid action in hippocampal circuits.

AB  - Decades of work propose that hippocampal activity supports internal representation of learned experiences and contexts, allowing individuals to form long-term memories and quickly adapt behavior to changing environments. However, recent studies insinuate hippocampal representations can drift over time, raising the question: how could the hippocampus hold stable memories when activity of its neuronal maps fluctuates? We hypothesized that task-dependent hippocampal maps set by learning rules and structured attention stabilize as a function of behavioral performance. To test this, we imaged hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons during learning and memory recall phases of a new task where mice use odor cues to navigate between two reward zones. Across learning, both orthogonal and overlapping task-dependent place maps form rapidly, discriminating trial context with strong correlation to behavioral performance. Once formed, task-selective place maps show increased long-term stability during memory recall phases. We conclude that memory demand and attention stabilize hippocampal activity to maintain contextually rich spatial representations.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is long-lasting changes in synaptic currents and structure. When neurons are exposed to signals that induce aberrant neuronal excitation, they increase the threshold for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), known as metaplasticity. However, the metaplastic regulation of structural LTP (sLTP) remains unclear. We investigate glutamate uncaging/photoactivatable (pa)CaMKII-dependent sLTP induction in hippocampal CA1 neurons after chronic neuronal excitation by GABAA receptor antagonists. We find that the neuronal excitation decreases the glutamate uncaging-evoked Ca2+ influx mediated by GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and suppresses sLTP induction. In addition, single-spine optogenetic stimulation using paCaMKII indicates the suppression of CaMKII signaling. While the inhibition of Ca2+ influx is protein synthesis independent, the paCaMKII-induced sLTP suppression depends on it. Our findings demonstrate that chronic neuronal excitation suppresses sLTP in two independent ways (i.e., dual inhibition of Ca2+ influx and CaMKII signaling). This dual inhibition mechanism may contribute to robust neuronal protection in excitable environments.

AB  - Activity-dependent GABAergic synapse plasticity is important for normal brain functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that Npas4 (neuronal PAS-domain protein 4) transcriptionally regulates the expression of IQSEC3, a GABAergic synapse-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF-GEF) that directly interacts with gephyrin. Neuronal activation by an enriched environment induces Npas4-mediated upregulation of IQSEC3 protein specifically in CA1 stratum oriens layer somatostatin (SST)-expressing GABAergic interneurons. SST+ interneuron-specific knockout (KO) of Npas4 compromises synaptic transmission in these GABAergic interneurons, increases neuronal activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and reduces anxiety behavior, all of which are normalized by the expression of wild-type IQSEC3, but not a dominant-negative ARF-GEF-inactive mutant, in SST+ interneurons of Npas4-KO mice. Our results suggest that IQSEC3 is a key GABAergic synapse component that is directed by Npas4 and ARF activity, specifically in SST+ interneurons, to orchestrate excitation-to-inhibition balance and control anxiety-like behavior.

AB  - A deep neural network model predicts theta oscillations in the mouse hippocampal CA1 area based on in vivo membrane potentials of as few as three pyramidal cells.
   Theta (theta) oscillations are one of the characteristic local field potentials (LFPs) in the hippocampus that emerge during spatial navigation, exploratory sniffing, and rapid eye movement sleep. LFPs are thought to summarize multineuronal events, including synaptic currents and action potentials. However, no in vivo study to date has directly interrelated theta oscillations with the membrane potentials (Vm) of multiple neurons, and it remains unclear whether LFPs can be predicted from multineuronal Vms. Here, we simultaneously patch-clamp up to three CA1 pyramidal neurons in awake or anesthetized mice and find that the temporal evolution of the power and frequency of theta oscillations in Vms (theta(Vm)s) are weakly but significantly correlate with LFP theta oscillations (theta(LFP)) such that a deep neural network could predict the theta(LFP) waveforms based on the theta(Vm) traces of three neurons. Therefore, individual neurons are loosely interdependent to ensure freedom of activity, but they partially share information to collectively produce theta(LFP).

AB  - BACKGROUND Epilepsy is a prevalent chronic neurological disorder affecting 50 million individuals globally, with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) being the most common form. Despite advances in antiepileptic drug development, over 30% of patients suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy, which can lead to severe cognitive impairments and adverse psychosocial outcomes. AIM To explore the role of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomal miR-203 in the regulation of neuroinflammation in a mouse model of epilepsy, providing a theoretical basis for the development of targeted microRNA delivery therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS Adult male C57BL/6 mice were divided into a control group and a TLE model of 30 mice each, and the TLE model group was established by injecting kainic acid. BMSCs were isolated from the mice, and exosomes were purified using ultracentrifugation. Exosomal miR-203 was identified and characterized using high-throughput sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The uptake of exosomes by hippocampal neurons and the subsequent effects on neuroinflammatory markers were assessed using in vitro cell culture models. RESULTS Exosomal miR-203 exhibited a significant upregulation in BMSCs derived from epileptic mice. In vitro investigations demonstrated the efficient internalization of these exosomes by hippocampal neurons, resulting in downregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression and activation of the nuclear factor kappaB pathway, ultimately leading to enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION Our study identifies exosomal miR-203 as a key regulator of neuroinflammation in a mouse model of epilepsy. The findings suggest that targeting miR-203 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for epilepsy by modulating the suppression of cytokine signaling 3/nuclear factor kappaB pathway, thus providing a potential avenue for the development of cell-free therapeutics.

AB  - Epileptic networks are characterized as having two states, seizures or more prolonged interictal periods. However, cellular mechanisms underlying the contribution of interictal periods to ictal events remain unclear. Here, we use an activity-dependent labeling technique combined with genetically encoded effectors to characterize and manipulate neuronal ensembles recruited by focal seizures (FS-Ens) and interictal periods (IP-Ens) in piriform cortex, a region that plays a key role in seizure generation. Ca2+ activities and histological evidence reveal a disjointed correlation between the two ensembles during FS dynamics. Optogenetic acti-vation of FS-Ens promotes further seizure development, while IP-Ens protects against it. Interestingly, both ensembles are functionally involved in generalized seizures (GS) due to circuit rearrangement. IP-Ens bidirec-tionally modulates FS but not GS by controlling coherence with hippocampus. This study indicates that the interictal state may represent a seizure-preventing environment, and the interictal-activated ensemble may serve as a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy.

AB  - Recent mechanistic studies have indicated that combinations of radiotherapy (RT) plus immunotherapy (via CSF-1R inhibition) can serve as a strategy to overcome RT resistance and improve the survival of glioma mice. Given the high mortality rate for glioma, including low-grade glioma (LGG) patients, it is of critical importance to investigate the mechanism of the combination of RT and immunotherapy and further translate the mechanism from mouse studies to improve survival of RT-treated human glioma patients. Using the RNA-seq data from a glioma mouse study, 874 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the group of RT-treated mice at glioma recurrence and the group of mice with combination treatment (RT plus CSF-1R inhibition) were translated to the human genome to identify significant molecular pathways using the KEGG enrichment analysis. The enrichment analysis yields statistically significant signaling pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, Hippo pathway, and Notch pathway. Within each pathway, a candidate gene set was selected by Cox regression models as genetic biomarkers for resistance to RT and response to the combination of RT plus immunotherapies. Each Cox model is trained using a cohort of 295 RT-treated LGG patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and validated using a cohort of 127 RT-treated LGG patients from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database. A four-DEG signature (ITGB8, COL9A3, TGFB2, JAG1) was identified from the significant genes within the three pathways and yielded the area under time-dependent ROC curve AUC = 0.86 for 5-year survival in the validation set, which indicates that the selected DEGs have strong prognostic value and are potential intervention targets for combination therapies. These findings may facilitate future trial designs for developing combination therapies for glioma patients.

AB  - In mammalian axon-carrying-dendrite (AcD) neurons, the axon emanates from a basal dendrite, instead of the soma, to create a privileged route for action potential generation at the axon initial segment (AIS). However, it is unclear how such unusual morphology is established and whether the structure and function of the AIS in AcD neurons are preserved. By using dissociated hippocampal cultures as a model, we show that the development of AcD morphology can occur prior to synaptogenesis and independently of the in vivo environment. A single precursor neurite first gives rise to the axon and then to the AcD. The AIS possesses a similar cytoskeletal architecture as the soma-derived AIS and similarly functions as a trafficking barrier to retain axon-specific molecular composition. However, it does not undergo homeostatic plasticity, contains lesser cisternal organelles, and receives fewer inhibitory inputs. Our findings reveal insights into AcD neuron biology and underscore AIS structural differences based on axon onset.

AB  - Objectives: Investigate the role of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in radioresistant Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Establishment of radioresistant CNE-1 cells (CNE-1-RR) by gradually increasing ionizing radi-ation (IR) doses, and identifying the apoptosis of CNE-1-RR by flow cytometry. We employed immu-noblot and immunofluorescence staining to detect the expression of YAP in both CNE-1-RR and control group cells. Moreover, we validated the role of YAP in CNE-1-RR by inhibiting its nuclear translocation. Results: In contrast to the control group, radioresistant NPC cells demonstrated significant YAP dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. CNE-1-RR cells exhibited enhanced activation of g-H2AX (Ser139) upon exposure to IR and greater recruitment of double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair-related proteins. Additionally, inhibiting YAP nuclear translocation in radioresistant CNE-1-RR cells signifi-cantly increased their sensitivity to radiotherapy. Conclusions: The present investigation has unveiled the intricate mechanisms and physiological roles of YAP in CNE-1-RR cells exhibiting resistance to IR. Based on our findings, it can be inferred that a combinational therapeutic strategy involving radiotherapy and inhibitors that impede the nuclear translocation of YAP holds promising potential for treating radioresistant NPC. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Toxic amyloid beta (A beta) species cause synaptic dysfunction and neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). As of yet, however, there are no reported regulators for gamma-secretase, which links a risky environment to amyloid accumulation in AD. Here, we report that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a positive regulator of gamma-secretase under hypoxia. From a genome-wide functional screen, we identify PKM2 as a gamma-secretase activator that is highly expressed in the brains of both patients and murine models with AD. PKM2 regulates A beta production and the amount of active gamma-secretase complex by changing the gene expression of aph-1 homolog. Hypoxia induces PKM2 expression, thereby promoting gamma-secretase activity. Moreover, transgenic expression of PKM2 in 3xTg AD model mice enhances hippocampal production of A beta and exacerbates the impairment of spatial and recognition memory. Taken together, these findings indicate that PKM2 is an important gamma-secretase regulator that promotes AO production and memory impairment under hypoxia.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is one of the postulated mechanisms for Pb neurotoxicity. However, the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for its pro-inflammatory effect are not fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the role of glial cells in neuroinflammation induced by Pb exposure. We investigated how microglia, a type of glial cell, responded to the changes caused by perinatal exposure to Pb by measuring the expression of Iba1 at the mRNA and protein levels. To assess the state of microglia, we analyzed the mRNA levels of specific markers associated with the cytotoxic M1 phenotype (Il1b, Il6, and Tnfa) and the cytoprotective M2 phenotype (Arg1, Chi3l1, Mrc1, Fcgr1a, Sphk1, and Tgfb1). Additionally, we measured the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, and TNF-& alpha;). To assess the reactivity and functionality status of astrocytes, we analyzed the GFAP (mRNA expression and protein concentration) as well as glutamine synthase (GS) protein level and activity. Using an electron microscope, we assessed ultrastructural abnormalities in the examined brain structures (forebrain cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus). In addition, we measured the mRNA levels of Cxcl1 and Cxcl2, and their receptor, Cxcr2. Our data showed that perinatal exposure to Pb at low doses affected both microglia and astrocyte cells' status (their mobilization, activation, function, and changes in gene expression profile) in a brain-structure-specific manner. The results suggest that both microglia and astrocytes represent a potential target for Pb neurotoxicity, thus being key mediators of neuroinflammation and further neuropathology evoked by Pb poisoning during perinatal brain development.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies. Vasorin (VASN) has been reported to be critical in tumor development and angiogenesis. However, VASN has not been reported in CRC, and its role is unclear. In this study, VASN expression is upregulated in CRC compared with the normal tissues, and VASN expression positively correlates with N stage and poor overall survival by analysis of different datasets and 32 CRC clinicopathologic samples. Overexpression of VASN significantly promotes CRC cell progression, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while knockdown of VASN inhibits CRC progression. We found that VASN was associated with the YAP/TAZ and PI3K/AKT pathways by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene ontology (GO) analysis. Notably, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and co-immunofluorescence (co-IP) confirmed that VASN could interact with YAP and activate the YAP/TAZ and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways, and knockdown of YAP reversed this effect. Importantly, our findings indicate that VASN interacts with YAP to inhibit YAP phosphorylation and stimulates CRC proliferation, migration, and invasion through activation of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD target gene CTGF and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways. Our results also show that knockdown of YAP reverses the cellular phenotype induced by increased VASN. In conclusion, our study reveals that VASN acts as an oncogene to stimulate tumor progression in CRC, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of CRC development and representing a possible novel biomarker for CRC.

AB  - Sea buckthorn is a promising ingredient for the food industry because it is a good source of vitamins, polyphenols, phytosterols, etc. In this research, it is the first time that aqueous extracts of lyophilized sea buckthorn (LSB) 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% w/w were used to enrich set-type yogurts. Therefore, fermentation kinetics, hardness, color, titratable acidity, syneresis, water holding capacity, total phenolic content microstructure, and sensory analysis were investigated. Extracts of lyophilized sea buckthorn shorten the yogurt fermentation time, change the microstructure, reduce syneresis, and increase water-holding capacity compared to plain yogurt. Also, the titratable acidity for all yogurts remained the same but the total phenolic content of yogurts increased as the concentration of extracts from lyophilized sea buckthorn increased. The color parameters of the fortified set-type yogurts were affected by the color of the sea buckthorn extract with increasing a* and b* values according to extract concentrations. Finally, yogurts fortified with 0.5% and 1.0% w/w extracts of LSB have good quality characteristics, increased total phenolic content, and higher scores of being liked compared to the rest of the enriched samples. This study could increase the knowledge of the uses of aqueous extracts of lyophilized sea buckthorn in dairy products.

AB  - The accumulation of amyloid plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which ADAM10, the alpha-secretase that catalyzes APP and facilitates the non-amyloidogenesis pathway, plays an important role. We have previously reported that the expression of copine-7 (Cpne7) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice is significantly upregulated by nicotine, whereas the potential role of CPNE7 in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we report that CPNE7 protein levels are significantly decreased in APP/PS1 mice and HEK293 cells stably expressing full-length APP. CPNE7 is shown to reduce A beta levels by favoring ADAM10 activity, and the elevated ADAM10 protein by CPNE7 involves a translational mechanism. Further transcriptome profiling reveals that CPNE7 differentially regulates genes associated with neuronal function. Among these, cyclase-associated actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein 1 (CAP1) is identified as a target gene of CPNE7, which controls ADAM10 translation through binding to the 5 ' untranslated region (5 ' UTR). Collectively, the CPNE7-CAP1 axis could be critical in the amyloidogenic pathway by regulating ADAM10 translation, in which the RNA binding activity of CAP1 is highlighted.image

AB  - Members of the Camelidae have unique adaptive immunological features that are not widely observed in other species. All camelids are known to have three distinct IgG isotypes - IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3. While IgG1 has a conventional antibody structure, both IgG2 and IgG3 are devoid of light chains and instead possess hypervariable regions in their heavy chain (VHH), while lacking the typical CH1 domain found in heavy chains. VHH domains are increasingly being utilized as "next generation" antibodies, as they have unique biochemical and structural properties including high pH stability as well as a lower molecular weight allowing for increased tissue penetration. These features of VHH domains offer a number of advantages for both biotechnology and clinical applications and are commonly termed "nanobodies". A second unique aspect of the camelid adaptive response is involves T cell-mediated immunity. Characterization of gamma delta (gamma delta) T cells in camelid species has found they use somatic hypermutation in their T cell receptor gamma (TRG) and delta (TRD) loci to increase the structural stability of their gamma delta T receptor. The use of somatic hyper mutation to increase the diversity of their T cell repertoire, is a feature that has not been observed in other mammalian species. In addition, in alpacas there is a unique subset of. d T cells called V gamma 9V delta 2 T cells. Activation of these cells is dependent upon phosphoantigen (PAg)-mediated interaction with B7-like butyrophilin molecules (BTN-3). This makes alpacas the first species outside of primates to be identified with this unique subset and activation mechanism. Here we review some fundamentals of camelid adaptive immunity that make them distinct from other vertebrate species and their potential applications to human therapies.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VD) is a common disease among elderly individuals that results in cognitive dysfunction. Although pharmaceutical treatments are used to temporarily improve the symptoms, these have side effects, including mental disorders and epilepsy. Therefore, identifying therapeutic strategies for VD which limit side effects would be advantageous. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of VD. As the major saponin type of Panax ginseng, Ginsenoside Re, exerts anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation effects, Re may have a therapeutic role in the management of VD. Our aim was to evaluate this potential therapeutic role of Re in a rat model of VD. We compared mitochondria' function in hippocampal neurons in groups with or without Re administration. Our findings show that Re administration can reverse the effects of VD on mitochondrial structure and function in hippocampal neurons, including protecting against a reduction in the number of mitochondria and preventing mitochondrial vacuolization. The relative expression levels of COX IV and PDH-A1 also increased after Re treatment, with a reduction in mitochondrial H2O2 production, in a time-and dose-dependent manner. These improvements in mitochondrial function protected against VD-associated cognitive dysfunction, measured by performance in a Morris water maze. Based on these findings, we concluded that Ginsenoside Re may ameliorate cognitive impairment in VD by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative stress in the brain. Collectively, we provide valuable experimental data which could inform the development of safe and effective drugs for the management of VD from ischemia.

AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Loss of full-length dystrophins is both necessary and sufficient to initiate DMD. These isoforms are expressed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex (Dp427c), and cerebellar Purkinje cells (Dp427p). However, our understanding of the consequences of their absence, which is crucial for developing targeted interventions, remains inadequate. We combined RNA sequencing with genome-scale metabolic modelling (GSMM), immunodetection, and mitochondrial assays to investigate dystrophic alterations in the brains of the mdx mouse model of DMD. The cerebra and cerebella were analysed separately to discern the roles of Dp427c and Dp427p, respectively. Investigating these regions at 10 days (10d) and 10 weeks (10w) followed the evolution of abnormalities from development to early adulthood. These time points also encompass periods before onset and during muscle inflammation, enabling assessment of the potential damage caused by inflammatory mediators crossing the dystrophic blood-brain barrier. For the first time, we demonstrated that transcriptomic and functional dystrophic alterations are unique to the cerebra and cerebella and vary substantially between 10d and 10w. The common anomalies involved altered numbers of retained introns and spliced exons across mdx transcripts, corresponding with alterations in the mRNA processing pathways. Abnormalities in the cerebra were significantly more pronounced in younger mice. The top enriched pathways included those related to metabolism, mRNA processing, and neuronal development. GSMM indicated dysregulation of glucose metabolism, which corresponded with GLUT1 protein downregulation. The cerebellar dystrophic transcriptome, while significantly altered, showed an opposite trajectory to that of the cerebra, with few changes identified at 10 days. These late defects are specific and indicate an impact on the functional maturation of the cerebella that occurs postnatally. Although no classical neuroinflammation markers or microglial activation were detected at 10 weeks, specific differences indicate that inflammation impacts DMD brains. Importantly, some dystrophic alterations occur late and may therefore be amenable to therapeutic intervention, offering potential avenues for mitigating DMD-related neuropsychiatric defects.

AB  - There is a lack of evidence on the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) microcycle duration on the antioxidant capacity and hippocampal inflammatory response of young (immature) samples. This study compared two HIIT microcycles lengths on adaptation to training, antioxidant balance, and systemic and hippocampal inflammation in immature rats. Twenty-four immature Wistar rats (27 days) were equally divided into groups: control; 4-day HIIT (3 training days + 1 rest day); and 7-day HIIT (6 training days + 1 rest day). Both microcycles of 4 and 7 days were 28 days of training (37-38 m min(-1)). Running performance improved in all training groups compared to controls (P < 0.05). However, the 7-day HIIT group statistically increased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to the control and 4-day HIIT groups (P < 0.05). The total serum antioxidant capacity in the 7-day HIIT group was statistically lower than in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference for the analysis of serum malondialdehyde between the groups. The hippocampal gene expression of IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the training groups was statistically higher than in the control group (P = 0.01), with no significant difference between the 4-day HIIT and 7-day HIIT groups. We concluded that HIIT microcycles with a longer duration decrease the antioxidant capacity and increase the systematic and hippocampal inflammation. Thus, we suggest using short HIIT microcycles for young (immature) groups due to improved running performance with less inflammatory and antioxidant changes.

AB  - Accumulation of misfolded proteins or perturbation of calcium homeostasis leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, understanding the ability of neuronal cells to cope with chronic ER stress is of fundamental interest. Interestingly, several brain areas uphold functions that enable them to resist challenges associated with neurodegeneration. Here, we established novel clonal mouse hippocampal (HT22) cell lines that are resistant to prolonged (chronic) ER stress induced by thapsigargin (TgR) or tunicamycin (TmR) as in vitro models to study the adaption to ER stress. Morphologically, we observed a significant increase in vesicular und autophagosomal structures in both resistant lines and 'giant lysosomes', especially striking in TgR cells. While autophagic activity increased under ER stress, lysosomal function appeared slightly impaired; in both cell lines, we observed enhanced ER-phagy. However, proteomic analyses revealed that various protein clusters and signaling pathways were differentially regulated in TgR versus TmR cells in response to chronic ER stress. Additionally, bioenergetic analyses in both resistant cell lines showed a shift toward aerobic glycolysis ('Warburg effect') and a defective complex I of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery. Furthermore, ER stress-resistant cells differentially activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) comprising IRE1 alpha and ATF6 pathways. These findings display the wide portfolio of adaptive responses of neuronal cells to chronic ER stress. ER stress-resistant neuronal cells could be the basis to uncover molecular modulators of adaptation, resistance, and neuroprotection as potential pharmacological targets for preventing neurodegeneration.

AB  - Human stem cells and derivatives transplantation are widely used to treat nervous system diseases, while the fate determination of transplanted cells is not well elucidated. To explore cell fate changes of human brain organoids before and after transplantation, human brain organoids are transplanted into prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP), respectively. Single-cell sequencing is then performed. According to time-series sample comparison, transplanted cells mainly undergo neural development at 2 months post-transplantation (MPT) and then glial development at 4MPT, respectively. A different brain region sample comparison shows that organoids grafted to PFC have obtained cell fate close to those of host cells in PFC, other than HIP, which may be regulated by the abundant expression of dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (Ach) in PFC. Meanwhile, morphological complexity of human astrocyte grafts is greater in PFC than in HIP. DA and Ach both activate the calcium activity and increase morphological complexity of astrocytes in vitro. This study demonstrates that human brain organoids receive host niche factor regulation after transplantation, resulting in the alignment of grafted cell fate with implanted brain regions, which may contribute to a better understanding of cell transplantation and regenerative medicine.
   Grafted human brain organoids in the host brain keep forebrain cell fate following intrinsic expression patterns similar to fetal brain tissue. Grafted organoids undergo neural and astrocytic differentiation successively. Young human cells acquire properties similar to the brain regions after grafting. Neurotransmitters enhance the activity and morphological complexity of astrocytes in organoids. image

AB  - Existing literature suggests that infection-specific mechanisms may play a significant role in the onset and progression of dementia, as opposed to the broader phenomenon of systemic inflammation. In addition, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors have been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for sepsis, given their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We investigated the neuroprotective effect of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (simvastatin) by analyzing neurodegenerative markers, mitochondrial respiration, and neuronal tracing in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) of sepsis survivor animals. Adult Wistar rats were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture or left non-manipulated. The animals were treated with simvastatin or vehicle for 4 days before and 10 days after surgery. The treatment preserved the non-associative memory (P < 0.05), recovered expression of Smad-3 in the hippocampus (P < 0.05), and prevented increased expression of calpain-1 (hippocampus: P < 0.0001; PFC: P < 0.05) and GSK beta (hippocampus: P < 0.0001; PFC: P < 0.0001) in the brain structures of the sepsis survivor animals. These animals also showed mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased axon terminals in the RE. Simvastatin seems to restore energy metabolism by improving the electron transfer system (ETS) values in the hippocampus (P < 0.01) and the oxidative phosphorylation/ETS (P/E) ratio in the PFC (P < 0.05), in addition to preventing the reduction of axon terminals in survivor animals. These results suggest a potential neuroprotective effect and the importance of considering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors as a possible adjuvant therapy in sepsis.

AB  - Excitotoxicity caused by excessive concentration of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate causes neuronal cell death and promotes neurodegenerative disorders. The neuroexcitant neurotoxin kainic acid (KA) induces excitotoxicity, leading to neuronal death via oxidative stress and inflammation, and its experimental use is widespread. This study was designed to determine the protective effect of Troxerutin (TXR) and its relationship with Galectin-3 (Gal-3) in experimental excitotoxicity with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n = 10): Control group rats received intraperitoneal (ip) normal saline for 6 days. Sham group rats received a single dose of intracerebroventricular (icv) normal saline on the first day. KA group rats were treated with a single dose of KA; icv-0.5 mu g/mu l). TXR group rats treated with TXR for 6 days: ip-100 mg/kg) and KA + TXR group rats treated with KA (single dose) and TXR (6 days). It was observed that malondialdehyde (MDA) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) levels increased and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels decreased in the cerebral cortex of rats with KA neurotoxicity. TXR treatment caused a significant improvement in MDA and GSH levels and a significant decrease in IL-1 beta levels in rats with the excitotoxicity model. Gal-3 expressions in the hippocampus and cerebellum increased in KA-treated rats, whereas TXR treatment decreased Gal-3 expressions. In addition, histopathological changes caused by KA administration showed improvement in TXR-treated groups. In conclusion, the findings showed that TXR treatment attenuated KA-induced neurotoxicity by reducing oxidative tissue damage, inflammatory response and Gal-3 expression.

AB  - Prenatal stress can negatively impact neonatal health, growth, and bonding with the mother. However, molecular basis of these modifications is not completely understood. The aim of this experimental study was to test the hypothesis that intrauterine stress exposure may contribute to subsequent depression-like comorbidities associated with neuroinflammation. Wistar Albino nulliparous female rats were divided into two groups (each, n = 6): controls and pregnancy stress (Days 1 through 21). Two live rat pups (one female and one male) from each term delivery were randomly selected, and depression-like behavior tests were performed on Postpartum Days 30-34, followed by euthanasia on Day 35. NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) pathway gene expressions in the hippocampus and immunohistochemical caspase 3 (cas-3), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) staining in the temporal and prefrontal cortices were evaluated. Compared with controls, exposure to prenatal stress was associated with increased depression and anxiety-like behavior, hippocampal NLRP3 inflammasome activation (p = 0.022 and p = 0.035 for female and male pups, respectively), neuronal degeneration and increased cas-3, mTOR, and TRPM immunostaining in the prefrontal and temporal cortices of both female and male offspring (p < 0.05 for all comparisons except p < 0.01 for cas-3 in the male cortex and female temporal cortex). Exposure to antenatal stress can lead to depression-like behavior in the infant, mainly driven by hippocampal NLRP3 inflammasome activation, cortical neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Future perspectives include NLRP3-targeted therapies with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects against adverse prenatal effects of maternal stress.

AB  - When the total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity of sea buckthorn juice were assayed by spectrophotometry, the reaction solutions were not clarified, so centrifugation or membrane treatment was needed before determination. In order to find a suitable method for determining TPC and antioxidant activity, the effects of centrifugation and nylon membrane treatment on the determination of TPC and antioxidant activity in sea buckthorn juice were studied. TPC was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau method, and antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. For Treatment Method (C): the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was taken for analysis. Method (CF): The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm, filtered by Nylon 66 filtration membranes with pore size of 0.22 mu m, and taken for analysis. Method (F): the sample was filtered by Nylon 66 filtration membranes with pore size of 0.22 mu m and taken for analysis. Method (N): after the sample of ultrasonic extract solution reacted completely with the assay system, the reaction solution was filtered by Nylon 66 filtration membranes with pore size of 0.22 mu m and colorimetric determination was performed. The results showed that centrifugation or transmembrane treatment could affect the determination of TPC and antioxidant activity of sea buckthorn juice. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between methods (CF) and (F), while there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between methods (C) (F) (N) or (C) (CF) (N). The TPC and antioxidant activity of sea buckthorn juice determined by the four treatment methods showed the same trend with fermentation time, and the TPC and antioxidant activity showed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05). The highest TPC or antioxidant activity measured by method (N) indicates that method (N) has the least loss of TPC or antioxidant activity, and it is recommended for sample assays.

AB  - Blocking of programmed death protein 1 ( PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1 with corresponding antibody to enhance T-cell response and mediate antitumor activity has been successfully applied in clinical practice. Several immune checkpoint inhibitors including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting PD-1 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in cancer immunotherapy. However, the application of traditional antibodies has limited due to their drawbacks of large molecular weight (MW) and low tissue penetration. As the high specificity and strong tissue penetration of nanobodies (Nbs), efforts have been taken to develop Nbs for cancer therapy. Herein, we aim to screen a specific Nb against human PD-1 derived from a naive camel Nb phage display library and further study its biological characteristic and antitumor activity. Finally, an anti-PD-1 Nb with high specificity and affinity was screened and generated, its cytotoxicity and antitumor effect was also confirmed in vitro and in vivo. All of these indicate that the anti-PD-1 Nb may provide an alternative and appealing therapeutic agent for cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - Purpose: Many proteins in tripartite motif (TRIM) family have been reported to play an important role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study was designed to investigate the effect of TRIM14 on the cerebral I/R injury in rats.
   Methods: The rat model was constructed through inserting thread into the middle cerebral artery. The expression of TRIM14 was measured by qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. The hippocampal sections were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to determine infarct volume and used for measuring the neurologic deficit score and brain water content. The H&E staining was used for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The number of apoptotic cells was measured by fluorescence microscopy. The levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha were detected by qRT-PCR and ELISA. The swimming speed, latency time, and number of platform crossings were measured by the water maze test.
   Results: TRIM14 was significantly enhanced in rats with cerebral I/R injury compared to Sham rats, showing its highest level at 24 h after I/R. TRIM14 inhibition reduced ischemic brain injury, suppressed neuron apoptosis, suppressed inflammation, and improved cognitive dysfunction in rats with cerebral I/R injury. TRIM14 inhibition also suppressed the activation of NF-kappa B/NLRP3 pathway in rats with cerebral I/R injury.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, the expression of TRIM14 was increased in rats with cerebral I/R injury, the protective effect of TRIM14 inhibitor on cerebral I/R injury in rats depends on its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect. The underlying mechanism was, at least partially, through regulating NF-kappa B/NLRP3 pathway.

AB  - Objective: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a severe and common complication of sepsis and can induce cognitive dysfunction and apoptosis of neurons and neuroinflammation. Emodin has been confirmed to have anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, we sought to investigate the role of Emodin in SAE. Methods: The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method was used for the establishment of SAE in mice model. For treatment of Emodin, intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg Emodin was performed before the surgery. The Morris water maze and open field tests were carried for measurement of cognitive dysfunction. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was for histological analysis of hippocampus. Cell apoptosis of hippocampus neurons was measured by TUNEL staining. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus tissue homogenate were evaluated by ELISA. BDNF/TrkB signaling-related proteins (TrkB, p-TrkB, and BDNF), autophagy-related proteins (LC3 II/I and Beclin-1), and apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3) were detected by Western blotting. Results: Emodin significantly inhibited apoptosis and induced autophagy in hippocampal neurons of CLP-treated mice. In addition, Emodin significantly ameliorated CLP-induced cognitive dysfunction and pathological injury in mice. Meanwhile, Emodin notably inhibited CLP-induced inflammatory responses in mice via upregulation of BDNF/TrkB signaling, while the effect of Emodin was partially reversed in the presence of K252a (BDNF/TrkB signaling inhibitor). Conclusion: Emodin significantly inhibited the progression of SAE via mediation of BDNF/TrkB signaling. Thus, Emodin might serve as a new agent for SAE treatment.

AB  - CaMKII has molecular memory functions because transient calcium ion stimuli can induce long-lasting increases in its synaptic localization and calcium ion-independent (autonomous) activity, thereby leaving memory traces of calcium ion stimuli beyond their duration. The synaptic effects of two mechanisms that induce CaMKII autonomy are well studied: autophosphorylation at threonine-286 and binding to GluN2B. Here, we examined the neuronal functions of additional autonomy mechanisms: nitrosylation and oxidation of the CaMKII regulatory domain. We generated a knock-in mouse line with mutations that render the CaMKII regulatory domain nitrosylation/oxidation-incompetent, CaMKII & UDelta;SNO, and found that it had deficits in memory and synaptic plasticity that were similar to those in aged wild-type mice. In addition, similar to aged wild-type mice, in which CaMKII was hyponitrosylated, but unlike mice with impairments of other CaMKII autonomy mechanisms, CaMKII & UDelta;SNO mice showed reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) when induced by theta-burst stimulation but not high-frequency stimulation (HFS). As in aged wild-type mice, the HFS-LTP in the young adult CaMKII & UDelta;SNO mice required L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channels. The effects in aged mice were likely caused by the loss of nitrosylation because no decline in CaMKII oxidation was detected. In hippocampal neurons, nitrosylation of CaMKII induced its accumulation at synapses under basal conditions in a manner mediated by GluN2B binding, like after LTP stimuli. However, LTP-induced synaptic CaMKII accumulation did not require nitrosylation. Thus, an aging-associated decrease in CaMKII nitrosylation may cause impairments by chronic synaptic effects, such as the decrease in basal synaptic CaMKII.

AB  - Senile plaque formation as a consequence of amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) aggregation constitutes one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This pathology is characterized by synaptic alterations and cognitive impairment. In order to either prevent or revert it, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed, and some of them are focused on diet modification. Modification of the omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids (FA) ratio in diets has been proven to affect A beta production and senile plaque formation in the hippocampus and cortex of female transgenic (TG) mice. In these diets, linoleic acid is the main contribution of omega-6 FA, whereas alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) are the contributors of omega-3 FA. In the present work, we have explored the effect of omega-6/omega-3 ratio modifications in the diets of male double-transgenic APPswe/PS1 & UDelta;E9 (AD model) and wild-type mice (WT). Amyloid burden in the hippocampus increased in parallel with the increase in dietary omega-6/omega-3 ratio in TG male mice. In addition, there was a modification in the brain lipid profile proportional to the omega-6/omega-3 ratio of the diet. In particular, the higher the omega-6/omega-3 ratio, the lower the ceramides and higher the FAs, particularly docosatetraenoic acid. Modifications to the cortex lipid profile was mostly similar between TG and WT mice, except for gangliosides (higher levels in TG mice) and some ceramide species (lower levels in TG mice).</p>

AB  - Background: Jiaohong pills (JHP) consist of Pericarpium Zanthoxyli (PZ) and Radix Rehmanniae, two herbs that have been extensively investigated over many years due to their potential protective effects against cognitive decline and memory impairment. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects remain elusive. Here, research studies were conducted to investigate and validate the therapeutic effects of JHP on Alzheimer's disease.Methods: BV-2 cell inflammation was induced by lipopolysaccharide. AD mice were administered amyloid-beta (A beta). Behavioral experiments were used to evaluate learning and memory ability. The levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the phosphorylation level of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) were detected using Western blot. Nissl staining was used to detect neuronal degeneration.Results: The results demonstrated that an alcoholic extract of PZ significantly decreased the levels of NO, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and iNOS; increased the expression level of IL-10; and significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of MAPK and NF-kappa B. These inhibitory effects were further confirmed in the AD mouse model. Meanwhile, JHP improved learning and memory function in AD mice, reduced neuronal damage, and enriched the Nissl bodies in the hippocampus. Moreover, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in the cortex were significantly downregulated after JHP administration, whereas IL-10 showed increased expression.Conclusions: It was found that JHP reduced neuroinflammatory response in AD mice by targeting the MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - S-Sulfocysteine (SSC) is a metabolite derived from the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. It has been implicated in neurotoxicity observed in children with sulfite oxidase deficiency. The aim of our study was to confirm the neurotoxic effects of SSC using a mouse hippocampal cell line (HT-22) and to investigate the role of apoptosis in these effects, especially in terms of caspase-3 activation and genotoxicity. Based on the viability graph obtained following increasing concentrations of SSC, we determined the LC50 dose of SSC to be 125 mu M by probit analysis. The cytotoxic effects of SSC were not reversed by glutamate receptor blocker administration. However, SSC treatment did not induce caspase-3 activation or induce DNA damage. Our results showed that SSC has a cytotoxic effect on neurons like glutamate, but glutamate receptor blockers reversed glutamate-induced toxicity, while these blockers did not protect neurons from SSC toxicity. The absence of caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation, which are indicative of apoptosis, in SSC-induced cell death suggests that alternative cell death pathways, such as necrosis and oxytosis may be implicated. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate SSC-induced cell death. The aim of our study was to confirm the neurotoxic effects of SSC using a mouse hippocampal cell line (HT-22) and to investigate the role of apoptosis in these effects, especially in terms of caspase-3 activation and genotoxicity.

AB  - Increased ATP release and its extracellular catabolism through CD73 (ecto-5 '-nucleotidase) lead to the overactivation of adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), which occurs in different brain disorders. A2AR blockade blunts mood and memory dysfunction caused by repeated stress, but it is unknown if increased ATP release coupled to CD73-mediated formation of extracellular adenosine is responsible for A2AR overactivation upon repeated stress. This was now investigated in adult rats subject to repeated stress for 14 consecutive days. Frontocortical and hippocampal synaptosomes from stressed rats displayed an increased release of ATP upon depolarization, coupled to an increased density of vesicular nucleotide transporters and of CD73. The continuous intracerebroventricular delivery of the CD73 inhibitor alpha,beta-methylene ADP (AOPCP, 100 mu M) during restraint stress attenuated mood and memory dysfunction. Slice electrophysiological recordings showed that restraint stress decreased long-term potentiation both in prefrontocortical layer II/III-layer V synapses and in hippocampal Schaffer fibers-CA1 pyramid synapses, which was prevented by AOPCP, an effect occluded by adenosine deaminase and by the A2AR antagonist SCH58261. These results indicate that increased synaptic ATP release coupled to CD73-mediated formation of extracellular adenosine contributes to mood and memory dysfunction triggered by repeated restraint stress. This prompts considering interventions decreasing ATP release and CD73 activity as novel strategies to mitigate the burden of repeated stress.

AB  - As the most common degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis (OA) contributes significantly to pain and disability during aging. Several genes of interest involved in articular cartilage damage in OA have been identified. However, the direct causes of OA are poorly understood. Evaluating the public human RNA-seq dataset showed that CBFB (subunit of a heterodimeric Cbf beta/Runx1, Runx2, or Runx3 complex) expression is decreased in the cartilage of patients with OA. Here, we found that the chondrocyte-specific deletion of Cbfb in tamoxifen-induced Cbfb(f/f);Col2a1-CreER(T) mice caused a spontaneous OA phenotype, worn articular cartilage, increased inflammation, and osteophytes. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that Cbf beta deficiency in articular cartilage resulted in reduced cartilage regeneration, increased canonical Wnt signaling and inflammatory response, and decreased Hippo/Yap signaling and Tgf beta signaling. Immunostaining and western blot validated these RNA-seq analysis results. ACLT surgery-induced OA decreased Cbf beta and Yap expression and increased active beta-catenin expression in articular cartilage, while local AAV-mediated Cbfb overexpression promoted Yap expression and diminished active beta-catenin expression in OA lesions. Remarkably, AAV-mediated Cbfb overexpression in knee joints of mice with OA showed the significant protective effect of Cbf beta on articular cartilage in the ACLT OA mouse model. Overall, this study, using loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, uncovered that low expression of Cbf beta may be the cause of OA. Moreover, Local admission of Cbfb may rescue and protect OA through decreasing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and increasing Hippo/Yap signaling and Tgf beta/Smad2/3 signaling in OA articular cartilage, indicating that local Cbfb overexpression could be an effective strategy for treatment of OA.

AB  - Excitatory synapses are typically described as single synaptic boutons (SSBs), where one presynaptic bou-ton contacts a single postsynaptic spine. Using serial section block-face scanning electron microscopy, we found that this textbook definition of the synapse does not fully apply to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Roughly half of all excitatory synapses in the stratum oriens involved multi-synaptic boutons (MSBs), where a single presynaptic bouton containing multiple active zones contacted many postsynaptic spines (from 2 to 7) on the basal dendrites of different cells. The fraction of MSBs increased during development (from postnatal day 22 [P22] to P100) and decreased with distance from the soma. Curiously, synaptic properties such as active zone (AZ) or postsynaptic density (PSD) size exhibited less within-MSB variation when compared with neighboring SSBs, features that were confirmed by super-resolution light microscopy. Computer sim-ulations suggest that these properties favor synchronous activity in CA1 networks.

AB  - Cerebral microinfarcts (CMIs) are characterized by sporadic obstruction of small vessels leading to neurons death. They are associated with increased risk of cognitive impairments and may have different risk factors compared with macroinfarcts. CMIs have a high incidence and result in heavy social burden; thus, it is essential to provide reasonable treatment in clinical practice. However, there are relatively few researches on the mechanism and treatment of CMIs, and the literature is composed almost exclusively of community-or hospital based on autopsy or imageological studies focusing on elderly patients. The Bu Yang Huan Wu (BYHW) decoction, a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has long been used to treat stroke and stroke-related diseases, including cognitive impairments. We applied microsphere-induced CMI model in rats to investigate the behavioral and molecular consequences of CMIs and to determine how they were ameliorated by BYHW decoction treatment. We then used the Morris water maze, quantitative proteomics, immunohistochemistry, and other molecular assays and found that activation of the PKA/CREB pathway by BYHW decoction treatment may reverse mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibit apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, and ameliorate CMI-induced cognitive impairments in rats. Collectively, these findings confirmed the therapeutic potential of the BYHW decoction in treating cognitive impairments induced by CMIs and demonstrated a viable mechanism for its action.

AB  - Simple Summary Semen quality in ostriches is still being studied to optimize the reproductive performance of these birds in a commercial farming environment. Various methods such as mass sperm motility scoring and computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) technology have been employed successfully to evaluate semen quality characteristics such as sperm motility. The relationship between these methods in assessing sperm motility in ostriches is unknown. This study evaluated the relationship between the CASA and the mass sperm motility scoring method when analyzing ostrich sperm motility. Positive significant correlations between these methods for sperm motility traits were recorded, suggesting that farmers could utilize the affordable mass sperm motility scoring to screen ostrich males for sperm quality. Semen analyses have gained momentum in various livestock industries. However, in farmed ostriches, semen analysis is still in its experimental stage, and males are not screened for sperm quality before breeding. This study investigated the correlations between computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) technology and the traditional, yet affordable, mass sperm motility score. Semen was collected from nine South African Black ostrich males (mean age +/- SD: 5.25 +/- 1.21 years), using the dummy female method for 5 consecutive days monthly, for 8 months. Mass sperm motility scores were recorded on a scale of 1-5 (1: little to no sperm movement; 5: rapid sperm movement). The CASA traits recorded were: total motility (MOT), progressive motility (PMOT), curve-linear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), linearity (LIN), straightness (STR), wobble (WOB), and beat-cross frequency (BCF). The results revealed positive correlations between mass sperm motility and PMOT, MOT, VCL, and VAP ranging from 0.34 to 0.59 (p < 0.0001). In contrast, negative correlations were recorded between mass sperm motility and LIN, STR, and BCF, with correlations ranging from -0.20 to -0.39 (p < 0.0001). VSL, ALH, and WOB were not correlated to mass sperm motility (p > 0.05). Ostrich farmers may thus be able to evaluate sperm motility reliably and potentially select breeding males by using the affordable mass sperm motility scoring method. Determining the correlation between these methods and fertility after artificial insemination or natural mating is however needed.

AB  - Compared with synthetic surfactants, amino acid surfactants (sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate, SLS) and natural products (flavonoid glycosides from Camellia oleifera cake, FG) have renewability, lower toxicity, and biodegradability, which can reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution during emulsion preparation. Storage time and lipid oxidation are important indicators for evaluating the environmental adaptability of emulsions. However, the effect of complex systems (surfactants and flavonoids) on emulsion performance and its related mechanisms have not yet been thoroughly studied. The oxidative stability, physical stability, and interaction mode of FG-ionic surfactants (SLS/CTAB)-stabilized oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions were explored. The results indicated that FG displayed excellent antioxidant and emulsifying capacity without negative hemolysis. Moreover, FG contributed to the interfacial activity of ionic surfactants. The optimum synergistic ratio of SLS/ CTAB-FG was 0.167/0.091. The presence of FG alleviated the stratification of cream volume and retarded Ostwald ripening and droplet coalescence. After storage, the FG-SLS-stabilized emulsions showed the smallest droplet size and the largest emulsion volume. Moreover, the addition of FG effectively reduced the production of harmful substances such as 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lipid hydroperoxides. A meaningful discovery was that oxidative stability depended strongly on the interaction mechanism between FG and surfactants. FG was more useful for improving the oxidative stability of anionic surfactant-stabilized emulsions. Overall, this study demonstrates that Camellia oleifera cake can serve as an inexpensive and ecofriendly renewable resource for natural emulsifiers and antioxidants, and provides theoretical guidance for its more effective utilization.

AB  - Synaptic transmission relies on the continual exocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles. Aged vesicle proteins are prevented from recycling and are eventually degraded. This implies that active synapses would lose vesicles and vesicle-associated proteins over time, unless the supply correlates to activity, to balance the losses. To test this hypothesis, we first model the quantitative relation between presynaptic spike rate and vesicle turnover. The model predicts that the vesicle supply needs to increase with the spike rate. To follow up this prediction, we measure protein turnover in individual synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons by combining nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) and fluorescence microscopy. We find that turnover correlates with activity at the single-synapse level, but not with other parameters such as the abundance of synaptic vesicles or postsynaptic density proteins. We therefore suggest that the supply of newly synthesized proteins to synapses is closely connected to synaptic activity.

AB  - Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and places a significant burden on society. Neuroinflammation is closely associated with the pathophysiology of depression. Increasing evidence suggests that astrocytes, as the most abundant glial cells in the brain, are involved in the occurrence and development of depression due to morphological abnormalities and dysfunction. Astrocytes express the NOD-like receptor protein 2 (NLRP2) and NLRP3 inflammasomes, and the activation of inflammasomes induces pyroptosis. Ghrelin, a gastrointestinal peptide, plays vital role in regulating inflammation and alleviating stress. Therefore, we proposed a hypothesis that ghrelin inhibits the activation of inflammasomes on astrocytes, reduces pyroptosis, and consequently prevents depression. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse depression model and cultured primary astrocytes in vitro to explore the mechanism of the antidepressant effect of ghrelin. Our results showed that ghrelin effectively inhibited acute inflammatory responses and damage in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The activation of NLRP2 and NLRP3 in astrocytes induced by LPS was significantly inhibited by ghrelin. Pretreatment with ghrelin effectively suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of pyroptosis-related proteins and mRNA. Ghrelin alleviated cell membrane pore formation and cell swelling, ultimately improved LPS-induced depression-like behavior. In vitro, ghrelin prevented the LPS-induced upregulation of pyroptosis-related proteins and mRNA expression in astrocytes, and inhibited the initiation and assembly of NLRP2 and NLRP3. Ghrelin exhibits antidepressant effects, inhibits inflammasomes activation in astrocytes, and prevents pyroptosis, suggesting a novel strategy for treating depression. This groundbreaking study reveals new avenues for targeting potential therapeutic interventions to alleviate depression.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2 , which encodes methyl-CpG-binding protein 2, a transcriptional regulator of many genes, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ). BDNF levels are lower in multiple brain regions of Mecp2-deficient mice, and experimentally increasing BDNF levels improve atypical phenotypes in Mecp2 mutant mice. Due to the low blood-brain barrier permeability of BDNF itself, we tested the effects of LM22A-4, a brain-penetrant, small-molecule ligand of the BDNF receptor TrkB (encoded by Ntrk2 ), on dendritic spine density and form in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and on behavioral phenotypes in female Mecp2 heterozygous (HET) mice. A 4-week systemic treatment of Mecp2 HET mice with LM22A-4 restored spine volume in MeCP2-expressing neurons to wild-type (WT) levels, whereas spine volume in MeCP2-lacking neurons remained comparable to that in neurons from female WT mice. Female Mecp2 HET mice engaged in aggressive behaviors more than WT mice, the levels of which were reduced to WT levels by the 4-week LM22A-4 treatment. These data provide additional support to the potential usefulness of novel therapies not only for RTT but also to other BDNF-related disorders.

AB  - The amyloid framework forms the central medical theory related to Alzheimer disease (AD), and the in vivo demonstration of amyloid positivity is essential for diagnosing AD. On the basis of a longitudinal cohort design, the study investigated clinical progressive patterns by obtaining cognitive and structural measurements from a group of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI); the measurements were classified by the positivity (A beta+) or absence (A beta-) of the amyloid biomarker. We enrolled 185 patients (64 controls, 121 patients with MCI). The patients with MCI were classified into two groups on the basis of their [F-18]flubetaben or [F-18]florbetapir amyloid positron-emission tomography scan (A beta+ vs. A beta-, 67 vs. 54 patients) results. Data from annual cognitive measurements and three-dimensional T1 magnetic resonance imaging scans were used for between-group comparisons. To obtain longitudinal cognitive test scores, generalized estimating equations were applied. A linear mixed effects model was used to compare the time effect of cortical thickness degeneration. The cognitive decline trajectory of the A beta+ group was obvious, whereas the A beta- and control groups did not exhibit a noticeable decline over time. The group effects of cortical thickness indicated decreased entorhinal cortex in the A beta+ group and supramarginal gyrus in the A beta- group. The topology of neurodegeneration in the A beta- group was emphasized in posterior cortical regions. A comparison of the changes in the A beta+ and A beta- groups over time revealed a higher rate of cortical thickness decline in the A beta+ group than in the A beta- group in the default mode network. The A beta+ and A beta- groups experienced different APOE epsilon 4 effects. For cortical-cognitive correlations, the regions associated with cognitive decline in the A beta+ group were mainly localized in the perisylvian and anterior cingulate regions. By contrast, the degenerative topography of A beta- MCI was scattered. The memory learning curves, cognitive decline patterns, and cortical degeneration topographies of the two MCI groups were revealed to be different, suggesting a difference in pathophysiology. Longitudinal analysis may help to differentiate between these two MCI groups if biomarker access is unavailable in clinical settings.

AB  - A synergistic combination of in vitro electrophysiology and multicompartmental modeling of rat CA1 pyramidal neurons identified TRPM4 channels as major drivers of cholinergic modulation of the firing rate during a triangular current ramp, which emulates the bump in synaptic input received while traversing the place field. In control, fewer spikes at lower frequencies are elicited on the down-ramp compared to the up-ramp due to long-term inactivation of the Na-V channel. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) removes or even reverses this spike rate adaptation, causing more spikes to be elicited on the down-ramp than the up-ramp. CCh application during Schaffer collateral stimulation designed to simulate a ramp produces similar shifts in the center of mass of firing to later in the ramp. The non-specific TRP antagonist flufenamic acid and the TRPM4-specific blockers CBA and 9-phenanthrol, but not the TRPC-specific antagonist SKF96365, reverse the effect of CCh; this implicates the Ca2+-activated nonspecific cation current, I-CAN, carried by TRPM4 channels. The cholinergic shift of the center of mass of firing is prevented by strong intracellular Ca2+ buffering but not by antagonists for IP3 and ryanodine receptors, ruling out a role for known mechanisms of release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Pharmacology combined with modeling suggest that [Ca2+] in a nanodomain near the TRPM4 channel is elevated through an unknown source that requires both muscarinic receptor activation and depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx during the ramp. Activation of the regenerative inward TRPM4 current in the model qualitatively replicates and provides putative underlying mechanisms for the experimental observations.

AB  - Alcohol exposure in adolescence is considered a major cause of cognitive impairments later in life including spatial learning and memory. Integrated stress response (ISR), a program of conservative translation and transcription, is crucial in synaptic plasticity and memory. Although previous studies have elucidated ISR in different brain areas involved in learning and memory disorders, the impact of ISR on learning and memory following adolescent alcohol exposure remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure caused spatial learning and memory impairment, combined with neuronal damage in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and hippocampus (HIP) in adult rats. Moreover, integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB) administration not only improved spatial learning and memory impairment and neuronal damage but also inhibited the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) and reversed changes in synaptic proteins. These findings suggested that ISRIB ameliorates AIE exposure-induced spatial learning and memory deficits by improving neural morphology and synaptic function through inhibiting ER stress signaling pathway in the mPFC, NAc and HIP in adulthood. Our findings may enhance comprehension of cognitive function and neuronal effects of adolescent ethanol exposure and ISRIB treatment may be an underlying potential option for addressing alcohol-induced learning and memory deficits.

AB  - Palmitoylation is the most common post-translational lipid modification in the brain; however, the role of palmitoylation and palmitoylating enzymes in the nervous system remains elusive. One of these enzymes, Zdhhc5, has previously been shown to regulate synapse plasticity. Here, we report that Zdhhc5 is also essential for the formation of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate in vitro that this is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Zdhhc5, its localization at the plasma membrane and its C-terminal domain, which has been shown to be truncated in a patient with schizophrenia. Loss of Zdhhc5 in mice results in a decrease in the density of excitatory hippocampal synapses accompanied by alterations in membrane capacitance and synaptic currents, consistent with an overall decrease in spine number and silent synapses. These findings reveal an important role for Zdhhc5 in the formation and/or maintenance of excitatory synapses.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that pathological alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) mainly transmits along the neuronal network, but several key questions remain unanswered: 1) How many and which connections in the connectome are necessary for predicting the progression of pathological alpha-Syn? 2) How to identify risk genes that affect pathology spreading functioning at presynaptic or postsynaptic regions, and are these genes enriched in different cell types? Here, these questions are addressed with novel mathematical models. Strikingly, the spreading of pathological alpha-Syn is predominantly determined by the key subnetworks composed of only 2% of the strongest connections in the connectome. Genes associated with the selective vulnerability of brain regions to pathological alpha-Syn transmission are further analyzed to distinguish those functioning at presynaptic versus postsynaptic regions. Those risk genes are significantly enriched in microglial cells of presynaptic regions and neurons of postsynaptic regions. Gene regulatory network analyses are then conducted to identify "key drivers" of genes responsible for selective vulnerability and overlapping with Parkinson's disease risk genes. By identifying and discriminating between key gene mediators of transmission operating at presynaptic and postsynaptic regions, this study has demonstrated for the first time that these are functionally distinct processes.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a widespread neurodevelopmental disorder with unknown etiology. Dysfunction of several brain areas including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and cerebellum is involved in cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with ASD. Several studies have reported a reduction in the number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV+) neurons in brain areas of ASD patients and animal models such as a shank mutant mouse model and rodents receiving fetal valproic acid (VPA) administration. Developing therapeutic interventions that restore PV interneurons can be the future therapeutic approach to ASD. The present study examined the possible effect of agmatine (AG), an endogenous NMDA antagonist, on the number of PV+ neurons in a VPA animal model of autism. The therapeutic effects of AG in ameliorating ASD-like behaviors were previously reported in VPA rats. AG was gavaged at dosages of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg from gestational day (GD) 6.5 to 18.5, and the number of PV interneurons was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the 1-month-old rats. Prenatal VPA (GD 12.5) or AG led to a decrease of PV neurons in the PFC, Cornu ammonia (CA1), and molecular layers (MLs) of the cerebellum. However, exposure to AG restored the PV population induced by VPA. AG may modify underlying neuronal mechanisms resulting in the increased survival or restoration of the PV population.
   Prenatal valproic acid decreased parvalbumin-positive neuronsin the prefrontal cortex. Prenatal valproic acid decreased parvalbumin-positive neuronsin the CA1 area of the hippocampus and molecular layers (MLs) of thecerebellum. Agmatine amelioratesvalproic acid-induced depletion of parvalbumin-positive neurons. image

AB  - Both epidemiological investigation and animal experiments demonstrated that pre-/postnatal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) could induce neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies showed that astrocyte was involved in PFOS-induced neurotoxicity, while little information is available. In the present study, the role of astrocyte-derived calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-phosphorylated discs large homolog 1 (DLG1) signaling in PFOS eliciting cytotoxicity in neuron was explored with primary cultured hippocampal astrocyte and neuron. The application of PFOS showed a decreased cell viability, synapse length and glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression, but an increased CaMKII, DLG1 and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) expression in primary cultured astrocyte. With 2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-aminohexylcarbamic acid tert-butyl ester-9-isopropylpurine (CK59), the CaMKII inhibitor, the disturbed cell viability and molecules induced by PFOS could be alleviated (CREB expression was excluded) in astrocytes. The cytotoxic effect of neuron exposed to astrocyte conditional medium collected from PFOS (PFOS-ACM) pretreated with CK59 was also decreased. These results indicated that PFOS mediated GLT-1 expression through astrocyte-derived CaMKII-DLG signaling, which might be associated with injuries on neurons. The present study gave an insight in further exploration of mechanism in PFOS-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are a transient neuron type that populate the postnatal hippocampus. To understand how the persistence of CR cells influences the maturation of hippocampal circuits, we combined a specific transgenic mouse line with viral vector injection to selectively ablate CR cells from the postnatal hippocampus. We observed layer-specific changes in the dendritic complexity and spine density of CA1 pyramidal cells. In addition, transcriptomic analysis highlighted significant changes in the expression of synapse-related genes across development. Finally, we were able to identif y significant changes in the expression levels of latrophilin 2, a postsynaptic guidance molecule known for its role in the entorhinal-hippocampal connectivity. These findings were supported by changes in the synaptic proteomic content in CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Our results reveal a crucial role for CR cells in the establishment of the hippocampal network.

AB  - WWC1 regulates episodic learning and memory, and genetic nucleotide polymorphism of WWC1 is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the molecular mechanism through which WWC1 regulates neuronal function has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that WWC1 and its paralogs (WWC2/3) bind directly to angiomotin (AMOT) family proteins (Motins), and recruit USP9X to deubiquitinate and stabilize Motins. Deletion of WWC genes in different cell types leads to reduced protein levels of Motins. In mice, neuron-specific deletion of Wwc1 and Wwc2 results in reduced expression of Motins and lower density of dendritic spines in the cortex and hippocampus, in association with impaired cognitive functions such as memory and learning. Interestingly, ectopic expression of AMOT partially rescues the neuronal phenotypes associated with Wwc1/2 deletion. Thus, WWC proteins modulate spinogenesis and cognition, at least in part, by regulating the protein stability of Motins.

AB  - Sunflower occupies the fourth position among oilseed crops the around the world. Eceriferum (CER) is an important gene family that plays critical role in very-long-chain fatty acids elongation and biosynthesis of epicuticular waxes under both biotic and abiotic stress conditions. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of sunflower CER genes during drought stress condition. Thus, comparative analysis was undertaken for sunflower CER genes with Arabidopsis genome to determine phylogenetic relation-ship, chromosomal mapping, gene structures, gene ontology and conserved motifs. Furthermore, we sub-jected the sunflower cultivars under drought stress and used qRT-PCR analysis to explore the expression pattern of CER genes during drought conditions. We identified thirty-seven unevenly distributed CER genes in the sunflower genome. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that CER genes were grouped into seven clades in Arabidopsis, Helianthus annuus, and Gossypium hirsutum. Expression analysis showed that genes CER10 and CER60 were upregulated in sunflower during drought conditions, indicating that these genes are activated during drought stress. The results obtained will serve to characterize the CER gene family in sunflower and exploit the role of these genes in wax biosynthesis under limited water condi-tions. Key message: Cuticular waxes protect the plants from drought stress, so we observed the expression of wax bio synthesis genes in recently sequences genome of Helianthus annuus. We observed that expres-sion of wax biosynthesis genes CER10 and CER60 was upregulated when the plants were subjected to drought stress. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the influence of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced neuronal apoptosis in epilepsy rats, and to explore the signaling pathways related to the action. Healthy Sprague-Dawley rats aged 8 weeks old were randomly divided into 5 groups, namely, control group, PTZ model group, PTZ + rHuEPO intervention group, PTZ + SB431542 + rHuEPO intervention group and PTZ + SB431542 (TGF-beta/Smad inhibitor) intervention group. The expressions of apoptotic proteins [tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and caspase-3] and the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/ Smad signaling pathway-related proteins [phosphorylated smad3 (p-smad3) and TGF-beta 1] in the brain tissues were determined via Western blotting (WB). Epilepsy was successfully induced by PTZ in the rats. The results of the TUNEL assay showed that the intervention with rHuEPO could remarkably reduce the number of PTZ-induced apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus, while SB431542 inhibitor could attenuate the protective effect of rHuEPO against neuronal apoptosis (P<0.05). In addition, the intraperitoneal injection of 50 mu g/kg rHuEPO could activate the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway, markedly up-regulate the expressions of TGF-beta 1 and p-smad3 (P<0.05), down-regulate the expressions of apoptotic proteins TNFR1 and caspase-3 (P<0.01) and reduce neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, SB431542 was able to notably repress the protective effect of rHuEPO against neuronal apoptosis, and down-regulate the expressions of p-smad3 and TGF-beta 1 (P<0.01). In conclusion, the inhibitory effect of rHuEPO on nerve cell apoptosis in epilepsy rats may be realized by activating the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway, thus relieving neuronal apoptosis and ameliorating the symptoms of epilepsy.

AB  - Lysine demethylase KDM7A removes histone modifications H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me1/2. KDM7A plays critical roles in gene expression and contribute to biological processes including tumorigenesis, metabolism, and embryonic development. However, the functions of KDM7A in mammalian nervous system are still poorly explored. In this study, functional roles of KDM7A are comprehensively investigated in neuronal cells by applying CUT & Tag-seq, RNA-seq and mice models. Knockdown of Kdm7a in N2A cells result in the alteration of histone modifications near transcription start sites (TSSs) and the expression changes of a large number of genes. In particular, the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), a series of genes maintaining the function of the nervous system and associating with neurological disorders, are significantly decreased upon Kdm7a knockdown. Furthermore, in vivo knockdown of Kdm7a in dentate gyrus (DG) neuron of mice hippocampus, via Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based stereotaxic microinjection, led to a significant decrease of the expression of c-Fos, a marker of neuron activity. Behavior assays in mice further revealed that Kdm7a knockdown in hippocampus repress neuron activity, which leading to impairment of emotion and memory. Collectively, the study reveals that KDM7A affects neuron functions by regulating IEGs, which may provide new clues for understanding epigenetic mechanisms in neurological disorders.

AB  - Advanced physiological aging is associated with impaired cognitive performance and the inability to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), an electrophysiological correlate of memory. Here, we demonstrate in the physiologically aged, senescent mouse brain that scanning ultrasound combined with microbubbles (SUS+MB), by transiently opening the blood-brain barrier, fully restores LTP induction in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Intriguingly, SUS treatment without microbubbles (SUSonly), i.e., without the uptake of blood-borne factors, proved even more effective, not only restoring LTP, but also ameliorating the spatial learning deficits of the aged mice. This functional improvement is accompanied by an altered milieu of the aged hippocampus, including a lower density of perineuronal nets, increased neurogenesis, and synaptic signaling, which collectively results in improved spatial learning. We therefore conclude that therapeutic ultrasound is a non-invasive, pleiotropic modality that may enhance cognition in elderly humans.

AB  - Cell atlases serve as vital references for automating cell labeling in new samples, yet existing classification algorithms struggle with accuracy. Here we introduce SIMS (scalable, interpretable machine learning for single cell), a low-code data-efficient pipeline for single-cell RNA classification. We benchmark SIMS against datasets from different tissues and species. We demonstrate SIMS's efficacy in classifying cells in the brain, achieving high accuracy even with small training sets (<3,500 cells) and across different samples. SIMS accurately predicts neuronal subtypes in the developing brain, shedding light on genetic changes during neuronal differentiation and postmitotic fate refinement. Finally, we apply SIMS to single-cell RNA datasets of cortical organoids to predict cell identities and uncover genetic variations between cell lines. SIMS identifies cell-line differences and misannotated cell lineages in human cortical organoids derived from different pluripotent stem cell lines. Altogether, we show that SIMS is a versatile and robust tool for cell-type classification from single-cell datasets.

AB  - Melatonin is a hormone synthesized by the pineal gland with neuroprotective and neurodevelopmental effects. Also, melatonin acts as an antidepressant by modulating the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The positive effects of melatonin on behavior and neural development may suggest it is used for reverting stress but also for the alterations produced by chemotherapeutic drugs influencing behavior and brain plasticity. In this sense, temozolomide, an alkylating/anti-proliferating agent used in treating brain cancer, is associated with decreased cognitive functions and depression. We hypothesized that melatonin might prevent the effects of temozolomide on depression- and anxiety-like behavior by modulating some aspects of the neurogenic process in adult Balb/C mice. Mice were treated with temozolomide (25 mg/kg) for three days of two weeks, followed by melatonin (8 mg/kg) for fourteen days. Temozolomide produced short- and long-term decrements in cell proliferation (Ki67-positive cells: 54.89% and 53.38%, respectively) and intermediate stages of the neurogenic process (doublecortin-positive cells: 68.23% and 50.08%, respectively). However, melatonin prevented the long-term effects of temozolomide with the increased number of doublecortin-positive cells (47.21%) and the immunoreactivity of 2 & PRIME; 3 & PRIME;-Cyclic-nucleotide-3 phosphodiesterase (CNPase: 82.66%), an enzyme expressed by mature oligodendrocytes, in the hilar portion of the dentate gyrus. The effects of melatonin in the temozolomide group occurred with decreased immobility in the forced swim test (45.55%) but not anxiety-like behavior. Thus, our results suggest that melatonin prevents the harmful effects of temozolomide by modulating doublecortin cells, hilar oligodendrocytes, and depression-like behavior tested in the forced swim test. Our study could point out melatonin's beneficial effects for counteracting temozolomide's side effects.

AB  - Background: Korean black ginseng, a specially processed ginseng through repeat steaming and drying, has various pharmacological effects. However, its role in cognitive impairment remains unclear. Purpose and methods: This study examined whether Korean black ginseng extract (BGE; 50 and 100 mg/kg, orally, 18 weeks) may mitigate cognitive impairment in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results: BGE significantly improved cognitive performance in 5xFAD mice, associated with reduced A beta accumulation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. BGE suppressed microglial and astrocytic activation, alongside the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and enzymes (cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase). These changes coincided with the inhibition of key inflammatory signaling pathways, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)/p65, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Furthermore, BGE reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species and enhanced the nuclearE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) signaling pathway in the brains linked to the downregulation of toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 in the brain. Conclusion: Taken together, BGE could improve AD-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration by simultaneously regulating anti-inflammatory pathways (p38 MAPK/NF-kappa B/STAT3 and NLRP3 inflammasome) and an antioxidant pathway (Nrf2/HO-1) via modulation of TLR2/4.

AB  - Macroautophagy (hereafter "autophagy") is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is important for learning and memory, suggesting critical roles for autophagy at the neuronal synapse. Little is known, however, about the molecular details of how autophagy is regulated with synaptic activity. Here, we used live-cell confocal microscopy to define the autophagy pathway in primary hippocampal neurons under various paradigms of synaptic activity. We found that synaptic activity regulates the motility of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in dendrites. Stimulation of synaptic activity dampens AV motility, whereas silencing synaptic activity induces AV motility. Activity-dependent effects on dendritic AV motility are local and reversible. Importantly, these effects are compartment specific, occurring in dendrites and not in axons. Most strikingly, synaptic activity increases the presence of degradative autolysosomes in dendrites and not in axons. On the basis of our findings, we propose a model whereby synaptic activity locally controls AV dynamics and function within dendrites that may regulate the synaptic proteome.

This study aimed to evaluate whether TYAP restores mitochondrial function and 5hmC levels in a palmitic acid (PAL)-induced hippocampal injury model. Approach: Palmitic acid (PAL)-induced hippocampal injury was prepared in primary hippocampal neurons, and the TYAP treatments with different doses (50-200 mu g/mL) were also applied. The neurons were randomly assigned to 6 groups: Control, Control + TYAP (200 mu g/mL), PAL, PAL + TYAP (50 mu g/mL), PAL + TYAP (100 mu g/mL), and PAL + TYAP (200 mu g/mL). Outcomes, including measures of inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and DNA epigenetic changes (such as 5hmC and 5 mC), were assessed. Additionally, the effects of TYAP were evaluated in TET2-knockdown HT22 cells to assess the involvement of TET2 in TYAP treatment. Results: TYAP mitigated PAL-induced hippocampal injury by restoring TET2 and 5hmC levels, reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and enhancing mitochondrial function. Knockdown of TET2 abolished these effects, demonstrating the critical role of TET2 in TYAP-mediated neuroprotection. Conclusions: TYAP confers neuroprotection against PAL-induced hippocampal neuron damage through the TET25hmC pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for neurological conditions associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.

AB  - The intricate nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has presented significant hurdles in the development of effective interventions. Sulforaphane (SFN) is of interest due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, which could address various aspects of AD pathology. This study explores the potential of SFN in a rat model of AD induced by A(3 (1-42) peptides. AD symptoms were triggered in rats by injecting A(3 (1-42) peptides directly into their cerebral ventricles. SFN (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg), Trigonelline (10 mg/kg), and Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) were administered in A(3 (1-42) treated animals. Behavioral assessments were performed using the Novel Object Recognition tests. Various biochemical parameters, such as soluble A(3 (1-42), IRS-S312, GSK-3(3, TNF-alpha, acetylcholinesterase, nitrite levels, lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione activity, were quantified using ELISA kits and spectrophotometric assays. Histopathological analyses included Hematoxylin and Eosin, Crystal Violet, Congo red, and IRS-1 Immunohistochemistry staining. Quantification was performed to assess neuronal loss and A(3 plaque burden. The novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive evaluation of SFN's impact on multiple AD-related pathways at dual doses. The Novel Object Recognition test revealed that SFN, especially at higher doses, improved memory deficits induced by A(3 (1-42). Biochemically, SFN reduced hippocampal A(3 levels, IRS-S312, GSK-3(3, TNF-alpha, and acetylcholinesterase activity, while increasing glutathione levels, all in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological analyses further confirmed SFN's protective role against A(3-induced neuronal damage, amyloidosis, and changes in insulin signaling. These results highlight SFN's potential as a multifaceted therapeutic agent for AD, offering a promising avenue for treatment due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. The inclusion of combination treatments with Trigonelline and Pioglitazone alongside SFN offers insights into potential synergistic effects, which could pave the way for developing combination therapies for AD.

AB  - RhoA plays a crucial role in neuronal polarization, where its action restraining axon outgrowth has been thoroughly studied. We now report that RhoA has not only an inhibitory but also a stimulatory effect on axon development depending on when and where exerts its action and the downstream effectors involved. In cultured hippocampal neurons, FRET imaging revealed that RhoA activity selectively localized in growth cones of undifferentiated neurites, whereas in developing axons it displayed a biphasic pattern, being low in nascent axons and high in elongating ones. RhoA-Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling prevented axon initiation but had no effect on elongation, whereas formin inhibition reduced axon extension without significantly altering initial outgrowth. In addition, RhoA- mDia signaling promoted axon elongation by stimulating growth cone microtubule stability and assembly, as opposed to RhoA-ROCK signaling, which restrained growth cone microtubule assembly and protrusion.

AB  - Simple Summary Serious consequences of septicemic bacterial infections include the formation of purulent and pyogranulomatous inflammation resulting in abscesses in inner organs. Different bacteria are known to cause these infections in livestock. In this study, we report in detail on a case of a fatal Rhodococcus (R.) equi infection in an alpaca (Vicugna pacos), to our knowledge, for the first time. R. equi is a member of the actinomycetes, a bacterial group known to contain several pathogenic bacteria. R. equi primarily affects equine foals and other domestic animals, but also humans, which renders this bacterium a zoonotic agent. The rhodococcal infection of the alpaca reported herein caused septicemia, resulting in emaciation and severe lesions in the lungs and heart. The onset of infection was presumably caused by aspiration pneumonia, resulting in abscesses exclusively in the lungs. The R. equi isolate proved to be pathogenic, based on the virulence gene vapA encoding the virulence-associated protein A. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed a susceptibility to doxycycline, erythromycin, gentamycin, neomycin, rifampicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and vancomycin. This report of an R. equi infection in an alpaca makes clear that we still have knowledge gaps about bacterial infectious diseases in alpacas and potential zoonotic impacts. Therefore, the determination of pathogenic, zoonotic bacteria in alpacas is essential for treatment and preventive measures with respect to sustaining the health, welfare and productivity of this camelid species. Rhodococcus (R.) equi is a pathogen primarily known for infections in equine foals, but is also present in numerous livestock species including New World camelids. Moreover, R. equi is considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen. In this report, we describe in detail a fatal rhodococcal infection in an alpaca (Vicugna pacos), to our best knowledge, for the first time. The alpaca died due to a septicemic course of an R. equi infection resulting in emaciation and severe lesions including pyogranulomas in the lungs and pericardial effusion. The onset of the infection was presumably caused by aspiration pneumonia. R. equi could be isolated from the pyogranulomas in the lung and unequivocally identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the rpoB gene. The isolate proved to possess the vapA gene in accordance with tested isolates originating from the lungs of infected horses. The R. equi isolates revealed low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC values) for doxycycline, erythromycin, gentamycin, neomycin, rifampicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and vancomycin in antibiotic susceptibility testing. Investigations on the cause of bacterial, especially fatal, septicemic infections in alpacas are essential for adequately addressing the requirements for health and welfare issues of this New World camelid species. Furthermore, the zoonotic potential of R. equi has to be considered with regard to the One Health approach.

AB  - Diazinon (DZN) an organophosphate (OP), with the most important mechanism of action of DZN being induction of oxidative stress (OS) and inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Verbascum cheiranthifolium (VER) and Biebersteinia multifida (BM) belong to the Scrophulariaceae and Biebersteiniaceae family respectively. These plants are widely used in Iranian traditional medicine due to their beneficial effects. Thus, this research aimed to appraise the protective effects of the methanolic extract of the VER and BM on changes in the level of expression of alpha 7 and alpha 4 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in hippocampus (HPC) of DZN-treated rats. In this research, 36 male Wistar rats were used and randomly divided into six groups: Control, DZN (40 mg/kg), VER (1 g/kg), DZN+VER (40 mg/kg+1 g/kg), BM (150 mg/kg), and DZN+BM (40 mg/ kg+150 mg/kg). At the end of treatment periods, the animals of all groups underwent the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The rats were anesthetized, and blood sampling was performed. Eventually, the brain was removed for histological study and evaluation of OS parameters. The results indicated that DZN increased the extent of expression of nAChRs in the HPC and significantly inhibited cholinesterase (ChEs) activity plus OS parameters. Also, in MWM, the time to find the platform was significantly longer in the DZN group, while the time and the distance in the probe test were lower than in the control groups. VER and BM extract in the treatment groups simultaneously improved the extent of expression of nAChRs, ChEs activity, as well as the parameters of OS and spatial memory significantly. In conclusion, our results support the neuroprotective properties of VER and BM extract versus DZN in rats. Accordingly, the extracts of VER and BM may be useful as an approach for the treatment of learning disorders and memory enhancement.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with M1-type macrophage activation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapies have shown promise in models of pathologies relevant to SLE, while the function and mechanism of MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-exo) were still unclear. We aimed to interrogate the effect of MSC-exo on M1-type polarization of macrophage and investigate mechanisms underlying MSC-exo. Exosomes were isolated from MSC and the effect of MSC-exo on macrophage polarization was evaluated. The key tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) carried by exosomes were identified by small RNA sequencing and verified in clinical samples. The effect of exosomal-tRFs on macrophage polarization was examined. In this study, MSC-exo dramatically suppressed expression of M1 markers, and reduced the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, while increased M2 markers in macrophages. A total of 243 differently expressed tRFs (DEtRFs) were identified between MSC-exo treated and untreated macrophage, among which 103 DEtRFs were up-regulated in response to MSC-exo treatment, including tsRNA-21109. The target genes of tsRNA-21109 were mainly enriched in DNA transcription-related GO function, and mainly involved in inflammatory-related pathways, including Rap1, Ras, Hippo, Wnt, MAPK, TGF-beta signaling pathway. The tsRNA-21109 was lowly expressed in clinical samples and was associated with the patient data in SLE. Compared to the normal MSC-exo, the tsRNA-21109-privative MSCexo up-regulated M1 marker (CD80, NOS2, MCP1) and down-regulated M2 marker (CD206, ARG1, MRC2), also increased the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in macrophages. Western blot and immunofluorescence confirmed that the proportion of CD80/ARG-1 was increased in macrophages treated with tsRNA-21109-privatived MSC-exo compared to that with control MSC-exo. In conclusion, MSC-exo inhibited the M1-type polarization of macrophages, possibly through transferring tsRNA-21109, which may develop as a novel therapeutic target for SLE.

AB  - The nervous system is the primary target for lead exposure and the developing brain appears to be especially susceptible, namely the hippocampus. The mechanisms of lead neurotoxicity remain unclear, but microgliosis and astrogliosis are potential candidates, leading to an inflammatory cascade and interrupting the pathways involved in hippocampal functions. Moreover, these molecular changes can be impactful as they may contribute to the pathophysiology of behavioral deficits and cardiovascular complications observed in chronic lead exposure. Nevertheless, the health effects and the underlying influence mechanism of intermittent lead exposure in the nervous and cardiovascular systems are still vague. Thus, we used a rat model of intermittent lead exposure to determine the systemic effects of lead and on microglial and astroglial activation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus throughout time. In this study, the intermittent group was exposed to lead from the fetal period until 12 weeks of age, no exposure (tap water) until 20 weeks, and a second exposure from 20 to 28 weeks of age. A control group (without lead exposure) matched in age and sex was used. At 12, 20 and 28 weeks of age, both groups were submitted to a physiological and behavioral evaluation. Behavioral tests were performed for the assessment of anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity (open-field test), and memory (novel object recognition test). In the physiological evaluation, in an acute experiment, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and heart and respiratory rates were recorded, and autonomic reflexes were evaluated. The expression of GFAP, Iba-1, NeuN and Synaptophysin in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was assessed. Intermittent lead exposure induced microgliosis and astrogliosis in the hippocampus of rats and changes in behavioral and cardiovascular function. We identified increases in GFAP and Iba1 markers together with presynaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus, concomitant with behavioral changes. This type of exposure produced significant long-term memory dysfunction. Regarding physiological changes, hypertension, tachypnea, baroreceptor reflex impairment and increased chemoreceptor reflex sensitivity were observed. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the potential of lead intermittent exposure inducing reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis, along with a presynaptic loss that was accompanied by alterations of homeostatic mechanisms. This suggests that chronic neuroinflammation promoted by intermittent lead exposure since fetal period may increase the susceptibility to adverse events in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and/or in the elderly.

AB  - Since the role of estrogen in postmenauposal-associated dementia is still debatable, this issue urges the search for other medications. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a drug used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and has shown a neuroprotective effect against other neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of DMF on an experimental model of Alzheimer disease (AD) using D-galactose (D-Gal) administered to ovariectomized (OVX) rats, resembling a postmenopausal dementia paradigm. Adult 18-month old female Wistar rats were allocated into sham-operated and OVX/D-Gal groups that were either left untreated or treated with DMF for 56 days starting three weeks after sham-operation or ovariectomy. DMF succeeded to ameliorate cognitive (learning/short- and long-term memory) deficits and to enhance the dampened overall activity (NOR, Barnes-/Y-maze tests). These behavioral upturns were associated with increased intact neurons (Nissl stain) and a reduction in OVX/D-Gal-mediated hippocampal CA1 neurodegeneration and astrocyte activation assessed as GFAP immunoreactivity. Mechanistically, DMF suppressed the hippocampal contents of ADsurrogate markers; viz., apolipoprotein (APO)-E1, BACE1, A beta 42, and hyperphosphorylated Tau. Additionally, DMF has augmented the neuroprotective parameters p-AKT, its downstream target CREB and BDNF. Besides, it activated AMPK, and enhanced SIRT-1, as well as antioxidant defenses (SOD, GSH). On the other hand, DMF inhibited the transcription factor NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, adiponectin/adiponectin receptor type (AdipoR)1, GSK-3 beta, and MDA. Accordingly, in this postmenopausal AD model, DMF treatment by pursuing the adiponectin/AdipoR1, AMPK/SIRT-1, AKT/CREB/BDNF, AKT/GSK-3 beta, and APO-E1 quartet hampered the associated tauo-/amyloidopathy and NF-kappa B-mediated oxidative/inflammatory responses to advance insights into its anti-amnesic effect.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder presenting cognitive decline accompanied by deposits of amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau hyperphosphorylation. Without current treatment to AD, many studies suggested diverse approaches, one of which was herbal medicine and its active compounds. Very few studies have examined the effect of Lindera glauca Blume (L. glauca) in models of degenerative disease despite the attention that it received as a novel potential treatment source. We examined the efficacy of L. glauca in a mouse model of AD, which was induced by intrahippocampal injection of A beta(1-42).
   Methods: Mice were intrahippocampally infused with A beta(1-42) and were orally administered ethanolic extract of L. glauca before and after infusion for 21 days. Y-maze test and Morris water maze was conducted to assess memory impairment. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were performed to assess the effect of L. glauca administration on pathological changes in mice.
   Results: L. glauca exhibited beneficial effects in spatial and reference learning as shown in increased time spent in the target quadrant in Morris water maze and increased spontaneous alternation in Y-maze. At the same time, decline of A beta burden and phosphorylated tau were observed in the hippocampus of L. glauca-treated mouse under intrahippocampal injection of A beta(1-42). The results corresponded with amelioration of the decreased neuronal marker, neuronal-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) and attenuation of the increased reactive astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in hippocampus. Additionally, 21-day treatment with L. glauca inhibited downregulation of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) and brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels.
   Conclusion: L. glauca improves behavioral deficits induced by A beta(1-42) and inhibits both A beta- and tau-related pathological changes, stimulating neuroprotection mediated by CREB activation. L. glauca can be suggested as a new candidate for treatment of AD.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests a strong association between aluminum (Al) exposure and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to their nanoscale size and increased surface area, Al nanoparticles (ALNP) exhibit greater neurotoxicity than bulk Al, raising concerns about their role in neurodegenerative disorders. While quercetin has been recognized for its neuroprotective effects, its ability to counteract ALNP-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration and dysregulated MAPK signaling remains largely unexplored. This study investigated the potential of quercetin to ameliorate ALNP-induced memory deficits, alterations in hippocampal stereological parameters, and disruptions in caspase-3 and MAPK signaling in male Swiss mice. Mice (SWR/J, aged 8-10 weeks) received ALNP (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally for 10 days) with or without quercetin at doses of 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg (orally). Memory performance was assessed using the elevated plus maze (EPM), novel object recognition (NOR), and Y-maze tasks, followed by stereological and western blot analyses of the hippocampus. Our findings revealed that quercetin (100 mg/kg) significantly preserved hippocampal volume and neuronal integrity in the dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1)-key regions involved in memory processing and output signaling. Additionally, quercetin modulated MAPK signaling by enhancing ERK phosphorylation while suppressing ALNP-induced activation of p38 and cleaved caspase-3, suggesting a role in reducing neuroinflammation and apoptosis. This is the first study to demonstrate that quercetin can counteract the neurotoxic effects of ALNP, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic strategy against nanoparticle-induced neurodegeneration in an Alzheimer's-like model.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is a common type of stroke, but effective treatment methods are still imperfect and new effective therapies need to be explored. Radix Aconiti Coreani and Rhizoma Typhonii used as Baifuzi in the treatment of stroke or symptoms associated with stroke have been recorded in ancient Chinese books and are widely used. Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that both of them have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Radix Aconiti Coreani and Rhizoma Typhonii have therapeutical effects on gerbils with ischemic stroke, to investigate their potential mechanisms of action, and to provide a reference for rational clinical application by comparing the differences between them. In this manuscript, the right unilateral ligation of the carotid artery of gerbils was used to cause an ischemic stroke model. The neurological deficits of gerbils in each group were scored by Longa scale. The area of cerebral infarction was detected by 2,3,5-tribenzotetrazolchloride staining. The levels of inflammatory factors, oxidative stress indexes, and vascular endothelial function indexes in brain homogenate and serum were determined by ELISA. The expression levels of P-Akt PI3K, HO-1, and KEAP1 proteins in brain tissue were determined by Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the recovery of neuronal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of the gerbil brain tissue and the expression of proteins related to PI3K/Akt and KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling pathways in neuronal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region. It was found that Radix Aconiti Coreani and Rhizoma Typhonii could improve neurological deficits and reduce cerebral infarction rate in gerbils. The results showed that Radix Aconiti Coreani and Rhizoma Typhonii could significantly decrease the expression of inflammatory factors, increase the expression of antioxidative stress indexes and vascular endothelial function factors, activate the PI3K/Akt, KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling pathway, reduce the inflammatory response, inhibit the oxidative stress, enhance the vascular endothelial cell function, and thus protect against ischemic brain injury. From the experimental results, both Radix Aconiti Coreani and Rhizoma Typhonii had neuroprotective effects on ischemic brain injury. Compared with Rhizoma Typhonii, the effects of Radix Aconiti Coreani on anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress were more significant, while Rhizoma Typhonii had showed more significant effects in promoting angiogenesis after ischemic stroke by increasing the level of NO.

AB  - GNAO1 encephalopathy is an orphan genetic disease associated with early infantile epilepsy, impaired motor control, and severe developmental delay. The disorder is caused by mutations in the GNAO1 gene, leading to dysfunction of the encoded protein G alpha o1. There is no cure for this disease, and symptomatic therapy is ineffective. Phenotypic heterogeneity highlights the need for a personalized approach for treating patients with a specific clinical variant of GNAO1 and requires the study of the disease mechanism in animal and cell models. Towards this aim, we developed an approach for modeling GNAO1 encephalopathy and testing gene therapy drugs in primary neurons derived from healthy mice. We optimized the delivery of transgenes to G alpha o1-expressing neurons using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV). We assessed the tropism of five neurotropic AAV serotypes (1, 2, 6, 9, DJ) for G alpha o1-positive neurons from the whole mouse brain. The DJ serotype showed the highest potential as a reporter delivery vehicle, infecting up to 66% of G alpha o1-expressing cells without overt cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that AAV-DJ also provides efficient delivery and expression of genetic constructs encoding normal and mutant G alpha o1, as well as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to suppress endogenous Gnao1 in murine neurons. Our results will further simplify the study of the pathological mechanism for clinical variants of GNAO1, as well as optimize the testing of gene therapy approaches for GNAO1 encephalopathy in cell models.

AB  - Anxiety and stress-related conditions represent a significant health burden in modern society. Unfortunately, most anxiolytic drugs are prone to side effects, limiting their long-term usage. Here, we employ a bioinformatics screen to identify drugs for repurposing as anxiolytics. Comparison of drug-induced gene-expression profiles with the hippocampal transcriptome of an importin alpha 5 mutant mouse model with reduced anxiety identifies the hypocholesterolemic agent beta-sitosterol as a promising candidate. beta-sitosterol activity is validated by both intraperitoneal and oral application in mice, revealing it as the only clear anxiolytic from five closely related phytosterols. beta-sitosterol injection reduces the effects of restraint stress, contextual fear memory, and c-Fos activation in the prefrontal cortex and dentate gyrus. Moreover, synergistic anxiolysis is observed when combining sub-efficacious doses of beta-sitosterol with the SSRI fluoxetine. These preclinical findings support further development of beta-sitosterol, either as a standalone anxiolytic or in combination with low-dose SSRIs.

AB  - Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a primary phenolic compound in olive oil, exhibits antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects in various cell types, including cardiomyocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Contrastingly, bisphenol S (BPS) is known to induce apoptosis in myocardial and endothelial cells via oxidative stress. BPS increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reduces the viability of hippocampal HT22 cells. In this study, we explored whether HT could protect neurons from BPS-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our results showed that HT effectively inhibited oxidative stress responses in the brains of BPS-treated mice and significantly decreased ROS production in BPS-treated HT22 and PC12 cells. Additionally, HT reduced BPS-induced neuronal apoptosis in the cortical regions of mice as well as in HT22 and PC12 cells. Further analysis revealed that BPS activates the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, a key mediator of oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, while HT counteracted these effects. In summary, this study demonstrates the antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties of HT in BPS-exposed neurons. These findings provide compelling experimental evidence supporting the potential dietary inclusion of HT-rich compounds to alleviate oxidative stress-related neuronal damage.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury affects the largest proportion of individuals in the United States and world-wide. Preclinical studies of repetitive and mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) have been limited in their ability to recapitulate human pathology (i.e. diffuse rotational injury). We used the closed-head impact model of engineered rotation acceleration (CHIMERA) to simulate rotational injury observed in patients and to study the pathological outcomes post-rmTBI using C57BL/6J mice. Enhanced cytokine production was observed in both the cortex and hippocampus to suggest neuroinflammation. Furthermore, microglia were assessed via enhanced iba1 protein levels and morphological changes using immunofluorescence. In addition, LC/MS analyses revealed excess glutamate production, as well as diffuse axonal injury via Bielschowsky's silver stain kit. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of rmTBI has made it challenging to identify drug therapies that address rmTBI, therefore we sought to identify novel targets in the concurrent rmTBI pathology. The pathophysiological findings correlated with a time-dependent decrease in protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) protein expression and activity post-rmTBI along with dysregulation of PRMT upstream mediators s-adenosylmethionine and methionine adenosyltransferase 2 (MAT2) in vivo. In addition, inhibition of the upstream mediator MAT2A using the HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line suggest a mechanistic role for PRMT7 via MAT2A in vitro. Collectively, we have identified PRMT7 as a novel target in rmTBI pathology in vivo and a mechanistic link between PRMT7 and upstream mediator MAT2A in vitro.

AB  - Environmental contaminants such as industrial and household chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers, heavy metals, and ionizing radiation are the primary causes of oxidative stress. Acetamiprid (ACMP) is a pesticide, belongs to the neonicotinoid family. Curcumin (Cur) is a brilliant yellow chemical component found in turmeric root which has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumor characteristics. It has been widely utilized to treat or prevent neurological illnesses as both a herbal medication and a food additive. The main goal of this study is to examine the protective role of curcumin (100 mg/kg body weight) on the neurotoxicity caused by an environmental contaminant, acetamiprid (20 mg/kg body weight). We used five groups of male albinos rats: each with six animals. The first was a control group (saline 0.9%), the second was a vehicle group (DMSO 33%), the third was a curcumin group, the fourth group was given an acetamiprid only, and the fifth was given both curcumin and acetamiprid. The considerable reduction in the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) in the brain cortex, as well as the reduction in dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, indicating that acetamiprid has an overall pro-oxidant effect. On the other hand, we noticed a rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO), and DNA fragmentation, in the cerebral cortex. Our findings revealed that oral curcumin supplementation improved biochemical parameters in brain of rats treated with acetamiprid. We conclude that curcumin may play a role as effective antioxidant in reducing the imbalance between the formation of free radicals, and the body's antioxidant systems, that result in reducing the severity of oxidative stress induced by acetamiprid.

AB  - Simple Summary Regular training for medical or enrichment purposes and the provision of environmental enrichment, such as varied feeding schedules and novel objects, are part of the management of African elephants in zoos. The present study aimed to find out whether training and enrichment in the form of a novel object induced physiological changes in captive African elephants. We repeatedly sampled the saliva of ten animals (three zoos) before and after training and the exposure to a novel object for the analysis of cortisol and as a measure of stress and arousal. We found high salivary cortisol levels before and low levels after training. A novel object, in contrast, moderately increased the salivary cortisol levels. Moreover, males and young elephants showed lower salivary cortisol levels than females and old elephants, respectively. The zoo, handling method (free vs. protected contact to keepers), reproductive and social status, however, did not influence the salivary cortisol levels of the animals studied. We conclude that the relatively high cortisol values before training could be due to anticipation of the training event. A novel object, in contrast, may have evoked arousal, which led to the observed cortisol increase. In addition, understanding why animals differ in stress responses will help to manage stress in zoo elephants with the goal of ensuring their welfare. Dealing with potential stress in species that have high husbandry requirements, such as elephants, is a challenge for zoos. The objective of the present study was to determine whether positive reinforcement training (PRT) and exposure to a novel object (NOV) for enrichment induced a salivary cortisol response indicative of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and which factors determine individual variation in this regard in captive African elephants. We repeatedly sampled the saliva of ten animals (three zoos) for the analysis of cortisol (SACort) before and up to 60 min (in 10-15 min intervals) after the onset of PRT (three repeats) or NOV (nine repeats), which lasted 10 min. There was considerable individual variation in SACort in response to PRT or NOV. Using mixed models, we were able to control these and to reveal that PRT was associated with high SACort before and relatively low SACort after PRT, while NOV induced a moderate SACort increase. The individual differences in SACort were related to age and sex (NOV), while the effects of zoo, handling method (free vs. protected contact) and reproductive and social status were variable. We conclude that positive affective states, such as anticipation or arousal, should be taken into account when interpreting the differences in the SACort responses between PRT and NOV. In addition, understanding the individuality of stress will support management decisions aimed at promoting captive elephant welfare.

AB  - Ghrelin is an orexigenic gastric hormone that promotes feeding behaviors and regulates energy homeostasis in both humans and rodents. Studies have reported intriguing yet conflicting roles that ghrelin and its receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) play in regulating multiple brain functions, such as learning and memory; however, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of ghrelin incubation and virus-mediated GHS-R1a overexpression on synaptic functions of primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results demonstrated that ghrelin pretreatment for 24 h, with a concentration of either 4 nM or 200 nM, suppressed the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), the frequency and the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Similarly, GHS-R1a overexpression inhibited both the frequency and the amplitude of mEPSCs, and mIPSCs frequency. Moreover, our in vitro Ca2+-image study with Rhod-3AM reveals that ghrelin pre-treatment for either 3 h or 24 h suppressed glutamate-induced elevation of cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. Our findings thus suggest that GHS-R1a signaling inhibits synaptic function of hippocampal neurons, which may contribute to the blocking effect of ghrelin on memory formation. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In order to understand the long-term effects of systemic inflammation, it is important to distinguish inflammation-induced changes in baseline cognitive function from changes that interact with aging to influence the trajectory of cognitive decline. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered to young adult (6 months) male rats via intraperitoneal injections, once a week for 7 weeks. Longitudinal effects on cognitive decline were examined 6 and 12 months after the initial injections. Repeated LPS treatment, in adults, resulted in a long-term impairment in memory, examined in aged animals (age 18 months), but not in middle- age (age 12 months). At 12 months following injections, LPS treatment was associated with a decrease in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission and altered expression of genes linked to the synapse and to regulation of the response to inflammatory signals. The results of the current study suggest that the history of systemic inflammation is one component of environmental factors that contribute to the resilience or susceptibility to age-related brain changes and associated trajectory of cognitive decline.

AB  - Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter that plays a main role in regulating physiological and cognitive functions. Serotonergic system dysfunction is involved in the etiology of various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of early-life serotonin depletion on cognitive disorders caused by sleep deprivation. Serotonin was depleted by para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 100 mg/kg, s.c.) at postnatal days 10-20, followed by sleep deprivation-induced through the multiple platform apparatus for 24 h at PND 60. After the examination of the novel object recognition and passive avoidance memories, the hippocampi and prefrontal cortex were dissected to examine the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression by PCR. Our findings showed that postnatal serotonin depletion and sleep deprivation impaired the novel object recognition and passive avoidance memories and changed the BDNF levels. In the same way, the serotonin depletion in early life before sleep deprivation exacerbated the harmful effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive function and BDNF levels. It can be claimed that the serotonergic system plays a main role in the modulation of sleep and cognitive functions.

AB  - Tau is a protein that normally participates in the assembly and stability of microtubules. However, it can form intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated aggregates that are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau can be phosphorylated by multiple kinases at several sites. Among such kinases, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates tau at Ser214 (pTAU-S214), an event that was shown to reduce the pathological assembly of the protein. Given that the neuronal cAMP/PKA-activated cascade is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory, and that cAMP-enhancing strategies demonstrated promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of cognitive deficits, we investigated the impact of cAMP on pTAU-S214 in N2a cells and rat hippocampal slices. Our results confirm that the activation of adenylyl cyclase increases pTAU-S214 in both model systems and, more interestingly, this effect is mimicked by GEBR-7b, a phosphodiesterase 4D inhibitor with proven pro-cognitive efficacy in rodents.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is a critical driver in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Dammarane sapogenins (DS), a deglycosylated product of ginsenoside, possess a variety of potent biological activities. The present study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effects of DS in a rat model of neuroinflammation induced by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our study revealed that DS pretreatment effectively improved LPS-induced associative learning and memory impairments in the active avoidance response test and spatial learning and memory in Morris water maze test. DS also remarkably inhibited LPS-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing microglia overactivation, pro-inflammatory cytok ine release (TNF-& alpha; and IL-1 & beta;) and reducing neuronal loss in the CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus. Importantly, pretreatment with DS reversed LPS-induced upregulation of HMGB1 and TLR4 and inhibited their downstream NF-& kappa;B signaling activation, as evidenced by increased I & kappa;B & alpha; and decreased p-NF-& kappa;B p65 levels. Furthermore, DS ameliorated LPS-induced synaptic dysfunction by decreasing MMP-9 and increasing NMDAR1 expression in the hippocampus. Taken together, this study suggests that DS could be a promising treatment for preventing cognitive impairments caused by neuroinflammation.

AB  - Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal and aggressive human malignancies, with no effective treatment currently available. The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is highly conserved in mammals and plays an important role in carcinogenesis. TAZ is one of major key effectors of the Hippo pathway. However, the mechanism supporting abnormal TAZ expression in ATC remains to be characterized. In the present study, we identified USP26, a DUB enzyme in the ubiquitin-specific proteases family, as a bona fide deubiquitylase of TAZ in ATC. USP26 was shown to interact with, deubiquitylate, and stabilize TAZ in a deubiquitylation activity-dependent manner. USP26 depletion significantly decreased ATC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The effects induced by USP26 depletion could be rescued by further TAZ overexpression. Depletion of USP26 decreased the TAZ protein level and the expression of TAZ/TEAD target genes in ATC, including CTGF, ANKRD1, and CYR61. In general, our findings establish a previously undocumented catalytic role for USP26 as a deubiquitinating enzyme of TAZ and provides a possible target for the therapy of ATC.

AB  - Stress can have profound consequences on mental health. While much is known about the neural circuits supporting associative memories of stressful events, our understanding of the circuits underlying the non- associative impacts of stress, such as heightened stress sensitivity and anxiety-related behavior, is limited. Here, we demonstrate that the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) support distinct non-associative behavioral changes following stress. Inhibiting stress-induced protein synthesis in the BLA blocked subsequent increases in stress sensitivity but not anxiety-related behaviors. Conversely, inhibiting stress-induced protein synthesis in the vHC blocked subsequent increases in anxiety-related behavior but not stress sensitivity. Inhibiting neuronal activity in the BLA and vHC during the assessment of stress sensitivity or anxiety-related behavior recapitulated these structures' dissociable contributions to defensive behavior. Lastly, blocking the associative memory of a stressor had no impact on stress-induced changes in anxiety-related behavior. These findings highlight that multiple memory systems support the long-lasting effects of stress.

AB  - Potentially druggable mechanisms underlying synaptic deficits seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are under intense interrogations. In addition to defective synaptic vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal disruption, autophagic perturbation, and neuroinflammation, hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2, also known as DPYSL2) is newly determined to correlate with synaptic deficits in human DLB. The small molecule experimental therapeutic, lanthionine ketimine-5-ethyl ester (LKE), appears to interact with CRMP2 in a host of neurodegenerative mouse models, normalizing its phosphorylation level while promoting healthful autophagy in cell culture models and suppressing the proinflammatory phenotype of activated microglia. Accordingly, this study examined the effect of LKE on alpha-synuclein A53T transgenic (Tg) mice which were employed as a DLB model. We found that chronic administration of LKE to A53T mice suppressed (1) the accumulation of LBs, (2) neuroinflammatory activation of microglia, (3) impairment of contextual fear memory, and (4) CRMP2 phosphorylation at Thr509 in A53T Tg mice. These results suggest that CRMP2 phosphorylation by GSK3 beta in the hippocampus is related to pathology and memory impairment in DLB, and LKE may have clinical implications in the treatment of alpha-synucleinopathy.

AB  - Camellia vietnamensis Huang, which belongs to Camellia oleifera, is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant widely planted on Hainan Island. Tea saponin is an important functional component of C. vietnamensis, and squalene is the precursor substance that controls its formation. Squalene synthase (SQS: EC 2.5.1.21) synthesizes squalene from 2 molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). In this study, 1683 bp of the C. vietnamensis SQS gene, designated as CvSQS, was cloned and encoded 414 amino acids. Bioinformatics and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed the high homology of CvSQS with squalene synthases from other plants. For soluble proteins, the carboxy-terminal deleted CvSQS was obtained for expression in Escherichia coli Transetta (DE3), and the recombinant protein with a weight of 42.5 kDa was detected using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. After an enzymatic reaction, the presence of squalene in the product was analyzed using GC-MS detection, which indicated that CvSQS had catalytic activity. The tissue specificity of CvSQS and its presence in seeds at various ripening stages was detected by q-RT PCR. CvSQS had the highest transcriptional level in leaves, followed by seeds, roots, and flowers; the amount of CvSQS in the seeds was highest in September. The identification and functional characterization of CvSQS is essential for further studies on the regulation mechanism of tea saponin in C. vietnamensis.

AB  - One of the traditional treatments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is administration of memantine, the NMDA receptor antagonist. However, the molecular mechanism of the complex memantine action and the impact on the hippocampal proteome in humans is unknown. In this study, hippocampal proteins extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded post mortem tissues obtained from healthy donors (n = 15), AD patients not treated with memantine (n = 11), and AD patients treated with memantine (n = 8) were investigated using tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. Memantine medication induced subtle but distinct changes in the hippocampal proteome in AD patients. Although it did not prevent the metabolic and physiologic decline associated with AD pathology, memantine administration upregulated several mitochondrially encoded proteins and mitigated the proteomic pattern of activated phagocytes. Furthermore, memantine specifically enhanced the expression of postsynaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors and components of the respective pathways without affecting presynaptic proteome. This suggests that memantine treatment in AD patients not only alleviates excitotoxic stress by inhibiting NMDA receptor activity, but also triggers broader adaptations in the synaptic signaling and plasticity.

AB  - ECM stiffness significantly influences the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), with YAP-a key transcription factor in the Hippo signaling pathway-playing a pivotal role. This study investigates the effects of ECM stiffness on ADSC differentiation and its relationship with YAP signaling. Various hydrogel concentrations were employed to simulate different levels of ECM stiffness, and their impact on ADSC differentiation was assessed through material properties, adipocyte-specific gene expression, lipid droplet staining, YAP localization, and protein levels. Our results demonstrated that increasing hydrogel stiffness enhanced adipocyte differentiation in a gradient manner. Notably, inhibiting YAP signaling further increased lipid droplet accumulation, suggesting that ECM stiffness influences adipogenesis by modulating YAP signaling and its cytoplasmic phosphorylation. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying ECM stiffness-dependent lipid deposition, highlighting YAP's regulatory role in adipogenesis. These findings provide valuable insights into the regulation of cell differentiation and have important implications for tissue engineering and obesity treatment strategies.

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to evaluate whether exogenous melatonin (MEL) mitigates the deleterious effects of high-dose caffeine (CAF) administration in pregnant rats upon the fetal hippocampus.Materials and methodsA total of 32 adult Wistar albino female rats were divided into four groups after conception (n = 8). At 9-20 days of pregnancy, intraperitoneal (i.p.) MEL was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day in the MEL group, while i.p. CAF was administered at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day in the CAF group. In the CAF plus MEL group, i.p. CAF and MEL were administered at a dose of 60 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively, at the same period. Following extraction of the brains of the fetuses sacrificed on the 21st day of pregnancy, their hippocampal regions were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin and Cresyl Echt Violet, anti-GFAP, and antisynaptophysin staining methods.ResultsWhile there was a decrease in fetal and brain weights in the CAF group, it was found that the CAF plus MEL group had a closer weight average to that of the control group. Histologically, it was observed that the pyramidal cell layer consisted of 8-10 layers of cells due to the delay in migration in hippocampal neurons in the CAF group, while the MEL group showed similar characteristics with the control group. It was found that these findings decreased in the CAF plus MEL group.ConclusionIt is concluded that high-dose CAF administration causes a delay in neurogenesis of the fetal hippocampus, and exogenous MEL is able to mitigate its deleterious effects.
   A high-dose caffeine (CAF) in pregnant rats caused a delay in migration of hippocampal neurons, but addition of exogenous melatonin was helpful in mitigating deleterious effects of the CAF. Thus, it is recommended that use of CAF should be limited during pregnancy to avoid its potential negative effects on the fetus. image

AB  - BackgroundMutations in the HERG potassium channel are a major cause of long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2), which can lead to sudden cardiac death. The HERG channel plays a critical role in the repolarization of the myocardial action potential, and loss-of-function mutations prolong cardiac repolarization.MethodsIn this study, we investigated the efficacy and underlying molecular mechanism of ICA-105574, an HERG activator, in shortening the duration of cardiac repolarization in severe LQT2 variants. We characterized the efficacy of ICA-105574 in vivo, using an animal model to assess its ability to shorten the QT interval and in vitro, in cellular models mimicking severe HERG channel mutations (A561V, G628S, and L779P) to evaluate its impact in enhancing IKr current. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of ICA-105574 action.ResultsIn vivo, ICA-105574 significantly shortened the QT interval. LQT2 mutations drastically reduced IKr amplitude and suppressed tail currents in cellular models. ICA-105574 restored IKr in A561V and G628S. Finally, in silico data showed that ICA-105574 stabilizes a pattern of interactions similar to gain-of-function SQT1 mutations and can reverse the G628S modifications, through an allosteric network linking the binding site to the selectivity filter and the S5P turret helix, thereby restoring its K+ ion permeability.ConclusionsOur results support the development of HERG activators like ICA-105574 as promising pharmacological molecules against some severe LQT2 mutations and suggest that molecular dynamics simulations can be used to test the ability of molecules to modulate HERG function in silico, paving the way for the rational design of new HERG activators.

AB  - Background. Hypoxia may induce mitochondrial abnormality, which is associated with a variety of clinical phenotypes in the central nervous system. Propofol is an anesthetic agent with neuroprotective property. We examined whether and how propofol protected hypoxia-induced mitochondrial abnormality in neurons. Methods. Primary rat hippocampal neurons were exposed to propofol followed by hypoxia treatment. Neuron viability, mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were measured. Mechanisms including reactive oxygen species (ROS), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), protein kinase A (PKA), HIF-1 alpha, Drp1, Fis1, Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1 were investigated. Results. Hypoxia increased intracellular ROS production and induced mPTP opening, while reducing ATP production, MMP values, and neuron viability. Hypoxia impaired mitochondrial dynamic balance by increasing mitochondrial fragmentation. Further, hypoxia induced the translocation of HIF-1 alpha and increased the expression of Drp1, while having no effect on Fis1 expression. In addition, hypoxia induced the phosphorylation of ERK and Drp1(ser616), while reducing the phosphorylation of PKA and Drp1(ser637). Importantly, we demonstrated all these effects were attenuated by pretreatment of neurons with 50 mu M propofol, antioxidant alpha-tocopherol, and ROS scavenger ebselen. Besides, hypoxia, propofol, alpha-tocopherol, or ebselen had no effect on the expression of Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1. Conclusions. In rat hippocampal neurons, hypoxia induced oxidative stress, caused mitochondrial dynamic imbalance and malfunction, and reduced neuron viability. Propofol protected mitochondrial abnormality and neuron viability via antioxidant property, and the molecular mechanisms involved HIF-1 alpha-mediated Drp1 expression and ERK/PKA-mediated Drp1 phosphorylation.

AB  - Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a critical complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is marked by metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation, ultimately progressing to heart failure. This study investigated the synergistic therapeutic potential of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (sea buckthorn, SBU) extract and metformin in a mouse model of T2DM-induced DCM. T2DM was induced using a 45% high-fat-AGEs-enriched diet, followed by treatment with SBU, metformin, or their combination. Treatment effects were monitored through bioinformatic analysis, chemoinformatic prediction, behavioral testing, biochemical assays, histopathological evaluations and gene expression profiles. Based on bioinformatic analysis, we identified key hub genes involved in the diabetic cardiomyopathy including SERPINE1, NRG1, MYH11, PTH, NR4A2, NRF2, PGC1 alpha, GPX4, ATF1, ASCL2, NOX1, NLRP3, CCK8, COX2, CCL2, PTGS2, EGFR, and oncostatin, which are pivotal in modulating the ferroptosis pathway. Furthermore, the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) NEAT1 and MALAT1, critical regulators of inflammation and cell death, was effectively downregulated, correlating with decreased levels of the pro-inflammatory marker oncostatin. The combined therapy significantly improved glucose regulation, reduced systemic inflammation and protected the heart from oxidative damage. Histopathological analysis revealed notable reductions in cardiac necrosis and fibrosis. Particularly, the combination therapy of SBU and metformin demonstrated a synergistic effect, surpassing the benefits of individual treatments in preventing cardiac damage. These findings highlight the potential of integrating SBU with metformin as a novel therapeutic strategy for managing DCM by targeting both metabolic and ferroptosis-related pathways. This dual intervention opens promising avenues for future clinical applications in diabetic heart disease management, offering a comprehensive approach to mitigating the progression of DCM.

AB  - Gut microbiota can influence cognitive ability via the gut-brain axis. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MWFLp-182 (L. plantarum MWFLp-182) was obtained from feces of long-living individuals and could exert marked antioxidant ability. Interestingly, this strain reduced the D-galactose-induced impaired cognitive ability in BALB/c mice. To comprehensively elucidate the underlying mechanism, we evaluated the colonization, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of L. plantarum MWFLp-182, along with the expression of potential genes associated with cognitive ability influenced and gut microbiota. L. plantarum MWFLp-182 enhanced the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased tight junction protein expression in the colon. Moreover, L. plantarum MWFLp-182 could modify the gut microbiota. Notably, treatment with L. plantarum MWFLp-182 upregulated the expression of postsynaptic density protein-95, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor, nerve growth factor, superoxide dismutase, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor/neuronal nuclei, while downregulating the expression of bcl-2-associated X and malondialdehyde in the hippocampus and upregulating short-chain fatty acids against D-galactose-induced mouse brain deficits. Accordingly, L. plantarum MWFLp-182 could improve cognitive ability in a D-galactose-inducing mouse model.

AB  - Biofilm formation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Candida albicans and is significantly associated with resistance to antifungal agents. Tea seed saponins, a class of non-ionic triterpenes, have been proven to have fungicidal effects on planktonic C. albicans. However, their anti-biofilm activity and mechanism of action against C. albicans remain unclear. In this study, the effects of three Camellia sinensis seed saponin monomers, namely, theasaponin E1 (TE1), theasaponin E2 (TE2), and assamsaponin A (ASA), on the metabolism, biofilm development, and expression of the virulence genes of C. albicans were evaluated. The results of the XTT reduction assay and crystal violet (CV) staining assay demonstrated that tea seed saponin monomers concentration-dependently suppressed the adhesion and biofilm formation of C. albicans and were able to eradicate mature biofilms. The compounds were in the following order in terms of their inhibitory effects: ASA > TE1 > TE2. The mechanisms were associated with reductions in multiple crucial virulence factors, including cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), adhesion ability, hyphal morphology conversion, and phospholipase activity. It was further demonstrated through qRT-PCR analysis that the anti-biofilm activity of ASA and TE1 against C. albicans was attributed to the inhibition of RAS1 activation, which consequently suppressed the cAMP-PKA and MAPK signaling pathways. Conversely, TE2 appeared to regulate the morphological turnover and hyphal growth of C. albicans via a pathway that was independent of RAS1. These findings suggest that tea seed saponin monomers are promising innovative agents against C. albicans.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by cognitive dysfunctions. Pharmacological interventions to slow the progression of AD are intensively studied. A potential direction targets neuronal sigma-1 receptors (S1Rs). S1R ligands are recognized as promising therapeutic agents that may alleviate symptom severity of AD, possibly via preventing amyloid-beta-(A beta-) induced neurotoxicity on the endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathways. Furthermore, S1Rs may also modulate adult neurogenesis, and the impairment of this process is reported to be associated with AD. We aimed to investigate the effects of two S1R agonists, dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and PRE084, in an A beta-induced in vivo mouse model characterizing neurogenic and anti-neuroinflammatory symptoms of AD, and the modulatory effects of S1R agonists were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods and western blotting. DMT, binding moderately to S1R but with high affinity to 5-HT receptors, negatively influenced neurogenesis, possibly as a result of activating both receptors differently. In contrast, the highly selective S1R agonist PRE084 stimulated hippocampal cell proliferation and differentiation. Regarding neuroinflammation, DMT and PRE084 significantly reduced A beta(1-42)-induced astrogliosis, but neither had remarkable effects on microglial activation. In summary, the highly selective S1R agonist PRE084 may be a promising therapeutic agent for AD. Further studies are required to clarify the multifaceted neurogenic and anti-neuroinflammatory roles of these agonists.

AB  - Zingerone (ZO), a nontoxic methoxyphenol, has been demonstrated to exert various important biological effects. However, its action on varying types of ionic currents and how they concert in neuronal cells remain incompletely understood. With the aid of patch clamp technology, we investigated the effects of ZO on the amplitude, gating, and hysteresis of plasmalemmal ionic currents from both pituitary tumor (GH(3)) cells and hippocampal (mHippoE-14) neurons. The exposure of the GH(3) cells to ZO differentially diminished the peak and late components of the I-Na. Using a double ramp pulse, the amplitude of the I-Na(P) was measured, and the appearance of a hysteresis loop was observed. Moreover, ZO reversed the tefluthrin-mediated augmentation of the hysteretic strength of the I-Na(P) and led to a reduction in the I-Ca,I-L. As a double ramp pulse was applied, two types of voltage-dependent hysteresis loops were identified in the I-Ca,I-L, and the replacement with BaCl2-attenuated hysteresis of the I-Ca,I-L enhanced the I-Ca,I-L amplitude along with the current amplitude (i.e., the I-Ba). The hysteretic magnitude of the I-Ca,I-L activated by the double pulse was attenuated by ZO. The peak and late I-Na in the hippocampal mHippoE-14 neurons was also differentially inhibited by ZO. In addition to acting on the production of reactive oxygen species, ZO produced effects on multiple ionic currents demonstrated herein that, considered together, may significantly impact the functional activities of neuronal cells.

AB  - Objectives Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), an essential cytokine belongs to TGF-beta superfamily, is crucial for female fertility. Increasing evidence show that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) influence the state of granulosa cells (GCs). This study aimed to detect the effects of TGF-beta 1 on the lncRNA transcriptome, and investigate whether lncRNAs mediate the functions of TGF-beta 1 in GCs. Material and Methods RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify and characterize the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). The regulatory mechanism of TGF-beta 1 to lncRNA transcriptome was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The effects of lncRNAs on the antiapoptotic and proproliferative functions of TGF-beta 1 were examined by morphological analysis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, Cell Counting Kit-8, and Western blot. Results A total of 72 DElncRNAs highly sensitive to TGF-beta 1 were identified with the criteria of |log(2)(fold chage)| >= 3 and false discovery rate < 0.05. Functional assessment showed that DElncRNAs were enriched in TGF-beta, nuclear factor kappa B, p53, and Hippo pathways which are crucial for the normal state and function of GCs. Importantly, SMAD4 is essential for the regulation of TGF-beta 1 to lncRNA transcriptome. In vitro studies confirmed that TGF-beta 1 induced TEX14-IT1 transcription in a SMAD4-dependent manner, and TEX14-IT1 mediated the antiapoptotic and proproliferative effects of TGF-beta 1 in GCs. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that TGF-beta 1 alters lncRNA transcriptome in a SMAD4-dependent manner, and highlight that lncRNAs mediate the functions of TGF-beta 1 in GCs, which contribute to a better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of female fertility.

AB  - Objective: Methadone is one of the widely used drug substances prescribed in treatment of opioid dependence and pain management; however, several studies have shown its neurotoxic effects on individuals and animal models. The purpose of this study was to assess neuroprotective effects of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on neurotoxicity induced by methadone in hippocampus of adult NMRI male mice.
   Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 48 adult NMRI male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=12 in each) including Methadone, Methadone with sesame oil, Methadone with CoQ10 and saline. The injections of methadone, saline and sesame oil were performed intraperitoneally for 20 days. 24 hours after last injection, half of the animals in each group (n=6) were randomly assessed for evaluating of spatial memory by radial maze. Following behavioral study, animals were sacrificed, and their brains were removed to evaluate pyknotic cells through histological assessment. The remaining were used to study the expression of Arc, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bdnf genes.
   Results: Results of the present study showed that daily administration of methadone increased the number of pyknotic neurons in the CA1 hippocampus and altered the expression of Bax, Bdnf, Arc and Bcl-2. However, it did not alter spatial memory comparing to saline group. CoQ10 treatment significantly reduced the number of pyknotic cells and expression of Bax, Bdnf, Arc when compared to the vehicle group treated by sesame oil. However, the expression of Bcl-2 significantly increased as a result of CoQ10 treatment.
   Conclusion: CoQ10 reduced the neuronal damage caused by methadone in the hippocampus CA1.

AB  - This study underlines the importance of (3-hydroxy (3-methylbutyrate (HMB), a muscle-building supplement in human, in increasing mouse hippocampal plasticity. Detailed proteomic analyses reveal that HMB serves as a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa), a nuclear hormone receptor involved in fat metabolism, via interaction with the Y314 residue. Accordingly, HMB is ineffective in increasing plasticity of PPARa-/- hippocampal neurons. While lentiviral establishment of full-length PPARa restores the plasticity promoting effect of HMB in PPARa-/- hippocampal neurons, lentiviral transduction of Y314D-PPARa remains unable to do that, highlighting the importance of HMB's interaction with the Y314 residue. Additionally, oral HMB improves spatial learning and memory and reduces plaque load in 5X familial Alzheimer's disease (5XFAD) mice, but not in 5XFADDPPARa mice (5XFAD lacking PPARa), indicating the involvement of PPARa in HMB-mediated neuroprotection in 5XFAD mice. These results delineate neuroprotective functions of HMB and suggest that this widely used supplement may be repurposed for AD.

AB  - Rapid and accurate detection of Camellia oleifera fruit is beneficial to improve the picking efficiency. However, detection faces new challenges because of the complex field environment. A Camellia oleifera fruit detection method based on YOLOv7 network and multiple data augmentation was proposed to detect Camellia oleifera fruit in complex field scenes. Firstly, the images of Camellia oleifera fruit were collected in the field to establish training and test sets. Detection performance was then compared among YOLOv7, YOLOv5s, YOLOv3-spp and Faster R-CNN networks. The YOLOv7 network with the best performance was selected. A DA-YOLOv7 model was established via the YOLOv7 network combined with various data augmentation methods. The DA-YOLOv7 model had the best detection performance and a strong generalisation ability in complex scenes, with mAP, Precision, Recall, F1 score and average detection time of 96.03%, 94.76%, 95.54%, 95.15% and 0.025 s per image, respectively. Therefore, YOLOv7 combined with data augmentation can be used to detect Camellia oleifera fruit in complex scenes. This study provides a theoretical reference for the detection and harvesting of crops under complex conditions.

AB  - Objectives of the present study were to investigate the characteristics including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, as determined by Brilliant Cresyl Blue (BCB) staining, of suboptimal porcine oocytes and to enhance the meiotic competence of those through pre-culture with cumulus cell masses (CCMs). Percentage of oocyte-cumulus complexes (OCCs) derived from small follicles (SF; <3 mm in diameter) containing the oocytes that were assessed as BCB-negative (BCB-) was significantly higher than those derived from medium follicles (MF; 3-6 mm in diameter). Degrees of dead cumulus cells were significantly higher in OCCs containing BCB- oocytes, regardless of the origin of OCCs (MF vs. SF), than those containing BCB-positive (BCB+) ones. Exposing OCCs containing BCB+ oocytes to the apoptosis inducer, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, for 20 h significantly induced the transition to BCB- and meiotic progression of exposed OCCs were significantly reduced in both SF and MF derived ones. Transit of BCB- oocytes to BCB+ was induced when OCCs were pre-cultured with CCMs of MF derived OCCs containing BCB+ oocytes for 20 h before IVM. This pre-culture also significantly increased the meiotic competence of BCB- oocytes, particularly in SF derived ones. However, reactive oxygen species levels were significantly higher in BCB+ oocytes as compared with BCB- ones, regardless of pre-culture with CCMs, whereas no significant differences were found in the ATP contents among the treatment groups. In conclusion, the BCB result of oocytes could be regulated by the healthy status and content of surrounding cumulus cells and the meiotic competence of suboptimal BCB- porcine oocytes is improved by pre-culture with healthy CCMs.

AB  - The gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor may participate in the development of diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP). BHF177 serves as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(B) receptor. In the current study, we sought to study the role of the BHF177-GABA(B) receptor in DNP and its underlying mechanism. Streptozotocin was adopted to induce a rat model of DNP, followed by determination of the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT), paw withdrawal latency (PWL), and glucose level. The effect of BHF177 on DNP by regulating the GABA(B) receptor in vivo was determined by the injection of BHF177 and/or CGP46381 (a GABA(B) receptor antagonist) into rat models of DNP. Hippocampal neuronal cells were isolated and cultured, and the neurons and DNP model rats were treated with activators of PKC (PMA), CaMKII (CaCl2), or ERK1/2 (EGF) to study the role of GABA(B) receptors in DNP via regulation of the NR2B-PKC-CaMKII-ERK-CREB pathway. BHF177 suppressed DNP symptoms by activating the GABA(B) receptors, as evidenced by increased PWT and PWL of DNP rats and the increased number of neurons expressing the GABA(B) receptor, but this effect was reversed by CGP46381 treatment. BHF177 treatment markedly repressed PKC, CaMKII, p-ERK1/2, and p-CREB expressions in the rat DNP model, but these suppressive effects were abrogated by treatments with PMA, CaCl2, or EGF treatment, respectively. To sum up, BHF177 suppresses DNP symptoms by blocking the PKC/CaMKII/ERK1/2/CREB signaling pathway to activate the GABA(B) receptors.

AB  - Cultivating drought -tolerant tea varieties enhances both yield and quality of tea plants in northern China. However, the mechanisms underlying their drought tolerance remain largely unknown. Here we identified a key regulator called CsREV , which differentially regulates xylem patterns between leaves and stems, thereby conferring drought tolerance in tea plants. When drought occurs, upregulation of CsREV activates the CsVND7a -dependent xylem vessel differentiation. However, when drought persists, the vessel differentiation is hindered as CsVND7a is downregulated by CsTCP4a. This, combined with the CsREV-promoted secondary -cell -wall thickness of xylem vessel, leads to the enhanced curling of leaves, a characteristic closely associated with plant drought tolerance. Notably, this inhibitory effect of CsTCP4a on CsVND7a expression is absent in stems, allowing stem xylem vessels to continuously differentiate. Overall, the CsREV - CsTCP4 - CsVND7 module is differentially utilized to shape the xylem patterns in leaves and stems, potentially balancing water transportation and utilization to improve tea plant drought tolerance.

AB  - Damaged mitochondria accumulation in diabetes is one of the main features that contribute to increased incidence of cognitive impairment by inducing apoptosis. Butyrate is a major metabolite produced by microbiota that has neuroprotective effects by regulating mitochondrial function. However, detailed mechanisms underlying how butyrate can regulate neuronal mitophagy remain unclear. Here, we examined the regulatory effects of sodium butyrate (NaB) on high glucose-induced mitophagy dysregulation, neuronal apoptosis, and cognitive impairment and its underlying mechanisms in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, SH-SY5Ys, and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. In our results, diabetic mice showed gut-microbiota dysbiosis, especially a decreased number of butyrate-producing bacteria and reduced NaB plasma concentration. NaB ameliorated high glucose-induced neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction by recovering PRKN/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. High glucose-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and -inhibited PRKAA/AMPK alpha stimulated the RELA/p65-HDAC8 complex, which downregulated PRKN protein expression by binding to the PRKN promoter region. NaB restored PRKN expression by blocking RELA nuclear translocation and directly inhibiting HDAC8 in the nucleus. In addition, HDAC8 overexpression inhibited the positive effect of NaB on high glucose-induced mitophagy dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. Oral administration of NaB improved cognitive impairment in diabetic mice by restoring mitophagy in the hippocampus. Taken together, NaB ameliorates neuronal mitophagy through PRKN restoration by inhibiting RELA-HDAC8 complexes, suggesting that NaB is an important substance for protecting neuronal apoptosis in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica L. Mill) is widely cultivated in arid regions of every continent for its nutritious fruits and various commercial applications, cactus pear cladodes are used as forage in the most arid regions, while recently prickly pear by-products are studied as ruminant feed. They are characterised by a high moisture and sugar content; therefore, it is necessary to study suitable conservation methods. The aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of silage to preserve prickly pear peels (PP) in a mixture with other by-products at different inclusion levels (5% straw and 6% or 12% wheat bran). For each treatment, six under vacuum micro-silos were prepared and, after 40 d of storage, the state of preservation was evaluated. Subsequently, the aliquots were analysed for chemical composition and incubated with sheep rumen fluid to evaluate the fermentation kinetics. The use of wheat bran and straw added to PP resulted in an increase in dry matter (DM); PP silage with wheat bran was found to have higher protein content and nutritional value. The greater presence of lactic acid was found in PP, such as acetic acid, therefore the lactic/acetic ratio was 2.33, significantly lower than silages with the addition of wheat bran. Silage with 5% straw showed the lowest level of organic matter disappearance (OMD) and the cumulative volume of gas (OMCV) produced during the incubation. The PP showed the fastest fermentation rate achieved after 12 h of fermentation, while those containing wheat bran, presented a higher maximum fermentation rate (R-max), which need longer time to be achieved. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) showed clear discrimination of different silages based on their chemical characteristics and parameters detected during in vitro incubation. Overall, the silages with the addition of wheat bran can be considered the best and, of the two, those produced with the addition of 12% bran. Finally, ensilage represents a conservation technique suitable for preserving the nutritional characteristics of PP.
   HIGHLIGHTS
   Ensiling is a good way to storage the PP by-product.
   Adding 12% wheat bran to PP had the best effects on silage.
   Simultaneous ensiling of several by-products is a good method for preserving agri-food by-products.

AB  - The physiological crosstalk between glucocorticoid and melatonin maintains neuronal homeostasis in regulating circadian rhythms. However, the stress-inducing level of glucocorticoid triggers mitochondrial dysfunction including defective mitophagy by increasing the activity of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), leading to neuronal cell death. Melatonin then suppresses glucocorticoid-induced stress-responsive neurodegeneration; however, the regulatory mechanism of melatonin, i.e., associated proteins involved in GR activity, has not been elucidated. Therefore, we investigated how melatonin regulates chaperone proteins related to GR trafficking into the nucleus to suppress glucocorticoid action. In this study, the effects of glucocorticoid on suppressing NIX-mediated mitophagy, followed by mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal cell apoptosis, and cognitive deficits were reversed by melatonin treatment by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of GRs in both SH-SY5Y cells and mouse hippocampal tissue. Moreover, melatonin selectively suppressed the expression of FKBP prolyl isomerase 4 (FKBP4), which is a co-chaperone protein that works with dynein, to reduce the nuclear translocation of GRs among the chaperone proteins and nuclear trafficking proteins. In both cells and hippocampal tissue, melatonin upregulated melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) bound to G alpha q, which triggered the phosphorylation of ERK1. The activated ERK then enhanced DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated hypermethylation of FKBP52 promoter, reducing GR-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis, the effects of which were reversed by knocking down DNMT1. Taken together, melatonin has a protective effect against glucocorticoid-induced defective mitophagy and neurodegeneration by enhancing DNMT1-mediated FKBP4 downregulation that reduced the nuclear translocation of GRs.

AB  - Serine/threonine kinases (STK3) is a core component of the Hippo pathway and modulates oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in cardiovascular diseases. However, its potential role in septic cardiomyopathy remains undefined. STK3-mediated phosphorylation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) was shown to suppress antioxidant gene transcription controlled by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in macrophages. To explore whether STK3 induces KEAP1-mediated suppression of Nrf2 in septic cardiomyopathy, wild-type and global STK3 knockout (STK3-/-) mice were treated with LPS. LPS treatment upregulated cardiac STK3 expression. STK3 deletion attenuated myocardial inflammation and cardiomyocyte death, and improved myocardial structure and function. In LPS-challenged HL-1 cardiomyocytes, shRNA-mediated STK3 knockdown normalized mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, attenuated apoptosis, and rescued antioxidant gene expression by preventing Nrf2 downregulation. Co-IP, docking analysis, western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays further showed that STK3 binds and phosphorylates KEAP1, promoting Nrf2 downregulation. Accordingly, transfection of phosphodefective KEAP1 mutant protein in cardiomyocyte restored Nrf2 expression and mitochondrial performance upon LPS, while expression of a phosphomimetic KEAP1 mutant abolished the mitochondria-protective and pro-survival effects of STK3 deletion. These findings suggest that STK3 upregulation contributes to septic cardiomyopathy by phosphorylating KEAP1 to promote Nrf2 degradation and suppression of the antioxidant response.

AB  - Adolescent stress is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Emerging evidence suggests that age-dependent sensitive windows for childhood trauma are associated more strongly with adult psychosis, but the neurobiological basis and potential sex differences are unknown. Using in vivo electrophysiology and immunohistology in rats, we systematically compared the effects of two age-defined adolescent stress paradigms, prepubertal (postnatal day [PD] 21-30; PreP-S) and postpubertal (PD41-50; PostP-S) foot-shock and restraint combined stress, on ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic activity, pyramidal neuron activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), corticoamygdalar functional inhibitory control, and vHipp and BLA parvalbumin interneuron (PVI) impairments. These endpoints were selected based on their well-documented roles in the pathophysiology of psychosis. Overall, we found distinct sex- and exposure age-dependent stress vulnerability. Specifically, while males were selectively vulnerable to PreP-S-induced adult VTA dopamine neuron and vHipp hyperactivities, females were selectively vulnerable to PostP-S. These male selective PreP-S effects were correlated with stress-induced aberrant persistent BLA hyperactivity, dysfunctional prefrontal inhibitory control of BLA neurons, and vHipp/BLA PVI impairments. In contrast, female PostP-S only produced vHipp PVI impairments in adults, with the BLA structure and functions largely unaffected. Our results indicated distinct adolescent-sensitive periods during which stress can sex-dependently confer maximal risks to corticolimbic systems to drive dopamine hyperactivity, which provide critical insights into the neurobiological basis for sex-biased stress-related psychopathologies emphasizing but not limited to schizophrenia. Furthermore, our work also provides a framework for future translational research on age-sensitive targeted interventions.

AB  - An established technology to create cloned animals is through the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), in which reprogramming the somatic cell nucleus to a totipotent state by enucleated oocyte cytoplasm is a necessary process, including telomere length reprogramming. The limitation of this technology; however, is that the live birth rate of offspring produced through SCNT is significantly lower than that of IVF. Whether and how telomere length play a role in the development of cloned animals is not well understood. Only a few studies have evaluated this association in cloned mice, and fewer still in cloned cows. In this study, we investigated the difference in telomere length as well as the abundance of some selected molecules between newborn deceased cloned calves and normal cows of different ages either produced by SCNT or via natural conception, in order to evaluate the association between telomere length and abnormal development of cloned cows. The absolute telomere length and relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number were determined by real -time quantitative PCR (qPCR), telomere related gene abundance by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) expression by SA-beta-gal staining. The results demonstrate that the newborn deceased SCNT calves had significantly shortened telomere lengths compared to newborn naturally conceived calves and newborn normal SCNT calves. Significantly lower mtDNA copy number, and significantly lower relative abundance of LMNB1 and TERT, higher relative abundance of CDKN1A, and aberrant SA-beta-gal expression were observed in the newborn deceased SCNT calves, consistent with the change in telomere length. These results demonstrate that abnormal telomere shortening, lower mtDNA copy number and abnormal abundance of related genes were specific to newborn deceased SCNT calves, suggesting that abnormally short telomere length may be associated with abnormal development in the cloned calves.

AB  - This study explores low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy (LiESWT)'s efficacy in alleviating detrusor hyperactivity with impaired contractility (DHIC) induced by ovarian hormone deficiency (OHD) in ovariectomized rats. The rats were categorized into the following four groups: sham group; OVX group, subjected to bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) for 12 months to induce OHD; OVX + SW4 group, underwent OHD for 12 months followed by 4 weeks of weekly LiESWT; and OVX + SW8 group, underwent OHD for 12 months followed by 8 weeks of weekly LiESWT. Cystometrogram studies and voiding behavior tracing were used to identify the symptoms of DHIC. Muscle strip contractility was evaluated through electrical-field, carbachol, ATP, and KCl stimulations. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses were performed to assess the expressions of various markers related to bladder dysfunction. The OVX rats exhibited significant bladder deterioration and overactivity, alleviated by LiESWT. LiESWT modified transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channel expression, regulating calcium concentration and enhancing bladder capacity. It also elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins, influencing ER-related Ca2+ channels and receptors to modulate detrusor muscle contractility. OHD after 12 months led to neuronal degeneration and reduced TRPV1 and TRPV4 channel activation. LiESWT demonstrated potential in enhancing angiogenic remodeling, neurogenesis, and receptor response, ameliorating DHIC via TRPV channels and cellular signaling in the OHD-induced DHIC rat model.

AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) offer mechanical support for patients with cardiogenic shock by unloading the impaired ventricle and increasing cardiac outflow and subsequent tissue perfusion. Their ability to adjust ventricular assistance allows for rapid and safe dynamic changes in cardiac load, which can be used with direct measures of chamber pressures to quantify cardiac pathophysiologic state, predict response to interventions, and unmask vulnerabilities such as limitations of left-sided support efficacy due to intolerance of the right heart. We defined hemodynamic metrics in five pigs with dynamic peripheral transvalvular VAD (pVAD) support to the left ventricle. Metrics were obtained across a spectrum of disease states, including left ventricular ischemia induced by titrated microembolization of a coronary artery and right ventricular strain induced by titrated microembolization of the pulmonary arteries. A sweep of different pVAD speeds confirmed mechanisms of right heart decompensation after left-sided support and revealed intolerance. In contrast to the systemic circulation, pulmonary vascular compliance dominated in the right heart and defined the ability of the right heart to adapt to left-sided pVAD unloading. We developed a clinically accessible metric to measure pulmonary vascular compliance at different pVAD speeds that could predict right heart efficiency and tolerance to left-sided pVAD support. Findings in swine were validated with retrospective hemodynamic data from eight patients on pVAD support. This methodology and metric could be used to track right heart tolerance, predict decompensation before right heart failure, and guide titration of device speed and the need for biventricular support.

AB  - The chemical composition, in vitro total gas and CH4 production and performance of cattle fed on factory black tea waste (Camellia sinensis) (BTW), alfalfa (Medicago Sativa), sainfoin (Onobrychis sativa) and white clover (Trifolium repens) was investigated. The gas production was quantified at the 24th hour of the incubation process. BTW was found to vary from roughages in chemical composition (p < 0.05). In addition, the roughages differed in terms of nutrient composition and gas production (p < 0.05). In legume roughages, acetic acid (AA), propionic acid (PA), butyric acid (BA), and total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) values ranged from 52.36-57.00 mmol/L, 13.46-17.20 mmol/L, 9.79-12.43 mmol/L, and 79.71-89.05 mmol/L, respectively. In comparison with black tea waste, legume roughages had higher values of AA, PA, BA, and TVFA. Black tea waste contained a higher acetic acid ratio than legume roughages when compared as a percentage. There was a similar ratio of propionic acid to the rate calculated for sainfoin (Onobrychis sativa) and clover (Trifolium repens), and a similar ratio of butyric acid to the ratio determined for alfalfa (Medicago Sativa). The current study shows that the 5.7-6.3% tannin content of black tea waste can be used in ruminant rations with high-quality roughages. Due to the fact that BTW reduces methane emissions from ruminants and eliminates energy waste from them, the environment can be improved. To obtain more reliable results, further animal feeding experiments on legume roughages and BTW are required.

AB  - Maternal separation (MS) is a key contributor to neurodevelopmental disorders, including learning disabilities. To test the hypothesis that dopamine signaling is a major factor in this, an atypical new dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitor, CE-123, was assessed for its potential to counteract the MS-induced spatial learning and memory deficit in male and female rats. Hence, neonatal rats (postnatal day (PND)1 to 21) were exposed to MS (180 min/day). Next, the acquisition of spatial learning and memory (Barnes maze task) and the expression of dopamine D1 receptor, dopamine transporter (DAT), and the neuronal GTPase, RIT2, which binds DAT in the vehicle-treated rats were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the adolescent animals. The results show that MS impairs the acquisition of spatial learning and memory in rats, with a more severe effect in females. Moreover, the MS induced upregulation of DAT and dopamine D1 receptors expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in adolescent rats. Regarding RIT2, the expression was decreased in the hippocampus for both the males and females, however, in the prefrontal cortex, reduction was found only in the females, suggesting that there are region-specific differences in DAT endocytic trafficking. CE-123 ameliorated the behavioral deficits associated with MS. Furthermore, it decreased the MS-induced upregulation of D1 receptor expression level in the hippocampus. These effects were more noted in females. Overall, CE-123, an atypical DAT inhibitor, is able to restore cognitive impairment and dopamine signaling in adolescent rats exposed to MS-with more evident effect in females than males.

AB  - The term neuroinflammation defines the reactions of astrocytes and microglia to alterations in homeostasis in the diseased central nervous system (CNS), the exacerbation of which contributes to the neurodegenerative effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Local environmental conditions, such as the presence of proinflammatory molecules, mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and local cell-cell interactions, are determinants of glial cell phenotypes. In AD, the load of the cytotoxic/proinflammatory amyloid beta (A beta) peptide is a microenvironmental component increasingly growing in the CNS, imposing time-evolving challenges on resident cells. This study aimed to investigate the temporal and spatial variations of the effects produced by this process on astrocytes and microglia, either directly or by interfering in their interactions. Ex vivo confocal analyses of hippocampal sections from the mouse model TgCRND8 at different ages have shown that overproduction of A beta peptide induced early and time-persistent disassembly of functional astroglial syncytium and promoted a senile phenotype of reactive microglia, hindering A beta clearance. In the late stages of the disease, these patterns were altered in the presence of A beta-plaques, surrounded by typically reactive astrocytes and microglia. Morphofunctional characterization of peri-plaque gliosis revealed a direct contribution of astrocytes in plaque buildup that might result in shielding A beta-peptide cytotoxicity and, as a side effect, in exacerbating neuroinflammation.

AB  - Melatonin is an endogenous indoleamine that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including the sleep-wake cycle, anxiety, immunity, and circadian rhythms. However, it is important to clarify that melatonin does not directly control circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are primarily synchronized by light, which acts on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and subsequently regulates melatonin production. This light-mediated synchronization of circadian rhythms is essential for maintaining the alignment of the body with the light-dark cycle. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of melatonin administration during different times of the day or night and explored its neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, we aimed to apply these findings to rodent models of dementia, aging, and neuro-inflammation for potential therapeutic applications. Our study uncovered novel evidence suggesting the involvement of RNA-binding motif protein (RBM)-47 and Nrf2 in the signaling pathways associated with melatonin administration during both day and night. We examined the role of RBM47 in Nrf2 activity through siRNA or CRISPR-mediated knockdown experiments using hippocampal neuronal cells and lentivirus injections in mice. In 5xFAD/aging/neuroinflammatory mouse models, antioxidant effects were enhanced when melatonin was administered during the day compared to nighttime administration. Furthermore, mRNA analysis and molecular biology experiments revealed the differential expression of RBM47 depending on the timing of melatonin administration. These findings suggest that a decrease in RBM47 expression may improve the antioxidant defense system in the hippocampus. Consequently, administering melatonin during the day rather than at night may present a plausible therapeutic strategy as an antioxidant.

AB  - Interpretations of Late Pleistocene hominin adaptative capacities by archaeologists have focused heavily on their exploitation of certain prey and documented contemporary behaviours for these species. However, we cannot assume that animal prey-taxa ecology and ethology were the same in the past as in the present, or were constant over archaeological timescales. Sequential isotope analysis of herbivore teeth has emerged as a particularly powerful method of directly reconstructing diet, ecology and mobility patterns on sub-annual scales. Here, we apply 87Sr/86Sr isotope analysis, in combination with delta 18O and delta 13C isotope analysis, to sequentially sampled tooth enamel of prevalent herbivore species that populated Europe during the Last Glacial Period, including Rangifer tarandus, Equus sp. and Mammuthus primigenius. Our samples come from two open-air archaeological sites in Central Germany, K & ouml;nigsaue and Breitenbach, associated with Middle Palaeolithic and early Upper Palaeolithic cultures, respectively. We identify potential inter- and intra-species differences in range size and movement through time, contextualised through insights into diet and the wider environment. However, homogeneous bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr across large parts of the study region prevented the identification of specific migration routes. Finally, we discuss the possible influence of large-herbivore behaviour on hominin hunting decisions at the two sites.
   Using multi-isotope analysis of tooth enamel of reindeer, equids and mammoth from the archaeological sites of K & ouml;nigsaue and Breitenbach, the authors identify shifts in ranging behaviour of these hominin prey species during the Last Glacial Period in Central Germany.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has emerged as an endogenous signaling molecule that functions in many physiological and pathological processes of human cells in health and disease, including neuromodulation and neuro-protection, inflammation, angiogenesis, and vasorelaxation. The limited clinical applications of current H2S donors have led to the development of H2S donor hybrid compounds that combine current H2S donors with bioactive molecules. Finely tuned multi-targeting hybrid molecules have been shown to have complementary neuroprotective effects against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stress. In this study, we devel-oped hybrid molecules combining a dithiolethione-based slow-releasing H2S donor that exerts neuroprotective effects, with the tripeptides glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine (GHK) and L-alanyl-L-cystinyl-L-glutamine (ACQ), two natural products that exhibit powerful antioxidant effects. In particular, a hybrid combination of a dithiolethione-based slow-releasing H2S donor and ACQ exhibited significant neuroprotective effects against glutamate-induced oxidative damage in HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. This hybrid remarkably suppressed Ca2+ accumulation and ROS production. Furthermore, it efficiently inhibited apoptotic neuronal cell death by blocking apoptosis-inducing factor release and its translocation to the nucleus. These results indicate that the hybrid efficiently inhibited apoptotic neuronal cell damage by complementary neuroprotective actions.

AB  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation by environmental agents and microbial metabolites is potentially implicated in a series of skin diseases. Hence, it would be very important to identify natural compounds that could inhibit the AhR activation by ligands of microbial origin as 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), indirubin (IND) and pityriazepin (PZ) or the prototype ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Five different dry Rosmarinus officinalis L. extracts (ROEs) were assayed for their activities as antagonists of AhR ligand binding with guinea pig cytosol in the presence of [H-3]TCDD. The methanolic ROE was further assayed towards CYP1A1 mRNA induction using RT-PCR in human keratinocytes against TCDD, FICZ, PZ, and IND. The isolated metabolites, carnosic acid, carnosol, 7-O-methyl-epi-rosmanol, 4 ',7-O-dimethylapigenin, and betulinic acid, were assayed for their agonist and antagonist activity in the presence and absence of TCDD using the gel retardation assay (GRA). All assayed ROE extracts showed similar dose-dependent activities with almost complete inhibition of AhR activation by TCDD at 100 ppm. The methanol ROE at 10 ppm showed 99%, 50%, 90%, and 85% inhibition against TCDD, FICZ, IND, and PZ, respectively, in human keratinocytes. Most assayed metabolites exhibited dose-dependent antagonist activity. ROEs inhibit AhR activation by TCDD and by the Malassezia metabolites FICZ, PZ, and IND. Hence, ROE could be useful for the prevention or treatment of skin diseases mediated by activation of AhR.

AB  - Activity-dependent regulation of intrinsic excitability has been shown to greatly contribute to the overall plasticity of neuronal circuits. Such neuroadaptations are commonly investigated in patch clamp experiments using current step stimulation and the resulting input-output functions are analyzed to quantify alterations in intrinsic excitability. However, it is rarely addressed, how such changes translate to the function of neurons when they operate under natural synaptic inputs. Still, it is reasonable to expect that a strong correlation and near proportional relationship exist between static firing responses and those evoked by synaptic drive. We challenge this view by performing a high-yield electrophysiological analysis of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons using both standard protocols and simulated synaptic inputs via dynamic clamp. We find that under these conditions the neurons exhibit vastly different firing responses with surprisingly weak correlation between static and dynamic firing intensities. These contrasting responses are regulated by two intrinsic K-currents mediated by Kv1 and K-ir channels, respectively. Pharmacological manipulation of the K-currents produces differential regulation of the firing output of neurons. Static firing responses are greatly increased in stuttering type neurons under blocking their Kv1 channels, while the synaptic responses of the same neurons are less affected. Pharmacological blocking of K-ir-channels in delayed firing type neurons, on the other hand, exhibit the opposite effects. Our subsequent computational model simulations confirm the findings in the electrophysiological experiments and also show that adaptive changes in the kinetic properties of such currents can even produce paradoxical regulation of the firing output.
   Author summaryMost action potentials that neurons emit during their lifetime are produced by a dynamic interplay between the synaptic inputs and the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron. Activity-dependent or neuromodulatory changes targeting these intrinsic properties effectively regulate intrinsic excitability of the neurons and how they integrate synaptic input into firing output. Electrophysiologists mostly employ current step protocols in whole-cell patch clamp experiments to identify such changes in intrinsic excitability and to estimate the underlying functional consequences. In the present study we investigate the firing output of hundreds of hippocampal neurons under standard current step stimulation and when they are bombarded by simulated synaptic inputs via dynamic clamp. Our experiments show that firing intensity values in the two scenarios exhibit a surprisingly low correlation, hence, static firing responses yield poor predictive power to estimate firing responses under synaptic inputs. We also show in electrophysiological experiments and computer simulations that two voltage-dependent K-currents mediated by Kv1 and K-ir-channels in stuttering and delayed firing type neurons, respectively, play a key role in regulating these differential firing responses.

AB  - Introduction Fustin, a photogenic flavanol found in the plant Rhus verniciflua Stokes, has been involved in multiple disease ailments and has a beneficial pharmacological effect and a history of use in traditional medicine. The present research aimed to study the impact of fustin on scopolamine (SCOP)-induced memory impairment and neurodegeneration by modulating neuroinflammation and neurotransmitters in rats.Methods A total of 30 healthy Wistar rats were allocated into five groups (n=6). Group I- served as control and received saline solution (1mL/kg i.p.), group -II- fustin (100 mg/kg, orally), group -III -SCOP (1 mg/kg, i.p.), and group -IV and V were given fustin (50 and 100 mg/kg/p.o.) with SCOP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14-days. After 14 days, 2 hours after SCOP injection, the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed. After behavioral tests rats were subsequently euthanized, and brain supernatants were used to estimate choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), antioxidant [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH)], and total protein, oxidative stress markers [nitrate and malondialdehyde (MDA)], pro-inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and Interleukins-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-6]. Also, neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), Upsilon-amino butyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine (Ach), and noradrenaline (NA) contents were performed.Results Fustin exhibited substantial behavioral improvement in the Y-maze measures spontaneous alterations percentage (SA%) and decreased latency time following the acquisition and prolonged time spent in the probe trial in the MWM test. Moreover, fustin inhibits enhanced neuroinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers and improves the neurotransmitters.Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that fustin inhibits SCOP impact on cognitive abilities in rats. The present investigation demonstrates that fustin, a potent phytochemical, effectively mitigated the behavioral and physiological changes induced by SCOP in rats. This was primarily achieved by modulating the levels of inflammatory response and neurotransmitters.

AB  - Phoenixin-14 (PNX), initially discovered in the rat hypothalamus, was also detected in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, where its involvement in the regulation of pain and/or itch sensation was suggested. However, there is a lack of data not only on its distribution in DRGs along individual segments of the spinal cord, but also on the pattern(s) of its co-occurrence with other sensory neurotransmitters. To fill the above-mentioned gap and expand our knowledge about the occurrence of PNX in mammalian species other than rodents, this study examined (i) the pattern(s) of PNX occurrence in DRG neurons of subsequent neuromeres along the porcine spinal cord, (ii) their intraganglionic distribution and (iii) the pattern(s) of PNX co-occurrence with other biologically active agents. PNX was found in approximately 20% of all nerve cells of each DRG examined; the largest subpopulation of PNX-positive (PNX+) cells were small-diameter neurons, accounting for 74% of all PNX-positive neurons found. PNX+ neurons also co-contained calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; 96.1%), substance P (SP; 88.5%), nitric oxide synthase (nNOS; 52.1%), galanin (GAL; 20.7%), calretinin (CRT; 10%), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP; 7.4%), cocaine and amphetamine related transcript (CART; 5.1%) or somatostatin (SOM; 4.7%). Although the exact function of PNX in DRGs is not yet known, the high degree of co-localization of this peptide with the main nociceptive transmitters SP and CGRP may suggests its function in modulation of pain transmission.

AB  - Xanthohumol (XN) improves cognition of wild-type rodents on a high -fat diet (HFD). Bile acids and ceramide levels in the liver and hippocampus might be linked to these effects. XN modulates activity of the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR; also known as NR1H4), the primary receptor for bile acids. To determine the role of FXR in the liver and intestine in mediating the effects of XN on cognitive performance, mice with intestine-and liver-specific FXR ablation (FXRIntestine-/- and FXRLiver-/-, respectively) on an HFD or an HFD containing XN were cognitively tested. XN improved cognitive performance in a genotype-and sex-dependent manner, with improved task learning in females (specifically wild-type), reversal learning in males (specifically wild-type and FXRIntestine-/- mutant) and spatial learning (both sexes). XN increased hippocampal diacylglycerol and sphingomyelin levels in females but decreased them in males. XN increased the ratio of shorter-chain to longer -chain ceramides and hexaceramides. Higher diacylglycerol and lower longer-chain ceramide and hexaceramide levels were linked to improved cognitive performance. Thus, the beneficial sex-dependent cognitive effects of XN are linked to changes in hippocampal diacylglycerol and ceramide levels.

AB  - The cytosolic proteins synucleins and synapsins are thought to play cooperative roles in regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling, but mechanistic insight is lacking. Here, we identify the synapsin E-domain as an essential functional binding-partner of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). Synapsin E-domain allows alpha-syn functionality, binds to alpha-syn, and is necessary and sufficient for enabling effects of alpha-syn at synapses of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Together with previous studies implicating the E-domain in clustering SVs, our experiments advocate a cooperative role for these two proteins in maintaining physiologic SV clusters.

AB  - TRAIL, a member of TNF superfamily, is a potent inducer of neuronal death. Neurotoxic effects of TRAIL appear mediated by its death receptor TRAIL-R2/DR5. To assess the role of TRAIL/TRAIL-R2 pathway in AD-related neurodegeneration, we studied the impact of the treatment with amyloid-beta (A beta) upon cell viability and inflammation in TRAIL-R-deficient mice (TRAIL-R-/-). Here, we demonstrate that the lack of TRAIL-R2 protects from death cultured TRAIL-R-/- mouse embryonic hippocampal cells after treatment with either A beta 1-42 or TRAIL. Consistently, stereotaxic injection of A beta 1-42 resulted in blunted caspase activation, as well as in reduction of JNK phosphorylation and increased AKT phosphorylation in TRAIL-R-/- mice. Moreover, the lack of TRAIL-R2 was associated with blunted constitutive p53 expression in mice that have undergone A beta 1-42 treatment, as well as in decrease of phosphorylated forms of tau and GSK3 beta proteins. Likewise, TRAIL-R2 appears essential to both TRAIL and A beta-mediated neurotoxicity and inflammation. Indeed, hippocampi of TRAIL-R-/- mice challenged with A beta 1-42, showed a slight expression of microglial (Iba-1) and astrocytic (GFAP) markers along with attenuated levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, NOS2 and COX2. In conclusion, the bulk of these results demonstrate that the constitutive lack of TRAIL-R2 is associated with a substantial reduction of noxious effects of A beta 1-42, providing further evidence on the prominent role played by TRAIL in course of A beta-related neurodegeneration and confirming that the TRAIL system represents a potential target for innovative AD therapy.

AB  - Polyphenols are capable of decreasing cancer risk. We examined the chemopreventive effects of a green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract, polyphenol extract (a mixture of blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), blackcurrants (Ribes nigrum), and added resveratrol phytoalexin), Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra) extract, and a coffee (Coffea arabica) extract on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) carcinogen-increased miR-134, miR-132, miR-124-1, miR-9-3, and mTOR gene expressions in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of CBA/Ca mice. The elevation was quenched significantly in the organs, except for miR-132 in the liver of the Chinese bayberry extract-consuming group, and miR-132 in the kidneys of the polyphenol-fed group. In the coffee extract-consuming group, only miR-9-3 and mTOR decreased significantly in the liver; also, miR-134 decreased significantly in the spleen, and, additionally, miR-124-1 decreased significantly in the kidney. Our results are supported by literature data, particularly the DMBA generated ROS-induced inflammatory and proliferative signal transducers, such as TNF, IL1, IL6, and NF-kappa B; as well as oncogenes, namely RAS and MYC. The examined chemopreventive agents, besides the obvious antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, mainly blocked the mentioned DMBA-activated factors and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as well, and, at the same time, induced PTEN as well as SIRT tumor suppressor genes.

AB  - Aggressive cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are mostly fatal because of their po-tential to metastasize to distant organs. Cancer cells acquire various abilities to metastasize, including resistance to anoikis, an apoptotic cell death induced by loss of anchorage to the extracellular matrix. Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) and Yes-associated protein (YAP), the down-stream effectors of the Hippo pathway, regulate cell-and tissue-level architectures by responding to mechanical microenvironments of cells, including the cell-extracellular matrix interaction. The Hippo pathway is frequently disrupted in cancer cells, and TAZ and YAP are irrelevantly activated, potentially resulting in anchorage-independent survival/proliferation of cancer cells and metastatic progression. The study aims to investigate the roles of TAZ and YAP in anoikis resistance in basal-like (BL) TNBC cells, which comprise a major subtype (>70%) of TNBC. We found that TAZ and YAP had nonredundant roles in anchorage-independent cancer cell survival or anoikis resistance. Particularly, TAZ was indispensable for anoikis resistance in BL-TNBC cells but not for survival of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells (MECs). In contrast, YAP, a paralog of TAZ, was indispensable for survival of both non-transformed MECs and cancer cells. Therefore, TAZ might be a preferable therapeutic target against dissemination of aggressive cancer cells without killing normal cells. Interestingly, TAZ was abnormally stabilized in BL-TNBC cells under non-adherent conditions, which promoted anoikis resistance. Furthermore, OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, was responsible for the stabilization of TAZ in detached BL-TNBC cells. Importantly, simultaneous high expression of TAZ and OTUB1 was associated with poor prognosis in BC. Thus, OTUB1 has emerged as a potentially druggable target.

AB  - Brassica rapa L., an edible, feeding and medicinal plant cultivated on the Tibetan plateau with altitudes above 3800 m, has several pharmacological effects. However, its therapeutic effects against memory impairment and central fatigue have yet to be conclusively established. In this study, the Y-maze and Morris water maze tasks revealed that Brassica rapa L. aqueous extract (BE) significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits of sleep deprivation (SD)-treated mice. Moreover, BE treatment partially alleviated SD-induced reductions in the levels of peripheral energy metabolism, and significantly decreased inflammatory factor levels in serum and hippocampus. In addition, BE treatment significantly relieved central fatigue and stabilized the excitability as well as activities of neurons by regulating the levels of hypothalamus tryptophan metabolites and striatum neurotransmitters. The neuroprotective effects of BE were also confirmed using glutamate-treated HT22 cells, whereby BE pretreatment significantly attenuated intracellular ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization via adenosine 5 '-monophosphate activated protein kinase/peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (AMPK/PPAR-gamma) signaling pathways. Thus, BE might probably prevent SD-induced learning and memory deficits by inhibiting neuroinflammation and restoring mitochondrial energy metabolism in the hippocampus. These findings imply that BE is a potential complementary therapy for those suffering from deficient sleep or neurometabolic disorders, although this needs verification by prospective clinical studies.

AB  - Voluntary sleep curtailment is increasingly more rampant in modern society and compromises healthy cognition, including memory, to varying degrees. However, whether memory encoding is impaired after chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, using the mice, we tested the impact of CSD on the encoding abilities of social recognition-dependent memory and object recognition-dependent memory. We found that memory encoding was indeed vulnerable to CSD, while memory retrieval remained unaffected. The hippocampal neurons of mice with memory encoding deficits exhibited significant synapse damage and hyperactive autophagy, which dissipates during regular sleep cycles. This excessive autophagy appeared to be triggered by damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), resulting from oxidative stress within the mitochondria. The relief at the behavioral and molecular biological levels can be achieved with intraperitoneal injections of the antioxidant compound melatonin. Moreover, our in vitro experiments using HT-22 cells demonstrated that oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide led to oxidative damage, including mtDNA damage, and activation of autophagy. Melatonin treatment effectively countered these effects, restoring redox homeostasis and reducing excessive autophagic activity. Notably, this protective effect was not observed when melatonin was administered as a pre-treatment. Together, our findings reveal the vulnerability of memory encoding during chronic sleep curtailment, which is caused by oxidative stress and consequent enhancement of autophagy, suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for addressing these effects following prolonged wakefulness through melatonin intervention, and reiterate the significance of adequate sleep for memory formation and retention.

AB  - Childhood maltreatment is a leading risk factor for psychopathology, though it is unclear why some develop risk averse disorders, such as anxiety and depression, and others risk-taking disorders including substance abuse. A critical question is whether the consequences of maltreatment depend on the number of different types of maltreatment experienced at any time during childhood or whether there are sensitive periods when exposure to particular types of maltreatment at specific ages exert maximal effects. Retrospective information on severity of exposure to ten types of maltreatment during each year of childhood was collected using the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure scale. Artificial Intelligence predictive analytics were used to delineate the most important type/time risk factors. BOLD activation fMRI response to threatening versus neutral facial images was assessed in key components of the threat detection system (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus and ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices) in 202 healthy, unmedicated, participants (84 M/118 F, 23.2 +/- 1.7 years old). Emotional maltreatment during teenage years was associated with hyperactive response to threat whereas early childhood exposure, primarily to witnessing violence and peer physical bullying, was associated with an opposite pattern of greater activation to neutral than fearful faces in all regions. These findings strongly suggest that corticolimbic regions have two different sensitive period windows of enhanced plasticity when maltreatment can exert opposite effects on function. Maltreatment needs to be viewed from a developmental perspective in order to fully comprehend its enduring neurobiological and clinical consequences.

AB  - Background: The mechanisms underlying synaptic injury and anxiety-like behavioral changes caused by diabetes and the strategies to reverse these changes are not well understood.
   Objectives: This study examined the neuroprotective effects of hesperidin on anxiety-like behaviors in diabetic rats and investigated the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of the PKA/CREB pathway.
   Methods: Rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated orally with hesperidin (50 and 150 mg/kg) for 10 weeks. The elevated plus maze (EPM), hole board test (HBT), and marble-burying test (MBT) were used to assess anxiety-like behaviors. We further examined the effects of hesperidin on the PKA/CREB pathway in vivo and in vitro.
   Results: The results show that supplementation with hesperidin exerted anxiolytic effects on the diabetic rats, as evidenced by increased percentages of open arm entries and time spent in the open arms in the EPM; decreased numbers of hole visits in the HBT; decreased numbers of marbles buried; and increased expression of PKA, CREB, BDNF, and synaptic proteins in the amygdala and hippocampus of diabetic rats. Hesperidin was found to reverse the imbalance in the PKA/CREB/BDNF pathway. In vitro, we found that the PKA inhibitor H89 reversed the protective effects of hesperidin against cell injury and reversed the HG-induced expression of PKA, pCREB/CREB, and BDNF.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that hesperidin could ameliorate the anxiety-like behaviors of diabetic rats and that activating the PKA/CREB/BDNF pathway contributed to the beneficial effects. This study may provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying anxiety-like behaviors in diabetes and identify new therapeutic targets for clinical treatment.

AB  - People's aging is accompanied by cognitive impairment, especially the decline in learning and memory ability. Probiotics have potential health-promoting functions in this regard. In this study, the function of Bifidobacterium longum 300 (BL300) in reducing cognitive impairment of mice induced via d-galactose was evaluated, and the mitigating mechanism of this function was deeply researched. Treatment with BL300 significantly enhanced the nesting ability of the mice, increased their time spent in the target quadrant of the water maze, and reduced the number of errors in passive avoidance tests (PAT). Notably, BL300 treatment facilitated recovery in the gut microbiota composition by increasing beneficial microbial populations (e.g., Lactobacillus) and decreasing pathogenic bacteria. Importantly, compared to mice treated with d-galactose, the indices of inflammation and acetylcholinesterase levels in the hippocampus and serum were decreased, along with a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain (such as TNF-alpha and IL-6) when they were fed with BL300. Furthermore, the administration of BL300 resulted in an increase in the populations of BDNF+ and NeuN+ cells in the hippocampus and reduced intestinal permeability. Therefore, this study provides compelling evidence for the BL300 can reduce cognitive decline, and BL300 would be regarded as a potential probiotic for alleviating cognitive impairment.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is increasingly recognized as an important comorbidity of diabetes progression; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Dapagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), has shown promising effects against diabetes in rodent experiments and human clinical assays. This study aimed to determine the underlying mechanism and examine the effect of dapagliflozin on diabetic cognitive impairment. To create an in vivo model of diabetic cognitive impairment, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were used. Dapagliflozin was administered to mice for 8 weeks. The context fear condition and Morris water maze test was used to evaluate mice's behavioral change. Western blotting was used to evaluate protein expression. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Nissl staining were applied to monitor morphological and structural changes. Congo red staining was performed to identify the formation of senile plaques. Mitochondria morphology was examined using a transmission electron microscope, and blood flow in the mouse cerebral cortex was measured using a laser Doppler imaging assay. Comparison to the diabetes mellitus (DM) group, the dapagliflozin group had lower glucose levels. Behavioral studies have shown that dapagliflozin can restore memory deficits in diabetic mice. The murky cell membrane edges and Nissl bodies more difficult to identify in the DM group were revealed by HE and Nissl staining, which were both improved by dapagliflozin treatment. Dapagliflozin inhibited the progression of A ss generation and the reduced cerebral blood flow in the DM group was rescued. After dapagliflozin treatment, damaged mitochondria and lack of SGLT2 in the hippocampus and cortex of diabetic mice were repaired. Diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction was attenuated by dapagliflozin and the effect was indirect rather than direct.

AB  - Adequate dietary L-tryptophan (Trp) governs intestinal homeostasis in piglets. However, the defensive role of Trp in the diet against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4 (K88) in pigs is still poorly understood. Here, sixty (6.15 +/- 1.52 kg, 24-day-old, Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) weaned piglets were used for an E. coli F4 attack test in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The growth (ADG, ADFI, GH), immune factors (IL-10, IgA, IgG, IgM), Trp metabolite 5-HT, intestinal morphology (jejunal and colonic VH), mRNA expression of beta-defensins (jejunal BD-127, BD-119, ileal BD-1, BD-127), and abundance of beneficial microorganisms in the colon (Prevotella 9, Lactobacillus, Phascolarctobacterium, Faecalibacterium) were higher in the piglets in the HT (High Trp) and HTK (High Trp, K88) groups than in the LT (Low Trp) and LTK (Low Trp, K88) groups (P<.05), while FCR, diarrhea rate, diarrhea index, serum Trp, Kyn, IDO, D-LA, ET, and abundance of harmful microorganisms in the colon (Spirochaetes, Fusobacteria, Prevotella, Christensenellaceae R7) were lower in the HT and HTK groups than in the LT and LTK groups (P<.05). High Trp reduced the expression of virulence genes (K88 and LT) after E. coli F4 attack (P<.05). The IL-6, TNF-alpha was lower in the HTK group than in the LT, LTK group (P<.05).

AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) causes selective neuronal damage to cerebrocortical neurons (CCNs) in the central nervous system, but not to hippocampal neurons (HiNs), which are highly vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases. In our previous study using cultured rat neurons, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis and found that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin (NT), was specifically expressed in HiNs. Therefore, to elucidate the causal factors of MeHg toxicity resistance in HiNs, we conducted a comparative study of the protein expression and function of several NTs, including BDNF, using CCNs showing vulnerability to MeHg toxicity and HiNs showing resistance. BDNF was specifically expressed in HiNs, whereas nerve growth factor was barely detectable in either neuron type. In addition, other NTs, NT3 and NT4/5, were expressed in small but nearly equal amounts in both neuron types. Furthermore, among the various pathways involved in MeHg neurotoxicity, the p44/42 MAPK pathway was specifically activated in HiNs, even without MeHg treatment. siRNAs were used to reduce NTs in both neuron types. Only a specific reduction in BDNF attenuated the resistance to MeHg toxicity and p44/42 MAPK activation in HiNs. In addition, the external addition of BDNF and NT4/5, which act on the same tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk), TrkB, suppressed MeHg neurotoxicity in both neuron types. These results suggest that BDNF, expressed specifically in HiNs, is involved in the resistance to MeHg neurotoxicity via TrkB. Additionally, the activation of the p44/42 MAPK pathway may contribute to the inhibitory effect of BDNF on MeHg neurotoxicity.

AB  - Ammonium (NH4+), as a major inorganic source of nitrogen (N) for tea plant growth, is transported and distributed across membranes by the proteins of ammonium transporters (AMTs). However, the AMT2-type AMTs from tea plants remain poorly understood. In this study, five CsAMT2 subfamily genes were identified in tea plant genomes, and their full-length coding sequences (CDS) were isolated from roots. Then, a NH4+ uptake kinetic comparison of Fudingdabaicha (FD), Huangdan (HD), and Maoxie (MX) showed that FD was a high N efficiency (HNE) cultivar that had a wide range of adaptability to NH4+, HD was a high N efficiency under high N conditions (HNEH) cultivar, in which it was easy to obtain higher yield in a high N environment, and MX was a high N efficiency under low N conditions (HNEL) cultivar, which had a higher affinity for NH4+ than the other two. Tissue-specific expression analysis suggested that CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 were highly expressed in the roots, indicating that these two members may be unique in the CsAMT2 subfamily. This is further supported by our findings from the temporal expression profiles in the roots among these three different N adaptation cultivars. Expression levels of CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 in FD and HD were upregulated by a short time (2 h) under high NH4+ treatment, while under low NH4+ treatment, CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 were highly expressed at 0 h and 2 h in the HNEL-type cultivar-MX. Furthermore, the functional analysis illustrated that CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 could make a functional complementation of NH4+-defective mutant yeast cells at low NH4+ levels, and the transport efficiency of CsAMT2.3 was higher than that of CsAMT2.2. Thus, we concluded that CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 might play roles in controlling the NH4+ uptake from the soil to the roots. These results will further the understanding of the NH4+ signal networks of AMT2-type proteins in tea plants.

AB  - Exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) proteins are implicated in a wide range of cellular functions including oxidative stress and cell survival. Mitochondrial-dependent oxidative stress has been associated with progressive neuronal death underlying the pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases. The role of Epac modulation in neuronal cells in relation to cell survival and death, as well as its potential effect on mitochondrial function, is not well established. In immortalized hippocampal (HT-22) neuronal cells, we examined mitochondria function in the presence of various Epac pharmacological modulators in response to oxidative stress due to ferroptosis. Our study revealed that selective pharmacological modulation of Epac1 or Epac2 isoforms, exerted differential effects in erastin-induced ferroptosis conditions in HT-22 cells. Epac1 inhibition prevented cell death and loss of mitochondrial integrity induced by ferroptosis, while Epac2 inhibition had limited effects. Our data suggest Epac1 as a plausible therapeutic target for preventing ferroptosis cell death associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Approximately 50% of patients with chronic neuropathic pain experience cognitive impairment, which negatively impacts their quality of life. The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) may be involved in hippocampal cognitive processes. However, its role in chronic neuropathic pain-induced cognitive impairment remains elusive. Spared nerve injury (SNI) was used to induce chronic neuropathic pain in rats, while the novel-object recognition test and the Y-maze test were employed to assess cognitive function. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and stereotaxic hippocampal microinjection were utilized to elucidate the potential mechanisms. We observed a reduction in mechanical pain threshold and cognitive impairment in SNI rats. This was accompanied by a tendency for hippocampal microglia to adopt pro-inflammatory functions. Notably, no changes were detected in CB2R expression. However, downregulation of the endogenous ligands AEA and 2-AG was evident. Hippocampal microinjection of a CB2R agonist mitigated cognitive impairment in SNI rats, which correlated with a tendency for microglia to adopt anti-inflammatory functions. Additionally, SNI-induced activation of the p-ERK/NF kappa B pathway in the hippocampus. Activation of CB2R reversed this process by upregulating DUSP6 expression in microglia. The effects elicited by CB2R activation could be inhibited through the downregulation of microglial DUSP6 via hippocampal adeno-associated virus (AAV) microinjection. Conversely, overexpression of hippocampal DUSP6 using AAV ameliorated the cognitive deficits observed in SNI rats, which remained unaffected by the administration of a CB2R antagonist. Our findings demonstrate that activation of hippocampal CB2R can mitigate chronic neuropathic pain-induced cognitive impairment through the modulation of the DUSP6/ERK/NF kappa B pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Chinese Ecliptae herba (Eclipta prostrata (L.) L.) is an ethnomedicinal herb, which is used mainly to nourish kidney and thus strengthen bones according to traditional Chinese medicine theory. Pharmacological studies have supported the ethnomedicine use, showing that Ecliptae herba extract has an anti-osteoporotic effect in vivo and promoted osteoblast proliferation and activity in vitro. However, the molecular mechanism of Ecliptae herba on osteoblast differentiation from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC), the progenitors of osteoblasts, is still unclear.Aim of the study: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA epigenetic modification may play a key role in promoting osteoblastic differentiation, and thus treating osteoporosis. This study sought to assess the mechanism through which Eclipate herba and its component wedelolactone influence m6A modification during the process of osteoblastogenesis from BMSC.Material and methods: The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin red S (ARS) staining were applied to deter-mine osteoblastogenesis from BMSC. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR were performed. RNA sequencing analysis was used to determine the characteristics of m6A methylation. Stable knocking down of METTL3 using lentiviral-based shRNA was performed. Results: Upon 9 d treatment of BMSC with ethyl acetate extract of Ecliptae herba (MHL), ALP activity and ossification level increased in comparison with osteogenic medium (OS)-treated control. The expression of methyltransferase METTL3 and METTL14 was significantly increased, but WTAP expression had no change in response to MHL treatment. Knocking down of METTL3 resulted in a decrease in MHL-induced ALP activity, ossification level as well as mRNA expression of Osterix and Osteocalcin, two bone formation-related markers. The level of m6A increased when BMSC was treated with MHL for 9 d. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that MHL treatment altered mRNA m6A modification of genes associated with osteoblastogenesis. By kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, HIF-1 alpha, PI3K/Akt, and Hippo signaling pathways were enriched and associated with m6A modification. The expression of m6A-modified genes including HIF-1 alpha, VEGF-A, and RASSF1, was upregulated by MHL, but the upregulation was reversed after METTL3 knockdown. Additionally, the enhanced expression of METTL3 was also observed after treatment with wedelolactone, a component from MHL.Conclusions: These results suggested a previously uncharacterized mechanism of MHL and wedelolactone on osteoblastogenesis, by which METTL3-mediated m6A methylation is involved and thus contributes to the enhancement of osteoblastogenesis.

AB  - Featured Application Evaluation of the ecological and health risk associated with the cultivation and consumption of the typical product "Aglione della Valdichiana" (elephant garlic). The aim of this study was to provide, for the first time, data on the concentration of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in soils and bulbs of elephant garlic (Allium ampeloprasum L.) cultivated in Valdichiana, a traditional agricultural area of Tuscany, Italy. Bulbs of elephant garlic and soil samples were collected in four cultivation fields and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine the concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, U, V, Zn. The concentrations of these PTEs in bulbs and cultivation soils were used to calculate geochemical, ecological and health risk indices. The results of this study suggest that, although bulbs of elephant garlic from the Valdichiana area may present slightly high concentrations of Cd, Ni and Pb, the associated health risk based on the daily intake is absolutely negligible. Cultivation soils had somewhat high Cu concentrations probably due to the diffuse use of Cu-based products in agriculture, but showed overall a very low ecological risk.

AB  - Introduction: : Perinatal women often experience mood disorders and postpartum depression due to the physical load and the rapid changes in hormone levels caused by pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing. When the mother's emotions become unstable, their parental behavior (maternal behavior) may decline, the child's attachment may weaken, and the formation of mother-child bonding can become hindered. As a result, the growth of the child may be adversely affected. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of omega 3 fatty acid deficiency in the perinatal period on maternal behavior and the oxytocin concentration and fatty acid composition in brain tissue.
   Materials and methods: : Virgin female C57BL/6 J mice fed a omega 3 fatty acid-deficient omega 3-Def) or adequate omega 3-Adq) diet were mated for use in this study. To assess maternal behavior, nest shape was evaluated at a fixed time from gestational day (GD) 15 to postpartum day (PD) 13, and a retrieval test was conducted on PD 3. For neurochemical measurement, brains were removed from PD 1-6 dams and hippocampal fatty acids and hypothalamic oxytocin concentrations were assessed.
   Results: : Peripartum nest shape scores were similar to those reported previously (Harauma et al., 2016); nests in the omega 3-Def group were small and of poor quality whereas those in the omega 3-Adq group were large and elaborate. The inferiority of nest shape in the omega 3-Def group continued from PD 0-7. In the retrieval test performed on PD 3, dams in the omega 3-Def group took longer on several parameters compared with those in the omega 3-Adq group, including time to make contact with pups (sniffing time), time to start retrieving the next pup (interval time), and time to retrieve the last pup to the nest (grouping time). Hypothalamic oxytocin concentrations on PD 1-6 were lower in the omega 3-Def group than in the omega 3-Adq group.
   Discussion:: Our data show that omega 3 fatty acid deficiency reduces maternal behavior, a state that continued during pup rearing. This was supported by the observed decrease in hypothalamic oxytocin concentration in the omega 3-Def group. These results suggest that omega 3 fatty acid supplementation during the perinatal period is not only effective in delivering omega 3 fatty acids to infants but is also necessary to activate high-quality parental behavior in mothers.

AB  - Each year, agro-foods produce thousands of tonnes of by-products that contain high-value, unique nutrients. The application of plant by-products enables agro-food corporations to obtain value from them and avoid using natural resources. The idea of the bio economy protects against environmental pollution and leads to a cheap source of bioactive components, which can be transformed into value-added products for other industries. The numerous publications on the positive impact of sea buckthorn (SBT, Hippophae rhamnoides L., Elaeagnaceae family) and its products on human health mainly concern its fruits and seeds. However, there are few data relating to the properties of SBT leaves. The leaves of SBT can be a rich source of nutrients and biologically active substances. In this investigation, we report the study of the leaves of four SBT cultivars. We determined their antioxidant capacities, measured total polyphenols and total flavonoids, and quantified their major polyphenols and alkaloids. The results show that SBT leaves are a source of antioxidants and alkaloids. Additionally, in this raw material, we identified the presence of individual flavonols (rutoside and quercetin), individual anthocyanidins (cyaniding, delphinidin, and peonidin), and chelerythrine by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) for the first time. Through these types of studies, we aim to revalue this raw material, which is not well known in the world. Considering its nutritional properties, we seek to increase the use of its high-value, unique nutrients in food processing, medicine, and animal nutrition, in accordance with the goals of a closed-loop bioeconomy.

AB  - While the consequences of mathematically-based software, algorithms and strategies have become ever wider and better appreciated, ethical reflection on mathematics has remained primitive. We review the somewhat disconnected suggestions of commentators in recent decades with a view to piecing together a coherent approach to ethics in mathematics. Calls for a Hippocratic Oath for mathematicians are examined and it is concluded that while lessons can be learned from the medical profession, the relation of mathematicians to those affected by their work is significantly different. There is something to be learned also from the codes of conduct of cognate but professionalised quantitative disciplines such as engineering and accountancy, as well as from legal principles bearing on professional work. We conclude with recommendations that professional societies in mathematics should sponsor an (international) code of ethics, institutional mission statements for mathematicians and syllabuses of ethics courses for incorporation into mathematics degrees.

AB  - The catfish Ancistrus triradiatus belongs to the species-rich family Loricariidae. Loricariids display remarkable traits such as herbivory, a benthic lifestyle, the absence of scales but the presence of dermal bony plates. They are exported as ornamental fish worldwide, with escaped fishes becoming a threat locally. Although genetic and phylogenetic studies are continuously increasing and developmental genetic investigations are underway, no genome assembly has been formally proposed for Loricariidae yet. We report a high-quality genome assembly of Ancistrus triradiatus using long and short reads, and a newly assembled transcriptome. The genome assembly is composed of 9530 scaffolds, including 85.6% of ray-finned fish BUSCOs, and 26,885 predicted protein-coding genes. The genomic GC content is higher than in other catfishes, reflecting the higher metabolism associated with herbivory. The examination of the SCPP gene family indicates that the genes presumably triggering scale loss when absent, are present in the scaleless A. triradiatus, questioning their explanatory role. The analysis of the opsin gene repertoire revealed that gene losses associated to the nocturnal lifestyle of catfishes were not entirely found in A. triradiatus, as the UV-sensitive opsin 5 is present. Finally, most gene family expansions were related to immunity except the gamma crystallin gene family which controls pupil shape and sub-aquatic vision. Thus, the genome of A. triradiatus reveals that fish herbivory may be related to the photic zone habitat, conditions metabolism, photoreception and visual functions. This genome is the first for the catfish suborder Loricarioidei and will serve as backbone for future genetic, developmental and conservation studies.

AB  - Stroke is a cerebrovascular disease that threatens human health. Developing safe and effective drugs and finding therapeutic targets has become an urgent scientific problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation of the microglia-derived exosome on hippocampal neurons and its relationship to miR-124 in the exosome. We incubated hippocampal neurons with exosomes secreted by oxygen-glucose deprivation/ reoxygenation (OGD/R) microglia. The levels of glutamic acid (GLU) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the culture supernatant were detected by ELISA. CCK-8 was used to measure neuronal survival rates. The mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were detected by RT-qPCR to evaluate the effect of exosomes on neurons. RT-qPCR was then used to detect miR-124 in microglia and their secreted exosomes. Finally, potential targets of miR-124 were analyzed through database retrieval, gene detection with dual luciferase reporters, and western blotting experiments. The results showed that the contents of GLU, TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA increased in the supernatant of cultured hippocampal neurons, the content of GABA decreased, and the survival rate of neurons decreased. Oxygen-glucose deprivation increases miR-124 levels in microglia and their released exosomes. miR-124 acts as a target gene on cytokine signaling suppressor molecule 1(SOCS1), while miR-124 inhibitors reduce the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA in neurons. These results suggest that oxygen- and glucose-deprived microglia regulate inflammatory cytokines leading to reduced neuronal survival, which may be achieved by miR-124 using SOCS1 as a potential target.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects and mechanism of diaporthein B (DTB), a natural compound extracted from the fungus Penicillium sclerotiorum GZU-XW03-2, on human colon cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of DTB at different concentrations on the proliferation of colon cancer cells HCT116 and LOVO was detected at 24 and 48 h. The effect of cell migration and clone formation ability were detected by cell scratch and plate cloning experiments. Morphological changes were observed by Hoechst 33342 and Annexin-V/PI staining, and flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of apoptotic cells. DTB significantly inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner without significant effects on normal colonic epithelial cells NCM460. The IC50 inhibition effect can be achieved after treatment with 3 mu mol/L DTB for 24 h. Compared with the blank group, the migration and clonal-forming ability of colon cancer cells in the DTB group was significantly decreased (p < 0.01), while the apoptotic cells were significantly increased (p < 0.01) in a concentration-dependent manner. DTB can inhibit the proliferation and migration of human colon cancer cells HCT116 and LOVO and promote the apoptosis of human colon cancer cells.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Curcuma longa L., Azadirachta indica A Juss. Cassia tora L. has been used in Unani medicine for various skin ailments. Several researches have been conducted on these plants which have shown anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, antiviral, anti-oxidant, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, and immune modulation activities. Skin diseases and the use of these drugs are mentioned in classical Unani literature like The Canon of medicine, Continens Liber, Hippocratic treatments, The Complete Book of the Medical Art etc.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to formulate anti-microbial soap and to evaluate its clinical efficacy of in the management of Tinea corporis.
   Materials and methods: The anti-microbial soap was prepared by hydroalcholic extracts of Curcuma longa L., Azadirachta indica A Juss. and Cassia tora L. The prepared soap was evaluated for various physicochemical parameters, microbiological evaluation, stability study, skin irritation, In-vitro anti-microbial activity, GCMS analysis, and a clinical trial was carried out to evaluate its efficacy. A Single Blind Randomized Placebo Controlled trail on 30 patients aged between 18 and 60 years of either gender was carried out. The participants were randomly allocated to receive either anti-microbial soap or Placebo soap for 4 weeks. Subjective parameters including erythema, pruritis and desquamation were assessed weekly while as objective parameter including Photograph of lesion, Total Symptom Score (TSS) and KOH mount was assessed at baseline and at the end of the trial.
   Results: The improvement in subjective parameters was found significant in test group. Erythema, scaling, and desquamation was completely relieved by 70%, 80% and 25% patients respectively in test group while as none of the patients got complete relief in control group. There was statistically significant reduction in average TSS 8.65 +/- 0.6708 to 3.05 +/- 1.35 p < 0.001. KOH mount turned negative in 80% patients in test group while as only 20% turned negative in control group.
   Conclusion: It is concluded that Unani drugs can be utilized in better way by modifying into a convenient dosage form. Anti-microbial soap was formulated by adding minimal additives to achieve effectiveness, with cost effective benefits and less or no side effects. Anti-microbial soap was effective in management of management of Tinea corporis. Moreover further studies on large sample size are required to fine-tune these observations.

AB  - Our study aimed to explore the impact and mechanism of Euonymus alatus leaf extract on age-dependent oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and progressive memory impairments in aged mice. Twenty-four-month-old mice received EA-L3 (300 mg/kg/day) or the reference drug, donepezil (DPZ, 5 mg/kg/day), for 6 weeks, and learning and memory functions were detected using the Passive Avoidance Test (PAT). As expected, cognitive function deficits were detected in aged mice compared with young mice, and these deficits were significantly mitigated by dietary treatments with EA-L3. In parallel, it upregulated the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and subsequently activated the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/cAMP response element-binding (CREB) signaling in the mouse hippocampus and scopolamine-induced B35 and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. EA-L3 showed strong anti-inflammatory effects with decreased NF-kappa Bp65, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), increased interleukin (IL)-10, and doublecortin (DCX) protein expression in the hippocampus of aged mice. Similar results were also confirmed in LPS-induced BV-2 microglia and neuroblastoma cells upon treatment with EA-L3 extract. In addition, EA-L3 notably dose-dependently decreased ROS in BV2 cells after exposure to LPS. Taken together, EA-L3 might be used as a dietary supplement to alleviate oxidative stress, the deterioration of hippocampal-based memory tasks, and neuroinflammation in elderly people.

AB  - Author summary Our experiences are often hierarchically organized, so is our knowledge. Identifying meaningful segments in hierarchically structured information is crucial for many cognitive functions including visual, auditory, motor, memory, language processing, and reasoning. Herein, we show that the attractor dynamics of recurrent neural circuits offer a biologically plausible way for hierarchical segmentation. We found that an extended model of associative memory autonomously performs segmentation by finding groups of tightly linked memories. We proved that the neural dynamics of our model mathematically coincide with optimal graph segmentation in graph theory and are consistent with the experimentally observed nature of human behaviors and neural activities. Our model established a previously unexpected relationship between attractor neural networks and the graph-theoretic processing of knowledge structures. Our model also provides experimentally testable predictions, particularly regarding the role of inhibitory circuits in controlling representational granularity.
   Our cognition relies on the ability of the brain to segment hierarchically structured events on multiple scales. Recent evidence suggests that the brain performs this event segmentation based on the structure of state-transition graphs behind sequential experiences. However, the underlying circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper we propose an extended attractor network model for graph-based hierarchical computation which we call the Laplacian associative memory. This model generates multiscale representations for communities (clusters) of associative links between memory items, and the scale is regulated by the heterogenous modulation of inhibitory circuits. We analytically and numerically show that these representations correspond to graph Laplacian eigenvectors, a popular method for graph segmentation and dimensionality reduction. Finally, we demonstrate that our model exhibits chunked sequential activity patterns resembling hippocampal theta sequences. Our model connects graph theory and attractor dynamics to provide a biologically plausible mechanism for abstraction in the brain.

AB  - Background: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) has been confirmed as one of the pathogenesis underlying vascular cognitive impairment. A series of pathological changes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, are involved in this pathophysiology and contribute to cognitive impairment and neuropathological alterations. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) of Buqi Huoxue Tongnao (BQHXTN) prescription possesses a remarkable clinical efficacy for treating patients with CCH, but still lacks a scientific foundation for its pharmacological mechanisms. Purpose: To investigate the role and underlying mechanism of the effects of BQHXTN on CCH both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: In this study, we established a two-vessel occlusion (2-VO) induced CCH model in Sprague-Dawley rats, an oxygen-glucose deprivation model in BV2 cells, and a steatosis cell model in L02 cells to reveal the underlying mechanisms of BQHXTN by behavioral test, histopathological analysis and the detection of pro-inflammatory cytokine, apoptotic factors and reactive oxide species. Donepezil hydrochloride and Buyang Huanwu decoction were used as positive drugs. Results: Compared with the 2-VO group, BQHXTN treatment at three doses significantly enhanced the memory and learning abilities in the Y-maze and novel object recognition tests. The hematoxylin-eosin staining indicated that BQHXTN protected against hippocampal injury induced by CCH. Of note, in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, BQHXTN prominently inhibited the production of IL-18, TNF-alpha, cleaved-caspase 3, and iNOS by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, consequently exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant effects. Moreover, it provided the first initial evidence that BQHXTN treatment mitigated dyslipidemia by increasing the LXR alpha/CYP7A1 expression, thereby delaying the neuropathological process. Conclusion: In summary, these findings firstly revealed the pharmacodynamics and mechanism of BQHXTN, that is, BQHXTN could alleviate cognitive impairment, neuropathological alterations and dyslipidemia in CCH rats by activating PI3K/AKT and LXR alpha/CYP7A1 signaling pathways, as well as providing a TCM treatment strategy for CCH.

AB  - Background: Festidinol is a flavan-3-ol which has been shown to reduce advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species, both of which play a crucial role in the pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the effects of festidinol on oxidative stress, amyloidogenesis, phosphorylated tau (pTau) expression, synaptic function, and cognitive impairment, and the potential mechanisms involved, in a mouse model with an Alzheimer-like pathology. Methods: D-galactose (150 mg/kg) and aluminum chloride (10 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally into 40 mice for 90 days to generate an AD mouse model with cognitive impairment. Festidinol (30 mg/kg) and donepezil (5 mg/kg) were then administered orally for 90 days after which behavior and molecular changes in the brain were measured. Results: The aluminum accumulated and the expression of the cell senescence marker P16 increased after exposure to D-galactose and AlCl3 (2.5 +/- 0.5 mg/kg, 149.1 +/- 28.1% of control, respectively). Festidinol markedly decreased the escape latency (8.7 +/- 4.3 s) and increased the number of platform crossings (8 +/- 1.4 time) in the Morris water maze test. Superoxide dismutase activity was significantly elevated after festidinol administration, however there were significant reductions in the levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, receptor for advanced glycation end products, phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (pNF-cB), and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFAT1). Festidinol attenuated amyloid beta production by reducing the mRNA of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Festidinol also significantly decreased the expression of pTau and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 (148.6 +/- 37.6% of control, 125.3 +/- 22.6% of control, respectively). Conclusion: Festidinol can ameliorate learning and memory impairments by modulating amyloidogenesis, tau hyperphosphorylation, cholinergic activity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, and by regulating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The sclerotium of Lignosus rhinocerus (Cooke) Ryvarden is highly valued for its purported medicinal properties. The decoction and macerated materials prepared from the sclerotium are used for treating cancer and other ailments based on extensive traditional knowledge. Scientific evidence from in vitro cytototoxicity, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory analyses showed the effectiveness of sclerotial water extracts but toxicity assessment of such preparations has not been reported. Aim of the study: This study aimed to compare the differential toxicity and teratogenicity (if any) of the hot water (HW) and cold water (CW) extracts of both wild and cultivated sclerotium on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Materials and methods: Zebrafish embryos were treated with varying concentrations of the sclerotial HW and CW extracts (0.3-500 mu g/mL) for 72 h until hatching. The hatching, mortality and heartbeat rate of the embryos as well as the potential teratogenic effect of the extracts were assessed in embryos post-treatment with the extracts. Results: While the sclerotial HW extracts were nontoxic (LC50 > 500 mu g/mL), the sclerotial CW extracts delayed the hatching of the embryos up to 48 h and showed slight toxicity with LC50 values of 398.4 mu g/mL and 428.3 mu g/ mL for the cultivated and wild sclerotium, respectively. The sclerotial CW extracts also induced minor tachycardia in zebrafish larvae. Phenotypic assessment revealed that, while yolk sac edema was observed at high concentrations (300 and 500 mu g/mL) of all extracts, curved trunk and bent tail were only observed in the embryos treated with CW extracts of wild sclerotium (300 and 500 mu g/mL) but not for CW extracts of cultivated sclerotium at similar concentrations. Conclusion: The sclerotial water extracts of L. rhinocerus prepared using different methods have varying degree of toxicity and teratogenicity in zebrafish embryos with the sclerotial CW extracts showed higher toxicity than the HW extracts.

AB  - PurposeFertility preservation for pre-pubertal girls undergoing gonadotoxic cancer treatments and women with systemic cancers at high risk for ovarian metastasis remains limited. Current options, such as ovarian cortex transplantation, risk reintroducing malignant cells. This study presents a novel approach focusing on ex vivo folliculogenesis and mature oocyte retrieval for cryopreservation, mitigating this risk.MethodsThis experimental study optimized an ex vivo ovarian perfusion system in sheep, refining gonadotropin stimulation to yield mature oocytes. Eleven ovaries were divided into two experimental subgroups: Group 1 (n = 5) and Group 2 (n = 6). Both groups were perfused in a bioreactor for 4 to 8 days under distinct perfusion protocols, differing in gonadotropin administration overnight-Group 1 did not receive overnight gonadotropin stimulation, whereas Group 2 received basal gonadotropin stimulation overnight. Assessments included follicular proliferation, oocyte maturity, apoptosis, ovarian function-related gene expression, and the levels of hormones, metabolites, and electrolytes in the culture medium, compared across subgroups.ResultsThe protocol without overnight ovarian stimulation yielded mature MII oocytes, despite fewer secondary follicles and overexpression of the pro-apoptotic BAX gene. Conversely, ovaries with overnight stimulation yielded mostly GV-MI oocytes and exhibited reduced secondary follicle proliferation and higher HIF1A expression. Hormone levels, metabolites, and electrolytes remained stable across groups and time.ConclusionsThis study is the first to report the successful harvesting of MII oocytes following extended ex vivo perfusion of intact ewe ovaries, highlighting the potential of the perfusion model to support advanced follicular development. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate underlying mechanisms and refine protocol efficiency.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Saiga antelope horn (SAH), derived from the male Saiga tatarica Linnaeus, has been used in China for millennia to treat hyperpyretic convulsions and hypertension-related diseases. Clarifying its effectiveness and mechanism of action are essential because of its limited availability. This study will guide the investigation of alternative resources. Aim of the study: The study investigated the short- and long-term antihypertensive effectiveness of SAH in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and the relation of its mechanism of action to H2S (hydrogen sulfide), other reactive sulfur species (RSS), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Materials and methods: In the SHR model, blood pressure was independently monitored by the tail-cuff method and carotid artery intubation. Hypertension was assessed weekly by physical signs, including facial temperature, irritability, pain, rotation time, and water consumption. The effects of SAH on the RAAS, vasoactive substances, and sympathetic neurotransmitters were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and colorimetry on study completion. Transcriptomics detected differentially expressed mRNAs and enriched signaling pathways in thoracic aorta tissue. H2S was measured in the mesenteric arteries and thoracic aorta by probe staining and PbS detection. H2S and other RSS were measured in intestinal tissue by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The correlation of the antihypertensive activity of SAH with H2S was tested with DL-propargylglycine (PAG), a cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) inhibitor. SAH organ protection was evaluated by histopathologic staining of artery, heart, and kidney tissue. Results: SAH had significant short- and long-term effectiveness. It improved symptom scores and regulated RAAS, vasoactive substances, and sympathetic neurotransmitters. Transcriptomes of thoracic aorta tissue found differentially expressed genes following SAH treatment. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment found that those genes were enriched in calcium, oxidative phosphorylation, and aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption and were involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis and metabolism of sulfur compounds and thioesters. SAH significantly increased H2S levels in arterial and intestinal

AB  - Background/Purpose: : Rhodiola crenulata (Hook. f. et Thoms.) H. Ohba ( R. crenulate ), a famous and characteristic Tibetan medicine, has been demonstrated to exert an outstanding brain protection role in the treatment of highaltitude hypoxia disease. However, the metabolic effects of R. crenulate on high-altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI) are still incompletely understood. Herein, the anti-hypoxic effect and associated mechanisms of R. crenulate were explored through both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Study design/Methods: The mice model of HHBI was established using an animal hypobaric and hypoxic chamber. R. crenulate extract (RCE, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg) and salidroside (Sal, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) was given by gavage for 7 days. Pathological changes and neuronal apoptosis of mice hippocampus and cortex were evaluated using H &E and TUNEL staining, respectively. The effects of RCE and Sal on the permeability of blood brain barrier (BBB) were detected by Evans blue staining and NIR-II fluorescence imaging. Meanwhile, the ultrastructural BBB and cerebrovascular damages were observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The levels of tight junction proteins Claudin-1, ZO-1 and occludin were detected by immunofluorescence. Additionally, the metabolites in mice serum and brain were determined using UHPLC-MS and MALDI-MSI analysis. The cell viability of Sal on hypoxic HT22 cells induced by CoCl 2 was investigated by cell counting kit-8. The contents of LDH, MDA, SOD, GSH-PX and SDH were detected by using commercial biochemical kits. Meanwhile, intracellular ROS, Ca 2 + and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by corresponding specific labeled probes. The intracellular metabolites of HT22 cells were performed by the targeted metabolomics analysis of the Q300 kit. The cell apoptosis and necrosis were examined by YO-PRO-1/PI, Annexin V/PI and TUNEL staining. In addition, mitochondrial morphology was tested by Mito-tracker red with confocal microscopy and TEM. Realtime ATP production, oxygen consumption rate, and proton efflux rate were measured using a Seahorse analyzer. Subsequently, MCU, OPA1, p-Drp1ser616, p-AMPK alpha, p-AMPK beta and Sirt1 were determined by immunofluorescent and western blot analyses. Results: The results demonstrated that R. crenulate and Sal exert anti-hypoxic brain protection from inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, maintaining BBB integrity, increasing tight junction protein Claudin-1, ZO-1 and occludin and improving mitochondrial morphology and function. Mechanistically, R. crenulate and Sal alleviated HHBI by enhancing the tricarboxylic acid cycle to meet the demand of energy of brain. Additionally, experiments in vitro confirmed that Sal could ameliorate the apoptosis of HT22 cells, improve mitochondrial morphology and energy metabolism by enhancing mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. Meanwhile, Sal-mediated MCU inhibited the activation of Drp1 and enhanced the expression of OPA1 to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, as well as activation of AMPK and Sirt1 to enhance ATP production. Conclusion: Collectively, the findings suggested that RCE and Sal may afford a protective intervention in HHBI through maintaining BBB integrity and improving energy metabolism via balancing MCU-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis by activating the AMPK/Sirt1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Background: Diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is a prevalent complication of diabetes, characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Current pharmacological interventions have limited therapeutic efficacy in managing this condition. Huoshan large-leaf yellow tea (HLYT), derived from Camellia sinensis leaves, has demonstrated dual pharmacological properties in both glycemic regulation and cognitive enhancement, suggesting its potential as a preventive and therapeutic agent for DCD. Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to clarify the regulatory effect of HLYT on DCD and explore its underlying mechanisms. Study design: The research encompassed a comprehensive multi-phase investigation. Network pharmacological analysis identified HLYT's key target genes for DCD. Molecular docking screened hub target genes, which were further verified by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quantified HLYT's active components for setting animal experiment dosages. A DCD model was established in rats by feeding them a high-fat diet and injecting streptozotocin (STZ). Subsequently, HLYT was administered to the rats via intragastric gavage for intervention. The results of this intervention were then verified through relevant animal experiments. Results: Utilizing an integrated approach of network pharmacology and molecular docking, five pivotal target genes (Adora2a, Mapk8, Stat3, Vcam1, Edn1) were identified as the primary molecular targets of HLYT in DCD pathogenesis. Quercetin, kaempferol, caffeine, theobromine, and EGCG in HLYT exhibited significant binding affinities with these targets. The results of animal experiment have shown that HLYT can alleviate neuronal damage and cognitive dysfunction, reduce the levels of IL-6 and IL-1 beta in the serum and brain tissue in DCD rats. Furthermore, it can also inhibit the expression of Adora2a, Mapk8, Stat3, Vcam1, and Edn1 mRNA as well as the expression of STAT3, ADORA2A, JNK1, ET1, and VCAM1 proteins. Conclusion: HLYT has a significant protective effect on DCD in rats by regulating Adora2a, Mapk8, Stat3, Vcam1, and Edn1 genes, suggesting that it has remarkable clinical potential in the treatment of DCD.

AB  - NG2 glia receive synaptic input from neurons, but the functional impact of this glial innervation is not well understood. In the developing cerebellum and somatosensory cortex the GABAergic input might regulate NG2 glia differentiation and myelination, and a switch from synaptic to extrasynaptic neuron-glia signaling was reported in the latter region. Myelination in the hippocampus is sparse, and most NG2 glia retain their phenotype throughout adulthood, raising the question of the properties and function of neuron-NG2 glia synapses in that brain region. Here, we compared spontaneous and evoked GABAA receptor-mediated currents of NG2 glia in juvenile and adult hippocampi of mice of either sex and assessed the mode of interneuron-glial signaling changes during development. With patch-clamp and pharmacological analyses, we found a decrease in innervation of hippocampal NG2 glia between postnatal days 10 and 60. At the adult stage, enhanced activation of extrasynaptic receptors occurred, indicating a spillover of GABA. This switch from synaptic to extrasynaptic receptor activation was accompanied by downregulation of ?2 and upregulation of the a5 subunit. Molecular analyses and high-resolution expansion microscopy revealed mechanisms of glial GABAA receptor trafficking and clustering. We found that gephyrin and radixin are organized in separate clusters along glial processes. Surprisingly, the developmental loss of ?2 and postsynaptic receptors were not accompanied by altered glial expression of scaffolding proteins, auxiliary receptor subunits or postsynaptic interaction proteins. The GABAergic input to NG2 glia might contribute to the release of neurotrophic factors from these cells and influence neuronal synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Fetal hypoxia and maternal stress frequently culminate in neuropsychiatric afflictions in life. To replicate this condition, we employed a model of prenatal severe hypoxia (PSH) during days 14-16 of rat gestation. Subsequently, both control and PSH rats at 3 months old were subjected to episodes of inescapable stress to induce learned helplessness (LH). The results of the open field test revealed an inclination towards depressive-like behavior in PSH rats. Following LH episodes, control (but not PSH) rats displayed significant anxiety. LH induced an increase in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels in extrahypothalamic brain structures, with enhanced nuclear translocation in the hippocampus (HPC) observed both in control and PSH rats. However, only control rats showed an increase in GR nuclear translocation in the amygdala (AMG). The decreased GR levels in the HPC of PSH rats correlated with elevated levels of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) compared with the controls. However, LH resulted in a reduction of the CRH levels in PSH rats, aligning them with those of control rats, without affecting the latter. This study presents evidence that PSH leads to depressive-like behavior in rats, associated with alterations in the glucocorticoid system. Notably, these impairments also contribute to increased resistance to severe stressors.

AB  - Small vascular graft engineering may help reduce early vein graft failure. We assessed the feasibility, safety, and in vivo vascular regeneration potential of the decellularised human saphenous vein (D-hSV) with and without pre-seeding with porcine endothelial-like cells (ELCs) following grafting in porcine carotid artery (CA). A total of 14 pigs received CA grafting of control D-hSVs (n = 7) or D-hSVs seeded with ELCs (SD-hSV; n = 7). Ultrasound vascular Doppler was undertaken before and after grafting, and at 4 weeks. Outcome measures included patency, intimal thickening (IT), in situ vascular regeneration, endothelial cell (EC) coverage, neo-angiogenesis, mesenchymal-EC transition, and contractile cells. All animals reached the predefined culling point in good health, with no feasibility/safety concerns. Mild graft dilatation occurred at 4 weeks vs. baseline, with no difference between groups. In total, 9/14 grafts (64.3%) remained patent at 4 weeks (4/7 (57.1%) vs. 5/7 (71.4%) in the D-hSV and SD-hSV groups, respectively). IT increased from 17.1 +/- 4.7% at baseline to 54.1 +/- 12.2% at 4 weeks. Vascular regeneration occurred in all patent grafts with EC coverage, an increase in collagen and elastin, vimentin, SM-MHC-11, and calponin, with no difference between groups. The D-hSV for arterial vascular grafting is feasible and safe and associated with signs of in situ vascular regeneration by host cells at 4 weeks. Pre-seeding with ELCs did not add benefits.

AB  - This study investigates the development of topically applied non-invasive amino-functionalized silica nanoparticles (AMSN) and O-Carboxymethyl chitosan-coated AMSN (AMSN-CMC) for ocular delivery of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Particle characterization was performed by the DLS technique (Zeta-Sizer), and structural morphology was examined by SEM and TEM. The drug encapsulation and loading were determined by the indirect method using HPLC. Physicochemical characterizations were performed by NMR, TGA, FTIR, and PXRD. In vitro release was conducted through a dialysis membrane in PBS (pH 7.4) using modified Vertical Franz diffusion cells. The mucoadhesion ability of the prepared nanoparticles was tested using the particle method by evaluating the change in zeta potential. The transcorneal permeabilities of 5-FU from AMNS-FU and AMSN-CMC-FU gel formulations were estimated through excised goat cornea and compared to that of 5-FU gel formulation. Eye irritation and ocular pharmacokinetic studies from gel formulations were evaluated in rabbit eyes. The optimum formulation of AMSN-CMC-FU was found to be nanoparticles with a particle size of 249.4 nm with a polydispersity of 0.429, encapsulation efficiency of 25.8 +/- 5.8%, and drug loading capacity of 5.2 +/- 1.2%. NMR spectra confirmed the coating of AMSN with the CMC layer. In addition, TGA, FTIR, and PXRD confirmed the drug loading inside the AMSN-CMC. Release profiles showed 100% of the drug was released from the 5-FU gel within 4 h, while AMSN-FU gel released 20.8% of the drug and AMSN-CMC-FU gel released around 55.6% after 4 h. AMSN-CMC-FU initially exhibited a 2.45-fold increase in transcorneal flux and apparent permeation of 5-FU compared to 5-FU gel, indicating a better corneal permeation. Higher bioavailability of AMSN-FU and AMSN-CMC-FU gel formulations was found compared to 5-FU gel in the ocular pharmacokinetic study with superior pharmacokinetics parameters of AMSN-CMC-FU gel. AMSN-CMC-FU showed 1.52- and 6.14-fold higher AUC0-inf in comparison to AMSN-FU and 5-FU gel, respectively. AMSN-CMC-FU gel and AMSN-FU gel were "minimally irritating" to rabbit eyes but showed minimal eye irritation potency in comparison to the 5 FU gel. Thus, the 5-FU loaded in AMSN-CMC gel could be used as a topical formulation for the treatment of ocular cancer.

AB  - Hippo signaling is a conserved mechanism for controlling organ growth. Increasing evidence suggests that Hippo signaling is modulated by various cellular factors for normal development and tumorigenesis. Hence, identification of these factors is pivotal for understanding the mechanism for the regulation of Hippo signaling. Drosophila Mnat9 is a putative N-acetyltransferase that is required for cell survival by affecting JNK signaling. Here we show that Mnat9 is involved in the negative regulation of Hippo signaling. RNAi knockdown of Mnat9 in the eye disc suppresses the rough eye phenotype of overexpressing Crumbs (Crb), an upstream factor of the Hippo pathway. Conversely, Mnat9 RNAi enhances the eye phenotype caused by overexpressing Expanded (Ex) or Warts (Wts) that acts downstream to Crb. Similar genetic interactions between Mnat9 and Hippo pathway genes are found in the wing. The reduced wing phenotype of Mnat9 RNAi is suppressed by overexpression of Yorkie (Yki), while it is suppressed by knockdown of Hippo upstream factors like Ex, Merlin, or Kibra. Mnat9 co-immunoprecipitates with Mer, implying their function in a protein complex. Furthermore, Mnat9 overexpression together with Hpo knockdown causes tumorous overgrowth in the abdomen. Our data suggest that Mnat9 is required for organ growth and can induce tumorous growth by negatively regulating the Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures. The interaction between astrocytes and neurons has been suggested to play a role in the abnormal neuronal activity observed in epilepsy. However, the exact way astrocytes influence neuronal activity in the epileptogenic brain remains unclear. Here, using the PTZ-induced kindling mouse model, we evaluated the interaction between astrocyte and synaptic function by measuring astrocytic Ca2+ activity, neuronal excitability, and the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the hippocampus. Compared to control mice, hippocampal slices from PTZ-kindled mice displayed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels and an abnormal pattern of intracellular Ca2+-oscillations, characterized by an increased frequency of prolonged spontaneous transients. PTZ-kindled hippocampal slices also showed an increase in the E/I ratio towards excitation, likely resulting from an augmented release probability of excitatory inputs without affecting inhibitory synapses. Notably, the alterations in the release probability seen in PTZ-kindled slices can be recovered by reducing astrocyte hyperactivity with the reversible toxin fluorocitrate. This suggests that astroglial hyper-reactivity enhances excitatory synaptic transmission, thereby impacting the E/I balance in the hippocampus. Altogether, our findings support the notion that abnormal astrocyte-neuron interactions are pivotal mechanisms in epileptogenesis.

This study aimed to explore whether SCL exerted antidepressant effects through inhibiting neuroinflammation, in turn improving neuronal injury. In vitro studies revealed that SCL blocked lipopolysaccharide-increased BV2 microglial M1 but promoted the M2 phenotype. The BV2-N2a interaction model suggested that increasing the M2 phenotype of BV2 played neuroprotective effects. The current studies demonstrated that SCL up-regulated the expression of CUMS-and LPS-decreased cannabinoid receptor type-2 (CB2R) mRNA. In vitro studies showed that the transfection of BV2 with siCrn2 blocked the SCL-increased M2 phenotype via the inactivating signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) pathway, further decreasing the viability of N2a cells. Finally, the possible pharmacodynamic compounds, gamma-schisandrin and schisantherin A, were indicated by AutoDuck analysis. Overall, our study showed that SCL promoted microglia polarization toward the M2 phenotype, in turn exerting neuroprotective effects by activating CB2R-STAT6 signaling further to play antidepressant roles.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in addition to a traumatic event. Cognitive dysfunction following SCI has been widely reported in patients and animal models. However, the neuroanatomical changes affecting cognitive function after SCI, as well as the mechanisms behind these changes, have so far remained elusive. Herein, we found that SCI accelerates oxidative stress damage of hippocampal neuronal mitochondria. Then, for the first time, we presented a three-dimensional morphological atlas of rat hippocampal neurons generated using a fluorescence Micro-Optical Sectioning Tomography system, a method that accurately identifies the spatial localization of neurons and trace neurites. We showed that the number of dendritic branches and dendritic length was decreased in late stage of SCI. Western blot and transmission electron microscopy analyses also showed a decrease in synaptic communication. In addition, a battery of behavioral tests in these animals revealed hippocampal based cognitive dysfunction, which could be attributed to changes in the dendritic complexity of hippocampal neurons. Taken together, these results suggested that mitochondrial abnormalities in hippocampal neurons induced the dendritic complexity reduction and cognitive decline following SCI. Our study highlights the neuroanatomical basis and importance of mitochondria in brain degeneration following SCI, which might contribute to propose new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Jiawei Tongqiao Huoxue decoction (JTHD), composed of Acorus calamus var. angustatus Besser, Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Conioselinum anthriscoides 'Chuanxiong', Prunus persica (L.) Batsch, Ziziphus jujuba Mill., Carthamus tinctorius L., Pueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.) Maesen & S.M.Almeida ex Sanjappa & Predeep, Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Leiurus quinquestriatus, and Moschus berezovskii Flerov, was developed based on Tongqiao Huoxue decoction in Wang Qingren's "Yilin Gaicuo" in the Qing Dynasty. It has the effect of improving not only the blood flow velocity of vertebral and basilar arteries but also the blood flow parameters and wall shear stress. Especially in recent years, the potential efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of basilar artery dolichoectasia (BAD) has attracted great attention as there are still no specific remedies for this disease. However, its molecular mechanism has not been elucidated. To identify the potential mechanisms of JTHD will help to intervene BAD and provide a reference for its clinical application. Aim of the study: This study aims to establish a mouse model of BAD and explore the mechanism of JTHD regulating yes-associated protein/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ) pathway for attenuating BAD mice development. Materials and methods: Sixty post-modeling C57/BL6 female mice were randomly divided into sham-operated, model, atorvastatin calcium tablet, low-dose JTHD, and high-dose JTHD groups. After 14 days of modeling, the pharmacological intervention was given for 2 months. Then, JTHD was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). ELISA was utilized to detect the changes in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and lipoprotein a (Lp-a) in serum. EVG staining was conducted to observe the pathological changes of blood vessels. TUNEL method was employed to detect the apoptosis rate of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Micro-CT and ImagePro Plus software were used to observe and calculate the tortuosity index, lengthening index, percentage increase in vessel diameter, and tortuosity of the basilar artery vessels in mice.

AB  - To date, few effective treatments have been licensed for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which a kind of chronic liver disease. Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) is reported to be involved in the development of NAFLD. Thus, we evaluated the suitability of a redox-unlockable polymeric nanopartide Hep@PGEA vector to deliver MST1 or siMSTI (HCP/MST1 or HCP/siMST1) for NAFLD therapy. The Hep@PGEA vector can efficiently deliver the condensed functional nucleic acids MST1 or siMST1 into NAFLD-affected mouse liver to upregulate or downregulate MST1 expression. The HCP/MST1 complexes significantly improved liver insulin resistance sensitivity and reduced liver damage and lipid accumulation by the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway without significant adverse events. Instead, HCP/siMST1 delivery exacerbates the NAFLD. The analysis of NAFLD patient samples further clarified the role of MST1 in the development of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD. The MST1-based gene intervention is of considerable potential for clinical NAFLD therapy, and the Hep@PGEA vector provides a promising option for NAFLD gene therapy.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zibu Piyin Recipe (ZBPYR) is a traditional Chinese medicine compound composed of 12 kinds of Chinese herbal medicines including red ginseng and yam. Long-term basic and clinical applications have proved that ZBPYR can prevent and treat cognitive dysfunction. Previous studies showed that chronic psychological stress can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and lead to cognitive decline. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in chronic psychological stress-induced diabetes mellitus. While the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD) is unclear. Aim of the study: Our previous research found that a ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR) has significant pharmacological effects against DACD. The present study investigated changes in mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain and the mechanism of insulin resistance and mitochondrial damage to explore the relationship between neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in chronic psychologically stressed DACD rats. Materials and methods: Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats with spontaneous T2DM and rats with diabetic cognitive impairment that was induced by chronic psychological stress were used in in vivo experiments. PC12 cells that were damaged by rotenone were used for the in vitro experiment. Results: The findings indicated that the number of mitochondria decreased, morphology and membrane potential were damaged, and reactive oxygen species increased in the cortex and hippocampus in psychologically stressed DACD rats. Protein kinase C beta 2 (PKC beta 2) activation and insulin resistance were markedly induced by chronic psychological stress, together with decreases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) and mitochondrial fusion protein 2 (Mfn2). Furthermore, ZBPYR exerted protective effects both in in vivo and in vitro. Conclusion: Mitochondrial damage and insulin resistance were observed in the brain in chronic psychologically stressed DACD rats. The ZBPYR significantly improved brain mitochondrial damage and insulin resistance in chronic psychologically stressed DACD rats. These results provide novel insights for the development of ZBPYR as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of chronic psychological stress and DACD.

AB  - Executive functions, learning, attention, and processing speed are imperative facets of cognitive performance, affected in neuropsychiatric disorders. In clinical studies on different patient groups, recombinant human (rh) erythropoietin (EPO) lastingly improved higher cognition and reduced brain matter loss. Correspondingly, rhEPO treatment of young rodents or EPO receptor (EPOR) overexpression in pyramidal neurons caused remarkable and enduring cognitive improvement, together with enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation. The 'brain hardware upgrade', underlying these observations, includes an EPO induced similar to 20% increase in pyramidal neurons and oligodendrocytes in cornu ammonis hippocampi in the absence of elevated DNA synthesis. In parallel, EPO reduces microglia numbers and dampens their activity and metabolism as prerequisites for undisturbed EPO-driven differentiation of pre-existing local neuronal precursors. These processes depend on neuronal and microglial EPOR. This novel mechanism of powerful postnatal neurogenesis, outside the classical neurogenic niches, and on-demand delivery of new cells, paralleled by dendritic spine increase, let us hypothesize a physiological procognitive role of hypoxia-induced endogenous EPO in brain, which we imitate by rhEPO treatment. Here we delineate the brain EPO circle as working model explaining adaptive 'brain hardware upgrade' and improved performance. In this fundamental regulatory circle, neuronal networks, challenged by motor-cognitive tasks, drift into transient 'functional hypoxia', thereby triggering neuronal EPO/EPOR expression.

AB  - Although 3D cell culture models are considered to reflect the physiological microenvironment and exhibit high concordance with in vivo conditions, one disadvantage has been that cell proliferation is slower in 3D culture as compared to 2D culture. However, the signaling differences that lead to this slower proliferation are unclear. Here, we conducted a cell-based high-throughput screening study and identified novel small molecules that promote cell proliferation, particularly under 3D conditions. We found that one of these molecules, designated GA-017, increases the number and size of spheroids of various cell-types in both scaffold-based and scaffoldindependent cultures. In addition, GA-017 also enhances the ex vivo formation of mouse intestinal organoids. Importantly, we demonstrate that GA-017 inhibits the serine/threonine protein kinases large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2, which phosphorylate Yes-associated protein and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif , key effectors of the growth- and proliferation-regulating Hippo signaling pathway. We showed that GA-017 facilitates the growth of spheroids and organoids by stabilizing and translocating Yes-associated protein and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif into the cell nucleus. Another chemical analog of GA-017 obtained in this screening also exhibited similar activities and functions. We conclude that experiments with these small molecule large tumor suppressor kinase inhibitors will contribute to further development of efficient 3D culture systems for the ex vivo expansion of spheroids and organoids.

Endoscopic sinus surgery can be effective in improving symptoms, although surgical outcomes can be compromised post-operatively, and revision surgery is required in a proportion of patients. This study compares outcomes and healthcare resource use in patients undergoing sinus surgery with or without Chitogel as a post-operative dressing.Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using deidentified audit data from adult patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis, who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery between January 2016 and December 2021. Patients in the intervention group received Chitogel as a post-operative dressing, and control patients received standard best-practice care. Cox Proportional Hazards survival analysis was used to compare revision surgery rates and time to revision between treatment groups. The rate of revision surgery was used to estimate potential health sector savings associated with use of Chitogel following surgery compared to the control arm, considering initial treatment costs and the cost of revision surgery.Results Over 18-24 months, patients treated with Chitogel demonstrated significantly lower rates of revision surgery (p = 0.035), and a trend towards decreased use of post-operative steroids, compared to control. Potential health sector savings due to reduced rates of revision surgery following use of Chitogel are estimated as NZ $753,000 per 100 patients.Conclusion Severe chronic rhinosinusitis patients treated with Chitogel had lower rates of revision surgery within the first 18-24 months post-operative. These findings suggest that use of Chitogel can improve long-term patient outcomes and should improve health system efficiency.

AB  - Herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) in saliva enable plants to detect herbivores and activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Piercing-sucking herbivores secrete gel saliva, forming salivary sheaths that assist in feeding, however, the role of proteins within these sheaths in modulation of plant defenses remains poorly understood. Here, a thermostable HAMP, myosin light chain 1-like (myosin) is identified, from the salivary sheath of the small brown planthopper (SBPH) Laodelphax striatellus. Myosin is a widely conserved arthropod protein, and acts as an elicitor of BAK1-dependent PTI responses in several plant species. Plants are able to specifically recognize the myosin 41-amino-acid peptide (MP41), which acts as a minimal immunogenic epitope. Furthermore, myosin and MP41 stimulate jasmonic acid and H2O2 production in rice. The resulting defenses not only diminish planthopper performance directly but also induce volatile emissions, attracting a common parasitoid. Additionally, expression of myosin in rice increased plant resistance to a chewing insect as well as to viral and fungal pathogens. However, silencing myosin in SBPH resulted in disruption of salivary sheath formation, reducing insect feeding efficiency. This study demonstrates that myosin from the SBPH salivary sheath serves as a critical and unavoidable HAMP, triggering broad-spectrum plant resistance to various insects and pathogens.

AB  - Major depression disorder is one of the most common psychiatric diseases. Recent evidence supports that environmental stress affects gene expression and promotes the pathological process of depression through epigenetic mechanisms. Three ten-eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes are epigenetic regulators of gene expression that promote 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modification of genes. Here, we show that the loss of Tet2 can induce depression-like phenotypes in mice. Paradoxically, using the paradigms of chronic stress, such as chronic mild stress and chronic social defeat stress, we found that depressive behaviors were associated with increased Tet2 expression but decreased global 5hmC level in hippocampus. We examined the genome-wide 5hmC profile in the hippocampus of Tet2 knockout mice and identified 651 dynamically hydroxymethylated regions, some of which overlapped with known depression-associated loci. We further showed that chronic stress could induce the abnormal nuclear translocation of Tet2 protein from cytosol. Through Tet2 immunoprecipitation and mass spectrum analyses, we identified a cellular trafficking protein, Abelson helper integration site-1 (Ahi1), which could interact with Tet2 protein. Ahi1 knockout or knockdown caused the accumulation of Tet2 in cytosol. The reduction of Ahi1 protein under chronic stress explained the abnormal Ahi1-dependent nuclear translocation of Tet2. These findings together provide the evidence for a critical role of modulating Tet2 nuclear translocation in regulating stress response.

AB  - Simple Summary: Zinc oxide remains a widely used compound for the control and prevention of post-weaning Escherichia coli (E. coli) diarrhoea in piglets. It is sometimes administered concomitantly with oral E. coli vaccines. In this research, we assessed the influence of the administration of zinc oxide in piglet feed in combination with a bivalent vaccine against E. coli. We studied the immune activation, intestinal integrity, production of secretory IgA, and excretion of E. coli via faecal samples at different times post-vaccination. Although the main difference observed was the excretion of the E. coli vaccine strain, the immune response determined in both vaccine groups was similar, irrespective of the presence of ZnO in the feed.
   Background: Although zinc oxide has been banned at therapeutic doses in the EU, its use is still legal in most countries with industrial pig farming. This compound has been shown to be very effective in preventing E. coli-related diseases. However, another strategy used to control this pathogen is vaccination, administered parenterally or orally. Oral vaccines contain live strains, with F4 and F18 binding factors. Since zinc oxide prevents E. coli adhesion, it is hypothesised that its presence at therapeutic doses (2500 ppm) may alter the immune response and the protection of intestinal integrity derived from the vaccination of animals. Methods: A group of piglets were orally vaccinated at weaning and divided into two subgroups; one group was fed a feed containing 2500 ppm zinc oxide (V + ZnO) for the first 15 days post-vaccination (dpv) and the other was not (V). Faeces were sampled from the animals at 6, 8, 11, 13, and 15 dpv. Unvaccinated animals without ZnO in their feed (Neg) were sampled simultaneously and, on day 15 post-vaccination, were also compared with a group of unvaccinated animals with ZnO in their feed (ZnO). Results: Differences were found in E. coli excretion, with less quantification in the V + ZnO group, and a significant increase in secretory IgA in the V group at 8 dpv, which later equalised with that of the V + ZnO group. There was also some difference in IFN alpha, IFN gamma, IL1 alpha, IL beta, and TNF alpha gene expression when comparing both vaccinated groups (p < 0.05). However, there was no difference in gene expression for the tight junction (TJ) proteins responsible for intestinal integrity. Conclusions: Although some differences in the excretion of the vaccine strain were found when comparing both vaccinated groups, there are no remarkable differences in immune stimulation or soluble IgA production when comparing animals orally vaccinated against E. coli in combination with the presence or absence of ZnO in their feed. We can conclude that the immune response produced is very similar in both groups.

AB  - The branching angle of tea plants is a key factor in determining their branching structure, which significantly affects yield, suitability for mechanical harvesting, and overall plant architecture. However, the mechanisms underlying branching angle formation in tea plants remain unclear. In this study, we explored the mechanism of branching angle formation in tea plants by analysing the transcriptome and plant hormone levels of tea plant cultivars with different branching angles. The results indicated that gibberellin positively regulates the branching angle of tea plants, cytokinins, auxin, and abscisic acid involved in the formation of branching angles in tea plants. The transcriptome analysis revealed that candidate regulatory factors, including plant-hormone-related genes (the gibberellin synthesis gene GA3ox1 and metabolism gene GA2ox1; the cytokinin metabolism genes CKX and UGT; the auxin signal transduction-related gene LAX3; and the abscisic acid signal transduction gene PYL4), genes regulating cell division and growth (LAZY1, TAC1, and MAX1), and transcription factors (MYBs, WRKYs, TCPs, AP2/ERFs, and MADS-box), are involved in the formation of branching angles in tea plants. These results offer insights into the mechanism of branching angle formation in tea plants, providing important theoretical reference for the selection and breeding of tea cultivars suitable for mechanical harvesting, thereby improving agricultural efficiency and sustainability.

AB  - The timing of centrosome separation and the distance moved apart influence the formation of the bipolar spindle, affecting chromosome stability. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling induces early centrosome separation through downstream G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK2, which phosphorylates the Hippo pathway component MST2 (Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 2), in turn allowing NIMA kinase Nek2A activation for centrosomal linker disassembly. However, the mechanisms that counterbalance centrosome disjunction and separation remain poorly understood. We unveil that timely degradation of GRK2 by the E3 ligase Mdm2 limits centrosome separation in the G2. Both knockout expression and catalytic inhibition of Mdm2 result in GRK2 accumulation and enhanced centrosome separation before mitosis onset. Phosphorylation of GRK2 on residue S670 enables a complex pattern of non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains assembled by Mdm2, which correlate with kinase protein degradation. Remarkably, GRK2-S670A protein fails to phosphorylate MST2 despite overcoming Mdm2-dependent degradation, which results in defective centrosome separation, shorter spindles, and abnormal chromosome congression. Conversely, extra levels of wild-type kinase in the G2 cause increased inter-centrosome distances with longer spindles, also converging in congression issues. Our findings show that the signals enabling activity of the GRK2/MST2/Nek2A axis for separation also switches on Mdm2 degradation of GRK2 to ensure accurate centrosome dynamics and proper mitotic spindle functionality.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological disorder primarily affecting older adults. A hallmark of this condition is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to increased oxidative stress and cellular damage. Treatment with a curcumin-selenium nanoemulsion has been shown to enhance behavioural performance and mitigate degenerative changes induced by aluminium chloride (AlCl3). This nanoemulsion also reduced the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and lowered levels of key proteins, including A beta, p53, tau, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Additionally, it significantly decreased nitric oxide (NO) levels in the brain while enhancing the activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The study highlights the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the curcumin-selenium nanoemulsion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic option for alleviating AD induced by AlCl3. These results are further supported by improvements in the histological structure of the cortex and hippocampus, as well as enhanced immunohistochmical assessment of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Cur- Se-nanoemulsion, the current drug delivery technology, may lower the amount of amyloid-beta in AD rat brain and considerably ameliorate the memory deficit that improve therapy efficacy in AD lesions.

AB  - Background Possible modulatory effects of noninvasive brain stimulation have gained interest recently. In our study, the effect of low frequency electric fields (LF-EF) on stress-induced electrophysiological, behavioral changes and the possible involvement of serotonergic 5-HT2C receptors were investigated. Materials and methods A total of eight groups including the control groups were formed by applying LF-EF with or without a 5-HT2C receptor agonist to naive or acute stress exposed rats to demonstrate the effects of LF-EF. LF-EF administration at 10 kV/m was started 30 min before acute stress application and lasted for 1 h in total. Anxiety levels and social interaction were evaluated using the elevated plus maze test and social interaction test, respectively. Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) were recorded by using ascending loudness paradigms. Loudness dependence AEP (LDAEP) was calculated by using amplitude values to analyze serotonergic transmission. Serotonin and glucocorticoid levels were measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Results It was observed that the applied LF-EF reduced the anxiety behavior, and attenuated the LDAEP responses in stress and/or 5-HT2C receptor agonist applied groups. In parallel, an increase in serotonin levels and a decrease in glucocorticoid levels were observed. However, LF-EF exposure was ineffective in impaired social interaction. Conclusions Our findings show that 10 kV/m LF-EF administration may modulate the neural network and physiological responses associated with mild acute stress. 5-HT2C receptor dependent functions are thought to play a role in the anxiolytic effect of LF-EF.

AB  - Social behavior is a basic domain affected by several neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD and a heterogeneous set of neuropsychiatric disorders. The SCRIB gene that codes for the polarity protein SCRIBBLE has been identified as a risk gene for spina bifida, the most common type of neural tube defect, found at high frequencies in autistic patients, as well as other congenital anomalies. The deletions and mutations of the 8q24.3 region encompassing SCRIB are also associated with multisyndromic and rare disorders. Nonetheless, the potential link between SCRIB and relevant social phenotypes has not been fully investigated. Hence, we show that Scrib(crc/+) mice, carrying a mutated version of Scrib, displayed reduced social motivation behavior and social habituation, while other behavioral domains were unaltered. Social deficits were associated with the upregulation of ERK phosphorylation, together with increased c-Fos activity. Importantly, the social alterations were rescued by both direct and indirect pERK inhibition. These results support a link between polarity genes, social behaviors and hippocampal functionality and suggest a role for SCRIB in the etiopathology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, our data demonstrate the crucial role of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in underlying social motivation behavior, thus supporting its relevance as a therapeutic target.

AB  - Chronic liver injury follows inflammation and liver fibrosis; however, the molecular mechanism underlying fibrosis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the role of ductal WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) was investigated after liver injury. Ductal TAZ-knockout (DKO) mice showed decreased liver fibrosis following a Diethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate (DDC) diet compared to wild-type (WT) mice, as evidenced by decreased expression levels of fibrosis inducers, including connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf)/cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2), cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61/CCN1), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgfb1), in DKO mice. Similarly, TAZ-knockout (KO) cholangiocyte organoids showed decreased expression of fibrosis inducers. Additionally, the culture supernatant of TAZ-KO cholangiocyte organoids decreased the fibrogenic gene expression in liver stellate cells. Further studies revealed that prominin 1 (PROM1/CD133) stimulated TAZ for fibrosis. After the administration of DDC diet, fibrosis was decreased in CD133-KO (CD133-KO) mice compared to that in WT mice. Similarly, CD133-KO cholangiocyte organoids showed decreased Ctgf, Cyr61, and Tgfb1 expression levels compared to WT cholangiocyte organoids. Mechanistically, CD133 stabilized TAZ via Src activation. Inhibition of Src decreased TAZ levels. Similarly, CD133-knockdown HCT116 cells showed decreased TAZ levels, but reintroduction of active Src recovered the TAZ levels. Taken together, our results suggest that TAZ facilitates liver fibrosis after a DDC diet via the CD133-Src-TAZ axis.

AB  - BackgroundEpilepsy is a neurological disease characterized by recurrent seizures, hyperexcitable neurons and various behavioral comorbidities. The electrical charge during seizures depletes the antioxidant defense mechanism in the epileptic brain and increases the oxidative burden. Natural antioxidant compounds are potential therapeutics in the treatment of two major pathologies of epilepsy with their anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects and can modulate these targets. Gum Arabic is one of the natural plant polysaccharides that is non-toxic and biodegradable. Methods and resultsA total of 30 Wistar albino male rats (8-12 weeks, 350-500 g), were randomly divided into 5 groups with 6 animals in each group: 1-Control, 2-Sham (Phosphate buffer saline (PBS)), 3-PTZ, 4-Gum Arabic, 5-PTZ + Gum Arabic. PTZ was administered i.p at 35 mg/kg/day for 11 days. After 48 h, the injection was completed with 75 mg/kg PTZ. Locomotor activity, immobilization, rearing, grooming, eating, and drinking behaviors were recorded with the LABORAS behavior system for 30 min after kindling. Animals were treated with Gum Arabic (2 mg/kg/day, oral gavage) for 10 days. At the end of the period, animal behavior was recorded again. Then the hippocampus tissues were removed. Oxidative parameters (TAS and TOS), early growth response 1 (EGR1) and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (Rev-erb alpha) gene expressions and behaviors were analyzed. ConclusionGum Arabic increased TAS levels (P = 0.000), decreased TOS levels (P = 0.000), and thus exhibited antioxidant properties by reducing oxidative stress burden. EGR1, which was upregulated in the seizure group, was downregulated after treatment (P = 0.000), and Rev-erb alpha was downregulated in seizure and upregulated after treatment (P = 0.000). Gum arabic may be an antiepileptic and anxiolytic therapeutic in improving epileptic seizures by reducing oxidative stress burden through EGR1 and Rev-erb alpha.0

AB  - Mitochondrial respiratory complexes are organized into supercomplexes (SC) to regulate electron flow and mitigate oxidative stress. Alterations in SC organization in the brain may affect energy expenditure, oxidative stress, and neuronal survival. In this report, we investigated the amount, activity and organization of mitochondrial complex I (CI) in the hippocampus of 12-month-old McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rats, an animal model of Alzheimer's-like cerebral amyloidosis. By means of BN-PAGE, we found that the organization of SC did not differ between genotypes, but a lower abundance of SC was detected in Tg compared to wild-type (WT) rats. Using a more sensitive technique (2-D electrophoresis followed by Western blot), higher levels of free CI and a decrease in the relative abundance of assembled CI in SC (I-III2 and I-III2-IV) were observed in Tg rats. In-gel activity assays showed that the total activity of CI (CI + SC-CI) is lower in Tg compared to WT, while Tg samples show a significant decrease in SC-CI-associated activity. This alteration in CI assembly was associated with nitro-oxidative stress and changes in mitochondrial fusion-fission parameters. To assess CI composition, we applied LC-MS/MS to the isolated CI from BN-PAGE and found that 11 of 45 subunits described in mammals were found to be less abundant in Tg. We examined the levels of the nuclear-derived NDUFA9 subunit, which is critical for CI assembly, and found higher levels in the cytoplasmic fraction and lower levels in the mitochondrial fraction in Tg, suggesting that brain amyloidosis affects the import of CI subunits from the cytosol to the mitochondria, destabilizing the SC. This is the first report to characterize the types, abundance and activity of SC in the hippocampus of an animal model of cerebral amyloidosis, providing additional experimental evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying the brain bioenergetic deficit characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.image

AB  - The axon initial segment (AIS) has characteristically dense clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav), cell adhesion molecule Neurofascin 186 (Nfasc), and neuronal scaffold protein Ankyrin-G (AnkG) in neurons, which facilitates gen-eration of an action potential and maintenance of axonal polarity. However, the mechanisms underlying AIS assembly, maintenance, and plasticity remain poorly understood. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the AnkG ankyrin repeat (ANK repeat) domain in complex with its binding site in the Nfasc cytoplasmic tail that shows, in conjunction with binding affinity assays with serial truncation variants, the molecular basis of AnkG-Nfasc binding. We confirm AnkG interacts with the FIGQY motif in Nfasc, and we identify another region required for their high affinity binding. Our structural analysis revealed that ANK repeats form 4 hy-drophobic or hydrophilic layers in the AnkG inner groove that coordinate interactions with essential Nfasc residues, including F1202, E1204, and Y1212. Moreover, we show disruption of the AnkG-Nfasc complex abolishes Nfasc enrichment at the AIS in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Finally, our structural and biochemical analysis indicated that L1 syndrome -associated mutations in L1CAM, a member of the L1 immu-noglobulin family proteins including Nfasc, L1CAM, NrCAM, and CHL1, compromise binding with ankyrins. Taken together, these results define the mechanisms underlying AnkG-Nfasc complex formation and show that AnkG-dependent clus-tering of Nfasc is required for AIS integrity.

AB  - Background Cathepsin S (CTSS) is a cysteine protease that played diverse roles in immunity, tumor metastasis, aging and other pathological alterations. At the cellular level, increased CTSS levels have been associated with the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and disrupted the homeostasis of Ca2+ flux. Once CTSS was suppressed, elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and changes of Ca2+ influx were observed. These findings have inspired us to explore the potential role of CTSS on cognitive functions.Methods We conducted classic Y-maze and Barnes Maze tests to assess the spatial and working memory of Ctss -/- mice, Ctss +/+ mice and Ctss +/+ mice injected with the CTSS inhibitor (RJW-58). Ex vivo analyses including long-term potentiation (LTP), Golgi staining, immunofluorescence staining of sectioned whole brain tissues obtained from experimental animals were conducted. Furthermore, molecular studies were carried out using cultured HT-22 cell line and primary cortical neurons that treated with RJW-58 to comprehensively assess the gene and protein expressions.Results Our findings reported that targeting cathepsin S (CTSS) yields improvements in cognitive function, enhancing both working and spatial memory in behavior models. Ex vivo studies showed elevated levels of long-term potentiation levels and increased synaptic complexity. Microarray analysis demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was upregulated when CTSS was knocked down by using siRNA. Moreover, the pharmacological blockade of the CTSS enzymatic activity promoted BDNF expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Notably, the inhibition of CTSS was associated with increased neurogenesis in the murine dentate gyrus. These results suggested a promising role of CTSS modulation in cognitive enhancement and neurogenesis.Conclusion Our findings suggest a critical role of CTSS in the regulation of cognitive function by modulating the Ca2+ influx, leading to enhanced activation of the BDNF/TrkB axis. Our study may provide a novel strategy for improving cognitive function by targeting CTSS.

AB  - Proteins involved in neurodegeneration can be coupled with optogenetic reagents to create rapid and sensitive reporters to provide insight into the biochemical processes that mediate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We have recently developed a novel optically-responsive tool (the 'CofActor' system) that couples cofilin and actin (key players in early stage cytoskeletal abnormalities associated with neurodegenerative disorders) with light-gated optogenetic proteins to provide spatial and temporal resolution of oxidative and energetic stress-dependent biochemical events. In contrast to currently available small-molecule based biosensors for monitoring changes in the redox environment of the cell, CofActor is a light-activated, genetically encoded redox sensor that can be activated with precise spatial and temporal control. Here we describe a protocol for the expression and activation of the CofActor system in dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures prepared from newborn mice. Cultures were transfected with Lipofectamine on the fifth day in vitro (DIV5), then exposed to cellular stress inducing stimuli, leading to the formation of actin-cofilin rods that can be observed using live cell imaging techniques. The protocol described here allows for studies of stress-related cytoskeletal dysregulation in live neurons exposed to neurodegenerative stimuli, such as toxic A beta 42 oligomers. Moreover, expression of the sensor in neurons isolated from transgenic mouse models of AD and/or mice KO for proteins involved in AD can advance our understanding of the molecular basis of early cytoskeletal dysfunctions associated with neurodegeneration.

AB  - Cholinergic neuronal networks in the hippocampus play a key role in the regulation of learning and memory in mammals. Perturbations of these networks, in turn, underlie neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms remain largely undefined. We have recently demonstrated that an in vitro MEN1 gene deletion perturbs nicotinic cholinergic plasticity at the hippocampal glutamatergic synapses. Furthermore, MEN1 neuronal conditional knockout in freely behaving animals has also been shown to result in learning and memory deficits, though the evidence remains equivocal. In this study, using an AVV viral vector transcription approach, we provide direct evidence that MEN1 gene deletion in the CA1 region of the hippocampus indeed leads to contextual fear conditioning deficits in conditional knockout animals. This loss of function was, however, recovered when the same animals were re-injected to overexpress MEN1. This study provides the first direct evidence for the sufficiency and necessity of MEN1 in fear conditioning, and further endorses the role of menin in the regulation of cholinergic synaptic machinery in the hippocampus. These data underscore the importance of further exploring and revisiting the cholinergic hypothesis that underlies neurodegenerative diseases that affect learning and memory.

AB  - Sevoflurane anesthesia is reported to repress neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs), thereby affecting the brain development, but the underlying mechanism of sevoflurane on the proliferation of NSCs remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to discern the relationship between sevoflurane and NSC proliferation. Bioinformatics tools were employed to predict the expression of microRNA-18a (miR-18a) in 9-day-old neonatal rat hippocampal tissues after sevoflurane treatment and the downstream genes of miR-18a, followed by a series of assays to explore the relationship among miR-18a, runt related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), and beta-catenin in the hippocampal tissues. NSCs were isolated from the hippocampal tissues and subjected to gain-/loss-of-function assays to investigate the interactions among miR-18a, RUNX1, and beta-catenin in NSCs and their roles in NSC development. Bioinformatics analysis and experimental results confirmed high expression of miR-18a in rat hippocampal tissues and NSCs after sevoflurane treatment. Next, we found that miR-18a downregulated RUNX1 expression, while RUNX1 promoted NSC proliferation by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The behavioral experiments also showed that sevoflurane caused nerve injury in rats, whilst RUNX1 overexpression protected rat neurodevelopment. Our findings uncovered that sevoflurane attenuated NSC proliferation via the miR-18a-meidated RUNX1/Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, thereby impairing rat neurodevelopment.

AB  - Iron overload is implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction. Some iron and mitochondria-related measures show sex differences. It is unclear whether mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) from blood associated with iron depositions in the brain or liver and whether the relationship differs by sex. In this population-based study, we find that among community-dwelling adults, lower mtDNAcn assessed in blood is associated with higher brain iron in basal ganglia and hippocampus and more liver fat, and not with brain volumes or liver iron. Interestingly, the association between mtDNAcn and brain iron in basal ganglia is prominent in men. Our observations lead to the hypothesis that mechanisms connecting mitochondrial dysfunction and iron overload may differ between brain and liver and differ by sex.

AB  - Glioma is a brain tumor that originates from brain or spine glial cells. Despite alternative treatments, the overall survival rate remains low. Oridonin (ORI) is purified from the Chinese herb Rabdosia rubescens, which has exhibited positive effects on tumors. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ORI on U87MG glioblastoma cells and whether the Hippo/YAP-related signaling pathway was involved. Malignant glioblastoma U87MG cells and male athymic nude mice (BALB/cnu/nu) were used as the experimental models. The YAP inhibitor Verteporfin (VP) and the overexpression of YAP were used to investigate its potential relation with glioma. Here, we found that ORI inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in U87MG cells. Moreover, ORI inhibited Bcl-2, YAP, and c-Myc protein expression but increased Bax, caspase-3, and p-YAP protein expression. Furthermore, the effect of ORI was also confirmed in a mouse model bearing glioma. ORI reversed the effect of overexpression of YAP. Collectively, oridonin suppressed glioblastoma oncogenesis via the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway and could be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of glioblastoma.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Recently, several abnormally regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study was to identify abnormally expressed miRNAs and to investigate whether they affect pathological changes in AD in the 5xFAD AD mouse model.
   Experimental Approach: Using microarray analysis and RT-qPCR, miRNA expression in the hippocampus of a 4-month-old 5xFAD mouse model of AD was investigated. A dual-luciferase assay was performed to determine whether the altered miR-200c regulates the translation of the target mRNA, Ywhag. Whether miR-200c modulates AD pathology was determined in primary hippocampal neurons and C57BL/6J mice transfected with miR-200c inhibitor. In addition, total miRNAs were extracted from the serums of 28 healthy age-matched controls and 22 individual participants with cognitive impairment, and RT-qPCR was performed.
   Key results: miR-200c expression was reduced in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. In primary hippocampal neurons, miR-200c regulated the translation of 14-3-3 gamma and increased tau phosphorylation (p-tau) by increasing p-GSK-3 beta (GSK-3 beta phosphorylation). It was also confirmed that miR-200c inhibition in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice induces cognitive impairment and increases tau phosphorylation through 14-3-3 gamma activation. Finally, aberrant expression of miR-200c was confirmed in the blood serum of human AD patients.
   Conclusion and Implications: Our results strongly suggest that dysregulation of miR-200c expression contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, including cognitive impairment through hyperphosphorylated tau.

AB  - BackgroundChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a global health issue, with some patients experiencing anxiety and depression-like symptoms. This study investigates the role of HMGB1 in anxiety and depression-like behaviors associated with the microglial Notch1/Hes-1 pathway in CRS mice.MethodsA CRS mouse model was developed, and behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate anxiety and depression-like behaviors. Techniques including 18F-FDG PET, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence were used to assess hippocampal metabolic activity in CRS mice. Western Blot and RT-qPCR were employed to measure HMGB1 and Notch1/Hes-1 expression in the hippocampus, while ELISA determined inflammatory cytokine levels. The study also examined the effects of metformin on these behaviors and its mechanisms.ResultsCRS mice exhibited increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors, accompanied by enhanced hippocampal metabolic activity. HMGB1-siRNA treatment reduced these behaviors. Hippocampal glucose metabolism was markedly higher in CRS mice than in controls. Nissl staining revealed hippocampal neuron damage, and immunofluorescence indicated microglial activation in CRS mice. Reducing HMGB1 expression inhibited Notch1/Hes-1 pathway activation. In microglia, HMGB1 knockdown suppressed the Notch1/Hes-1 pathway, reducing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Metformin improved neuropsychiatric symptoms in CRS mice by inhibiting the Notch1/Hes-1 pathway after HMGB1 downregulation.ConclusionHMGB1 activates the microglial Notch1/Hes-1 pathway in CRS mice, promoting neuroinflammation and anxiety and depression-like behaviors. Metformin alleviates these effects.

AB  - Cancer is a complex disease extremely dependent on its microenvironment and is highly regulated by a variety of stimuli inside and outside the cell. Evidence suggests that active camel whey fraction (TR35) confer anti-tumor effects in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its exact mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying suppression of NSCLC cell growth and proliferation by TR35. Treatment of A549 and H1299 cells with TR35 suppressed their growth and enhanced apoptosis, as revealed by CCK-8, colony formation and flow cytometric analyses. We find that TR35 suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft nude mouse model without losses in body weight. RNA-seq and KEGG pathway analyses showed that the DEGs were enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Jak-STAT signaling pathways. After test the key factors' activity associated with these pathways by Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and western blotting, the activation of JNK phosphorylation and inhibition of p38 and STAT3 phosphorylation was observed both in TR35 treated lung cancer cell and tumor tissue. Taken together, these results showed that TR35 play a significant role in the NSCLC progression in the tumor microenvironment via MAPK and Jak-STAT signaling, highlighting TR35 as a potential therapeutic agent against lung cancer.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is one of the most widely consumed non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. In the present study, 73 commercial tea samples were collected from tea plantations in the Southwest, South, Jiangnan, and Jiangbei regions of China. The contents of four macroelements (phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg)) and 15 trace metals (arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), aluminium (Al), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), thorium (Th), thallium (Tl), rubidium (Rb) and barium (Ba)) in tea samples were determined. The mean concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Zn, Al, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Th, Tl, Rb and Ba were in the range of 0.02-0.61, 0.008-0.126, 0.09-1.12, 0.001-0.012, 0.07-1.62, 19.5-73.2, 170-2100, 5.9-43.3, 228-2040, 60-337, 2.09-17.95, 0.002-0.08, 0.004-0.409, 0-150.50 and 3.1-41.2 mu g/g, respectively, which were all lower than the maximum permissible limits stipulated by China (NY/T 288-2012, NY 659-2003). The target hazard quotients of each heavy metal were lower than one, and the combined risk hazard index of all heavy metals for adults was in the range of 0.10-0.85; therefore, there was no significant carcinogenic health risks to tea drinking consumers under the current dietary intake. Significant differences were found in the content of trace elements (Zn, Cu, Fe, Ni, Th, Tl, Rb and Ba) (p < 0.05); however, no significant differences were found in the content of macroelements (P, K, Ca and Mg) and trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Al and Mn) in teas from different regions. Therefore, the region did not affect the heavy metal exposure risk. Correlation coefficient and principal component analyses were performed to determine the source of the elements. Three principal factors were obtained: factor 1 was positively related to Ca, Mg, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Al, Mn, Fe and Th (32.63%); factor 2 to P, Zn, Cu and Ni (18.64%) and factor 3 to K and Rb (10.10%). Thus, the elements in the same factor might originate from the same source.

AB  - Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) is a transcription factor that is involved in neuronal regeneration and the development of glutamatergic systems. However, it is unknown whether Klf4 is involved in acute seizure. To investigate the potential role of Klf4 in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure, western blotting, immunofluorescence, behaviour test and electrophysiology were conducted in this study. We found that Klf4 protein and mRNA expression were increased in both the hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) after PTZ-induced seizure in mice. HP-specific knockout (KO) of Klf4 in mice decreased protein expression of Klf4 and the down-stream Klf4 target tumour protein 53 (TP53/P53). These molecular changes are accompanied by increased seizure latency, reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test. Reduced hippocampal protein levels for synaptic proteins, including glutamate receptor 1 (GRIA1/GLUA1) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (DLG4/PSD95), were also observed after Klf4-KO, while increased mRNA levels of complement proteins were observed for complement component 1q subcomponent A (C1qa), complement component 1q subcomponent B (C1qb), complement component 1q subcomponent C (C1qc), complement component 3 (C3), complement component 4A (C4a) and complement component 4B (C4b). Moreover, c-Fos expression induced by PTZ was reduced by hippocampal conditional KO of Klf4. Electrophysiology showed that PTZ-induced action potential frequency was decreased by overexpression of Klf4. In conclusion, these findings suggest that Klf4 plays an important role in regulating PTZ-induced seizures and therefore constitutes a new molecular target that should be explored for the development of antiepileptic drugs.
